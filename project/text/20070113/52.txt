pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink the malts of america vodka is easy whiskey is hard barely a week goes by without a new brand of vodka vying for shelf space get a distilling license and you can have a marketable vodka usually purchased from an industrial contract distillery in weeks many of the new microdistillers popping up around the country are bottling vodka to pay the rent but those eager to test their still skills are crafting whiskey in particular scotch style single malt whiskey given americas robust indigenous whiskey tradition why emulate scotch in part making whiskey from malted barley is a way for small distillers to carve out a niche separate from the predominantly corn whiskey made by the well established bourbon companies but there is also the challenge rather like josiah wedgwoods th century quest to re create the portland vase of trying to match the artistry of undisputed masters vodka is fast but whiskey takes time and as old ben once sagely observed time is money the biggest challenge for the small craft distillers tackling whiskey may not be in making a drinkable spirit but in finding the cash needed to keep it in barrels for the years it takes to mature "i remember sitting down with my wife and saying well spend &# or &# and after years we might start getting some of it back " says richard pelletier who owns the nashoba valley winery in bolton mass "at least the kids are young " he joked with his wife "so at the very least years from now we can have an open bar at their weddings " the first barrels of nashoba single malt whiskey were distilled in and are still aging mr pelletier keeps the oldest barrel in his living room where he can easily steal tastes and keep tabs on its progress nantucket spirits which has been sailing along with sales of its triple eight vodka also has a scotch style single malt in dunnage called "notch" for "not scotch" the whiskey was first distilled in and may finally get released later this year nantucket spirits financed its whiskey experiment by selling cask futures a cash flow technique that scottish start ups have been using as well new american single malt whiskeys are also in the works at oregons house spirits and ohios woodstone creek spirits one new distiller isnt willing to wait years to get his whiskey to market after an apprenticeship at scotlands bowmore distillery rick wasmund started the copper fox distillery in sperryville va a little over a year ago he believes hes found a strategy for maturing whiskey in a fraction of the time required by barrel aging and to prove it already has bottles of his wasmunds single malt whisky in stores in virginia illinois california and washington d c in an old warehouse along a small river nestled in the shadow of the blue ridge mountains mr wasmund malts his own barley and cooks ferments and distills it in wonderfully low tech artisanal fashion but thats where his fidelity to tradition ends to avoid the costly barrel aging wait mr wasmund employs an old trick used by home distillers and makers of bulk wine rather than just putting his whiskey in wood to mature he puts wood in his whiskey mr wasmund toasts hunks of oak and fruitwood bags them in burlap and leaves them in the raw young spirit to steep like a tea bag in mere months he has a reddish whiskey in the bottle which he sells at a premium price sacrilege perhaps but sometimes todays sacrilege proves to be the innovation that revolutionizes an industry alas not in the case of "chipped" whiskey when i tasted wasmunds blind along with traditionally aged american single malts and a couple of classic scotch whiskies the shortcuts in mr wasmunds method were all too apparent yes there was plenty of wood in the whiskey but that was the problem it tasted of wood rather than of the deeper flavors associated with barrel aging vanilla caramel toffee there was a lack of structure in the spirit that left wasmunds shallow and tinny the most important changes that age imparts to spirits come not from addition but from subtraction wood may impart certain flavors but it is the long term process of evaporation the "angels share" that escapes from porous casks over the years that encourages the harsher compounds in any distillate to escape its a shame that the copper fox distillery isnt in a position to age its whiskey more traditionally because the rest of mr wasmunds process reflects an admirable commitment to craft with the patience and financing to keep his whiskey in proper barrels he could yet produce a fine single malt the american single malts that stood out in my tasting were the two that pioneered the trend st george and mccarthys both whiskeys come from west coast distillers known for their artisanal fruit brandies and perhaps not surprisingly both have a fruity quality but there the similarities end stephen mccarthy owner of clear creek distillery in portland ore found himself rained out on an irish fishing trip years ago he worked his way through the lodges lengthy list of single malt scotches and was inspired to give the genre a go his favorites were bold peat bombs from the isle of islay lagavulin in particular and thats what he set out to emulate mr mccarthy bought heavily peated barley from lagavulins supplier islays port ellen maltings the result is a whiskey even smokier than the template but with a jammy sweetness too you could describe it as odd or interesting depending on whether you like it i would describe it as interesting and a worthy homage by contrast alameda calif s st george spirits made a decision to pursue its own style of single malt and went peat free to do so "every time we used peat smoked barley " says distiller lance winters "we found it tasted like somebodys scotch " instead they chose to add a unique flavor by using a portion of barley smoked over alder and beech woods after on average seven years in used bourbon barrels st george single malt is a subtle and light whiskey not unlike glenfiddich though much sweeter it makes for a lovely after dinner drink in time there may be a wide variety of good single malt whiskeys made in america following the lead of st george and mccarthys but time it will take email me at eric felten wsj com good very good st george single malt &# a light subtle and sweet whiskey with hints of sauternes style dessert wines mccarthys single malt &# a big fat peat bomb when the smoke clears a rich jammy sweetness is revealed ok wasmunds single malt whisky &# a carefully made raw spirit the strategy for speed aging this four month old whiskey results in a dram that is mighty woody but lacking in the deeper more complex flavors that give fine whiskeys their structure
