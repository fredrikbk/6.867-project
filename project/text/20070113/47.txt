politics &amp economics china to continue birth rate control beijing concluding a three year review of its controversial population policies china says it has no choice but to continue controlling birth rates despite increasing population imbalances the government acknowledged that its one child policy will produce a surge in the number of single men and elderly trends with worrisome implications for social stability and government finances but the nation cant support a population much larger than the current billion according to the review state controls on childbearing have "eased the pressure of population growth on the economy society resources and the environment " the national population and family planning commission said in a report published this past week although that "relationship is still strained and is bringing many serious challenges " the government wants to keep the birth rate low at the current average of children per woman the report says this will ensure the population will rise only slowly in coming years and peak at billion people after and then start declining chinas family planning policies were launched in in response to a wave of births that threatened to send population growth out of control now the government officially "encourages late marriage and childbearing and advocates one child per couple " the restriction on births is applied most strictly on women living in cities and less so elsewhere but local governments have leeway in implementing policy which has sometimes led to abuses when they try to meet their family planning targets the commissions report called for greater "innovation" in family planning and for the creation of a social security system for the elderly in rural areas so that couples dont feel they must have children to provide for them the population controls have brought their own set of unintended problems because the one child policy effectively means that each generation will be smaller than the one preceding it the elderly will have to be supported by a shrinking number of younger people that is becoming a challenge for a country trying to expand a rudimentary social welfare system another consequence has been the creation of a gender imbalance if a chinese couple can have only one child they usually prefer to have a boy as a result births have become heavily skewed to boys in there were boys born for every girls that means that by there will million more men than women in the to year age group the report says which is likely to bring greater "social disorder " this gender imbalance may push increasing numbers of chinese men to move to other countries in search of partners
