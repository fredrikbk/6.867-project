pursuits books romantic destiny with complications skylight confessions by alice hoffman little brown pages &# alice hoffman has been prominent on the american literary scene for three decades her first novel "property of " was published in when she was since then she has produced novels and two books of short stories establishing a solid reputation as one of americas most reliable if not necessarily most exciting writers of fiction reading "skylight confessions" is a vaguely disturbing experience all the familiar elements of an alice hoffman book are in place the generous mixture of supernatural elements with a naturalistic milieu ms hoffman calls it "yankee magic realism" the addition of fairy tale elements to the story the timeless setting without reference to topical events "skylight confessions " set on long island and in connecticut and new york city could take place any time between the s and the present day she has accustomed her fans to these ingredients almost to the point where readers can sink comfortably into each new story as though it were a predictable genre tale rather than a novel that might require serious engagement and thats really what "skylight confessions" is a genre story in this case the kind of book that might best be described as a romance novel for college graduates the book has enough intellectual trappings to flatter readers into thinking that they are getting some mental nourishment but in essence it is pure romance novel and nothing more the plot focuses on the star crossed marriage of arlyn singer and john moody as it turns out the two were destined for one another but the repressed john cannot accept this fate and pulls away becoming a distant indeed scarcely present husband and father arlyn dies young and john remarries but he is psychologically unable to let her go and her spirit or specter lives on in the house haunting john and poisoning his relationship with his new bride while the children live in an emotional isolation that their father is unable to assuage ms hoffman has cited "wuthering heights" as the book that has had the greatest influence on her and "skylight confessions" contains all the standard elements of brontean high romance including hyperbole predestined "true" love and a doomed heathcliffean character in this case john and arlyns son sam in the best romance novel tradition the ending is suffused with a sense of almost religious redemption and possibility those who crave a cozy read that affirms romantic fantasies about deathless love and knights to the rescue may well admire "skylight confessions " but those who feel that one of literatures tasks is to challenge such fantasies are likely to wonder at the gap between alice hoffmans high reputation and the thin literary skills on display in her latest work ms allens latest book is "moral minority our skeptical founding fathers "
