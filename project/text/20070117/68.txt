hugo and mahmoud weve known for some time that hugo chavez is a menace to the economic well being of his own people but the question that seems increasingly urgent is whether hes becoming a threat to u s security interests both in the western hemisphere and beyond specifically wed like to know what senator chris dodd and congressman bill delahunt make of mr chavezs weekend summit with mahmoud ahmadinejad the iranian president stopped by caracas on saturday as part of a four day engagement with latin americas new leftist governments on sunday the iranian communed with nicaraguas new boss daniel ortega and then on monday he hit the inauguration of ecuadors new pro chavez president rafael correa the caracas visit was mr ahmadinejads second in four months "this is just a prelude of what we will do " declared mr chavez in a televised speech announcing the creation of a joint &# billion fund to finance development and other projects "this large and strategic fund brother is going to be converted into a mechanism of liberation " he added saying their goal is to build "a network of alliances " in managua the iranian also signed a "broad cooperation accord" with mr ortega mr chavez openly funded the sandinistas presidential campaign last year and he earlier supported evo morales in bolivia venezuelan soldiers have reported that they are under orders to give colombian rebels safe haven and mr chavez signed contracts last year to buy russian migs and open a kalishnakov factory at home meanwhile the venezuelan is using his recent election victory to consolidate his grip on the economy a week ago he announced he would nationalize the countrys electricity and telephone companies he already controls the oil business his goal here is to redistribute income but especially to shrink the private economy in order to reduce the space in which any political opposition can operate the caracas stock exchange index fell last week but that didnt phase senor chavez hes moving to withdraw the license of a prominent independent television network and he has asked congress to grant him temporary executive power to rule by decree "the world should know our revolution is not turning back " he said "this is the path our boat is on socialism country socialism or death " the world should have known this a long time ago but too many people chose to ignore it mr chavez took office in on a promise to end corruption and injustice by human rights groups warned of a deterioration in constitutional protections and mr chavez began importing cuban security agents along with cuban doctors and teachers to spread propaganda each time mr chavez has faced resistance he has tightened the screws price and capital controls and property seizures became state policy employees of the state owned oil company and its contractors were fired if they opposed the government political opponents were jailed all the while mr chavez has had american enablers who excused his growing repression or blamed it on a reaction to u s policy foremost among them has been mr dodd who has defended mr chavez as "democratically elected" despite his clear trend toward authoritarianism in the circumstances surrounding a recall referendum were so anti democratic that the european union refused to act as an observer jimmy carter nonetheless blessed the outcome amid heavy irregularities and the u s state department endorsed the process other politicians such as mr delahunt embraced and flattered mr chavez for his pr stunt of offering cut rate oil to poor americans perhaps its time these americans paid attention to the kind of "socialism" and "revolution" that their support is helping mr chavez to build in venezuela
