turkey enjoys a boom in malls istanbul this metropolis has long been celebrated as a merchants paradise home to the famed grand bazaar and its colorful and crowded medieval alleyways today turkey is gaining a new type of retail experience about minutes by car from the grand bazaar is the recently opened futuristic steel and glass kanyon mall well dressed turks saunter through boutiques selling &# yves st laurent suits and equally pricey bottles of chateau margaux since turkeys first modern shopping mall was opened less than two decades ago construction of others has boomed the country has malls the vast majority of which opened in the past five years according to the turkish council of shopping centers and retailers a further are under construction and more are in the planning stages the council adds while investors originally concentrated on the two largest cities istanbul and ankara the new projects are spread across turkey particularly in fast expanding industrial and tourist centers such as konya and antalya "were just updating the grand bazaar tradition " says avi alkas an istanbul shopping mall consultant who worked on the kanyon project zoning permission for large facilities is easy to obtain in turkey he says in contrast to western europe where laws to protect small shopkeepers make it "almost impossible to get a construction permit anywhere from prague to paris to build a new shopping center " the explosion of glittering new malls underscores turkeys huge economic opportunities and illustrates some of its challenges even as turkeys negotiations to enter the european union stall the country continues to race ahead economically displaying a pro business attitude and flexibility that often surpasses that of western europe foreign businesses from retailers to manufacturers are flocking to the country opening hypermarkets and car factories at a rapid pace turkish output rose by a third in to the strongest pace of growth in the organization for economic cooperation and development whose members include most of western europe and the u s turkeys progress remains fragile some fear the political freeze in its eu ambitions will lead to a loss of investor and consumer confidence widespread counterfeiting of upscale brands remains a threat even though laws call for fines and confiscation enforcement remains weak overbuilding and growing domestic opposition from small mostly islamic businessmen could lead to legislation to protect small shopkeepers and crush the mall movement "it has gotten so crazy that two shopping malls are being built side by side " says serdar sunay director of operations at boyner group one of turkeys largest retailers "we have to be careful because we can put stores in only one mall " until recently the idea of a saturated turkish retail market was a joke high tariff walls kept out modern goods leaving shopping concentrated in street markets or typical venues such as the grand bazaar first built by sultan mehmet ii the conqueror in the th century economic changes in the s began to lower tariff barriers and led to construction of the countrys first modern mall in galleria near istanbuls airport
