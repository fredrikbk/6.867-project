politics &amp economics groundwork for a war debate democrats expect a series of fights over iraq spending washington republican votes will decide the coming debate in congress over the iraq war so democrats are first working to build bipartisan support for nonbinding criticism before taking on the white house over funding the two part strategy is on display this week as top republicans and democrats on the senate foreign relations committee expect to announce agreement on a resolution challenging president bushs decision to increase u s troop levels as those talks proceed the house appropriations committee will also begin hearings this morning to lay the groundwork for tougher fights over war related spending requests this spring and summer the iraq debate wont be one single battle but a series of firefights over the coming months during which events on the ground in baghdad will be pivotal much as democrats are emboldened by novembers victories they also have their own divisions on the issue and mr bush whose powers as commander in chief give him immense leverage has said he has no intention of backing down but the landscape has changed and left him more vulnerable on three points novembers election shook rank and file republicans who are fearful of going into with the war still a major issue the planned troop increase has aggravated divisions in the republican foreign policy establishment best captured by the opposition from nebraska sen chuck hagel a vietnam veteran with ties to two former secretaries of state james baker and colin powell the growing financial strain of iraq will be spelled out as never before in a series of defense and war related spending requests by the white house next month expected to total more than &# billion through sept former north carolina sen john edwards the democrats vice presidential nominee who already is running for the white house in is pressing hard for a vote to cut off funding for any military escalation in iraq but oregon sen gordon smith whose december floor speech against the war captured the post election shift among republicans cautions democrats against moving too fast "democrats are wise not to push this too hard but i think within this year the issue will have ripened enough that the correct course of action will be clear " mr smith said in the house the skittish republican mood was apparent last week as party leaders faced warnings that there must be real progress in iraq before july to keep members in line that date also coincides with when democrats hope to have begun debate on the defense appropriations bill the measure will include not only funding for basic defense operations but for the first time a request by the white house budget office for what it anticipates will be the annual war costs in iraq and afghanistan for the new fiscal year that begins oct the total package to be revealed with the presidents budget next month could exceed &# billion on top of this the administration is expected to ask for emergency supplemental funding providing an estimated &# billion in emergency appropriations to sustain military operations overseas for the remainder of this fiscal year ending sept taken together that means lawmakers will be asked to address in a matter of months defense and war related requests in the range of &# billion driven up by iraq annual spending on defense already matches in terms of dollars adjusted for inflation expenditures at the height of the vietnam war and these numbers could further shake republican resolve "i think it will have an impact money issues may be put in play for real " said new hampshire sen judd gregg the ranking republican on the senate budget committee "for those of us from the northeast its pretty evident that people are losing patience and want to get out " said rep rodney frelinghuysen r n j a member of the defense appropriations panel "a lot of people are peeling off from supporting the president " among republicans sen hagel is most crucial given his standing on the senate foreign relations panel war experience and long attachment to prominent republican foreign policy figures "this is not just chuck hagel charging out based on some months in vietnam " mr hagel said in an interview and if he should enter the presidential campaign it could emphasize the divide among republicans mr hagel has stressed to democrats that they must let "the system work" to build ties with republicans on the war debate "the american people have to have some hope that were not just a bunch of political animals and we can come together " senate majority leader harry reid d nev has kept himself one step removed and left the early negotiations to his armed services and foreign relations committee chairmen sens carl levin d mich and joseph biden d del respectively one option would be to have the resolution reported out of the senate foreign relations committee to give it more standing and house democrats have signaled that they could use the senate product as a model for their own resolution next week "i expect it to be a bipartisan vote " said house majority leader steny hoyer d md the nervousness among house republicans is striking after novembers losses "two years before the elections people are worried about their political skins " said rep ray lahood r ill a pew research center survey shows republican voters rallying behind the president but independents were the swing force in and by a margin the same pew poll shows independents opposing the plan to send more troops thus rep john murtha d pa who will manage the iraq spending bill this spring is convinced he can get bipartisan support even as he proposes to add restrictions that could impede the planned deployment of four more army combat infantry brigades into iraq and rather than cutting funds lawmakers could add more money to defense bills but then attach readiness requirements that must be met for it to be used "it is not going to end because of any legislative action we take but the legislative actions we take can help to bring it to an end " said house appropriations committee chairman david obey d wis congressional coalition building democratic members of congress opposed to the war in iraq are working to enlist republican lawmakers to support their position "democrats are wise not to push this too hard but i think within this year the issue will have ripened enough that the correct course of action will be clear " gordon smith r oregon capitol hill timetable january debate on bipartisan senate resolution of disapproval over troop increase february and march debate on supplemental budget request totaling about &# billion for iraq and afghanistan summer debate on defense appropriations bill which may top &# billion through sept including iraq afghanistan and operations overseas
