and its present takes root in brooklyn brooklyn n y two tuesdays ago just after p m early afternoon by most jazz schedules the back room at barbes a bar performance space in brooklyns park slope neighborhood was packed with a mix of bohemians and professionals as violinist jenny scheinman concluded her first set ms scheinman is one of the fastest up and comers on the jazz scene her recent gigs have featured leading players such as guitarist bill frisell pianist jason moran drummer paul motian and reedman don byron and in november she led an piece string orchestra but those gigs are in manhattan on tuesdays for the past three years she has held forth at barbes a five year old space that has become the epicenter for a growing jazz scene in park slope ms scheinman says she uses the happy hour residency to experiment "i try things that i think might not work just to find out " she said in an interview earlier this month "i put together bands of people that i think will play well together but dont know each other " in that regard she is fulfilling the mission of the venue which was named for a french train station and founded by an expatriate frenchman olivier conan mr conan aimed to create a place where musicians could work out new ideas on stage and werent limited by genre ms scheinmans sets which move seamlessly from the grizzled laments of tom waits to the debonair swing of duke ellington typify the eclectic barbes scene her band on the evening i saw her featured guitarist adam levy bassist todd sickafoose and clarinetist doug wieselman each a respected and in demand improviser on jan she will perform with wide ranging los angeles based guitarist nels cline ms scheinman sings a few tunes in a prim crystalline high alto on others the band sounds like a scruffy country unit with the violinist holding her instrument like a guitar plucking rhythm lines to accent mr levys solos ms scheinmans solos are pithy highlighted by intricate rhythms and a bluesy pungency the gig is typical of a change that is going on in jazz twenty years ago jazz began to run short of star level talent that could easily fill a concert hall but around the same time many conservatories and other established educational institutions began jazz programs now there is a glut of exciting graduates of those music programs who never quite became stars on the nightclub circuit but are playing more modest one and two night stands and some of the best jazz artists of any age or level of education are settling in for residencies at intimate nightclubs and performance spaces the range of venues that host these sorts of gigs is expanding although greenwich village remains the jazz capital large nightclubs like the village vanguard and the blue note draw hard core and casual fans alike and their neighbors include smaller but vital spaces like the cornelia street cafe the jazz gallery and smalls jazz has expanded in other parts of manhattan intimate venues are thriving in harlem and the east village and in brooklyn barbes is joined in park slope by biscuit bbq the tea lounge and bar each usually featuring well respected players the brooklyn clubs offer a more relaxed less formal environment and gentler prices than their manhattan counterparts and musicians many of whom live in the borough have taken to them enthusiastically throughout its near century long existence jazz has been very friendly to musical taxonomists as the new developments have usually occurred within easily definable movements like swing bebop free jazz and fusion the changes occurring today are more subtle and involve players taking the panoply of sounds theyve grown up around and creating a new jazz from it the new venues have less of a connection to jazzs past than older clubs and feel freer to present the emerging sounds while ms scheinmans tuesday gigs offer a menu too diverse for some manhattan jazz clubs other park slope performances would fit in perfectly across the river last january trumpeter john mcneil and saxophonist bill mchenry started a sunday night engagement in the skylight room of a bistro called night and day where their quartet played russ freeman and other composers from the s cool school movement the booking was to last for a month but the band found a following and remained in place even as the bistro changed into biscuit bbq during the summer the booking is now open ended and the quartet has become a fixture on the new york city weekend jazz scene attracting musicians park slope jazz fans and aficionados from all over the city a key is that this is an engagement that does not feel stuck in the era in which the music was first made "the music is pretty diatonic the tunes modulate very little which enables us to improvise over them in a more contemporary way " explained mr mcneil via email the year old trumpeter met mr mchenry while working in a variety of bands and the two discovered a shared passion for s west coast jazz composers who became known as the cool school both felt the music was unfairly obscure though it is cherished by jazz fans and they jumped at the chance to build a gig around this repertoire the music is lean but full of rhythmic nuance and the co leaders probing solos and rich interplay highlight their sets there is so much above ground jazz activity in brooklyn now the park slope scene has emerging parallels in williamsburg fort greene and bedford stuyvesant that a new collective has dubbed itself the brooklyn jazz underground the organization comprises bands led by on the rise players who have pooled their resources for promotion and used outlets like myspace com to gain exposure for their music the brooklyn jazz underground had its launch last week at smalls in manhattan but the spirit of the organization is firmly rooted in brooklyn all of the members reside there and they wanted to give a nod to the vitality of its scene "brooklyn represents an aesthetic that we all embrace in our own music that of fearless experimentation and open mindedness " wrote trombonist alan ferber in an email "whenever i walk into a brooklyn jazz club i know that i have to check my preconceptions at the door and enter expecting to hear anything its very exciting and consistently inspiring " mr mcneil also finds the brooklyn setting vital to his performances "this is a very jazz friendly atmosphere with a lot of regulars " he said he added that the familiarity keeps him on his toes "you have to be careful not to repeat yourself " he added "you dont want the audience singing along to your solos " ms scheinman recalled a visit from her father who came to see her perform at carnegie hall a couple of years ago "the next night i played at barbes and later that night as we were walking home he said jenny you know im really proud of you for playing at carnegie hall and that was a great concert but i have to admit that i liked hearing you at barbes better "hes an old folkie " she continued "so it would make sense that hed say this but i agree theres nothing like music in a small room among people who at least seem like friends " mr johnson writes about jazz for
