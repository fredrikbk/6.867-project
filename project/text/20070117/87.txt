no apology yet but hey no prob in regard to your jan editorial "the berger files" a couple of years ago the journal was actively pursuing the truth about mr berger and the event at the national archives several articles appeared that cast suspicion on mr bergers actions during that time i happened to be listening to npr and one day heard daniel shorr request a couple of minutes to speak about mr berger mr schorr went on to say and i paraphrase here that the journal had a vendetta against mr berger and had been printing untrue and unfounded charges against him in an obvious effort to discredit him and the clinton administration he went on further to say that the manner in which this was done would never happen at other less partisan papers like the new york times and others he then went on to say that mr berger had been fully exonerated by current investigations and wondered out loud if the journal was going to issue an apology for its partisan reporting shortly after it came to light that mr berger was indeed guilty of that which you had accused him i wrote to npr and asked that if in light of these events daniel shorr had apologized to the journal i never heard back have you william a stephenson cordillera colo
