waistlines can be almost as important as increasing the dollars in their investment portfolios for one group of her boomer clients former secret service agents serving as an agent on the presidents security detail for instance is a physically demanding and mentally challenging role that requires stamina and discipline ms schaeffer says at age agents are required by law to retire from active duty

disorienting and lead to frustration they often struggle to maintain independently the level of physical fitness and mental focus that once came so easily through their job when clients voice such concerns ms schaeffer asks if clients have considered meeting with a nutritionist medical studies show that improving diet can help people work out more effectively and reduce the likelihood of injury

benefited from diet advice she then offers to put clients in touch with a nutritionist baby boomers who retire at age can on average expect to spend roughly years in retirement as a raft of studies
