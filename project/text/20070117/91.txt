on education what s wrong with vocational school the topic yesterday was education and children in the lower half of the intelligence distribution today i turn to the upper half people with iqs of or higher todays simple truth is that far too many of them are going to four year colleges begin with those barely into the top half those with average intelligence to have an iq of means that a tough high school course pushes you about as far as your academic talents will take you if you are average in math ability you may struggle with algebra and probably fail a calculus course if you are average in verbal skills you often misinterpret complex text and make errors in logic these are not devastating shortcomings you are smart enough to engage in any of hundreds of occupations you can acquire more knowledge if it is presented in a format commensurate with your intellectual skills but a genuine college education in the arts and sciences begins where your skills leave off in engineering and most of the natural sciences the demarcation between high school material and college level material is brutally obvious if you cannot handle the math you cannot pass the courses in the humanities and social sciences the demarcation is fuzzier it is possible for someone with an iq of to sit in the lectures of economics read the textbook and write answers in an examination book but students who cannot follow complex arguments accurately are not really learning economics they are taking away a mishmash of half understood information and outright misunderstandings that probably leave them under the illusion that they know something they do not a depressing research literature documents ones inability to recognize ones own incompetence traditionally and properly understood a four year college education teaches advanced analytic skills and information at a level that exceeds the intellectual capacity of most people there is no magic point at which a genuine college level education becomes an option but anything below an iq of is problematic if you want to do well you should have an iq of or higher put another way it makes sense for only about of the population if one stretches it to get a college education and yet more than of recent high school graduates enroll in four year colleges adjust that percentage to account for high school dropouts and more than of all persons in their late teens are trying to go to a four year college enough people to absorb everyone down through an iq of no data that i have been able to find tell us what proportion of those students really want four years of college level courses but it is safe to say that few people who are intellectually unqualified yearn for the experience any more than someone who is athletically unqualified for a college varsity wants to have his shortcomings exposed at practice every day they are in college to improve their chances of making a good living what they really need is vocational training but nobody will say so because "vocational training" is second class "college" is first class large numbers of those who are intellectually qualified for college also do not yearn for four years of college level courses they go to college because their parents are paying for it and college is what children of their social class are supposed to do after they finish high school they may have the ability to understand the material in economics but they do not want to they too need to learn to make a living and would do better in vocational training combine those who are unqualified with those who are qualified but not interested and some large proportion of students on todays college campuses probably a majority of them are looking for something that the four year college was not designed to provide once there they create a demand for practical courses taught at an intellectual level that can be handled by someone with a mildly above average iq and or mild motivation the nations colleges try to accommodate these new demands but most of the practical specialties do not really require four years of training and the best way to teach those specialties is not through a residential institution with the staff and infrastructure of a college it amounts to a system that tries to turn out televisions on an assembly line that also makes pottery it can be done but its ridiculously inefficient government policy contributes to the problem by making college scholarships and loans too easy to get but its role is ancillary the demand for college is market driven because a college degree does in fact open up access to jobs that are closed to people without one the fault lies in the false premium that our culture has put on a college degree for a few occupations a college degree still certifies a qualification for example employers appropriately treat a bachelors degree in engineering as a requirement for hiring engineers but a bachelors degree in a field such as sociology psychology economics history or literature certifies nothing it is a screening device for employers the college you got into says a lot about your ability and that you stuck it out for four years says something about your perseverance but the degree itself does not qualify the graduate for anything there are better faster and more efficient ways for young people to acquire credentials to provide to employers the good news is that market driven systems eventually adapt to reality and signs of change are visible one glimpse of the future is offered by the nations two year colleges they are more honest than the four year institutions about what their students want and provide courses that meet their needs more explicitly their time frame gives them a big advantage two years is about right for learning many technical specialties while four years is unnecessarily long advances in technology are making the brick and mortar facility increasingly irrelevant research resources on the internet will soon make the college library unnecessary lecture courses taught by first rate professors are already available on cds and dvds for many subjects and online methods to make courses interactive between professors and students are evolving advances in computer simulation are expanding the technical skills that can be taught without having to gather students together in a laboratory or shop these and other developments are all still near the bottom of steep growth curves the cost of effective training will fall for everyone who is willing to give up the trappings of a campus as the cost of college continues to rise the choice to give up those trappings will become easier a reality about the job market must eventually begin to affect the valuation of a college education the spread of wealth at the top of american society has created an explosive increase in the demand for craftsmen finding a good lawyer or physician is easy finding a good carpenter painter electrician plumber glazier mason the list goes on and on is difficult and it is a sellers market journeymen craftsmen routinely make incomes in the top half of the income distribution while master craftsmen can make six figures they have work even in a soft economy their jobs cannot be outsourced to india and the craftsmans job provides wonderful intrinsic rewards that come from mastery of a challenging skill that produces tangible results how many white collar jobs provide nearly as much satisfaction even if foregoing college becomes economically attractive the social cachet of a college degree remains that will erode only when large numbers of high status high income people do not have a college degree and dont care the information technology industry is in the process of creating that class with bill gates and steve jobs as exemplars it will expand for the most natural of reasons a college education need be no more important for many high tech occupations than it is for nba basketball players or cabinetmakers walk into microsoft or google with evidence that you are a brilliant hacker and the job interviewer is not going to fret if you lack a college transcript the ability to present an employer with evidence that you are good at something without benefit of a college degree will continue to increase and so will the number of skills to which that evidence can be attached every time that happens the false premium attached to the college degree will diminish most students find college life to be lots of fun apart from the boring classroom stuff and that alone will keep the four year institution overstocked for a long time but rightly understood college is appropriate for a small minority of young adults perhaps even a minority of the people who have iqs high enough that they could do college level work if they wished people who go to college are not better or worse people than anyone else they are merely different in certain interests and abilities that is the way college should be seen there is reason to hope that eventually it will be mr murray is the w h brady scholar at the american enterprise institute
