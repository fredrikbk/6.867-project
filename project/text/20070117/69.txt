in search of better ways to search google microsoft ask com quietly use spinoff sites to test new features solicit feedback pulling up videos kevin mccarty long a devout google user recently discovered a search engine he often finds more helpful its called searchmash com and unlike google and other major search sites it pulls up video images and text all at the same time "i absolutely hate having to go from page to page to get a combination of image and web results " says mr mccarty a year old computer consultant in nashville tenn "searchmash saves lots of time " it turns out though that searchmash is google in recent months the top search engine and its main rivals have stealthily set up a new generation of search engines where they try out new tools and features on consumers without putting their tried and true formulas at risk if something proves to be a hit the combined search results that mr mccarty likes so much for instance it could eventually be folded into the parent site for now though these sites provide an entertaining and even useful glimpse into the evolution of web and in particular search engines which in their basic operation havent changed much in years google inc launched searchmash com in september without the google name although it is mentioned in the sites privacy policy searchmash displays a subset of the normal google search results in an entirely different interface with collapsible menus for video blog and image results on the same screen in december iac interactivecorp s ask com launched ask x which chops up the results page into an unconventional three panel format standard search results are flanked on the left by suggested terms to help you narrow or expand your search and on the right by results broken down by categories such as news and dictionary results yahoo inc now uses alltheweb com and altavista com both of which it acquired in recent years to experiment with processes like livesearch a feature that will start suggesting search terms for you when you type just one letter microsoft corp s windows live unit recently launched msdewey com a search engine where users pose their query to prerecorded video clips of an actress playing the role of ms dewey a brassy and attractive woman in a low cut black dress the site is helping microsoft test users tolerance for a fancy interface with high resolution images and audio in response to a particular search query ms dewey pipes back with one of some scripted responses pegged to what the user typed the search results appear on the side if you search for "president bush " for instance one possible response from the actress may be "hey there big guy watch it or maybe i should just turn your name over to the justice department " all of the leading search brands have operated their own internal test sites and labs for years they frequently test layout and formatting tweaks on their main sites often without users knowing but now they are making their bold new ideas more public and asking users for feedback ask x links to a feedback form where users can submit random thoughts about the quality of the results searchmash devotes space on its results page to a box that asks users to select whether the results in categories like web image blog and video search were useful with the exception of msdewey com which is largely for entertainment the sites aim to test new features that may make search more successful often hoping to fold them back into core sites if they prove popular users dont have to rate the features to try them unlike other search sites that ask users to rate the accuracy of results to create a community driven search formula these sites generally stick to the same set of search results you would find on the branded site but package them in new ways for example all four search engines so far have resisted combining various types of search like image search video search and local search on one screen worried that consumers would find it too messy but the spinoffs are embracing that approach often displaying results from multiple sources on the same screen another theme trying to better guess users intentions and help them change their mind without starting their search all over again googles searchmash which swaps new features in and out every few weeks has experimented with blending in spell check adjusted results yahoos livesearch which pulls up possible queries before the user is finished typing was launched first on alltheweb com and is now on next yahoo com the companys site for test projects the companies are starting to show their cards as internet users demand more than just the basics from internet search services after all the standard search model hasnt changed much in almost a decade "for of internet users search today is exactly like it was in " says ken cassar chief analyst for nielsen netratings but the new content from videos to maps to social networking profiles and the spread of broadband that makes searching it faster has many predicting that radically new approaches to search are just around the corner "it is still the early days in search and in the user interface " says justin osmer senior product manager for windows live that sense and with paid search spending forecast to climb to &# billion in according to jupiter research have motivated a host of start ups including a soon to be launched search engine from the founder of wikipedia called search wikia search wikia com the companies approach their public testing grounds with varying degrees of secrecy google yahoo and microsoft havent prominently branded the sister sites with their name although they disclose their affiliations in the "terms and conditions" and privacy policies or in the fine print the anonymity ensures users arent potentially biased when they rate results says mike bostock a software engineer at google to further cloak their affiliations the properties generally have a remarkably different look than the core brands with alternate colors graphics and fonts asks approach with ask x is slightly different the company plans to use the site launched in december as a home for gathering feedback on a variety of possible products before they launch starting with web search the three panel interface currently being tested is likely to become the backbone of asks new home page expected out this year says daniel read vice president for products and user experience at the company ask x also has a video search tool a feature currently not available through ask christina pikas a year old librarian says ask x surfaces some useful details that are buried in other search engines when ms pikas of laurel md recently searched for her last name ask x pulled out not only results pertaining to the animal the pikas but also a photo encyclopedia entry and to her surprise a characterization of its kingdom phylum class and order
