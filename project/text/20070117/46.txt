econoblog are london style traffic charges the answer for u s congestion crammed roadways and rush hour traffic once were only problems in major u s cities such as new york and los angeles but traffic snarls are becoming a growing problem for more cities the number of metro areas where rush hour travelers spend more than hours per year stewing in traffic grew from a mere five in to in according to the most recent report from the texas transportation institute traffic policies have long focused on road building but some now argue that opening toll based express lanes or instituting extra fees for rush hour drivers as london did in may drive people toward public transportation and make commutes more efficient are there unintended consequences of such policies and how big a problem is congestion if in the end commuters still are willing brave the morning rush the online journal asked economists peter gordon of the university of southern california and matthew kahn of the university of california at los angeles to discuss the costs of traffic congestion the problem it poses or doesnt pose for cities and how policy options such as londons traffic congestion charges might play on this side of the pond matthew kahn writes while congestion is annoying is it destructive to long run urban growth congested cities such as boston london new york city and san francisco all feature high home prices and they continue to attract the skilled to live and work there we are a highly diverse nation i dont like to commute so ive spent a lot of money on a relatively small apartment that is in walking distance to ucla i know other faculty who actually seem to enjoy commuting they choose to live in distant suburbs and happen to own nice cars with good stereos if their commute is five minutes shorter each day have they been made much better off if people knew that they could drive faster due to effective congestion policies would they "sprawl" more and live further from their jobs peter gordon writes matt i agree that u s highway traffic problems are not as bad as elsewhere in the world but many americans have high expectations and some of the nations worst commutes have been getting the most attention still traffic congestion where it exists is actually a no brainer in fact its necessary we insist on free access to roads in most places and as a result we actually rely on congestion to ration scarce road space what strikes me as interesting is how comparatively little congestion we get in spite of both policy failures and growth in population income and travel traffic problems have been compounded by the fact that it has been official policy of late to purposely underfund road construction and road improvements on a per passenger mile or per trip basis public transportation gets vastly more money from the federal government and from most of the states than road building does but funding public transit does almost nothing for congestion so how is it that we do so well comparatively when our policies are so inept heres the answer for the most part our system allows people and businesses to evaluate many complex trade offs when choosing their locations our rules are flexible enough to let them to make the tough choices in order to find the sites that work best for them all things considered believing that policy makers and planners can discover more beneficial location patterns as many of them assert would further compound the policy errors whereas many cite the census finding that about of commuters use public transit it is worth noting that when considering all trips in passenger miles public transits share is closer to this number has been falling in every year since the data have been compiled looking at this trend multi billion subsidies ever since the mid s are invisible and about of these transit passenger miles are in the new york metro area while road pricing would expand options because people can choose whether to spend time or money most planners want to implement tough oregon style land use controls designed to make development more compact that limit peoples options i am more optimistic about outcomes that come from expanded options matthew kahn writes peter has pointed out a fascinating paradox what is good transit policy most economists would argue that supply side attempts by building more roads wont ease congestion because drivers will respond by driving more urban congestion pricing appears to be working in central london drivers are responding to higher prices during peak hours by changing their driving habits some have argued congestion charges could actually create a "virtuous cycle" such that middle class people move from cars to public transit and this leads to a political constituency demanding higher quality public transit which u s cities most closely resemble dense london perhaps older cities such as boston new york and san francisco could be the first "guinea pigs" to try out congestion pricing and other cities could learn from their experience peter gordon writes while matt and i agree that congestion pricing on roads and highways is a good idea i do not think that it would be anything like the london example american cities are much more spread out and outside manhattan do not have a london type core dr bumsoo lee and i report that for the largest u s urbanized areas approximately of jobs are in the core in subcenters and everywhere else origins and destinations are much too dispersed for conventional transit to be useful to most people this is why the best that we can do in my view is to take up the idea of bob poole and ken orski who suggest transforming our almost useless hov lanes into hot lanes tolled lanes that would allow people to purchase faster travel at peak hours private investors would be keen to get in on this making a new source of capital available to highway agencies that cannot seem to get by on gas tax revenues i disagree with matt however that this policy would do much for transit use in the u s most people like personal transportation many of us use collective transportation only when we use the airlines and will jump at the chance to switch to private air travel as soon as it becomes affordable matthew kahn writes peter is right that job sprawl reduces public transit use i view the "virtuous circle" point as an attempt by political strategists to make road pricing more popular people usually oppose new taxes building on this point are congestion charges and hot lanes politically feasible people are used to the roads being "free " will people freak out if they are now charged for something that used to have a price of zero behavioral economists would say yes look at all the anger over "lexus lanes " was this merely "cheap talk" will this anger subside as road pricing helps to ease congestion and the middle class realize that the collected tax revenue can be earmarked for public goods they value peter gordon writes there is disagreement over the political feasibility of hot lanes ken orski for example believes that we have passed a "tipping point " the sr and i hot lane experiences in california suggest that we are past the original "lexus lane" media hysteria big budget transit projects and hov construction are popular because they are jobs programs big city politicians bank on this and get a pass from know nothings who presume that these are beneficial policies in fact they divert attention from serious innovations hot lanes would be one switching from producer side subsidies to targeted user side subsidies transit vouchers would be another de monopolization so that new carriers could compete is still another finally don shoup has convincingly shown that most cities parking policies are insane promoting auto use at the margin while mandating the provision of too many spaces the market can well decide how many spaces where and at what price and their price at any time of day we really have to get away from the same old stale policy options matthew kahn writes peter is right that a variety of interest groups have a stake in supply side "solutions" to congestion i learned a great deal about the political economy of building new transport infrastructure from alan altshuler and david luberoffs book titled "mega projects the changing politics of urban public investment " put bluntly has bostons "big dig" been worth the &# billion price tag many economists share the goal of mitigating the social costs of private vehicle use by introducing demand side incentives greg mankiws "pigou club" has drawn considerable attention as he has pushed for higher gas taxes in order to reduce vehicle greenhouse gas production politicians do not always follow the advice of efficiency seeking economists i wonder why will democrats in the local state and national elections be willing to run on a platform calling for higher gas taxes and road use charges many commuters trying to get to downtown jobs are "stuck in traffic" as our value of time continues to rise the cost of congestion increases peter gordon writes politics is the problem the wall street journals editorial page recently noted that neither republicans nor democrats can abandon earmarks so much for the message of the elections as the federal government elephant in the room earmarks will keep us in "big dig land" until such practices are curbed by constitutional change adding to capacity i e building more roads has more political appeal than managing what we already have through strategies such as road pricing private owners carefully compare the costs and benefits of pricing strategies versus adding capacity when the restaurateur looks at long waiting lists he has to think hard about adding tables and space or raising prices but this kind of deliberation is mostly missing from transportation policy discussions why did we ever think that politicized allocations could be efficient we teach the rational basis for public policy making but this may be a fools errand it appears that americans are affluent enough such that mega waste does not hurt most americans do not vote and those that do either enjoy or tolerate earmarks
