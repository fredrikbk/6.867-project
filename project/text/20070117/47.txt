educating democrats house democrats have scheduled a vote for today on a proposal that would reduce the interest rate on student loans the ostensible goal is to make college more affordable but such a move could well wind up having the opposite effect democrats campaigned last fall on a pledge to lower the interest rate on subsidized student loans to from the current "we will broaden college opportunity " says nancy pelosi the new house speaker "and we will begin by cutting interest rates for student loans in half " it makes for a good sound bite but on closer inspection the connection between lower interest rates and "college opportunity" is far from clear the interest rate doesnt affect whether a student can pay his or her tuition bill which means that no one unable to afford college today will suddenly be able to do so because of a reduction in the rate rather lowering the rate will simply boost the federal subsidy for loan repayments after graduation thats because the financial institutions that handle these loans are guaranteed a rate of return regardless of the interest rate halving the rate that lenders can charge borrowers means larger government read taxpayer subsidies for the banks in other words the democratic loan proposal isnt really about making college more affordable for low income families its about expanding federal subsidies for college grads including millions of middle class men and women who will go on to do very well in life and hardly need such a government handout "the average college graduate leaves school with a debt of &# which after consolidation and tax breaks comes to about &# a month " says brian riedl of the heritage foundation "if a college degree adds about a million dollars to your lifetime income bucks a month is manageable " democrats know that subsidizing college graduates doesnt sound all that great as a political theme so instead they pretend that cutting student loan interest rates will somehow make higher education more "accessible " the democrat proposal also has the potential to exacerbate perverse incentives already associated with the government student loan programs since tuition at public and private colleges has risen and respectively the only other segment of the economy where costs have outpaced inflation by similar leaps and bounds is health care and its no coincidence that third parties foot the bill for big chunks of both higher ed and health care spending this has predictably increased demand relative to supply and resulted in prices rising faster than they would otherwise like any business colleges will charge as much as their customers are willing to pay and you can be sure that as quickly as student aid increases colleges will raise tuition to capture the additional funds in the absence of all this subsidization colleges would have to be more cautious about raising tuition because their customers would be affected more directly so the biggest winners from this latest subsidy will be the relatively well off professors and administrators who run higher education rather than scaling back these interest rate subsidies democrats want to make them more generous this can only have the effect of further distorting the true cost of a college education by pushing more and more of that cost on to taxpayers ultimately increasing the governments role is a recipe for making college less affordable
