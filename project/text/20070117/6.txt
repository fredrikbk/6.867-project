among the sequoias they created art and tourism yosemite autry national center part i through sunday part ii through april the exhibit will travel to oakland calif reno nev and indianapolis los angeles as americans spread across the continent in the th century they walked rolled paddled and steamed past a series of grand and varied landscapes the countrys art and literary history is in no small part the collected responses of painters photographers and writers to these natural wonders the catskills niagara falls mississippi river great prairie rocky mountains southwest deserts pacific forests and alaska tundra "yosemite art of an american icon " the exhibition at the autry national center in los angeles examines with affection and intelligence the process by which one of these places became a symbol for the majestic potential of the young republic and an international tourist magnet on the northern california nevada border that today attracts more than three million visitors a year anyone who has hiked through yosemite national park knows that john muir ralph waldo emerson and others were not guilty of hype when they sanctified it as a "cathedral of nature " tiers of waterfalls spill into a wide valley surrounded by sheer granite cliffs a geometry both primeval and euclidian mountain lakes and forests of giant sequoia hundreds of feet high and thousands of years old add to the sense of an american sublime unrivaled by anything in the old world artists began to make extraordinary pictures of this extraordinary area shortly after gold prospectors entered the valley in the s the expeditionary draftsmen thomas ayres and adolph schwartz who took special note of the falls in their sketches and lithographs were trailed by photographers clarence weed in and carleton watkins and eadweard muybridge in the s working primarily with glass plates and a wet collodion process that required they develop their negatives on the spot they set up their cameras on narrow precipices and captured views of mirror lake cathedral rock el capitan the north dome that later became classic prospects in the work of ansel adams if the mammoth prints of watkins with their stark massing of abstract forms have been upgraded in historys eyes so that they now rank with the boldest art of the th century the enormous salon paintings of albert bierstadt inspired the widest popular acclaim and envy in the art world of the time his "sunset in the yosemite valley" from opens the show the product of an camping trip as well as his hyper romantic and commercial imagination it portrays a daily planetary event as cataclysmic in intensity mark twain gently mocked bierstadts attempts to improve on nature when he praised another irresistible exercise in bombast "the domes of the yosemite" from as "considerably more beautiful than the original" with "more the atmosphere of kingdom come than of california " throughout the s bierstadt painted a series of monumental yosemite canvases eight feet long or more thereby as kate nearpass ogden writes in her catalog essay "effectively staking out the valley as his turf " she argues that he also tried to position his view of yosemite falls as the "visual and symbolic heir to niagara falls " which his rival frederic church had earlier helped turn into an icon of north american splendor art and tourism in yosemite early on developed a profitable synergy words and images drew consumers who purchased booklets stereographs drawings and trinkets at the site and around the country even before when the wawona hotel was built tour groups from the east were touring the valley on horseback this crush of visitors and businesses became a growing problem for those who wanted to preserve the valley from development in president lincoln had signed a bill that set aside yosemite and mariposa grove under the stewardship of california for "public use resort and recreation inalienable for all time " but the wilderness advocate muir after he returned to the area in the s was so alarmed by the rapid despoliation of the land that he led the movement that transformed it into a national park in the curator amy scott and her team have assembled a first rate and representative selection of paintings and photographs to tell this story wall texts and catalog essays integrate the art within the history of the technology that abetted the formation in the public mind of yosemite as sacred ground the transcontinental railroad brought tourists from the east stereographs offered uncanny three dimensional views of rock strewn landscapes the invention of the handheld kodak encouraged more spontaneous picture taking a prime example from shows two young women kicking up their heels on overhanging rock at glacier point a risky platform for clowning the automobile and paved roads opened up the national park to millions the show is presented in halves the first part which closes jan brings together many early awestruck representations from through the s when ansel adams and edward weston first explored yosemite in winter with their view cameras the second part now on exhibit concurrently with the first part and then on its own until april offers post interpretations of the park and its visitors and a far less reverent perspective both parts will travel to the oakland museum of california on may the photograph of el capitan by the german artist thomas struth which opens part two competes in scale with a bierstadt or a s adams mural by the time struth arrived in however he could hardly ignore that a blacktopped road strewn with cars interrupted and in some ways defined the contemporary vista of the mountain the magnificent cliches of a pristine vastness perpetuated by adams and the sierra club provoked a reaction from younger artists who found such nature worship corny if not dishonest in bruce davidson photographed a yosemite campground where the people and their lawn chairs are as numerous as the pine trees the park also became a favorite spot to hang out and do drugs a scene captured in rondal partridges shot of half dressed young people milling on the mercer river bridge by richard misrach preferred to photograph one of adamss beloved motifs half dome through a stand of trees burned by fire another less than celebratory note is sounded by the american indian artifacts scattered through the first part of the show the southern miwok and mono paiute lived in the valley for years but are represented by only a tiny sample of baskets beadwork and necklaces none dating earlier than c patterns and forms by these early inhabitants were later adopted by their th century descendents however and the stately polychrome baskets by lucy telles and carrie bethel from the s are among the unexpected highlights here a few artists continue to demonstrate an unironic regard for the beauty of yosemite along with an adults recognition that the original wilderness is long gone mark klett has photographed where muybridge and weston stood and incorporated their prints into his multi paneled digital panorama stephen shores color landscape from portrays a family playing in the mercer river with unimposing mountains in the background yosemite as a pretty place but not as eden and wayne thiebauds paintings of various sites from the s to s are as close focused and modest in scope as thomas morans were god like and symphonic a place for the human must be acknowledged in this natural equation a place for the human eye if nothing else mr woodward is an arts critic in new york
