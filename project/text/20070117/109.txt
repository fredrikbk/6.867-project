reversal of fortune an immigration raid aids blacks for a time after latinos flee factory shifts to locals mr royalss struggle but for local african americans the dramatic appearance of federal agents presented an unexpected opportunity crider suddenly raised pay at the plant an advertisement in the weekly forest blade newspaper blared "increased wages" at crider starting at &# to &# an hour more than a dollar above what the company had paid many immigrant workers the company began offering free transportation from nearby towns and free rooms in a company owned dormitory near to the plant for the first time in years local officials say crider aggressively sought workers from the areas state funded employment office a key avenue for low skilled workers to find jobs of candidates sent to crider most of them black the plant hired about a customer at a convenience store in douglas ga told april paulk a part time clerk that a recruiter was in town looking for workers ms paulk passed the word to her husband year old germaine royals who had just been laid off from the latest in a series of temporary jobs both are african american less than a month after the raids on illegal immigrants mr royals and three other workers met at a gas station parking lot and piled into a van sent by peacock poultry inc one of several contractors hired to fill the ranks of criders production lines two hours later they pulled into an austere complex of brown dormitories owned by crider that three weeks earlier had teemed with hispanics mr royals stashed two small bags of belongings and a boom box in a dingy room and took his place the next morning on a production line at the chicken plant for the first time since significant numbers of latinos began arriving in stillmore in the late s the plants processing lines were made up predominantly of african americans the sudden reversal of economic fortunes in stillmore underscores some of the most complex aspects of the pitched debate over immigration do illegal immigrants take jobs from low skilled american workers the answer in stillmore initially appeared to be yes but in the months since crider began hiring hundreds of african americans the answer has become more complex the plant has struggled with high turnover among black workers lower productivity and pay disputes between the new employees and labor contractors the allure of compliant latino workers willing to accept grueling conditions despite rock bottom pay has proved a difficult habit for crider to shake particularly because the local native born workers who replaced them are more likely to complain about working conditions and aggressively assert what they believe to be legal pay and workplace rights americans avoid such labor because "they cant live on those wages and refuse to " says debra sabia a professor at nearby georgia southern university who founded a social service organization for the areas latino immigrants "if you gave a survey to americans and asked them where theyd want to work a slaughterhouse would not be on the list these are not jobs we aspire for our children to take " the impact of immigration on low wage workers is likely to come under increasing scrutiny as the new congress prepares to tackle immigration reform last month federal officials raided facilities owned by meat processor swift &amp co in six states which resulted in the arrests of about people on alleged identity theft and immigration violations georgia and particularly the atlanta region in the north of the state is home to a large concentration of wealthy and middle class african americans but in struggling rural towns the scarcity of work is particularly felt by low skilled african americans who by virtue of poor education lack of transportation or choice have been unable to follow jobs as they moved away stillmore began the th century as a timber and cotton town sitting at the intersection of three rail lines connecting the busy port town of savannah to the center of georgias cotton kingdom for decades anyone willing to grasp a hoe could find at least minimal work every spring and fall when cotton was planted and harvested but by the s cotton was fading the rail lines were abandoned and a chicken processing plant later acquired by crider in had become the hub of the local economy until the late s the plant employed a majority black production line with whites and some blacks as supervisors according to current and former employees by latino migrant workers who had long come and gone with the cotton and onion seasons were putting down roots part of a national trend the north american free trade agreement hurt many mexican farmers prompting a surge of illegal immigration at the same time u s immigration crackdowns made crossing the border more treacherous prompting workers to settle in the u s the south became home to more than a third of the nations hispanics georgias share tripled during the s to according to u s census estimates in the number of hispanics topped in georgia making up of the population the influx of hispanics meant crider could maintain its stillmore roots while drawing on a pool of low skilled foreign workers to do jobs that held little appeal for native born americans a government accountability office report on working conditions in the meat and poultry industry found injury rates among the highest of any u s industry and cited slippery floors and cold temperatures among the harsh conditions workers endure federal workplace safety inspectors cited crider in for a forklift accident in which a worker was run over and killed other plants in georgia have even higher incidences of violations according to federal records with the arrival of so many immigrants willing to toil for low wages on brutal round the clock shifts the number of black workers at crider declined steadily to in early from as high as a decade ago the company says wages stagnated at about &# an hour just above the u s minimum wage of &# an hour current and former workers say crider says it also paid incentives and bonuses not accounted for in hourly wages as african americans left seeking better pay or to escape the difficult and often bloody work most were replaced by latinos employees say crider officials say the transformation to majority hispanic work force happened gradually over most of a decade without any encouragement by the company david purtle criders president says any impression that the company didnt want to hire african americans then was "concocted in peoples minds who dont know whats going on the first people you see in our employment office are african americans weve never skewed our hiring toward any ethnic group " but he says crider faces the same problems that employers in many small towns grapple with "we have to find a source of employees and stillmore will not provide that source its not big enough " he says "we want people who want to work and are willing to work every day " the presence of so many illegal workers became routine at crider too jose sauceda first came to the u s as an illegal immigrant in but qualified for legal status under a reagan administration amnesty program and became a u s citizen in he arrived at crider in his wife socorro whom mr sauceda had paid smugglers to sneak across the border followed him to the poultry plant as she filled out a job application at the plant she tried to use for a social security number a taxpayer identification number starting with the number " " according to ms sauceda a crider clerk stopped her and said valid social security numbers never begin with a nine "she was very helpful " ms sauceda says "she kept saying perhaps you meant to put down a four or a six and i was nervous so i just chose a six and that worked " her application was accepted ms sauceda went to work on the production line crider officials said recently they doubted ms saucedas account of her hiring and that the company wasnt "aiding and abetting" illegal hispanic workers mr purtle the company president said in an interview that crider never knowingly violated u s immigration laws and wasnt aware that so many of its latino workers were illegally in the u s "our personnel people have always complied with the hiring laws " mr purtle said the company was "taken aback" when federal agents showed up in may asserting that about of its workers were suspected of having false work documents mr purtle says two crider employees were among four men arrested for allegedly running a document mill churning out fake green cards and other fake documents immigration officials initially worked with crider over several months to gradually weed out those workers who couldnt prove legal worker status then federal officials became much more aggressive launching the raid over labor day weekend agents hauled away about mostly mexican immigrants according to immigration officials the rest fled stillmore or went into hiding nearby some women and children hid for days in the scrubland and pine woods outside of town without food or shelter while they waited for immigration agents to leave in the week after the raids dozens of latinos crowded a vacant lot beside a bodega across from stillmores city hall to get on buses operated by a mexican bus line leaving for other cities in the u s or back to mexico for african americans the departure of the hispanics was a boon lisa shinhoster and chris butler heard about crider when an acquaintance of a crider recruiter walked into an after hours bar where they were playing cards and announced to the patrons "anybody want a job " the two were soon working at the plant gutting chickens for mr royals the new opportunities at crider amounted to a windfall after months of erratic work through a temporary labor agency a high school dropout who earned his general equivalency diploma two years ago mr royals previously worked nights at a succession of factory jobs he had just been laid off for the second time in a month when ms paulk came home with word of the crider recruiter mr royals went to crider with a plan to work as many hours as possible he sometimes worked hours a day and earn enough to save for a new home and pay off bills his wife recently took a full time job as a private nurse for an elderly woman and attends classes at a technical college to earn a license as a practical nurse mr royals rose daily before dawn often eating a breakfast of grits eggs and sausage served shortly after a m at the crider cafeteria mr royals was assigned to the plants packing department where his squat burly frame and muscular arms made him a natural fit lifting crates of processed chicken he says he enjoyed the physical nature of the work and the quick pace made the hours go by quickly but for some of the african american workers who surged into the plant the unexpected chance to work at crider didnt turn out well they described long arduous schedules alleged health and safety hazards and unrelenting supervisors a crider spokeswoman says the allegations are the sentiment of "people who are not intent on working " on oct barbara smiley a gregarious and tall year old from mount vernon about two hours away was reaching for a chicken that had fallen off a conveyor belt when she smacked her head into a solid steel pole she went to the nurses station for an ice pack and then the bathroom to wash down a pain reliever she says her supervisor reprimanded her for leaving her post igniting an argument ms smiley was fired "they cussed at me " ms smiley said after the incident a lump visible in center of her forehead in the shape of a half dollar coin "im years old if you cuss at me im going to cuss you back " the company spokeswoman said ms smiley suffered a mild injury and quit but couldnt confirm other details of the incident legal hispanic workers who remained at crider after the raid complain that the new black production line workers are getting higher pay but dont work as hard as their latino cohorts did when the plant operated with majority latino laborers says mr sauceda his six person assembly line produced pallets of poultry daily with each pallet holding pound boxes of chicken now with workers on the line most of them black only pallets a day are completed he says "the blacks sit in the cafeteria and dont come to the line until the chickens are brought in but the hispanics we spend the time cleaning and doing things that need to be done " says mr sauceda who has subsequently left the company mr royals counters that blacks work just as hard as latinos he says he sees groups of hispanics taking extra rests on overnight shifts "im thinking to myself man i dont get that many breaks " he says several african american workers found themselves in pay disputes since the illegal immigrants were run out of the plant crider no longer directly employs many entry level workers instead mr royals and many others are classified as independent contractors working under an agreement between crider and allen peacock an african american owner of a recruiting business crider paid mr peacock a set rate for the hours his employees work and he paid the workers using mr peacock allowed crider to quickly hire workers since the contractor has provided laborers to the poultry industry for years every friday mr peacock pulled into the parking lot of the dormitory complex and handed out checks most of which he cashed on the spot leaving his employees with no documentation of how much they received in wages or paid in taxes according to several workers after a few weeks on the job mr royals and other black workers claimed mr peacock was short changing them on hours worked they said taxes were being deducted even though workers never filled out federal and state tax forms at one point ms paulk mr royalss wife telephoned mr peacock and demanded an explanation about the paychecks mr peacock denied mishandling their wages "everybody has to pay taxes " he said in an interview mr peacock said his workers were all being fully paid and that their taxes were properly collected despite his frustrations mr royals vowed to keep working but one morning mr peacock arrived at the crider dormitory complex and several workers gathered to register their complaints about wages in front of the other employees mr royals says mr peacock fired him mr royals says mr peacock seemed upset that ms paulk had called him on his cellphone on her husbands behalf "he said i couldnt put my wife in her place " mr royals says mr peacock didnt respond to subsequent calls seeking comment mr royals moved to augusta ga where he began doing landscaping work since the raids african americans have made up about of criders work force while whites are and hispanics according to the company turnover has been high the population of workers hired since last septembers immigration raids has turned over three times according to crider still struggling to fill its ranks crider began busing in felons on probation from a state prison and residents of a homeless mission from nearby macon crider also hired another labor contractor who specializes in hispanic workers in recent weeks dozens of mostly hispanic workers have appeared at the plant largely on the overnight sanitation shift a hispanic worker at the plant said he recognized some of the new workers as among those who had been dismissed prior to the federal raids for having false immigration documents a few weeks later immigration agents returned to stillmore and were seen questioning hispanics at a grocery store crider says it has ended its relationship with the temporary labor provider that rehired some former illegal crider workers it says it has also ended its relationship with mr peacock saying it was a financial decision based on the additional fees they had to pay to the staffing company but crider is still about people short of its work force before the immigration raids it is now bringing laotian hmong immigrant workers and their families from minnesota and wisconsin with hopes that theyll stay on the job and build new roots in stillmore
