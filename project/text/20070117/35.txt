common sense an inexpensive way to play news of iphone buy at&amp t smartmoney january used to be the month for a long winters nap no more not with the giant consumer electronics show in las vegas and the north american international auto show in detroit during the first two weeks the headlines from these events this year have been dominated by apples new iphone and the imminent rise of toyota to pass ford as the worlds no auto maker apple shares are just under &# nearly double the price in july also brushing against a record are toyotas shares with the american depositary receipts trading at around &# i dont own shares in either company though i wish i did but at these prices im not about to take the plunge the good news is already reflected still i suspect there may be ways to profit from both the iphone and the auto industry compared with apple the media paid relatively little attention to at&amp t whose cingular wireless network now wholly owned by at&amp t after its merger with bellsouth and soon to be rebranded as at&amp t wireless gained exclusive rights as the iphone network even after at&amp ts strong showing last year the stock yields over and trades at just over times earnings wirelesss potential obviously any impact on at&amp t earnings if the iphone is a hit will be diluted compared with the impact on apple itself but i think that misses the broader point what the iphone demonstrates to me is that the potential of wireless devices and the networks that operate them is far greater than i would have imagined even a year or two ago hand held wireless devices are now functioning as phones computers email routers portable stereos mini televisions and game consoles the hand held device is becoming a vital part of nearly everyones life and if my bills are any indication consumers will be paying more and more now the cellular companies are beginning to introduce advertising onto the devices which could be a huge added revenue stream last year the debate was over who would dominate the home cable or phone companies though stocks of both groups did well cable seemed to be winning that contest but ive long argued theres room for both and im now convinced that in an increasingly mobile society the palm is as important a market as the home the palm is clearly dominated by the cellular companies to me this is one of those big ideas that can provide rich rewards for years i already own at&amp t shares and verizon communications and plan to add more if you want to play the iphone and all that it represents buy at&amp t new car hit at the auto show what caught my attention wasnt the string of futuristic concept vehicles but two here and now products from of all companies ford motor ive argued for some time that all the financial restructuring and layoffs cant save the american auto makers unless they come up with some products that people actually want to buy after visiting the new york auto show last spring i reported favorably on the new lincoln mkz a midsize luxury sedan available with all wheel drive now ford has unveiled the new ford edge and its luxury sibling the lincoln mkx these are "crossover" vehicles suv like cabins on automobile chassis and they are the best looking detroit cars ive seen in years they offer all wheel drive but unlike suvs and their gas guzzling truck like performance they offer decent fuel economy i think ford could have hits on its hands reminiscent of the early taurus and sable sedans i was also impressed with comments from fords new chief executive alan mulally who stressed that fords future is all about the quality of the products in stark contrast to toyota or even rival general motors whose shares were the best performing in the dow jones industrial average last year ford shares have gone nowhere recently the shares have been trading below &# after reaching as high as &# in september recommending ford is surely contrarian advice but with the stock at &# you dont have to wager all that much money and the january calls with a strike price of &# were selling for &# cashing out calls this week my long relationship with time warner came to an end at least temporarily the long term &# calls i bought long ago have expired a call is an option to buy a security at a specific price when i first bought them i calculated the value of time warner at &# a share which at the time some argued was far fetched now the value is probably higher but with time warner shares at &# they were so close to my original target that i cashed out by selling bear in mind that with some stock indexes at a record and with the nasdaq stock market within striking range of my next selling target im not increasing my exposure to equities at the moment but i can use the proceeds to buy at&amp t and ford maintaining my overall allocation james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may
