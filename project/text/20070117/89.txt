myspace moves to give parents more information web site popular with kids offers to monitor names ages will it repel biggest users in a bid to appease government critics news corp s popular web site myspace com is planning to offer free parental notification software a move that risks alienating its young users parents who install the monitoring software on their home computers would be able to find out what name age and location their children are using to represent themselves on myspace the software doesnt enable parents to read their childs e mail or see the childs profile page and children would be alerted that their information was being shared the program would continue to send updates about changes in the childs name age and location even when the child logs on from other computers the software code named "zephyr " represents myspaces latest attempt to pacify critics who claim that the site is unsafe for teens dozens of teens have been molested and some even murdered by people who first contacted them through myspace according to law enforcement officials the stakes are high for news corp which bought myspace in for &# million back when it had million monthly unique visitors and very little revenue since then myspace has rocketed to million monthly users in the u s surpassed yahoo as the no u s web site in terms of page views and is expected to generate nearly &# million in revenues this year but a group of state attorneys general led by connecticuts richard blumenthal are investigating taking legal action against myspace if it doesnt raise the age limit to join the site to from currently and begin verifying myspace members ages against public databases a lawsuit by the attorneys general could cost myspace tens of millions of dollars in fees and generate reams of negative publicity at a time when major advertisers are just overcoming their concerns about the site so far myspace has refused to take either of the steps demanded by the attorneys general it defends its age limit of arguing that it is better for high schoolers to join with the special privacy controls designed for and year old members than to lie about their age to join "if youre youll try to get on our site anyway because your friends are going to be on it " says hemanshu nigam chief security officer for fox interactive media the unit that oversees myspace myspace users who list their ages as and are automatically given a private profile that cant be browsed by members who list their age as over users over cant add and year olds as friends unless they know the teenagers first and last name or e mail address myspace members under cant access "mature" groups and can block contact from adults they dont already know myspace says it hasnt yet found a solution for the attorney generals request for age verification "weve spoken to a number of companies and we have not yet found a firm or technology that can reliably verify the age of our members under " mr nigam says privately news corp officials and others in the industry say that age verification is difficult to implement for kids under the age of because they often lack a drivers license or other government issued identification it can be done with parental permission slips but its not always easy to verify the relationship between a parent and a child and myspace could be legally liable for mistakes zephyr would put the burden on parents to monitor whether their children are lying about their ages a favorite gambit of some kids who like to assume other identities on social networking sites parents are also often concerned that children will provide too much real information that could make them easy prey for kidnappers or molesters the idea is to "give parents a tool to force a discussion with their kid " mr nigam says myspace has to tread a delicate line to keep the spirit of its web site intact while continuing to add safety features the company says it is confident that the software wont alienate teen users because it isnt reporting on the teens activities only about the features that any myspace user could see on a teens myspace profile mr nigam adds that many teens also have said they want greater protection on the site "our teens have told us that being safe on our site doesnt mean they are no longer cool " adds mr nigam in the meantime myspace officials have been discussing zephyr with others in the internet industry and facing much skepticism in december myspace demonstrated the program to the leading internet companies including google inc yahoo inc microsoft inc and time warner inc s aol at a meeting at the national center for missing and exploited children in washington d c the meeting was filled with tough questions says ernie allen president and chief executive of the center who worries that parents wont use the software since only percent of parents currently use internet blocking or monitoring software myspace demonstrated a system that works as follows a parent can download the free software onto his or her home computers the software will identify any user who logs onto myspace from those computers and collect his or her user name age and hometown that information will be stored on the hard drive and parents actually whoever has the administrative privileges on that computer can access it using a password that information is also publicly available to anyone who visits myspaces web site but many parents have trouble locating their kids profile pages because kids often dont use their real names the software will not monitor the myspace users movements or email but it will "tag" the profile and report back to the parent if the user name age or hometown have been changed the software will collect this information about anyone who logs onto myspace from the home computer so it could collect information about a childs friends as well as the child one big issue at the meeting was whether myspaces software would violate the privacy of users other social networking sites have more restrictive privacy rules than myspace not allowing anyone to see a users age or location for example another concern was that the software could be used by people other than parents to monitor the myspace usage on their computers still another issue is whether it will be easy to opt out myspace says that people who log onto myspace from a computer that has the software installed will be notified but myspace says it still hasnt been decided whether users will have a chance to quit myspace before their profile is tagged by the software such concerns have led some companies to decline to join myspaces efforts including college oriented social networking web site facebook which had million unique visitors in december and the blogging site xanga which had million unique visitors in december according to comscore media metrix "based on what weve been told xanga cannot participate because doing so would require xanga to share private consumer data with any third party who downloaded the software in violation of our privacy policy " says stephen kline chief safety officer of xanga facebooks chief privacy officer chris kelly says that myspaces approach is "inconsistent with our privacy architecture " unlike myspace profiles which can be viewed by anybody on the web facebook only allows its profiles to be viewed by people the member has specified as friends colleagues or schoolmates or associates through another network google yahoo microsoft and aol havent yet said whether they will sign onto the myspace initiative but people close to those companies caution that each has their own safety and security initiatives that are higher priority yahoo for instance provides parental controls for millions of subscribers to internet services that use yahoos technology "giving parents the ability to block access to content is much more important than just reporting that their children have been seeing content " says yahoo spokesman jim cullinan " so far it looks unlikely that the new software will appease the attorneys general north carolina attorney general roy cooper who co chairs the group with mr blumenthal says myspaces software "notifies the parent too late at best its after the child has offered his age at worst its when hes already left to meet a child predator " larry magid author of myspace unraveled and a web site blogsafety com says myspaces software seems like an important step but he cautions "there is no tool that will solve the problem of parents not taking an interest in what their kids are doing on the internet "
