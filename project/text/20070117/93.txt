petraeus time can one back president bushs new strategy in iraq yes for all its serious faults his new approach is the first one since the fall of baghdad to offer a chance to reverse the radicalization of iraq but it needs revision quickly too much of this new plan leaves unchanged the disastrous approach of john abizaid and george casey the two top generals on iraq the new offensive assuming it doesnt peter out through a slow arrival of soldiers or become enfeebled by "iraqi leadership" in its execution envisions a too small u s force doing too much recent remarks by defense secretary robert gates predicting troop reductions within a year and saying that we might not need an additional five brigades in baghdad for a successful operation are a frightening echo of the self defeating undermanned optimism that came from the u s military under mr gatess predecessor the good news is that by emphasizing a military not political strategy to diminish iraqs debilitating violence the president has correctly set aside one of the primary factors destroying the shiite arab center while waiting for a "political solution" to the sunni insurgency we watched shiite timidity and patience turn to anger and to a revenge which now threatens the integrity of the shiite led iraqi government gens abizaid and casey had gambled that they could stand up an effective iraqi military and police against the sunnis before violence threatened everything in baghdad that bet collapsed with the destruction of the shiite shrine in samarra in february but the administration kept playing the same hand as if nothing had happened the reversal of this soft power politics not troops mentality is an essential step forward still david petraeus who will succeed gen casey as the overall boss in iraq and who is one of americas finest most adaptable commanders may have to perform a miracle to compensate for this shortfall in manpower especially if the required five brigades for baghdad take months to arrive and if washington allows the offensive to move forward before he is even in charge the president can pre empt these lethal problems by ensuring gen petraeuss rapid arrival in iraq and by allowing him to determine how many soldiers he needs nevertheless there is a dismaying hesitancy in the militarys and the white houses deliberations on this conflict although the president wants a new approach the pentagon the state department and even the national security council appear wedded to the past the contradiction between what the president says and what his government does has never been greater we need to move rapidly the enemy is digging in and the drift to full scale civil war is gaining speed the administration needs to rethink its understanding of iraqi culture and politics as the "new" strategy still contains ideas that have catastrophically guided american officials in the green zone ever since sunni arab insurgents started killing americans in significant numbers u s officials still believe they must soon see sectarian reconciliation a reversal of de baathification and a nonsectarian equitable distribution of oil wealth all these achievements are meant to placate the aggrieved sunni arabs who represent of the population but no one knows how many sunni arabs sympathize with their brethren whove been killing shia it certainly seemed like a very large number before the shiites started counterattacking through their militias the statements of iraqi sunni arab organizations the coverage of the iraqi sunni press and the regions sunni arab media which often quotes and echoes the opinions of iraqi sunnis suggest strongly that there is substantial communitarian support for both domestic and foreign suicide bombers for the serious ex baathists sunni supremacists and iraqi sunni fundamentalists the lethal hardcore of the insurgency its still a good bet that theyre not into democratic negotiations they probably dont think much at all about an equitable distribution of oil revenues or wanting their jobs back in the new armys officer corps de baathification for the shiites and the sunnis is really about only one thing the army but from the moment the u s started building a more representative iraqi military in there was no way in hell the old baathist sunni officer corps could come back and now with the shiites killing sunnis even the most enlightened of the proscribed baathist officers this isnt a large group know that return would be suicide no one knows how many sunni arabs would turn against their uncompromising murderous brethren and align themselves with shiites if the right "deal" were struck its a very good guess that such men if they exist in any number would get mowed down by their radical compatriots if the u s and iraqi governments are going to bring peace to the "sunni triangle " they must break the back of the insurgency a minority used to the prerogatives of a communitarian dictatorship the sunnis have been trying to derail the new iraq they must come to know that they will lose everything if they dont abandon violence as their principal political tool they must know that if they choose to cease their violent opposition they will not be murdered for doing so this means as it has always meant a combined american and shiite iraqi occupation of major sunni arab cities if the sunni community hasnt hopelessly gone into a dominance or death opposition then it could still come to its senses provided the violent hardcore among them is neutralized and the shiites and the kurds allow them sufficient access to oil wealth shiite death squads have certainly taught the sunnis of baghdad that there are worse things than infidel u s troops in their neighborhoods baghdad is the first step and as retired general jack keane and the military historian frederick kagan have been pointing out restoring security in baghdad will take at least months and all the troops the president pledged to quote gen keane "we need all five brigades in baghdad as soon as possible it will take three to four months to clear neighborhoods of death squads and insurgents and at least the rest of the year to establish proper security for the population " this is going to be a long hard slog and the americans not the iraqis are going to have to lead it the presidents stated contention that prime minister nouri al malikis army and police will lead efforts to cleanse the city while the americans just support them will produce dismal results mr malikis pride doesnt win battles george bush has been fond of underscoring the counterinsurgency success in tal afar in which the iraqi army played an important supporting role if gen petraeus is really put into a supporting role in the battle of baghdad then weve lost already gen petraeus will have to deal with muqtada al sadr the thuggish son of iraqs most revered clerical family he has become for many shiites in baghdad a rapturously praised defender this esteem is merited he not any american general increased the security of the average shiite in the capital and if he is smart hell attack the americans before they have the chance to deploy much new strength if the americans successfully down sunni insurgents in the capital then they will go after mr sadr but the u s military should absolutely not go after mr sadr first we may barely have sufficient forces to handle a one front war against sunni insurgents and holy warriors we need to show the shiite community which by no means has embraced mr sadrs radicalism en masse that the battle of baghdads primary thrust isnt against the capitals large shiite ghetto the key here is how shiites view the first encounter if it goes against the insurgents then a subsequent attack on mr sadr and his militia might not provoke a large scale uprising and he just may play along he and his forces were mauled by the americans in since then they havent been particularly bold in attacking u s soldiers mr sadr has recently manifested some statesmen like behavior and has been more correct in his behavior toward grand ayatollah ali sistani the spiritual guide of iraqs shia and a bulwark of moderation yet washington ought to plan on mr sadr hitting u s forces another reason why gen petraeus who appears acutely sensitive to the sadr conundrum should be given as many brigades as the u s can rapidly pull together wars are often decided by one battle where the genius and resources of one commander proves decisive we are undoubtedly at that point in iraq the bush administration should ensure that gen petraeus has everything he needs and that any opposition inside the military to him and a larger longer counterinsurgency campaign is squelched america and iraq probably wont get a second chance mr gerecht is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute
