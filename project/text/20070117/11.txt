as disk drives reach new milestone flash gains new currency each measurement of one mile is like any other so there is no particular reason that one particular turn of a cars odometer wheel say from to should be as much fun as it is to watch but some are just like in the computer industry which just observed a remarkable century milestone of its own earlier this month disk drive maker hitachi announced that it would soon be shipping a terabyte capacity disk drive seagate another big drive maker quickly followed with its own announcement a terabyte is actually gigabytes the pc on your desk probably has or so gigabytes in it the biggest ipod nano has eight gigabytes the new top of the line terabyte drives are expected to cost around &# at first in other words what top of the line disk drives have lately tended to cost regardless of capacity the last time the disk drive crossed such a threshold was in when the first gigabyte drives were introduced back then all that people used computers for was actual work spreadsheets and such and it was hard to imagine why anyone would need so much storage news accounts noted that a gigabyte would store copies of "gone with the wind " without ever explaining why you would want to those first gigabyte drives were priced in the neighborhood of &# which on a cost per byte basis is times as expensive as the latest model even though not many people are expected to buy them at least initially its not as hard to explain what someone would do with a terabyte drive record a lot of tv shows and movies television especially high definition tv is the savior of the disk drive industry because it requires vast amounts of storage a terabyte gets you hours of hd programming sopranos super bowls whatever the makers of digital video recorders and set top boxes are adding bigger capacity disk drives to their units some of them are also finally starting to allow their users to attach external drives easily adding extra capacity on their own without having to replace the whole unit dish networks for instance will in the spring allow an external drive to be connected to its high definition dvrs via a computer style usb connection video and music much of it of illegal provenance is the engine of the converging computer and consumer electronics industries but when it comes to storage disk drives dont have the field to themselves in fact one of the most heated bits of competition in the computer industry is between the disk drive and flash memory industries flash is the solid state memory found in usb thumb drives with no moving parts its considered more rugged than disk drives which have rapidly spinning platters and much more but flash drives dont have the enormous capacity of disk drives the biggest flash drives on the market right now are in the eight to gigabyte range they are also compared with disk drives very expensive the gigabyte of data that would cost you cents to store on the latest big disk drive or cents on the gig drive at compusa that with rebates comes to &# would require in the neighborhood of &# if saved to flash but flash is getting cheap enough and capacious enough to be used in many markets that disk drive makers had wanted to keep for themselves notably cellphones and digital cameras tiny disk drives some not much bigger than your thumb have been engineered for these gadgets for example apple picked flash not disk drives for its new iphone as an example of flash economics the company announced two iphone models priced at &# and &# with the former being more expensive almost entirely because it will have four more gigabytes of flash the disk drive industry is fighting back making for example more rugged drives that can detect sudden motion and briefly suspend operations at last weeks consumer electronics show seagate showed a new drive attached to a skateboard while a tony hawk figure put it through its paces prices for both disk drives and flash are in the usual state of constant decline perhaps slightly more so with flash so that a year from now the same amount of money is likely to buy you twice as much storage flash drives of and gigabytes are expected this year the half gig drives that were top of the line just a few years ago are being phased out of manufacturing as flash closes in on gigabytes the next milestone for hard disk drives is the petabyte or a thousand terabytes "peta" is greek for fifth a petabyte is to the fifth power as well as fifth in line after kilo mega giga and tera petabytes sound like an absurdly large amount of storage who needs to keep a quarter of a million hours of video in their set top box especially if faster internet connections will allow you to stream video from someplace else whenever you want to watch something but a terabyte had an impossible everest like feeling to it not too long ago come back in years and lets talk email me at lee gomes wsj com corrections &amp amplifications the mathematical quantity of a petabyte is the equivalent of to the th power the figure was incorrectly described as to the fifth power in the portals column on jan wsj march
