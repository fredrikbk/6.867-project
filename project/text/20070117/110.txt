rogue gallery rome italy has been trying for over six months to conclude an agreement with los angeless getty museum on ancient works of art that were illicitly removed from our country i still hope to succeed but on one point i am unable to understand the museums position how can they think that the italian government will accept an agreement that contemplates renouncing possession of those works of art this is impossible certainly the world has changed some decades ago i knew decent people who were resigned to the idea that important masterpieces excavated illegally in italy or other countries could still be unlawfully exported and exhibited in important museums their thinking was well when all is said and done we dont even have enough space in our own museums perhaps theyll look after them better abroad and spread some understanding of archaeology and art since the mid s the archaeological institute of america has taken an extremely firm stance against suspicious purchases of ancient finds many american museums have adopted strict rules of conduct in this field in recent months two great museums the boston museum of fine arts and the new york metropolitan museum of art have returned works that were removed from our country and whose restitution was requested by us many other institutions some private and not only american are doing the same the boston museum of fine arts returned the requested pieces even before signing an agreement with the italian government this collaboration will lead to scientific discovery and already offers benefits to the museum a splendid eirene from rome for example is on exhibition in boston thanks to a long term loan it is perhaps the most beautiful of similar works that we recovered it is thus truly surprising that the getty museum despite having received exhaustive and reliable documentation months ago from our technicians archaeologists legal experts and investigators from the carabinieri is still taking its time among these documents in fact are many photographs of works that were taken in the storerooms of art traffickers some years ago and that are exhibited at the getty museum today the international community hailed the italo swiss agreement signed last october as a successful approach to completely stamp out the trafficking of our archaeological heritage italy has some defects and there remains a lot of work to do but in recent years the country has learned to make much better use of its cultural heritage during the seven years when i was mayor of rome we reopened and built from scratch museums and display areas in the "eternal city " today we want to improve our services for tourists as well as their enjoyment of our extraordinary art and history we know that to make our museums more beautiful as well as our towns villages piazze splendid monuments and the italian countryside is a duty of civility and hospitality which comes long before that of national pride this is not a "political battle" with the getty museum the works that we are waiting for include the venus illicitly removed from morgantina in sicily and the bronze athlete that was hauled up in a fishing net from the waters of the adriatic sea and later secretly smuggled out of italy in total violation of its laws paradoxically museum founder john paul getty declared before his death that he did not want to acquire that work without official certification and clear title this is not a legal question but a question of ethics it is a matter of transparency in relations with the public and correct behavior in the antiquities market italy will be ready when it receives the full cooperation of the getty museum to embark on a program of long term scientific collaboration the getty museum stands to benefit from this cooperation so why does it continue to exhibit works of art that rightfully belong to italy mr rutelli is deputy prime minister of italy and minister for cultural heritage
