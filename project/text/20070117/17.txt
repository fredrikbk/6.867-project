boss talk welcome to my world nba commissioner stern gets kudos for expansion but has share of problems during his nearly years as commissioner of the national basketball association david stern has turned a once fringe league with drug and financial problems into a global brand a feat that has earned him wide admiration lately though the manager nobody questioned is getting some second guessing the most recent example was the leagues decision to switch to a new synthetic basketball without consulting players the league reversed itself last month after some players complained the new ball was hard to grip and was cutting their hands and regular season and playoff viewership has trended downward since mr stern continues to get kudos for the nbas efforts to use emerging technologies to reach more fans as well as the leagues overseas expansion in china the nba has sponsorship deals with companies both u s and foreign and its games and other programming are carried on tv stations up from last year about of the leagues &# billion in total revenue now comes from foreign tv contracts merchandising and licensing in a wide ranging interview mr stern spoke about everything from the nbas internet strategy to his relationship with gadfly dallas mavericks owner mark cuban excerpts wsj its often been said that when brawls break out on the court in the nba everybody makes a big deal out of it even though other sports frequently have fights among players why mr stern my own take is the burden of the fans being so close to the stands because of the spectacular view of our game from courtside which is the closest to the action of any game and its replicated by a camera and increasingly by high def the prospect of players in any shape or form crossing the barrier between them and the fans thats a problem that we have and no one else has wsj do you believe it also might have something to do with racial attitudes in this country that the nba is judged more harshly for that reason mr stern well i choose not to dwell on it but you may be on to something we were the first sport to be identified as black and despite the fact that the starters in other sports like football could be equally percentage wise black our guys are visible out there we can see them they dont come encumbered by hat helmet long sleeves and pants you just touched on the global conversation which is the role of race and certainly i would not be fully honest if i didnt say its always there in some shape or form wsj youre in a sport that heavily markets individual players doesnt that make you more vulnerable if these players act out mr stern you know i guess i can take either credit or blame for that but it doesnt really happen that way its the allure of celebrity marketing abc and espn study their audiences and they know that you get a bigger rise if you say "watch steve nash and dirk nowitzki former teammates reunite " we dont tell nike to spend hundreds of millions of dollars using our athletes and we like that by the way to sell their shoes the only time teams are mentioned is when jay leno makes fun of the clippers wsj youve been more aggressive than any other league marketing the nba internationally particularly in china talk about your progress mr stern nba is by far the no searched sports term on chinese search engine baidu com according to baidu wsj do you envision involvement in a chinese league mr stern yes its our plan to address china with a separate enterprise called nba china well have some investors that may be outside of the nba that may be strategic investors and that will have the right to start a league in china wsj whats the next international market after china mr stern its a problem because the answer is every place we sent a large contingent to india that had meetings the indian basketball federation is looking for support to grow the game and its finding itself overwhelmed with kids being interested its not that were going to go start a league there but theres the same kind of work to be done in india that we began doing in china in wsj back home when you look at additional ways to generate revenue what are your plans with streaming video mr stern i would say weve elected to idle rather than accelerate because we have to work a little bit harder for our tv deals we have four point some odd billion dollars worth of television deals currently in place and its actually &# billion total when you include the regional sports networks our network revenue and our over the air revenue is so important to us that weve moved a little bit more slowly with respect to alternate distribution technologies because we are never quite sure of the impact on existing revenue streams wsj the national football league has been creating some controversy by putting some games exclusively on its own network which is available in a limited number of homes because the nfl wants it to be carried on basic cable as opposed to a separate group of channels or "tier" that cost extra what is your approach with nba tv mr stern we made the judgment that we could live on a sports tier if the cable industry ever got its act together and marketed the sports tiers in the right way the cable industry hadnt made its mind up yet about sports tiers no matter what they say so they havent gone full hog doing it but to the extent that nfl is on a tier along with nba tennis fighting you name it i believe that ultimately there will be an aggregation of enough subscribers to make that a very profitable place to be located i mean weve held our price get a very healthy rate for nba tv and were in about or million homes wsj in most leagues including the nba cable is now broadcasting more games than the networks are we going to reach the point soon where you wont see any nba games on network tv mr stern the networks may be down to a share or a share and cable has done a good job of saying okay were at and theyre at but cable networks themselves their ratings and viewership are lower so if you want to get to large audiences with your advertising messages the networks will still be delivering big events of some type wsj is there a lesson from the ball incident mr stern the management lesson of that is listen to your employees our players have played with a composite ball in high school college and international leagues maybe it wasnt sold as well as it couldve been the public has spoken we have misstepped we didnt listen to our employees and we have owned up to our own failures wsj how extensively did spalding the maker of the ball test the ball before it was used in nba games mr stern it was tested to a degree the management lesson is episodic micromanagement is underrated wsj in september eight nba owners wrote you a letter in which they advocated more revenue to be transferred from large market teams to small market teams what was your reaction mr stern their concerns are valid and are being dealt with we have additional revenue assistance based upon a committees report our franchise valuations are going through the roof so the capital markets dont agree with the very owners who are saying that and by the way those very owners dont agree with it either based upon what they either just paid for their franchises or theyre trying to sell them for wsj it seems like the leagues relationship with the players union has gotten testier during the last few seasons is that the case mr stern our relationships pretty good with them this became a great issue for them the ball so let them run with it they were on weaker ground with "respect for the game" rules where we began enforcing a more stringent code to stop complaining to the referees if you wanted to be machiavellian you could tie the two together we dont want our players viewed as a bunch of complainers it isnt good for their health or ours wsj how many nba teams are profitable mr stern we have lots of teams that arent profitable and the last one just sold for &# million what a bunch of unsophisticated buyers eh laughter isnt it share price for shareholder value we have shares in the dallas mavericks expansion club went for &# million dollars and in the charlotte bobcats sold for &# million cash of course then its owner promptly signed the september letter think about that ok welcome to my world wsj teams like new orleans and memphis have struggled to justify themselves as nba cities do you think those teams will stay put mr stern if you ask me that as the mayor of memphis the answer is absolutely youve committed to us you built a building the city is supporting us and were going to support you barring some event that we hope doesnt occur there new orleans is a bit more problematic its got five years to run out its lease were supporting it in sales ways so that we can make it into a commercial success weve got our own people working with the team but its a tough place we had an owner who says new orleans it is you cant even buy me out im going there and we had a group of his partners who said ok partner new orleans it is so new orleans it was so now weve got five years to go on a lease in new orleans and were going back to fulfill our obligations hopefully be there forever wsj how do you compete with a global sport like soccer overseas mr stern we have countries covered in languages and all we need is a couple of more kids out of every hundred bouncing the ball rather than kicking it on an annual basis wsj would you like to have more guys like the mavericks mr cuban mr stern people forget ted turner was mark cuban before mark cuban was mark cuban and hes delightful you know dallas its a hot building some hot fans they all believe that he lives eats and breathes the team which he does you need a certain thickness of epidermis to deal and be dealt with and as long as youve tried to raise your own kids you can deal with almost anybody wsj he makes it sound like you never listen to him mr stern that would not be accurate but it doesnt pay for me to do anything other than to close the door and say david youre bigger than that and just go about my business he is a master at communications wsj what can you say about las vegas as a potential nba city mr stern the best hotel stock the best shows the best restaurants the best shopping just one little problem it has sports betting and we told mayor oscar goodman our close personal friend also a lawyer that if he took the game off the line that we would consider las vegas for all star weekend we also told him that if theyll take the nba off the line that well consider las vegas for an nba team wsj but isnt taking the nba off the line hard for them mr stern philosophically not economically the betting on nba is minuscule compared to other sports that shall remain nameless but are very violent and are played on sundays
