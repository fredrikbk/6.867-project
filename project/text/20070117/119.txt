shares of australias santos fight through oil price slide well disaster tiny rebound faces test as firm awaits bill for the cleanup perth australia lower crude oil prices have pricked the share price bubble of many oil producers in the past six months but australias santos has fared worse than most the slide has coincided with an environmental disaster at its partly owned banjar panji gas well in east java indonesia which has been spewing hot volcanic mud for more than seven months since july when the scale of the incident became apparent shares in santos adelaide australia have slipped more than hitting a month low of australian dollars us&# on jan yesterday they shed australian cents to close at a&# investors and analysts arent sure whether a small rebound last week was the start of a turnaround santos australias no oil and gas producer behind woodside petroleum and bhp billiton looks low priced compared with many energy companies but nobody knows how much the mudflow which has displaced people and may keep going for years will ultimately cost abn amro analyst aiden bradley who has a hold rating on santos says there is value in the stock but uncertainty about the indonesian disaster keeps him from rating it a buy "it could drag on as other environmental liabilities in the oil industry have done for numerous years " he says "is this something that could turn out to be a a&# billion exposure for santos it is a slim chance but people just dont know " santos which has a nonoperating interest in banjar panji has set aside a&# million in provisions for its share of cleanup and other costs it based this calculation on an october estimate by well operator and owner lapindo brantas of indonesia that total rectification costs may be us&# million indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono last month said lapindo must pay trillion rupiah us&# million to cover the cleanup and compensation for victims of the disaster santos has yet to receive official confirmation of the presidential estimate the origin of the mudflow which may have contributed to a fatal east java gas pipeline explosion in november hasnt been determined "were not commenting on the cause of the incident as a police investigation is under way into the conduct of the drilling undertaken by the operator " a santos spokesman says santos says it has "appropriate" insurance in place but it wont disclose what the policy limits are the banjar panji situation capped a frustrating year for santos chief executive john ellice flint who has targeted indonesia as a growth avenue since his appointment six years ago separate from the mudflow incident santos recently downgraded reserves at its jeruk oil find off the coast of java on its home turf santos has faced questions about its acquisition plans last month santos learned that its hostile a&# million takeover offer for queensland gas of brisbane australia might be derailed by the target companys selling a stake to retailer agl energy if the bid does lapse it will mark santoss second failed acquisition in the past year after its offer for oil and gas producer delhi petroleum was trumped by beach petroleum ubs analyst gordon ramsay put a reduce rating with a month price target of a&# on santos in november because of concerns about jeruk and potentially higher mudflow costs mr ramsay wants more detail on santoss liquefied natural gas expansion plans following the start up in of the conocophillips operated bayu undan lng plant in darwin santos is a minority partner in the million metric tons a year venture but could play a larger role if conocophillips approves a long proposed expansion abn amros mr bradley says he agrees that lng is a growth option his santos month target price of a&# includes a&# a share for a second lng processing facility at darwin even though the joint venture partners havent approved the expansion mr bradley also says santos could lift its share market value by as much as by separating its australian gas business from the higher risk international projects investors dont like santoss "suboptimal" mix of slim margin domestic production based on its moomba gas hub in central australia combined with higher risk lng and international assets "it is like combining a utility with an exploration company it doesnt work " mr bradley says santos also is constrained by legislation in its home state of south australia that limits the shareholding of a single investor to enacted in the late s to obstruct corporate raiders the ceiling removes the possibility of any "takeover premium" developing in santos shares so far the south australia government has refused to scrap the restriction mr bradley believes splitting santos up leaving the domestic company capped at individual ownership and an international unit with no shareholding limits would get around the issue rob patterson who helps manage a&# billion at adelaide based fund manager argo investments agrees the shareholding cap is "probably past its use " argo recently topped up its santos stake as the stock appeared inexpensive and "we thought the risk reward ratio was worthwhile "but it is still not without risk given the uncertainty of the mudflow outcome " mr patterson says another fund maple brown abbott has been a net buyer and last month reported a holding but some analysts arent convinced santos is worth buying deutsche bank has a sell rating with a price target of a&# it believes the call is "appropriate" given the mudflow uncertainty a jan report says citigroup says the market has overreacted to banjar panji "we maintain our buy recommendation as other aspects of the business perform well " it said last month referring to exploration results in vietnam and australia shares fall
