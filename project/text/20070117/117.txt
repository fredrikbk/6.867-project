the daily fix boggan cowboys prevail in a wild win over texas this is one of those simple sports mornings youre either talking about it or you missed it "it " in this case would be th ranked oklahoma states triple overtime thriller of a win over st ranked texas texas led by one with seconds left after kevin durants three point play but the cowboys mario boggan took an inbound pass near midcourt fought his way through the defense and launched a three pointer from the left wing and that wasnt even the best play of the game an honor that should go to byron eatons saving a loose ball from going out of bounds and hurling it in for a three pointer that just beat the shot clock espn has highlights here if you can endure the slings and arrows of registering for the oklahoman read berry tramels take "old gallagher iba arena has seen many a thing in its years but its never seen anything like this mario boggan not the best player on the court but the heartiest capped a game that will last as long as they tell stories about the basketball played in the storied campus barn boggan and texas freshman kevin durant didnt guard each other but maybe they should have super mario finished with points and rebounds in minutes super rookie finished with points and rebounds in minutes and it was every bit as exciting as it sounds " on cbs sportsline gary parrish has some sympathy for andre agassi andre agassi "poor guy was just sitting there with a film crew in front of him waiting to do a live interview on television during the networks australian open coverage " he explains "and when i say just sitting there i mean just sitting there for an hour while texas and oklahoma state went back and forth in a game so good i half expected a player to propose to a cheerleader " the game mr parrish writes "was what makes college hoops wonderful there were great players making great plays for two great programs and when that gets mixed with a great crowd and national television audience what you get is well what you get is one of the great american tennis players in history being put on hold " from the this might not be a good idea department sammy sosa is close to a non guaranteed deal with the texas rangers the team he broke in with back in it wasnt much of an arrival mr sosa hit with one dinger in games and was traded to the chicago white sox rangers hitting coach rudy jaramillo believes telling the chicago tribunes phil rogers that mr sosa still has bat speed and has regained his swing after some mechanical tinkering "jaramillo who once managed sosa in rookie ball knows all about the baggage sosa carries " mr rogers writes "he watched the gradual decline that led the cubs to trade him to baltimore for jerry hairston jr and two guys with faint pulses then saw sosa firsthand during the season that sent him into retirement he knows all about the whispers of how odd it was that sosa was reduced to warning track power when baseball started testing for steroids yet in that batting cage about a month away from the start of spring training jaramillo said he saw enough to convince him that sosa still can drive the ball well enough to be a contributor to a contending team " muhammad ali turns today leading dave anderson of the new york times to ponder one of the champs many boasts "when i go the gamell go to the graveyard " "boxing still has its health in some of the lower weight classes but the heavyweight division that ali ruled is in intensive care " mr anderson writes "with four obscure heavyweight champions decreed by four obscure governing bodies there is no one familiar champion if those four supposed titleholders marched through times square few if anybody would recognize any of them or even know any of their names but if ali even in his dull mask of parkinsons disease were to appear there today on his th birthday he would stop traffic happy birthday champ you were correct " the nfc and afc championship games pitting respectively the new orleans saints against the chicago bears and the indianapolis colts against the new england patriots are still a couple of days off but josh levin and three other writers from slate are having entirely too much fun predicting wholl win and agonizing over it the latest installment comes from mr levin a saints fan who calms his jitters by grousing quite entertainingly about the san diego chargers mistakes and the consequent extension of the pats dynasty even if he thinks ample history be darned that the colts are about to end that dynasty "im still strangely tickled about the been there done that patriots colts afc championship game aka brady vs manning xli " he writes "even with his look at me school of play calling and his seeming desire to become the ron popeil of the nfl theres still a place in my heart for peyton manning watching the usually infallible manning try to figure out bill belichicks defenses has been like watching a really smart toddler try to put together a piece jigsaw puzzle he didnt get it done the first time around or the second time or the eighth time but i have a feeling this time will be the charm " benny parsons the nascar champion veteran announcer and much loved ambassador for the sport died yesterday of complications from cancer n c he was in the south florida sun sentinel ed hinton recalls the oct finale of bps championship season a day that sounds like something from a feel good movie "only laps into the american at rockingham n c parsons was caught up in another drivers crash " mr hinton writes "the right side of his car was demolished crewmen back then were a ruthless brawling cheating lot willing to do anything and everything other than kill somebody to win the championship recalled junior johnson car owner for cale yarborough who was battling parsons for the title but after parsons car was towed back to the garage area apparently a total loss there occurred a phenomenon never seen before or since in nascar without a word crusty crewmen from virtually every other team converged on the wreckage they all worked together to patch up parsons car just enough that he could return to the track and complete enough laps to clinch the championship " mr parsons won just one of that seasons races trailing david pearson richard petty and cale yarborough but he won nonetheless because the points system was then based in part on miles run in matt kenseth had a similar championship season winning just one race out of which prompted changes to the points system veteran associated press writer mike harris recalls mr parsons sympathy for mr kenseth part of an appreciation that begins with bps kindness to a green sportswriter "i never knew anybody who met the humble man from rural north carolina without becoming his friend at least in bennys mind " mr harris writes "and by the way despite looking more like a friendly store clerk or school teacher he was a pretty good driver too although youd never know it from most of the stories he told " "benny parsons life was a mosaic of kindnesses " writes david poole in the charlotte observer "from helping young drivers like bill elliott and greg biffle get their footholds in nascar to pulling a wagon loaded with fresh strawberries through the garage during daytona testing handing them out with a smile and a handshake like some kind of pied piper you got so used to seeing ol bp do nice things you almost stopped noticing now hes gone " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well
