woes mount at europes bid for gps rival brussels a little more than a year ago the european space agency launched the first satellite for galileo a multibillion euro effort by europe to improve upon the u s s global positioning system and build a business for its aerospace and satellite industries but today the program seems to be turning into a financial and political black hole costs have ballooned bickering has broken out over which country will get the systems command center and the projects biggest backers concede they dont know how it will make money "i dont think revenues are very well sorted out yet they say they will somehow get paying customers but thats tricky " said andr malm an analyst at swedish research firm berg insight who has studied the market for satellite navigation systems he said the bickering among countries and its uncertain finances could make galileo a major political problem "galileo would be good for european society it could potentially be a business but its difficult there are risks " he said like the global positioning system or gps galileo is planned to be a network of satellites orbiting earth that will beam radio signals to receiving devices on the ground helping users anywhere in the world pinpoint their locations galileo is expected to have more satellites than the gps compared with the gpss allowing users more precisely to fix their locations galileos backers said users of its free service will be able to fix their locations within about three feet versus the gpss foot accuracy the project also has won the support of a number of other countries including china india and brazil most of which are seeking an alternative to the u s system and potentially trying to develop their own the chinese government for example plans to invest about million euros &# million in the program mainly to "strengthen ties between the eu and china" as it prepares to build its own system according to an official at chinas mission to the european union who deals with the matter unlike the gps which was developed by the u s military during the cold war and is still run by the air force galileo will be built and operated by private companies and agencies galileos supporters said this will make the system more reliable because it wont be shut down in the case of a security emergency the u s military has never shut down the gps signal since it was opened for civilian use in for all its promise galileo has myriad problems only one satellite has been launched in december the second satellite missed its initial fall launch date after it short circuited during final testing it is now set for launch sometime this year despite the setback the eu said it hopes to have all satellites in orbit by the end of the estimated cost of developing the system has soared far beyond the initial estimate of million euros and is now projected at billion euros the cost overruns are due to increased security to prevent breakdowns software upgrades rising labor and marketing costs and two additional test satellites needed to check the frequencies galileo will use eu officials have said that estimate may be too optimistic because the smaller gps cost about billion to design euros build and launch according to abi research an oyster bay n y technology research firm that consults for the aerospace and defense industries and has worked on the galileo and gps networks another problem a plan to have the private sector provide most of the financing is in tatters with galileos private partners still unwilling to invest in the project without a clear vision of how they will get a return under the plan european taxpayers are supposed to cover the initial billion euro cost of designing and building the satellites after that a consortium of eight european aerospace and defense companies communications device makers and satellite manufacturing companies astrium the satellite unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co inmarsat plc thales sa teleop finmeccanica spa aena hispasat sa and alcatel lucents alcatel space are expected to invest two thirds of the billion euros needed to launch the satellites taxpayers will cover the remaining third the consortium which was formed in and is based in toulouse france but still hasnt come up with a name or nominated a chief executive also is supposed to bear galileos operational costs once up and running with the project slated to cover its costs within six or seven years but a year funding contract set to be signed by the eight companies in hasnt been finalized peter marchlewski who was general counselor of the galileo joint undertaking until he retired in december said no new deadline exists to secure the companies backing none of the companies from the consortium returned calls requesting comment assuming galileo does become operational the eu expects it to cost million euros a year to operate the gps network with fewer satellites costs about million euros a year to operate according to the air force suggesting the eu also may be underestimating the operating costs european commission transport spokesman michele cercone said galileos final tab may well exceed estimates "only once negotiations are concluded will it be possible to clearly understand whether galileo will cost more than current estimates " he said those talks are continuing and eu officials said they hope to conclude them this year no one is sure whether galileo will be able to generate revenue let alone turn a profit only galileos base signal will be free to the public galileo will try to raise revenue by selling signals that will be accurate up to a few centimeters to paying customers mr marchlewski says but persuading airlines shipping companies and civil engineering groups they should pay for the extra precision will be tough industry officials said "our position is that its not really clear at this point that we need this paid service we already have gps free and we will have galileo free of charge and for now those are sufficient " said vincent de vroey general manager for technical operations for the association of european airlines in brussels which represents more than european airlines if revenue from industry doesnt come through european taxpayers will end up footing the bill for the system for several years mr marchlewski said far from uniting europeans galileo also looks set to divide them as new entrants into the eu argue with france and other countries about where to locate galileos command center galileos central agency the gnss supervisory authority doesnt have a headquarters and still operates out of the european commissions brussels offices galileos first satellite was launched from kazakhstan which is where the european space agency based in paris says it plans to launch the second satellite as well the czech republic wants its capital prague to host the center other cities hoping to be chosen include ljubljana in slovenia and valletta in malta western european countries led by france have resisted these pleas arguing that for security reasons the system should be near the center of european decision making "prague meets all security criteria for galileo " said jan vytopil spokesman for the czech republics mission to the eu adding czech leaders expect their counterparts in "old" europe to adhere to a compromise and let "new" european countries host new agencies the european commission said it hopes to settle the headquarters dispute this year
