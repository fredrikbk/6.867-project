jazzs history is living in queens no book on jazz history that ive seen includes the deeply rooted living history of this music in the borough of queens in new york city years ago i interviewed lester young "president of the tenor saxophone" in his home there and ive visited the louis armstrong home a national landmark administered by queens college and the armstrong archives at queens college but until recently i had no idea of the scores of jazz makers who have lived in queens and those who have died there the list is longer than this article but among them count basie bix beiderbecke dizzy gillespie and louis armstrong close neighbors and friends ella fitzgerald john coltrane woody herman jimmy rushing julian "cannonball" adderley "fats" waller james p johnson jimmy heath and tony spargo he was a member of the white new orleans original jazz band that in made the first jazz recording the fount of this research finally aligning queens with new orleans chicago manhattan and other storied centers of jazz is the flushing council on culture and the arts in flushing town hall its regular tours of "the queens jazz trail" include a large illustrated map of the icons and their addresses over the years the lively map is the creation of marc miller who has written a page guide that is further animated by tour conductor toby knight a singer with the chords a doo wop band mr miller tells of john coltrane tutoring children and teenagers in his st albans queens neighborhood who showed musical promise and he tells of a pivotal s evening in jazz history when benny goodman first jammed with pianist teddy wilson at a party in the forest hills queens home of red norvo and mildred bailey the goodman trio was birthed that night one of the first and the most historic racially integrated groups to play in public there had been integrated after hours jamming for years before mr miller has found that the first jazz community in queens was formed by clarence williams a successful record producer music publisher and entrepreneur who in bought a home in jamaica where "he planned to create a community of black musicians at a time when there were few hotels for african americans many out of town musicians stayed with the williams family among them willie the lion smith ma rainey and bessie smith louis armstrong probably got his first exposure to queens visiting williams " the word got around of how welcoming queens was becoming and remained for black musicians armstrong wrote not long before his death about how much he treasured the home his wife lucille had bought for him in corona in "just think through the years that weve lived in this house we have seen just about three generations come up on this particular block lots of them have grown up married had children and they still come back and visit aunt lucille and uncle louis " and many of them went to the louis armstrong elementary school and the louis armstrong intermediate school in queens another queens resident at the time trumpet player clark terry told me that armstrong would occasionally invite terry and other musicians to his home "to tell us the history of jazz " the greatly respected bassist milt hinton "the judge " his fellow musicians called him spoke for many in that community of black jazz creators about the effect being together in queens had on their lives "when i look back on it now i realize what that house really meant to us for the first time mona and i had something that was ours it was our security and some new roots " the roots continue to be fruitful at the flushing council on culture and the arts the curator of the past and the generator of the future of queens jazz producer clyde bullard has for the past eight years produced concerts with among other jazz performers barry harris marian mcpartland dr billy taylor and randy weston his father c b bullard for years head of the jazz department at atlantic records founded the jazz program at the flushing council along with jo ann jones and cobi narita recently clyde bullard applied for a national endowment for the arts grant to allow the creation of an member resident town hall jazz orchestra to be directed by jimmy heath known to his peers as "the complete jazzman " the mission of this prospective orchestra says clyde bullard "will be to revitalize and rejuvenate the jazz heritage of queens through concerts lectures and performances of music created by the great legends that once resided here " among those who still do live in queens is composer saxophonist heath and of those who have died buried in queens cemeteries are louis armstrong dizzy gillespie johnny hodges charlie shavers and jimmy rushing and another seminal figure in american music scott joplin the master composer of the graces of ragtime is buried in the boroughs st michaels cemetery the queens jazz trails tour takes place the first saturday of every month for information extension copies of the accompanying map can be obtained from mr miller at ephemera press ephemerapress com there too is his celebrated illustrated map of the harlem renaissance that cites cultural historian alaine lockes first chorus to the abiding importance of harlem "harlem is the precious fruit of the garden of eden the big apple " a story that climaxed in the queens jazz community was told to me by alto saxophonist phil woods designated this year a jazz master by the national endowment for the arts "many years ago at a club in new york i was down i was saying im not going anywhere im a white guy in this music hearing me whining and crying the blues art blakey and dizzy gillespie kidnapped me they put me in a cab and took me to dizzys place in queens "dizzy sat me down and said to me about charlie parker bird gave it to everybody to all races if you can hear it you can play it " in countries all over the world musicians of all blends of races are playing music created on the queens jazz trail mr hentoff writes about jazz for the journal see related article "leisure &amp arts and its present takes root in brooklyn" wsj january
