dollars bounce spurs revised outlooks for year the dollars strong start in the new year is causing some currency watchers to rethink their expectations for a swooning dollar in just a few weeks ago the conventional wisdom held that the dollar was headed downward due to slowing growth in the u s and a renewed focus on the countrys yawning deficits the dollar has bucked those expectations rising more than against the euro since the start of the year it has also strengthened against the yen hitting a month high and breaking the symbolic barrier of yen to the dollar driving this strength robust economic data in the u s along with signs that the trade deficit may be stabilizing with each indication that the u s economy is expanding at a healthy clip it becomes less likely that the federal reserve will cut short term interest rates to spur growth and might even raise them further today short term rates in the u s already are higher than in europe or japan so indications that those rates will remain steady or rise make it relatively more appealing to hold dollars as a result some currency strategists think the dollar might suffer only limited losses this year or perhaps even finish the year roughly where it started the dollars trajectory has a big impact on investors last year the dollars downward drift provided a generous boost to american investors returns earned overseas since profits in other currencies bought more dollars last year the dollar weakened against the euro analysts now think that kind of slide is unlikely to happen in the near future "i dont think were looking at a repeat of " says david gilmore of foreign exchange analytics a research firm "the bulk of dollar weakness is probably behind us " he says unless there is an unusual shock to the currency such as an abrupt decision by a major central bank to move reserves out of dollars or a rapid widening of the trade deficit late yesterday in new york the euro was at &# from &# on monday the dollar was at yen from yen the pound was at &# from &# the dollar may weaken against the euro toward the middle of the year says matthew strauss senior currency strategist at rbc capital markets his firms forecast for the end of the year puts the dollar at roughly the same level against the euro as it occupies today that prediction draws on a view that europes economy may start to decelerate in the latter part of the year mr strauss says while the u s rebounds of course currency movements are notoriously difficult to predict the dollar still faces pressure on several fronts the main persistent and long term worry is the fact that the u s imports far more than it exports and spends more than it saves making it dependent on other countries to finance the gap one way to address that imbalance is a weaker dollar since it would make the countrys exports more attractive the second concern relates to the large amount of dollars held by central banks around the world the dollar is the worlds favored reserve currency but the rising acceptance of the euro together with the dollars recent weakness has led central banks to consider diversifying their holdings so far moves in that direction have been limited any sign that central banks are shifting a significant portion of their reserves out of dollars could weigh heavily on the u s currency both of these concerns are of the longer term variety their effect on the dollar is likely to play out over many months or years in the meantime shorter term economic indicators are dictating the dollars course last november the dollar began tumbling against the euro when it appeared that u s growth was slowing as europes accelerated if the economies were headed in different directions reasoned traders so too would short term interest rates lower in the u s to spur the economy and higher in europe to keep inflation under control falling rates hurt a currency by making it less attractive because investors earn lower returns on assets denominated in that currency now those expectations about interest rate policy are shifting a slew of positive data on the u s economy has nearly eliminated the markets prior belief that the federal reserve would cut rates as early as march the european central bank meanwhile sounded a less hawkish note on inflation in early january although further rate increases are likely the current situation where u s short term rates are higher than in either europe or japan looks set to persist producing a relatively benign environment for the dollar underlying that scenario is a belief that the u s economy wont slow further and instead will start to rev up "the market has its verb tenses wrong " says marc chandler global head of foreign exchange at brown brothers harriman "the u s is not slowing down it has already slowed down " mr chandlers firm is forecasting that the dollar will finish the year trading at about &# a euro others disagree with such forecasts noting that u s economic performance isnt assured signs "still point to weaker u s growth compared to the rest of the world " says jens nordvig a currency strategist at goldman sachs "over time that will overwhelm the shorter term trend were seeing now " mr nordvig believes the euro will strengthen to &# in a year about a decline in the dollar from current levels one area where currency analysts seem in agreement is the scenario for the yen tomorrow japans central bank will decide whether to raise short term interest rates a move that could offer some support to its currency however even with a rate increase borrowing in japanese yen would remain extremely inexpensive by global standards those low rates have fueled a phenomenon known as the "carry trade " in which investors borrow japanese yen at low local interest rates then convert the currency into other currencies and invest it in countries with higher interest rates like australia or new zealand the trade creates a downward drag on japans currency since the maneuver involves selling yen to use the proceeds elsewhere as long as that dynamic persists currency strategists say its tough to foresee a significant strengthening in the currency the yens "underlying weakening trend will remain in place " says mr nordvig of goldman sachs yesterdays trading canada holds steady the dollar embarked on a modest rally despite the lack of data to support the move hitting a high yen against the beleaguered yen and pushing the euro down to as low as &# investors will get more substantial data to sink their teeth into today with the release of the december producer price index report as well as december industrial production data elsewhere the bank of canada kept its key lending rate unchanged at as expected noting that policy makers "continue to judge that the risks to the inflation projection are roughly balanced " isabelle lindenmayer
