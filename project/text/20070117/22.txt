business world ifoodfight apple has been making itself irresistible copy lately featuring simultaneously in the biggest scandal story of the day backdating and the splashiest marketing story iphone then theres this bounty beyond anything we had a right to expect how can you not love a company that launches one of the highest profile products in its history and does it with a disputed name and disputed not by some no name outfit in a suburban office park but by a silicon valley icon of the stature of networking giant cisco systems cisco is a highly respectable organization its ceo john chambers has yet to receive his due for surviving an unprecedented peril of pauline in riding his companys market cap to &# billion from &# billion during the bubble briefly making it the worlds most valuable company before the fall wiped out nearly half a trillion in shareholder wealth that mr chambers emerged without any sizeable particle of egg on his face and without anyone seriously challenging his probity or his companys books despite the fact that cisco spent the s wallowing in the minefield of merger accounting is a feat that speaks for itself cisco was fully in its rights to rush out a product called iphone in the weeks before apples long expected announcement it did so based on a brand name that it had acquired in and that apparently lay around unnoticed in a closet till very recently it was also within its rights to sue apple when apple as everyone had predicted for years introduced its own product called "iphone " nor is the settled order of the universe violated when one company resorts to a lawsuit against another not just to vindicate its rights but to advance its business strategy that said trademark law at bottom is about protecting a company from a competitor expropriating its investment in branding cisco may end up as the owner of "iphone " but it hardly had the knack of making the name worth anything it took apple to give its "property" any real value it took one guy apple ceo steve jobs uttering the word on a stage in san francisco fans and critics alike talk about mr jobss "dazzling showmanship" and "marketing genius " as if his success was all about technique its not its about history his role in the birth of the personal computer his proven gift for making products that people care about cisco is a great company too making products that everyone uses but it has never been in ciscos genes or its business model to make products people care about heres another way of looking at it cisco right now is counting its lucky stars that cisco rather than somebody else was the victim of apples theft if it was theft at least four products already in the market bear the name "iphone" a surecom usb device a software product from vocaltec in israel a voip phone by britains orate telecommunications and a line of hotel phones by californias teledex in addition to ciscos late hit revival of the product name acquired from infogear apple may have some grounds to argue whether placing an "i" in front of a generic item like a phone is enough to create a trademark while nobody called a music player a "pod" before everybody has always called a phone a "phone " whats more zdnet the online news service examined the paper trail and finds that cisco may have failed to meet a six year deadline to show it was making use of the trademark cisco did submit something just before an additional six month grace period ended but according to zdnet which backs up its report with a photo the filing consisted of slapping an "iphone" sticker on a box for its linksys cordless internet telephony kit all this adds up to an impression that ciscos business plan for "iphone" never amounted to more than an urge to exploit apples intention to launch a product of the same name which had been speculated about almost since the ipod was introduced the first mention in the new york times of an apple "iphone" came in august in fact the lightbulb seems to have appeared over ciscos head only when apple recently approached it about licensing or purchasing the "iphone" name in his blog cisco general counsel mark chandler plays to the gallery with talk about mom and apple pie values such as "interoperability" and "open" standards he says ciscos goal is not to shake loose some money but to start a "collaboration " of course if such a partnership were appealing to anybody but cisco cisco would hardly need to extort apples agreement by putting a gun to the head of its six little hostages because thats all cisco has to offer those six little letters in return it wants a piece of the wholly owned money machine that apple has created by convincing so many consumers to lock themselves into apples world and pay a hefty markup for the privilege collaboration is not apples game the company has been determinedly building its present prosperity on the closed standards of the ipod and itunes ciscos proffer in other words is the equivalent of slipping and falling on mick jaggers sidewalk then trying to parlay it into a place in the band with royalties of course we can only guess what goes on in mr jobss mind but he likely believes it was written in the heavens and the book of ages that apples next product would be called "iphone " he was not going to let a little thing like a trademark controversy thwart the onward march of destiny cisco will just have to be responsible for its own feng shui he might have figured which cant be too good when standing in the way of another "insanely great" apple product no its not the conventional logic by which pregnant corporate strategic and legal risks are taken but thats apple being apple
