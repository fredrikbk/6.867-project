greenwich developers try mega mansions on spec greenwich conn as hedge funds have flooded this affluent community in recent years joseph beninati and jim cabrera have placed some winning bets on the local real estate market messrs beninati and cabrera co founded antares investment partners which has profited handsomely by turning a ho hum office building in downtown greenwich into sleek office space for prestigious financial companies and private equity firms antares also helped transform the delamar hotel which replaced a run down motor lodge into a popular place for money managers to entertain their investors some of whom commute there by yachts that they dock alongside the hotel now antares is embarking on what some consider one of its boldest and riskiest projects at a time when big home builders across the country are cutting back antares is proceeding with plans to construct a handful of mansions the largest of which will include roughly square feet of space spanning several buildings and cost about &# million that mega mansion is being built off round hill road an area that includes many other opulent houses and some of the other houses are being built off taconic road in greenwich what could make the development risky is that antares is putting up the homes on spec meaning they currently dont have buyers typically such massive homes are built from the ground up by people who buy the land hire an architect and developer and build the house of their dreams to their exact specifications increasingly that process is being stymied in wealthy communities by residents who balk at the swelling size of homes and try to block their construction last winter joseph jacobs president of wexford capital which manages several hedge funds and private equity funds withdrew his plans to build a house with nearly square feet of living space in greenwich after attracting lots of publicity over neighborhood complaints that his house would be just too big according to newspaper accounts mr jacobs declined to comment through a spokesman "its more and more time consuming to develop a piece of property in greenwich " says john tesei a lawyer who has focused on land use in greenwich for years "you see greater regulatory involvement and greater scrutiny to be polite by abutting property owners " even when massive mansions arent rejected outright it can take more than three years to build a large home due to strict oversight of development from greenwichs government boards large spec homes face similar scrutiny antaress strategy is that it will fight the battles and get the approvals so that the home buyer can avoid the hassle antares started preparing for the mansions four years ago when it assembled acres of land around greenwich readied the properties for development and worked through the planning and zoning boards to obtain approval for the large homes "going through the approvals wasnt any fun " mr beninati says "a hedge fund guy doesnt want to deal with this " antares is betting that there are enough rich people in a hurry who would gladly give up the satisfaction of building their own home in exchange for the ease and speed of moving into an already built home mr beninati says antares is providing most of the equity and is using relatively little debt to develop the mansions antares is a private equity and development firm that manages real estate renovates the buildings builds them finds tenants and invests its own equity the company has about &# billion in assets under management and projects under development its properties are located in connecticut and new york while other private equity firms also manage their real estate investments antares as a relatively small firm is unusual because it is involved in so many different types of real estate from offices to high end homes "most groups will be in either office hotel or multifamily " says charlie schoenherr a managing director at lehman brothers which provided financing for two of antares projects in greenwich "they invest in various different property types within a certain region they are more regionally focused than focused on one property type we like the whole fairfield market with greenwich as the epicenter they are the most dominant firm in that market and we think that is a good strategy " mr beninati and mr cabrera and other antares executives own the majority of the company mr beninati says that investors in its projects include the private equity firms arch street capital advisors llc and lubert adler which invest capital from university endowments most of the mansions come with finished interiors but the company is taking an unusual approach in selling its largest home where the main building spans square feet antares built the stone exterior but will leave the interior design moldings floors bathroom and kitchen fixtures to the buyer once they purchase the home antares believes this approach lets high end buyers make the kinds of decisions about their living spaces they usually care most about there is little doubt the market for high end homes in greenwich is strong the median price of a single family home through the third quarter of was about &# million up from a median price of roughly &# million in according to david ogilvy &amp associates which sells high end greenwich homes last year eight homes sold for more than &# million said the firms president david ogilvy the risk for antares and its largest mansion which the company dubbed the lake carrington estate is that affluent buyers in that high price range will want to design the entire house themselves it also could prove difficult to sell such a large house that has very little on the inside "its unheard of " says mr ogilvy "people want to see the home done they might want to change it all but they want to see it done " one of antares mansions a square foot home is on the market for &# million lake carrington will go on the market next month and a third mansion will hit the market in march mr beninati and mr cabrera who are friends from prep school and who grew up in and around greenwich founded the firm in it started out investing in engineering companies and real estate but began focusing almost entirely on the latter in "we saw greenwich turn into a town where everyone commuted to new york city to a place where they both live and work " mr cabrera said the company founders say they got their big break in the late s when they brokered a deal to move hedge fund manager paul tudor jones into his current greenwich headquarters a former mansion previously occupied by tenneco an oil company in june antares bought a stake in a square foot office plaza called pickwick plaza in downtown greenwich which sold for &# million at the time it was the highest price ever paid for a suburban office property and all the leases were up for renewal antares which managed and renovated the property planned to more than double the rents which were as low as &# a square foot antares says it was able to raise the rents to more than &# a square foot the company and its partners recently sold the property for roughly &# million whether antares will enjoy the same success with its aggressive push into greenwichs housing market remains to be seen last february it bought a worn out unit apartment complex in greenwich for &# million antares has spent another &# million on massive renovations as it turns many of the units into for sale condos antares has deposits on units and several investors who are interested in buying a block of units antares says it expects to close on many of the units this spring the condos start at &# for a one bedroom square foot unit and are geared to the young traders analysts and other young people or empty nesters looking for a piece of greenwich antares also is expanding into stamford redeveloping acres of former industrial sites on the waterfront into office space geared to financial companies condominiums and a marina the &# billion project is years away from completion but the company is betting that the hedge fund economy will keep expanding "how do you take greenwich and expand it " mr beninati says "right next door is the stamford waterfront "
