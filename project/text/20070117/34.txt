cboe finds knock on ipo door legal spat with cross street rival slows debut plans and weighs on cbots own deal chicago in august just hours after chicago board options exchange ceo william brodsky broke off merger talks with longtime rival chicago board of trade the veteran exchange chief got some unexpected news "were filing a complaint against you in delaware" court mr brodsky was told by his board of trade counterpart according to officials at both exchanges the legal salvo has forced the cboe the nations largest options market by trading volume to return to the drawing board as it tries to become the last major u s exchange to transform itself into a shareholder owned company like many exchanges cboe has considered going public or merging with another market for years but its efforts have been stymied by its unusual ownership structure which is the subject of the lawsuit from the board of trade a unit of cbot holdings inc the key question at the center of the legal fight how much of the cboe a year old cooperative started in the chicago board of trades smoking lounge do board of trade members own financial exchanges today view going public as a competitive necessity in an age of rapid technological transformation new york stock exchange parent nyse group inc went public in march and commodity market new york mercantile exchange followed as nymex holdings both stocks have soared nasdaq stock market inc has been public for several years as has chicago mercantile exchange holdings inc which went public in with a stock market value of &# billion the chicago merc is larger than nyse group and is planning its own deal with the chicago board of trade that would create a &# billion company but the cboe is left out for the moment as it tries to resolve its legal tug of war with the board of trade the board of trade argues that its members own about of the cboe because it provided the initial funding for the options exchange in the early s and signed numerous agreements with cboe that it believes outlines its members role as co owners of the exchange those members possess "a fundamental and longstanding economic interest" in cboe says a board of trade spokesman "our resolve to protect this right is unequivocal " the cboe counters that if the board of trade proceeds with its union with the merc the boards members should be forced to give up their ownership stake because the board of trade will become part of the cme group inc the acquisition "extinguishes" any board of trade members rights in cboe mr brodsky said recently those rights could be valued at about &# billion the fight escalated in december when cboe filed papers with the securities and exchange commission outlining its position the friction has strained relations between the two exchanges recently when a cboe executive sat next to board of trade chairman charles carey at a charity breakfast mr carey told him jokingly "your members might shoot you" if the two were seen sitting together "people get emotional about this issue " explains mr carey a longtime corn trader "i tell them this is just business " a prolonged fight could delay cboes plans for an ipo and could even hamper the proposed merger between the merc and the board of trade thats because the board of trade merc deal requires approval of board of trade members and while the members mostly traders and retirees may want the merc deal they would prefer it without losing their cboe stake still other observers say its unlikely that cbot members will vote against a landmark merc deal that has already increased the value of cbot holdings shares by about &# billion for a stake in the cboe that may be worth no more than half that the merc and cbot have said they would reserve &# million to fight the case if it continues after the closing of the merc board of trade deal if cboe can free itself from this legal dispute it stands to be a key player in the global exchange merger frenzy currently under way its business has grown quickly for decades as individual investors and sophisticated fund managers move into stock options which give the right but not the obligation to buy or sell stocks or other financial instruments in the future options can be used to hedge a portfolios risk or to bet on market moves using borrowed money some analysts predict the chicago merc or another large exchange will eventually buy cboe which has an estimated market value of about &# billion nyse bought an options exchange with its archipelago purchase but nyse is a far smaller player in options and big board ceo john thain wants to grow larger in that market the cboe was started by board of trade grain traders who wanted to diversify out of a stagnant commodities market the fledgling exchange moved to its own offices across the street from the board of trade in the s board of trade members funded the new exchange but spun it off into a separate company so securities regulations that govern stock options wouldnt spill over into the boards commodity futures markets in cboes first few years the two exchanges fought over a promising mortgage bond options contract and sparred when the cboe aligned its stock index business with the rival merc mr brodsky plans to lay the groundwork for an ipo despite the lawsuit cboe became a for profit organization a year ago and has begun preparing the papers required to become shareholder owned the step many exchanges take before going public
