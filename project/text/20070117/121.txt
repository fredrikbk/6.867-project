for the e mail here the former near ubiquity of intels chips made it one of the best bellwethers of the tech industry but the companys most recent results tell a lot more about the makers of semiconductors than the customers who buy them intel said it shipped a record number of microprocessors for laptop and server computers and that it reaped cost savings from months of restructuring efforts that trimmed its work force by more than but as the san jose mercury news reports intels fourth quarter net income of &# billion was down from a year earlier on revenue that was down at &# billion as businessweek notes it says a lot about the industry "when the worlds largest chipmaker reports a quarter in which it sold more microprocessors than ever before but still sees its profits fall" by so much and the reason was advanced micro devices evolution from annoying no to margins munching rival amd may be taking the bigger licking in the price war but as the magazine points out the pressure on intel isnt going away especially for its gross margins intel said it expects a margin of roughly in the current quarter and for the whole year while its fourth quarter margin was down to from a year earlier "any hope for an improvement in pricing will depend on the supply " businessweek says "if demand for servers and pcs doesnt pick up soon and its not expected to for a few quarters yet intel and amd will find themselves in a market flooded with chips and not enough customers to buy them further depressing prices " still intel was able to boast about a higher average selling price for its chips last quarter while amd last week had to issue a surprise profit warning it blamed on lower average prices as the wall street journal reports intel chief financial officer andy bryant credited a higher proportion of the more expensive laptop and server chips for laptop computers and servers among intels sales while the journal suggests amd may have been left with excess inventory that forced it to offer discounts mr bryant acknowledged intel had gone through "a very tough pricing year " as the new york times reports and said "were going to have to fight to win orders " and that might not be the only fight intel faces people familiar with the european unions potential anticompetition case against the chip giant tell the journal that investigators have recommended to antitrust commissioner neelie kroes that she formally charge intel with illegally thwarting competition the case begun with an amd complaint six years ago is at the point where ms kroes must either act against intel or drop the matter the people familiar with the case say she has asked for more information but that she could decide at any time iraqi civilians and president bush central to the bush administration defense of its plan to deploy more troops to iraq is the argument that abandoning iraq would further endanger americans inviting terrorists who now fight u s troops there to attack u s civilians at home but also crucial to any definition of success in iraq will be the safety of iraqi civilians whose lives were thrust into an increasingly bloody war zone yesterday a pair of car bombs killed at least iraqi college students at a shiite dominated university in baghdad and wounded more than others in what the los angeles times suggests was the "latest salvo" in a civil war between sunnis and shiites separately the united nations said the violence killed more than iraqis last year in a report compiled from morgues hospitals and municipal authorities across the country that was nearly three times higher than the iraqi governments own estimate for as tallied by the associated press the new york times notes president bush last night was asked about the u n report and yesterdays violence on pbss "newshour with jim lehrer " and said the u s should help the iraqi government stop the sectarian violence and mr bush reiterated that he now expects the iraqi government to step up its efforts which eventually led to the following exchange mr lehrer "is there a little bit of a broken egg problem here mr president that there is instability and there is violence in iraq sectarian violence iraqis killing other iraqis and now the united states helped create the broken egg and now says okay iraqis its your problem you put the egg back together and if you dont do it quickly and you dont do it well then well get the hell out " president bush "yeah you know thats an interesting question i dont quite view it as the broken egg i view it as the cracked egg " mr lehrer "cracked egg " president bush " that where we still have a chance to move beyond the broken egg and i thought long and hard about the decision jim obviously its a big decision for this theater in the war on terror and you know if i didnt believe we could keep the egg from fully cracking i wouldnt ask kids additional kids to go into iraq to reinforce those troops that are there " later mr lehrer asked the president if iraq is indeed part of a struggle for the future of america "why have you not as president of the united states asked more americans and more american interests to sacrifice something the people who are now sacrificing are you know the volunteer military the army and the u s marines and their families theyre the only people who are actually sacrificing anything at this point " president bush "well you know i think a lot of people are in this fight i mean they sacrifice peace of mind when they see the terrible images of violence on tv every night i mean weve got a fantastic economy here in the united states but yet when you think about the psychology of the country it is somewhat down because of this war now here in washington when i say what do you mean by that they say well why dont you raise their taxes thatll cause there to be a sacrifice i strongly oppose that if thats the kind of sacrifice people are talking about im not for it because raising taxes will hurt this growing economy and one thing we want during this war on terror is for people to feel like their lifes moving on that theyre able to make a living and send their kids to college and put more money on the table " also of note associated press in remarks prepared for congressional testimony today attorney general alberto gonzales says federal judges are unqualified to make
