business if mr jobs is punished would holders suffer arrogance in the corner office is out of favor these days walt disneys michael eisner hewlett packards carly fiorina american international groups hank greenberg morgan stanleys phil purcell and pfizers hank mckinnell to name a few lost their powerful posts at least in part because of an inability to distinguish themselves from the companies they ran steve jobs however is another matter the chief executive officer of apple has good reason to think well of himself as the founder of both apple and pixar animation he has produced remarkable products that have transformed three different industries computers music and movies his trademark arrogance is more than just a personal characteristic it is part of his brand who else would make a big product announcement the same week as the consumer electronics show in las vegas but in a different city who else would introduce a cellphone already one of the most ubiquitous products on the planet with the words "were going to make history together today" who else would choose a name for it that is already in use by another company and after decades of aggressively defending his own companys intellectual property allow a company spokesman to dismiss the resulting infringement lawsuit as "silly" investors lapped it up last week the companys stock price jumped &# adding nearly &# billion to apples already heady market value that is around of the entire market value of research in motion which makes the ubiquitous blackberry and based on a product that isnt even in stores yet steve jobs is apple inc he created the company and then came back to rescue it when it was headed for oblivion it is difficult to imagine apple continuing in anything like its current form without him at the head dressed in mock turtleneck and blue jeans conjuring up gratifying images in the minds of grateful consumers that is why the markets euphoria came to an end on friday when the wall street journal reported that federal authorities continue to actively investigate a grant of million stock options to mr jobs that was finalized in december but dated october when the stock price was nearly &# lower other ceos caught up in the options backdating scandal have lost their jobs if mr jobs were to lose his the principal source of apples magic would be gone the companys handling of mr jobs and the options issue has raised as many questions as it has answered a board committee cleared mr jobs and current management of any wrongdoing but acknowledged he had recommended "favorable" dates for some options awards to apple employees other than himself the company also said mr jobs didnt "financially benefit" from the options or "appreciate the accounting implications" of backdated grants what exactly did the board committee mean by saying mr jobs picked "favorable" dates when the company replaced his unexercised options with restricted stock what formula did it use to calculate the number of shares it gave him was the value of his options part of that formula and if it was doesnt that mean he benefited from the options moreover how can the company say he didnt understand the "accounting implications" of backdating as accounting scandals go this is pretty simple stuff the company picks a date in the past when the stock price was lower and the options are in the money from the start shareholders are led to believe the options are an incentive for future performance in fact some of that performance has already occurred apple wouldnt comment on this column and isnt answering these questions its response to the backdating mess appears to be another example of jobsian arrogance while other companies take draconian actions to clear themselves of the backdating cloud apple is giving its leader a pass there is a problem here securities laws exist to protect shareholders if apple is guilty of backdating stock options the victims of the crime were in theory the shareholders who were misled apple shareholders however have benefited greatly from the tenfold increase in the companys stock price in recent years i doubt there is one of them who would begrudge steve jobs the extra &# million he would have received if he had exercised the options and i cant imagine there is one who wants him removed as apples ceo if mr jobs participated in backdating options he should be punished to let him off the hook would send a terrible signal that some people are exempt from the rules or above the law but any punishment that hampers his ability to continue running the company would be a mistake that is punishing the victim and only compounds the crime alan murray welcomes reader questions and will respond at wsj com talkingbusiness
