are specialized courts the cure for the medical malpractice system philip k howard makes a good case for an alternative approach to medical malpractice "strong medicine " editorial page jan he focuses on the costly and unpredictable nature of the current tort based system but the most important benefit that can derive from a reformed medical malpractice system is enhanced patient safety our health care system is hobbled by a conspiracy of silence that the negligence based medical malpractice system engenders hospitals and health providers hide their mistakes in the hope that they won t be sued when a claim is filed they react defensively and deny they did anything wrong when a settlement is finally reached the case is sealed shielded from public scrutiny and the very problems that caused the injury in the first place often go unchanged a no fault system like that supported by the national physicians alliance lifts that veil of secrecy when mistakes happen in such a system doctors and hospitals cooperate to discover the root cause of the injury then changes are made to prevent them from happening again stephen r smith m d associate dean of medicine professor of family medicine brown medical school providence r i common goods proposal for health courts moved beyond the usual malpractice reform merely capping damage awards bravo capping damages limits the size of the injustice without correcting the fundamental problem verdicts unsupported by medical evidence however common goods proposal to do away with the jury may be impractical because a jury trial is guaranteed in most state constitutions but specialized courts can be accomplished while respecting this guarantee how administratively many states already have created specialized courts administratively new york state has more than medical cases could be assigned to the same few judges who would receive training in scientific evidence become expert at keeping bogus medical theories out of the earshot of the jury and call neutral expert witnesses to guide the jury now more than ever health courts are needed because the number of lawsuits arising from hospital infections and medical errors is about to soar infection for example used to be considered the inevitable risk you face if you are hospitalized no more because there is compelling evidence that almost all infections are preventable hospitals are in a new legal situation infection could be the next asbestos so specialized judges are needed to help juries understand the technical issues and reach a fair verdict a fair trial who can argue with that betsy mccaughey ph d chairman committee to reduce infection deaths rid new york mr howard says "skyrocketing health care costs are a national tragedy " i agree his diagnosis of the cause and his proposed cure is malpractice the legal system is partially responsible for high medical costs but not as much as mr howard says here in texas we had serious medical malpractice tort reform several years ago it did shut down most of the plaintiffs bar in the malpractice area but malpractice insurance rates have not dropped in any proportion to the large decrease in liability exposure of the providers more pertinent to mr howards claims health insurance rates have continued to shoot through the roof in my small firm i provide coverage for four people through a small group plan generally the only coverage available for small business that same coverage cost &# in is now &# and still going up every year during and after our medical tort reform my rates were rising at about per year as to mr howards health court remedy he does not tell us whence these administrative judges would come or who would choose them and supervise them his remedy looks a lot like just another unresponsive government bureaucracy the ebola virus of modern life robert j gieb fort worth texas
