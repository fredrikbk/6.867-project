journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources trade world currency and central bank an old idea gets new attention with the latest round of world trade organization talks floundering perhaps it is time to resurrect a john maynard keynes proposal floated more than years ago for an international central bank that would prevent some of the obstacles to the discussions says susan georges president of the left leaning transnational institute of the netherlands keynes suggested that a body called the international clearing union launch a currency the bancor that would be used in crossborder trading governments would earn bancors when they sold exports and could spend the notes on imports the global central bank would charge interest on any account that ran a deficit or surplus encouraging members to keep a trade balance one benefit ms georges says would be to curb the huge foreign debts held by developing countries it also could temper another source of friction between rich and poorer countries agricultural subsidies under the icu rich countries would have to buy up products from developing nations to keep their bancor accounts from running up a large surplus pie in the sky the proposal was a key part of the bretton woods conference that led to the creation of the dollar based international monetary fund nobel prize winning economist robert mundell echoed the idea in his research that became the foundation for the common european currency but ms georges says the notion of a global currency was blocked by the u s in the s

hawkishness the human mind is predisposed to foreign policy hawks nobel economics laureate daniel kahneman and harvard university doctoral student jonathan renshon contend certain biases when applied to foreign policy debates generally will push a leader to favor a hawks argument for coercive force over a doves argument for political solutions humanitys excessive optimism studies show of people think they are better drivers than they actually are aid the hawks case that a war will be swift and easy thats because the human mind tends to prefer a shot at success even if the possibility carries with it the risk of major losses over a certain but statistically less severe loss this helps hawks argue against withdrawal from an unsuccessful military campaign where a small chance at success overshadows a bigger chance at failure the authors acknowledge there are many other reasons that push people to war concluding merely that "cognitive biases may make starting wars easier than it
