youtube executive walks a tightrope marketing officer seeks to introduce paid ads without losing users youtube is going corporate the video sharing site which helped spark the online video craze of the past year has in recent months been making a serious effort to cash in on its popularity last september three weeks before announcing that it was selling itself to google inc for &# billion youtube hired its first chief marketing officer suzie reider since then her rapidly expanding advertising sales and marketing teams have been trying to figure out how to seamlessly blend marketing into youtubes offerings the result a prominent spot on youtubes home page is now devoted to an advertiser video which youtube visitors can rate share and discuss as they would do with any other video posted on the site known among youtube executives as "participatory video ads " the videos arent typical commercials a two minute spot running tuesday from the "mycadillacstory" channel featured a record executive talking about his familys love of general motors cadillac advertisers can also buy dedicated "channels" to showcase videos related to their brand such as one set up by adidas called "it takes ive" that focuses on the power of teams includes a link to an adidas basketball web site and encourages users to submit videos showcasing a basketball and five friends more traditional sponsorships are also available coca cola for instance sponsored holiday greetings that users could send to their friends the challenge for youtube is to become more advertiser friendly without sending too many of its million plus monthly visitors looking for the exits its mostly young audience is easily turned off by hard sell advertising industry executives say "this type of audience that youtube attracts is very very fickle " says chad stoller executive director of emerging platforms for organic a digital marketing agency owned by omnicom "it is very much a what have you done for me lately audience " indeed even some marketing professionals are starting to say that youtubes efforts to build advertising into its system are making the onetime start up site feel too corporate "it just feels overwhelming in terms of the marketing presence " says greg verdino director of emerging channels for digital marketing agency digitas before joining youtube ms reider had been senior vice president of the games and entertainment division at cnet networks she talks below about her plans for developing standards for a new generation of advertising the wall street journal which of your advertising models have been most popular with marketers so far ms reider the user initiated unit participatory video ad that is on the front door home page of youtube has been embraced by marketers because it is a really good way to ignite a video and kick it off into the youtube environment because what happens is that you have a video there users watch it from there and if it gets into the most viewed for that day it is like the king of the hill it is easier for a video to take off if you can get some big catapult from the beginning wsj some say youtube is becoming a platform to host commercials and advertising as much as it was a place for people to share the videos they created how do you see this shift ms reider the participatory video ad is the only marketing or advertising opportunity on the front door and it is user initiated it is up to the users if they want to watch them or not there is no commercial video messaging that is interrupting their enjoyment of the entertainment content on the site wsj which of the different ad formats are sold out ms reider there are only days in a year that is how many participatory video ads we could have on the site the other programs that have been successful are the ones that are really entertaining and actually give back to the users give them something to do the coke example that was kind of neat because it leveraged the essence of the youtube community it took the video greetings the holiday greetings from some of our most popular users and then users could take those and send those out to their friends and relatives as a holiday greeting or they could take some of the coke commercials and some of those coke commercials are really fun i mean i think the polar bear commercial they are just great spots so the same deal entertaining is critical that is why people come to youtube to be entertained wsj some marketers say they arent looking to simply put advertising on the site they really want to join the community and get people talking about their brand how are you building that form of promotion ms reider they want integrated out of the box interesting engaging experiences on web sites where they feel like they are really interacting with the user so the programs that we are looking to build on youtube will try to do that for them they should be thinking about all of the little threads of content that they can weave through the site in order to engage all kinds of users in all kinds of areas of the site because there is so much that goes on here in any given day wsj some of the viral campaigns launched on youtube like smirnoffs tea partay video explode in popularity while others sputter what are the steps to building a great viral campaign ms reider marketers really have to think about the niche content for the individual user and not the huge hit as they approach these environments viewership is also triggered through stimuli that happen outside the youtube environment it happens through links that friends are sending around or happens through other elements of a marketing campaign it is very powerful to have "brand channels" on youtube where a brand marketer is housing content and then to use the massive google network to ignite interest in that content that is one of the really powerful ways that the youtube sales organization and the google sales organization can work together the other thing that marketers need to think about is that they need to tag their videos to make them searchable spoofs do great we see that spoofs usually have pretty high view counts release content in an episodic fashion so give them a little taste of it get that going then release a little more wsj how are the connections between google and youtube developing ms reider youtube is going to continue to be the youtube brand and google video will do what google video is going to do youtube is being operated as an independent company the wonderful thing though is that we have the resources of google to leverage their engineering team their product team where we need them ad notes britney exs latest career move flipping burgers nationwide mutual insurance has
