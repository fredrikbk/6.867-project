in the bay area ever since theyre also both wine buffs and have always loved the napa valley but they didnt get many chances to visit the famous wine region during the years they spent teaching and raising three boys all that changed a few years ago when the couple both of whom are now retired they started spending long weekends touring the wine country tasting local vintages and learning more about wine making as the becerras became increasingly familiar with northern californias wine growing regions they found themselves asking why not put this knowledge to good use in june the couple launched winecountrygetaways com a web site designed to help people plan trips to the california wine country the site offers information about the napa valley as well as lesser know wine regions such as santa barbara mendocino and paso robles "many people come to the california wine country and dont know what to do they just drive around and stop at random " says mr becerra who retired in one year before his wife after a visiting friend asked him to map out an itinerary for a trip to the napa valley mr becerra hit on the idea of making such information available online "we decided to set up wine trail itineraries that help people find their way around " he says "including maps hotels and where to buy picnic supplies " mr becerra spent years teaching in burlingame calif mostly as a middle school science and physical education teacher in he was named director of educational technology for the san mateo county office of education and trained teachers in how to use computers and the

design and updating the system ms becerra is hardly an internet maven she taught in a daly city elementary school took a few years off to raise their kids and then taught english as a second language for years at the san mateo adult school her contribution to the site and the part of the job she likes best involves gathering the information "i love meeting new people and hearing their stories " ms becerra says the couple often interview winery owners but first take notes on the wineries they visit "undercover" speaking into a digital recorder so as not to compromise their journalistic integrity they also regularly attend trade events and take classes in wine education while they may have fallen into the internet business by accident the becerras say they always knew they wanted to work part time in retirement "the site is perfect " mr becerra says "because its part time but makes us a bit of money to spend traveling " the site generates revenue about &# in from banner ads and googles adsense program that said the becerras turn to their pensions for most of their expenses of course most of the trips the couple take also produce fodder for the site they travel to different california wine growing regions about once a month and have also visited wineries in spain and italy "i wanted to continue to have a project when i retired " ms becerra says echoing her husband "but i also wanted to spend time with my grandkids and not work all the time " hello rewrite second take sometimes it takes a while nearly years in the case of noel anenberg to discover youve made the wrong

spending a lot of lazy days on the golf course instead they have poured the majority of their time into a second career running a landscape architecture business "we ended up dropping out of the country club because we never used it " says mr tindall age mr tindall who retired from a year career as a manufacturing engineer at general motors corp in and his year old wife who retired from her job as a legal secretary in had always imagined opening a part time business in their later years they just didnt anticipate that it would fill hours a week "i dont really feel retired " ms tindall says "the business is very rewarding and im enjoying every minute of it " several years before retirement the tindalls sat down and made a list of all their skills and hobbies in order to come up with an idea for a part time business gardening was their favorite pastime and they both knew a bit about computers they contemplated several ideas before hitting upon landscape design "we both lived on small farms as children and love being outside but once we decided to do landscape design we realized we didnt know anything about it " mr tindall recalls so the couple spent almost four years taking community college classes in landscape design computer aided design plant recognition and botany "during that time we made it a hobby to grow a self sustaining garden on our property " mr tindall says the couple live on a acre spread in corunna mich miles north of detroit the tindalls started creative scapes llc in they designed gardens for friends and family and kept the business small for the first five years they intended to keep it that way but after they both retired they started getting more and more clients through word of mouth until finally they signed on with a developer of large homes in their area "we migrated from small jobs to very complicated large jobs that take a few years to complete " mr tindall says as business partners the tindalls have developed a way to split the work ms tindall has an artistic flair and does most of the design work with the plants mr tindall has the engineering background and does most of the technical planning and architectural layout the money they make from creative scapes supplements mr tindalls pension "if it was all about the money i would have just done engineering consulting " says mr tindall who enjoys keeping up on the latest in landscape design by attending seminars and learning new computer programs despite their hectic schedule the tindalls find time to relax they often winter in florida and recently spent a month backpacking around europe they usually take about four months a year off from running creative scapes ms tindall says they will continue running the business "until we cant do it anymore " when they

too far he graduated with a master of fine arts from the new york academy of art at the age of with public shows under his belt mr joanou has been successful at selling his allegorical paintings for as much as &# each at galleries and via his web site joanoufinearts com that may be because unlike many artists he knows a lot about marketing having served as chairman and chief executive of advertising group dailey &amp associates before retiring in "i always loved art but being raised by a single mom who always worried about money i realized early on that i didnt want to be a starving artist " says mr joanou "i decided i better pursue business " after graduating from the university of arizona with a degree in business in mr joanou went to work for a series of advertising agencies eventually winding up at dailey where he spent years the firm was acquired by interpublic group in but mr joanou continued to serve as chief executive of the dailey division even though he spent most of his life on planes mr joanou couldnt get painting out of his mind so in the late s he took a series of night and weekend art classes at the university of california at los angeles and at parsons school of design by he wanted to take his art in a more serious direction advertising was becoming less of a challenge says mr joanou "i needed a whole new chapter in my life so i decided to seriously pursue being an artist " he applied to and was accepted by the new york academy of art four years before his anticipated retirement date mr joanou walked into the office of phil geier interpublics chief executive at the time and told him he was quitting to attend art school "he about fell on the floor and then said i was going to make you an offer you couldnt refuse but i cant beat that " remembers mr joanou "there was a lot of money involved if i had stayed another four years but its my life and i wanted to do art " with their four children grown mr joanou and his wife michelle packed their bags for manhattan energized by the hustle and bustle of new york after years in suburban los angeles mr joanou attacked art school with a fervent desire to succeed especially since some of his fellow students had trouble taking him seriously at first "on my first day i was riding the elevators up to class and one of the students turned to me to ask which class i taught " says mr joanou "i told him im with you and he looked at me like i was crazy " in fact mr joanou was older than the oldest professor on staff finishing the program in he then rented a studio in tribeca where he "shut himself off" for two years to create a body of large paintings "i didnt show the paintings to a soul " says mr joanou in he hired an agent to see if any galleries would be interested in showing the work to his surprise several were in the joanous moved back to la canada calif near pasadena mr joanou continues to work eight hours a day monday through friday in his studio "like a regular job " he says though he makes money from his work his art alone doesnt pay all the bills "im glad i first took the path in business " he says the doctor is in good shape jim acos may be but that doesnt stop him from hitting the ski slopes every winter in taos n m and not just as a hobby but as a job dr acos is a ski instructor teaching people young and old how to stay upright and master the snowplow when he retired from his career as an anesthesiologist in dr acos had already been working as a part time ski instructor for seven years he and his wife patricia started spending winters in taos back in the late s during one such vacation in dr acos stopped by the local ernie blake ski school and asked for a job first he had to complete a training program during which he lived in the dorms at hondo lodge with a bunch of young hotshot skiers an experience he still remembers fondly he started teaching classes the following year in and bought a condo near the slopes in "becoming a ski instructor was one of the better decisions ive made in my life " says dr acos who maintains a special fitness routine during the months of the year when he isnt skiing "it has kept me in very good health " something of a legend on the taos slopes dr acos is known as "dr jim" to his students many of whom request him as their teacher year after year he says some of his first time students are a bit surprised that an "old guy" is their teacher but most end up appreciating his patient teaching style he teaches at all skill levels but specializes in working with adults over many of his students are in their s or s and some have just had hip replacements or other medical procedures and are scared to get up on skis again "but they take one look at me and realize they can do it " dr acos says "skiing is a strange sport in that youre asked to give yourself up to gravity the first thing everyone wants to learn is how to stop " says dr acos who teaches six days a week during the ski season he would teach every day if he could but the ski school wont allow teachers over the age of to work more than six days a week "i teach people to ski slowly and in control " he says he feels his years as an anesthesiologist have helped him be a better ski instructor "just like with skiing with anesthesia people are entrusting their lives to you and youve first got to assuage their fears " he says dr acos didnt start skiing until his mid s he went to medical school during world war ii and then worked for the san diego naval hospital for two years he spent four years as a resident at the indiana
