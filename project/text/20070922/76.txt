weekend journal leisure &amp arts masterpiece tintorettos thunderbolt his crucifixion of just may be the italian renaissances single best work of religious art anatomy of a classic the venetian painter tintoretto c never commanded the sculptural vocabulary of leonardo or michelangelo he did not luxuriate in the warmth of giorgione or titian he displayed neither the draftsmanship disegno of florentine art nor the affection for coloring colorito that was the legacy of his native city but through a synthesis of each tradition "il disegno di michelangelo e il colorito di tiziano " as one venetian writer identified it tintoretto may just have painted the single best work of religious art in the italian renaissance his "crucifixion" of comes as both a concluding statement to the art of the high renaissance and also something wildly new to see it you have to visit venice tintorettos "crucifixion" continues to fill the back wall of the boardroom albergo of the scuola grande di san rocco where he left it tintoretto dedicated his artistic and spiritual life to this confraternity a charitable organization of christian laymen dedicated to the plague healer st roch surrounded by over other religious images that tintoretto painted for the scuola grande for the cost of materials the "crucifixion" forms the centerpiece of one of the largest intact cycles of religious work by a single artist in history unlike michelangelo who initially fled rome rather than finish the ceiling of the sistine chapel tintoretto never hesitated to apply his vision to paint he persevered even as he was rejected by the venetian establishment a situation that may explain the manic expressive urgency of his compositions consider how he first made his way into the scuola since tintoretto was the son of a silk dyer tintore the profession of a quarter of the scuolas membership his acceptance by the confraternity might have been a given but in when he entered the artistic competition to supply the first ceiling painting to the newly completed albergo the odds were not on his side a young man with an evangelical zeal tintoretto had already been rejected for membership in the conservative scuola resentment ran high against his brash personality and unorthodox paint handling "the thunderbolt of his brush " as one th century painter called it one member of the scuola even pledged to contribute ducats if tintoretto was not chosen for the commission meanwhile titian the ruling monarch of venetian painting who supposedly once expelled tintoretto from his workshop after recognizing the young students great talent backed his protege veronese as heir apparent to the colorito legacy their three way rivalry will be examined in a show at the museum of fine arts boston in spring giorgio vasari the great florentine chronicler of renaissance art recounts how "the little dyer" overcame the odds they had their differences but vasari still saw fit to call tintoretto "swift resolute fantastic and extravagant and the most extraordinary brain that the art of painting has ever produced " rather than submit a drawing of his ceiling plan tintoretto secretly measured the open space and "sketched a great canvas and painted it with his usual rapidity without any one knowing about it and then placed it where it was to stand " when the confraternity protested tintoretto made an offer "if they would not pay him for the work and for his labor he would make them a present of it " it was a clever move since no donation to st roch may be turned away through this gift "he so contrived that the work is still in the same place " it didnt hurt that the paintings subject was the scuolas patron saint within a year tintoretto overcame the scuolas lingering resentment he was accepted for membership and allowed to attempt his great "crucifixion " the layout of the room posed several challenges three different architects worked on the scuolas design when it was finished by scarpagnino in the buildings small elevated windows provided only minimal interior light the albergo was also wider than it was long so that any painting covering the back wall would have to be viewed from close proximity and below tintoretto conceived of a revolutionary program rather than keep his design locked in strict perspective which would have been distorted by the rooms oblique points of view think of the front row of a movie theater tintoretto folded his narrative around the central figure of christ on the cross he then depicted christ bending down to address the good thief the figures in mourning at the foot of the cross and our gaze from below the fixity of the cross provides an anchor within an undulating sea of dark details that seems to extend beyond the picture plane out into our own space with blank faces the mundane figures surrounding christ stir up the awful scene a crowd of onlookers carpenters soldiers and even a dog make up "a centrifugal energy that charges the entire picture " as the art historian david rosand wrote in his survey of th century venetian painting the ominous tones curved landscape and artistic urgency that underlie tintorettos color choice composition and paint handling make this work a point of departure rather than look back to the neo platonic ideals of classical sculpture brilliantly embodied at the start of the th century in the ceiling frescoes of the sistine chapel tintorettos "crucifixion" anticipates the fallen angels of our modern era like a thunderbolt from the brush tintorettos "crucifixion" can stop you in your tracks the victorian writer and artist john ruskin certainly thought so "i have been quite overwhelmed today by a man i have never dreamed of tintoret " he wrote to his father on his first visit to venice "i always thought of him a good and clever and forcible painter but i had not the smallest notion of his enormous powers and then to see his touch of quiet thought in his awful crucifixion there is an ass in the distance feeding on the remains of strewed palm leaves if that isnt a masters stroke i dont know what is " from to tintoretto expanded his swirling cycle of religious art in the scuola out and down from the cross of the "crucifixion" to canvases on the facing wall of the albergo "ecce homo " "christ before pilate" and "the way to calvary" to a monumental series of images from the new and old testaments covering the walls and ceiling of the scuolas central upper room sala superiore to episodes from the life of the virgin mary on the walls of the ground floor sala terrena tintorettos work at the scuola executed over more than years became a perfect union of form content application and artistic intention in tintorettos lifelong dedication to the scuola "the act of painting thus becomes a gesture of piety " writes the academic rosand earlier this year the prado museum in madrid hosted the first major survey since of tintorettos work the museum also published an excellent catalog in english on the artist no museum exhibition will ever do justice to tintoretto since his largest work never travels but the prado show came close shedding light even on san rocco "the most personal and intensely felt of his works conveying a powerful sense of the artists own deeply held faith " writes frederick ilchman a curator at the museum of fine arts and an essayist for the catalog the scuola grande di san rocco which remains active as a confraternity long ago opened its doors to the public it now also maintains an excellent web site www scuolagrandesanrocco it which includes interactive pictures of the rooms but theres no substitute for the real thing the artist el greco once called tintorettos "crucifixion" the greatest painting in the world next time you are in venice make a visit to the scuola your own act of piety and experience a work of art that reaches across the centuries to our own time and place mr panero is the managing editor of the new criterion see related letter "letters to the editor artists of centuries past are still unsurpassed" wsj sept
