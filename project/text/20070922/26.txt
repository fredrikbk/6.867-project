hot topic uncle sam subprime lender this week the house of representatives overwhelmingly approved a plan to erase billions of dollars of subprime loan defaults in the private mortgage industry how by making taxpayers responsible for future losses the bush administration recently announced support for a similar plan and the housing industry is in full lobbying mode one of the lone skeptics is alabama senator richard shelby who warns that this could be one of the most expensive federal bailouts since the savings and loan crisis of the late s hes onto something the goal of these bailout plans is at least admirable to ensure that subprime borrowers dont lose their homes to foreclosure which is a clear and present danger given that some two million adjustable rate mortgages will roll over at higher interest rates in the months ahead the bush plan would give the federal housing administration fha uncle sams depression era housing agency the authority to help as many as subprime borrowers refinance mortgages at lower interest rates by insuring those loans against default no one wants to see borrowers lose their homes and the good news is that private lenders are already working with late payment borrowers to refinance the terms of these subprime loans whats troubling about the fha expansion plan is that the insurance guarantee places taxpayers atop the housing bubble uncle sam would insure tens of billions of dollars in new mortgage liabilities and just when default levels are cascading worse both the white house and congress want to suspend the fhas downpayment requirements to insure even zero equity loans they should read a new study by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo which reviewed fha loans and found that borrowers "who make no downpayment at all have the highest default rates " sometimes these default rates were three times higher than high downpayment loans in the latest "fha modernization" bill some borrowers would have no equity in their home in some cases those getting this federal guarantee would have a mortgage larger even than the value of the home thats because the fha traditionally allows home borrowers to finance closing costs and the insurance premiums if housing prices keep falling home owners would have a financial incentive to walk away from the loan and leave it to taxpayers to pay off the balance fhas supporters claim this insurance can be expanded at no cost to taxpayers because fha premiums more than cover annual losses from defaults but this is like arguing that social security is solvent because it is running a "surplus" this year according to the bush administrations own actuarial projections fha already lacks the revenue stream to pay the expected claims on loans that go sour though it claims expanding its loan portfolio will put it in the black in recent years the u s government accountability office and the federal housing departments inspector general have issued reports scoring the fha for fraud lax financial standards and mission failure the inspector general reported in that "because of adverse loan performance " the fhas "total costs exceed receipts on a present value basis " it also noted that fha has consistently underestimated default rates on its new loans also in the congressional budget office confirmed that "fhas insurance program imposes costs on the government and taxpayers" and "the subsidy cost of the fha insurance is between and percent of the amount of the insured loans " these subsidies are "free" to taxpayers only in the sense that beltway accounting rules record future liabilities in invisible ink its a testament to the fhas underwriting ineptitude that even during the biggest housing boom in a generation the agencys delinquency rate has somehow doubled over the last years in and the fhas delinquency rate was five times higher than the rate on conventional prime mortgage loans double the rate on loans with private mortgage insurance and even slightly higher than the rate on subprime loans see the nearby chart one recent fha innovation was the "downpayment assistance program" in which a third party sometimes the bank or the home seller is permitted to fund the downpayment for the borrower that program has suffered default rates as high as five times higher than on the typical mortgage fhas market share fell to an all time low of of all loans in down from a decade ago the bush administration should have worked to get that percentage to zero and mothballed an obsolete new deal agency instead hud bureaucrats and the housing industry keep inventing new missions for the agency such as the "zero downpayment" program fha now wants to elbow its way into the upscale market by expanding the size of a loan it can insure to as much as &# which would make subsidized mortgage insurance a kind of universal entitlement we wonder if either end of pennsylvania avenue grasps the irony off what they are proposing at the very moment when private mortgage lenders are under pressure from regulators rating agencies and shareholders to tighten underwriting to avoid another mortgage meltdown the fha is relaxing its standards so it can insure more questionable mortgages if that is permitted to happen americas newest and largest subprime lender will be uncle sam dont expect this story to have a happy taxpayer ending
