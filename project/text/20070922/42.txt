one womans sad tortuous path through our health care system the article "legal loophole ensnares breast cancer patients" page one sept was a shocking comment about the disorganized u s medical system shirley loewe with an unusual type of breast cancer had to endure rejection from medicaid and a variety of hospitals along with a plethora of opinions about her condition and its treatment this unfortunate series of events would have been avoided if the u s had a single payer medical system where patients have a choice of physicians and hospitals at government expense all developed countries except the u s have such systems most patients are satisfied with their care which isnt nearly as costly as in the u s john radebaugh m d falmouth maine shame on good shepherd for not knowing about the treatment act on dr lewis duncan for not referring ms loewe to m d anderson cancer center on dr byron cook for the "early attention comment " on swedish medical center for denying her admission and the others for denying her treatment because they were under no obligation im saddened that this happened because she was poor what happened to the american dream barbara victoria galagusz r n encinitas calif your article described the unfortunate demise of a woman with breast cancer unfortunately facts were omitted leaving the reader to draw erroneous conclusions ms loewe was denied neither care nor financial assistance by good shepherd medical center during her several encounters at the medical center &# worth of services were provided as directed by her physician of choice hospital financial counselors met with ms loewe and per financial policy provided &# of assistance through the hospitals charity care program most of the balance remained unpaid and has since been written off ms loewes surgeon also provided services in excess of &# that were provided without compensation hospital personnel made numerous attempts to help ms loewe obtain medicaid benefits since she like of all texans are uninsured but medicaid benefits werent available to her with the exception of &# provided by the local county indigent care program and &# paid by ms loewe the medical center received no other funding i wish ms loewes surviving family members sympathy during their recent loss and hope there is comfort knowing that she received care at a hospital ranked nationally for high quality care and that significant financial assistance was provided good shepherd like most hospitals in america walks the daily tightrope of providing the very best care while medicare and medicaid payments decline and a growing number of uninsured individuals are provided free care the real health care story is at the national level where decisions are being made now to further restrict health care coverage to those who need it joseph a reppert vice president and cfo good shepherd health system longview texas i found the account of ms loewes tortuous path through the myriad obstacles to secure proper care to be heartbreaking and disturbing we have all heard horror stories about americas heath care system and such stories arent limited to the uninsured employed people with adequate health care coverage spend countless "working" hours on the phone managing their care through their provider such care is senselessly complicated but ms loewes story is about something entirely different than just aggravation with health care providers how is it that a person making only &# per year is making too much to obtain care how is it that anyone benefits when that person must quit her job to qualify for care ms loewes life may or may not have been extended through better health care but certainly her remaining life would have been more fulfilling if she hadnt experienced such excruciating frustration during the process of obtaining care i am ashamed that our system has become so cumbersome and that my own state of residence is one that cowers behind an obscure loophole to deny medicaid coverage to those in need and with a serious illness as americans we can do better m a cribbin st louis breast cancer activists fought long and hard to get women treated under medicaid after they were diagnosed under the centers for disease controls national breast and cervical cancer early detection program and it is heartbreaking and infuriating to see women being mistreated in this way one problem is that some states hold back on publicizing the program or encouraging facilities to enroll because they will then have to pay part of the treatment costs the cdc maintains a web site that gives information on where women can get screened under the program http www cdc gov cancer nbccedp however without aggressive publicity directed to low income women and adequate medicaid funding and requiring that states cover all accredited mammogram facilities the program will continue to miss women like ms loewe and doom them to unnecessary suffering and early death ilene winkler new york i found it interesting to see how much and how varied the treatment was that ms loewe received it appears that socialized medicine isnt so much a future possibility as it is a current reality while it is easy to sympathize with anyone having to navigate the "byzantine" health care system in the u s it would have added perspective to your article to find out whether ms loewe would have fared any better in canada or the u k places often held up as models for our health care system would she have simply died waiting for treatment would she have received the chemo radiation and surgical treatment afforded her under our system its possible that patients with breast or cervical cancer are unique in the coverage possible for uninsured patients i dont know of any prostate cancer prevention and treatment act but pointing out the discrepancy is probably not politically correct patrick vincent boise idaho see related letter "letters to the editor national health
