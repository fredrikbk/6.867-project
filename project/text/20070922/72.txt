weekend journal food &amp drink eating out food thats still fresh after years how charlie trotters dishes have shaped u s cuisine a salmon roulade evolves chicago charlie trotter is celebrating the th anniversary of his restaurant the official fete will be a dinner for prepared by six chefs of international renown oct but chef trotter himself is also taking stock of those two decades hes charting the way he has gradually changed how he cooks the same basic dishes or sets of ingredients the result will be the subject of a book to be published next year we went to chicago last week for a preview of the event and to taste firsthand what chef trotter has wrought in an important period for restaurants its an era in which the pinnacle of fine dining has been fought over by the molecular gastronomists spains ferran adria and britains heston blumenthal the fusion power players chief among them tetsuya wakuda of sydney the french children of the nouvelle cuisine revolution new yorks daniel boulud and pariss patissier pierre herme to mention just two and the american eclectics who give all the worlds ingredients a personal spin above all thomas keller the bicoastal eminence behind the french laundry and per se in chicago chef trotter is the dean of a scene that surpasses new yorks as a thrilling place to eat alinea tru blackbird nomi and others sprung out of a restaurant culture started by charlie trotters the restaurant is as dignified as a blue suit but relaxed not flashy with two smallish dining rooms the menu is a set classic multicourse degustation meal costing &# with astute wine pairings but the kitchen is ready to react on a dime to a diners request mr trotter likes to compare himself to miles davis who "never played my funny valentine the same way twice " what we witnessed in the restaurants private dining room was the assembly of two dishes it wouldnt have been practical to watch the multistage preparations that went into the iteration of a mediterranean salmon roulade of that primordial work of trotterology was a fairly traditional salmon roll accented with anchovies and olives the updated "roulade" i saw the chef plate wasnt a roulade at all but a tapestry of the same ingredients prepared with techniques that were barely known even to professionals back then for example the salmon cut in inch squared off chunks had spent minutes in an evacuated plastic bag set in a water bath at around degrees the fish was almost raw but it melted in the mouth the olives were dehydrated to concentrate their flavor the anchovies had been pureed spinach was a light green froth "not a foam " said mr trotter separating himself from a trend that fizzled aerated with a hand blender mr trotter assembled this lighter less oily dish and finished it off by adding a saffron "tuile " a glucose chip impregnated with intense saffron flavor and then adding a citrus vinaigrette and a shower of grated lemon rind in this one complex creation you can see the influence of japan on the shape and restraint of the salmon of nouvelle cuisine in the purees and of vanguard food science but it is no stunt the same basic flavors from the roulade are all there the mediterranean spirit has just been purified and then put through a kaleidoscope dont try recreating this at home even if you get the as yet untitled book next year trotter recipes are meant to be a record a souvenir of food that youd need purveyors and a kitchen with line cooks to pull off consider the perils of prestidigitating this dish out of ingredients that spell september in illinois dehydrated eggplant chips eggplant puree japanese eggplant cooked sous vide for hours basil infused olive oil heirloom tomato water confit of tomato and a triple whammy of manchego cheese whey worked into an agar jelly the curd transmogrified into a thin wafer and a snow of grated whole manchego those same basic ingredients with much less powerful "natural" flavors started out back in the day as a french inspired but then still quite modern terrine of sliced heirloom tomatoes vegetable terrines and pates were a hallmark of the nouvelle cuisines ironic tussle with traditional french haute cuisine in this case taking an idea normally associated with meat and applying it to vegetables in the new trotter version it has been ratcheted up into a better version of itself better in flavor visually physically and utterly changed in appearance does this mean mr trotters restaurant is better now than it was years ago certainly it is more refined and labor intensive a home cook could have tackled the old dishes but not these this is food for todays more knowing diner that justifies its much higher price with visible complexity email me at eatingout wsj com charlie trotters classic tuna
