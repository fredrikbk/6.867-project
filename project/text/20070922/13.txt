encore a special report editors note not long ago i mentioned to my wife how much i was looking forward to traveling in retirement and spending time overseas europe australia africa to my surprise she replied that she would be quite content and might prefer traveling within the u s and staying close to home that was the first of several conversations in which we discovered that some of our thoughts about later life dont quite mesh but clearly we have company when it comes to planning for retirement many wives and husbands arent taking time to talk about finances estate planning or something as simple as what a typical day might look like with that in mind we think this issues cover story offers several good icebreakers the questions you and your spouse should ask each other about your plans and hopes for retirement elsewhere in this issue we look at ways in which grandparents and their adult children can negotiate baby sitting duties the great "napping" debate and how you can charter your own yacht fortunately my wife and i agree about yachts were ready to climb aboard whatever the destination as always we welcome your comments
