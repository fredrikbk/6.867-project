short circuit the attorney general war has obscured another political fight that deserves more public notice the way senate democrats are stalling judicial nominations to key appellate courts several courts around the country face judicial emergencies yet the senate has so far confirmed only three circuit court nominees this year putting it badly behind the post carter era average of such confirmations in a presidents last two years nowhere is this more apparent than on the fourth circuit court of appeals which hears many of the biggest terrorism cases including the prosecution of so called "th hijacker" zacharias moussaoui and the detention of ysir hamdi as an enemy combatant that court is now one third empty with five of active seats vacant the oldest vacancy dates back to july making it the longest standing in the country the fourth circuit has been a legendary sand pit for judicial obstruction dating back to the clinton years u s district court judge terrence boyle was nominated to a seat on the fourth circuit in then renominated in only to be left in limbo for more than five years without a vote on the floor today in order to manage a caseload of filings a year the court issues the lowest percentage of written opinions in the country and hears the second lowest percentage of oral arguments the vacancy rate is also leaving an imprint on jurisprudence in june judge diana gribbon motz ruled against the bush administration in an enemy combatant case while that decision once might have been overturned en banc the vacancies now make it impossible that shift isnt lost on democrats on the judiciary committee who see preserving vacancies through as a key way to influence the direction of the court as it hears cases on the cia the pentagon and the navy brig in charleston south carolina last week president bush added two new fourth circuit nominees to the list for senate consideration south carolina lawyer steve matthews and richmond virginia lawyer duncan getchell bringing to four the number awaiting a hearing getting them through will require home state senators to rally behind the judicial needs in their states and for republicans like south carolina senator lindsey graham to help sustain the pressure senate democrats are eager to appear reasonable by cherry picking a few nominees to confirm and skywriting about the progress district court judge jennifer elrod made it out of judiciary on wednesday for a seat on the fifth circuit to much self congratulatory senate fanfare but her lucky charm may have been the fact that she has never issued an opinion in her five years on the bench a qualification few nominees can hope to match republicans cant stop democrats from defeating nominees but they can force them to pay a political price the issue played a big part in gop senate gains in both and and it deserves to do so again next year if democrats continue their obstructionism with six months left for confirmation hearings the white house and senate republicans should start raising the volume on judicial nominations
