the weekend interview with the dalai lama st century monk dharamsala india so rupert murdoch is buying your newspaper " its unclear whether the dalai lamas private secretary is making small talk about news corporations impending takeover of dow jones or if hes obliquely reminding me of mr murdochs oft quoted reference to his boss as "a very political old monk shuffling around in gucci shoes " im momentarily flummoxed how does one reply when surrounded by monks but i recover as we make our way through clouds to the dalai lamas residence here in the himalayan foothills for more than years the man better known as "his holiness" or if youre in china the "splittist " "separatist" or the ultimate slight "politician" has been waging a peaceful campaign for a free tibet which was invaded by communist china in and has been brutally suppressed ever since his "middle way" diplomacy a talk and talk some more approach has produced distinctly middling results in the leadup to next summers beijing olympics the atrocities in tibet have barely been mentioned overshadowed by chinas weapons sales in darfur a world away over the border china is tightening its vise the state administration for religious affairs declared last month that all buddhist reincarnations must get government approval a move that sets the stage for beijing to name its own dalai lama once this one passes the partys "go west" campaign is flooding tibet with han chinese marginalizing the native tibetans and a wave of recent political crackdowns has been left largely unnoticed in the western press but the dalai lama seems unperturbed even buoyant he emerges from the mist shuffling down a footpath to minister to a waiting line of devotees he chats with a group of former tibetan special forces personnel who helped whisk him over the border in "lets take a photograph" then he tends to the sick "visit a doctor" and blesses visiting buddhist pilgrims in the line also stand two teenage tibetan schoolgirls whose father was imprisoned last month for standing up at tibets annual lithang horse racing festival and denouncing the local monks for cooperating with the communists sparking sympathetic protests and subsequent crackdowns all over the province "your father is a brave man " the he tells the ponytailed girls who look simultaneously awed and sad the secretary is translating for me in a jarringly perfect american accent he spent time in new jersey as a youth the girls had trekked over the himalayas to nepal and later to india and freedom like many of the approximately refugees who come here every year they may never see their family again the dalai lama the private secretary whispers in my ear grants each of them an audience upon his arrival in dharamsala moving into a sitting room we leave the misty courtyard behind there is room for cautious optimism for tibetans that things will improve in their homeland but perhaps not in the dalai lamas lifetime as china gets richer and citizens search for spiritual fulfillment underground religious movements are budding across the country last year more than mainland chinese trekked to southern india to hear the dalai lama preach according to the tibetan government in exile others now come to dharamsala to learn buddhism and then return to china when zhao ziyang chinas former premier passed away his family asked the dalai lama for a blessing "chinese society is now ruled by autocrats " the dalai lama says with a laugh as we start our formal interview "but the society is still chinese society " the new jersey infused private secretary sits nearby helping with translations when necessary "chinese society built many many buddhist temples now with a little liberalization or lenient policy their religious faith is now khare zego re tibetan for what is the word returning reviving including the buddhist faith " i must have looked surprised at his cheerful optimism "mmm " he murmurs shifting slightly in his chair authoritarian closed societies are "unpredictable " but the dalai lama insists that hes taking the right approach "we are not seeking independence " he says "we want a solution according to the chinese constitution " the constitution as his negotiators often remind beijing says "all nationalities in the peoples republic of china are equal " and adds "the state protects the lawful rights and interests of the minority nationalities and upholds and develops the relationship of equality unity and mutual assistance among all of chinas nationalities " beijing of course insists that this the "splittist" wants "independence " not autonomy that was true years ago through the upheaval of the great leap forward and the cultural revolution there wasnt much dialogue to be had with beijing in the early s as the cultural revolution was peaking the dalai lama decided to shift to a call for autonomy not independence as a sign of good faith at the time he described it as a "middle approach " since then the monk whos never been far from politics has tried to separate himself from the process to give it real legitimacy the tibetan government in exile founded a parliament in but in a new constitution the charter of tibetans in exile transferred the power to select its members to the tibetan people in the charter was amended to allow the direct election of the prime minister samdhong rinpoche a reincarnate lama himself "i have no longer any political status " the dalai lama emphasizes "i remain just a simple buddhist monk " he says "quiet " beijing hasnt responded in kind to these gestures if anything the relationship has deteriorated over six rounds of talks last year president hu jintaos administration launched an intensive round of attacks against the dalai lama calling him "unworthy" of being a religious leader chinas rhetorical venom has created a growing sense of fury in the tibetan exile community many tibetans worry that the communist party is playing a waiting game stringing along the tibetan negotiators until the dalai lama passes a fear that the buddhist leader acknowledges "theres certainly more and more signs of frustrations not only on our side but inside " the dalai lama admits a tibetan youth tried to immolate himself when mr hu visited mumbai last year another tried last month in tibet violent tendencies have been crushed by the communists but that doesnt mean they wont surface "the suicides the bombings these things its possible " the dalai lama acknowledges sighing slightly with his hands now open "but then we always ask people to keep keep peace " one way of doing that is to institutionalize the tibetan cause in the younger generation through private donations the tibetan government funds the tibetan childrens village a network of schools for refugee children others are educated at indian government funded institutions all teach tibetan language culture and a version of chinese history that would never see the light of day on the mainland "in the past tibetans particularly the nomads and also the farmers they simply carried their centuries old way of life completely ignorant about the current world " the dalai lama says "we buddhists must be buddhists of the st century " maybe thats why the secretary is following mr murdochs purchases so closely another way to perpetuate the movement especially inside china is to debunk the communist partys characterization of religion as a destabilizing force the dalai lama preaches what he dubs "secular ethics" the idea that there are common experiences that all people regardless of religious faith share in his view all spiritual traditions talk about basic concepts of love compassion forgiveness tolerance contentment self discipline while these ideas may come packaged in different philosophies the message is the same "the main thing is some kind of usefulness to others " he pauses "thats the meaning of life " he says leaning forward and pointing his finger at me gently despite his optimism theres little chance that the "middle way" will spark a breakthrough anytime soon from beijings perspective the dalai lamas return to tibet would galvanize tibetans to rally behind their leader and push for independence an example that china which has suppressed other ethnic groups such as the uighurs could not tolerate for the communist party tibet remains the third rail of politics a topic so sensitive that it turns mild mannered chinese bureaucrats red in the face at a mere mention the party toyed briefly with liberalization of the region in the s only to find tibetans gleefully displaying the dalai lamas image and calling for independence in a crackdown ensued overseen by now president hu then the party secretary of the tibet autonomous region since taking office mr hu has installed a loyal hard liner to oversee the area chinas economy is increasingly providing political cover for its suppression of tibet its too big and important to let a little bright light shine on human rights abuses in a far away land the dalai lamas cause is especially lonely in asia given chinas economic rise and its rapidly accruing military clout "very few" democracies in the region publicly support tibet with the notable exception of india which comes under pressure frequently from beijing the silence is deafening given that many asian democracies including those in japan and south korea are home to large populations of buddhists even western democratic nations come under intense pressure from beijing belgium cancelled an official visit with the dalai lama before an eu china meeting in may this year australian prime minister john howard hesitated to meet the buddhist leader in june but after intense lobbying from washington acquiesced germanys angela merkel is proving braver shes hosting the dalai lamas first ever visit to the german chancellery on sunday "when we look at tibet issue locally then almost hopeless " the dalai lama concedes but from a "wider perspective " the tibet cause is "always hopeful " recalling how the soviet union changed he muses for a moment on how china is developing "china is communist without communist ideology only power " he declares "so logically no future " the "only future" for china is "democracy rule of law free press religious freedom free information chinas future depends on these factors " thats something he adds that president hu must know "i really feel sympathy" for him the u s has always proved a strong supporter of the tibetan cause a close relationship that makes the dalai lama feel "proud " america he says is a "champion of democracy freedom and liberty so their full support means they recognize our struggle as a just cause and a moral issue " next months congressional gold medal award ceremony has sent the chinese embassy into high defensive gear but that hasnt stopped president bush from scheduling a private audience with the dalai lama "of course sometimes i have disagreement with president bush but as a person i always made clear personally i like him hes very straightforward " the dalai lama recalls "down to earth " house speaker nancy pelosi is a "close friend of me personally and i should say a close friend of tibet " as we end the dalai lama drapes a traditional white katag scarf around my neck and presents me with a pin depicting potala palace in lhasa his ancestral home then like a child might he throws his arms around me and whispers into my ear "we are passing through a difficult period " he says "one ancient nation with a unique heritage in a way dying so support from the free world is very much appreciated " but will the free world follow through ms kissel is the wall street
