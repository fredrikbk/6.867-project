health fighting the good fight a husband discovers just how much he can help his wife with alzheimers even after she leaves home after a remarkable and vibrant life my year old wife leah now has alzheimers disease last fall unable to care for her on my own i decided to place her in a skilled nursing facility as it turns out im working nearly as hard and leah needs me just as much as when she was living at home about million americans have alzheimers and nearly million americans care for someone with alzheimers or another dementia according to the alzheimers association www alz org the demands on caregivers for the most part are well known almost one third provide care for five years or more and more than report high levels of emotional stress less understood is the fact that placing a loved one in a nursing facility doesnt mean that a caregivers burdens vanish often it means trading one set of problems for another thats the situation in which i find myself with leah leah was a true original a feisty attractive and energetic reporter at a cleveland newspaper when i met her in doris odonnell a former friend of leahs and a fellow journalist wrote in a recent memoir of those days that male reporters in cleveland "had never faced a hustler like leah " who scooped them constantly we married the next year eventually we settled in new jersey this newspaper transferred me to new york in where leah ran the county chapter of the girl scouts and a scholarship fund for young women all while raising our three daughters she also tap danced for years including an appearance at an atlantic city n j hotel and took lessons from tap legends "honi" coles and charles "cookie" cook then almost years ago alzheimers began stealing her away in september we moved to a senior residential campus in new jersey one that offered assisted living and skilled nursing care if needed for almost two years i was able to care for leah on my own but it wore me down she woke up many times during the night she fell out of bed and resisted my getting her back in i couldnt face the thought of a nursing home but eventually i had no choice in august the campus doctor and i put leah in the communitys nursing facility where she now has her own room she lives only a minute walk from me even though the care leah receives is adequate much of the time my wife still needs an advocate with her nurses and aides the strain on the facilitys staff is evident turnover is high and not all employees are motivated to do their best simply put its up to me to be a nag for instance i try to visit leah at different times each day if the staff knows when im going to show up then they also know when to be involved with my wife and when they can ignore her my spur of the moment appearances might cause some resentment but i think they also mean that leah gets better care otherwise she can end up being "planted" in a wheelchair left to watch television or listen to music one big risk is over sedation recently leah became agitated biting her arms and drawing blood at first the nurses wrapped her arms in heavy elastic bandages she took them off then they resorted to heavy doses of medication which all but knocked her out i insisted that they reduce or eliminate the drugs so she could remain alert i had to speak with aides nurses supervisors and the doctor in charge who finally agreed to cut the dosage for the time being leah is awake and responsive or as much as she can be a friend of mine max nichols wrote a book about his wife mickey who had alzheimers family and friends made it a point early in mickeys stay in a nursing home to take her to lunch even alzheimers patients need social support as often as possible i bring leah to meals with friends when residents greet and speak with my wife her face brightens and her mood remains good for several hours of course taking leah out of the nursing facility means getting her dressed up beyond her usual t shirt and slacks the staff aides find it difficult to get leah dressed and to tend to her personal hygiene patients often push the helper away one patient in leahs facility once put both feet in one leg of her pants fell forward and broke her arm others including my wife end up urinating while seated in a wheelchair and can be there for an hour or more thats why its so important for me and other caregivers to push aides to take patients to the bathroom as often as possible that help though can be slow in coming one night i had to urge three aides to find my wifes principal aide to help take her to the bathroom in this facility aides are assigned to several specific patients and wont assist others a practice that ive been trying to get changed for months with only partial success leahs aide kept dragging her feet and when she finally did tend to my wife it was too late she had had an accident leah now has to sit at a table where all patients are being fed by aides but i have to keep reminding the aides that she will drink liquids only with a straw because she has difficulty holding the glass drinking lots of fluids is essential for alzheimers patients like leah who sit in wheelchairs such individuals if they drink too little are prone to bladder infections so its important that caregivers urge aides to push patients to drink juices and liquids a fact that often escapes the staff its not uncommon for an alzheimers patient to end up with food covered clothes aides provide a cloth bib for leah that attaches at the back of the neck to keep her as clean as possible but she fiddles with it scattering food which i clean up when im there i try to be patient leah may give me a sharp "no" when offered some food but then may agree to eat she will also often talk in "code " if shes having difficulty eating shell say "i cant get it in " then she will begin to accept food again its that balancing act wanting to help leah but recognizing that its just as important to step back at times that takes practice in the book "the hour day " nancy mace and peter rabins note that alzheimers patients often are confused by too much activity around them "if the person is having frequent catastrophic reactions try to reduce the confusion around them " the authors write "this might mean having fewer people in the room having less noise or turning off the tv the key is to simplify to reduce the number of signals that the impaired disoriented brain must sort out " with that in mind ive learned not to argue with leah alzheimers patients often dont know what theyre saying so its best to divert their attention or kid them out of their pushing you away one day i joked that i couldnt express my opinion because "i was running for office and didnt want to lose any votes " leah looked at me sternly and said "bull " it was as if she had recaptured a part of her tough and feisty past when leahs illness became full blown my oldest daughter laura said "i want my mother back " i know that wont happen even though leah is now in the hands of professionals i know whatever the quality of care that her situation will worsen with time i try to look forward and to live my own life on campus seeing movies listening to lectures attending musical events playing duplicate bridge and poker and participating in two internal tv shows on hobbies and issues of the day as difficult as it is i try not to grieve it only upsets me and those around me i do my best to handle each day one at a time i have no choice mr berton a former wall street journal reporter lives in new jersey he can be
