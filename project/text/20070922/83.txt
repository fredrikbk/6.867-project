weekend journal travel destinations virginias time machine an isolated fishing port for years tangier island now wants to sell its history tangier island va life on chesapeake bays tangier island hasnt changed much over the centuries theres no bridge to the mainland locals speak with a distinct dialect which can be traced back to the islands earliest settlers from th century cornwall in england life revolves around fishing church and chatting with neighbors over white picket fences now this quaint way of life is under threat crabbing isnt paying the bills anymore and many watermen are leaving to find jobs elsewhere some parents worry that for the first time their kids wont have any reason to stay when they grow up destinations have long played up their past from preserved shaker villages in kentucky to re enactments at colonial williamsburg tangier is now attempting something similar but for an era that is barely extinct the heyday of crabbing and oyster harvesting that has driven the islands economy for years new trips let visitors go out with watermen as they ply the chesapeake fishing for crabs free kayaks and canoes can be used to traverse the many waterways crisscrossing the island with only a handful of motorized vehicles on the island days and evenings are quiet the loudest sounds being the gentle buzzing of insects or the beeping of golf carts the most popular mode of transportation as they shift into reverse in some ways the scene is similar to the fishing villages of new england with neatly preserved colonial style homes lighthouses in the distance and seagulls calling near the shore theres a mile long white sand beach a short distance off the main road reachable by a small path with no shops or restaurants on the beach its generally quiet dolphins can sometimes be spotted offshore its the local culture that makes this place so fascinating most people here can trace their ancestry back to the th century when john crockett is said to have settled the island with his children today most are at least distantly related and have one of a few last names crockett pruitt and parks are the most common many families live in homes passed down for generations complete with ancestors buried in the back yards centuries of isolation and inside jokes have cultivated a quirky slang vocabulary no commonly means yes ugly can mean pretty the dialect spoken quickly with elongated vowels has hints of a southern drawl with a lilting english twist during winter months the chesapeake bay sometimes freezes over supplies have to be brought by helicopter bill pruitt years old grew up on tangier island quit high school in th grade and has been working on a crab boat ever since he says business hasnt been great in recent years a consequence of the rising cost of crabbing and environmental regulations that limit the number of licenses but hes not eager to be in the tourism business "thats not my cup of coffee " says mr pruitt who isnt one of the watermen taking tourists on day trips "im not one for entertaining " others arent willing to let outsiders interfere too much tangier is "dry " meaning no alcohol is sold in stores or restaurants in keeping with most residents strict christian beliefs although most residents say theyre not bothered by drinking in moderation in the late s the people of tangier famously refused to let the kevin costner film "message in a bottle" be shot on the island when they learned some scenes would involve drinking and sex in the fall daytime highs reach into the s but the humidity is less oppressive than in the peak summer season making for breezy afternoons and cool evenings although day trippers have long popped over to tangier for a few hours of eating crab cakes and lying on the beach islanders are hoping slice of life watermen packages will encourage overnight stays access to the island is limited to a few ferries from maryland and virginia locals also use the daily mail boat from maryland "williamsburg is fine but this is not a reenactment this is real " says dan kauffman a seafood business specialist at virginia techs seafood agricultural research and extension center researchers there work with the states fishing industry to help businesses stay competitive the idea of using tourism to offset the rising costs of crabbing in tangier came up two years ago during brainstorming sessions with some of the locals mr kauffman says tangiers gentle pace belies the struggle locals have to keep up with changing times "its getting harder and harder to make it " says james eskridge considered one of the youngest and best watermen in tangier when mr eskridge graduated high school in the eight boys from his class all went to work as watermen he says since then everyone but mr eskridge has left to find other work mr eskridges father james "ooker" eskridge is the mayor and one of the watermen encouraging others to bring tourists aboard the elder mr eskridge rises at a m and he uses the same crab shanty as his grandfather at a local restaurant his wife serves up soft shell crab caught that morning in the afternoons mr eskridge leads tours of the shanties where visitors watch the crabs leave their hard outer shells and swell to one third larger than their original size he says hell also pull up a cage full of eels hes caught letting tourists touch
