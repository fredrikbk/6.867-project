ddt does take its toll on some people in response to steven milloys aug letter to the editor "ddt scaremongering will take human toll" mr milloy describes our study as "statistical malpractice " our paper was published in a highly respected scientific journal and the manuscript was carefully peer reviewed by scientists whose identity is unknown to us but who are experts in the subject area including statistics although the sample size was not large the study was hypothesis driven not a fishing expedition and the subjects came from a very high quality prospective study the best design for such research and one rarely available the exposures were measured using biomarkers another strength the findings presented were not "correlations" simply two way relationships but "associations" that enabled us to adjust for multiple confounding factors without which results might be obscured or inflated the factors that we did not include genetics and family history might change the magnitude of the effects but they are unlikely to change the overall results or their statistical significance because they have not ever been found to be correlated with the exposures we agree that malaria is a terrible disease whose eradication may save many lives and that ddt has played an important role in malaria control in third world countries however its potential harmful effects should be recognized in addition to breast cancer reproductive effects in women including premature delivery and shortened lactation have been demonstrated recent evidence also suggests impaired neurological function in infants exposed prenatally to ddt taken as a whole this body of evidence would suggest that prevention of ddt exposure among humans may be warranted reducing exposure may be possible by using prudent approaches to pesticide application or substitutes in sum while malaria control is a pressing public health issue world wide the side effects of ddt are not zero and a balanced view should be encouraged barbara a cohn ph d piera m cirillo m p h robert i sholtz m s mary s wolff ph d public health institute mount sinai school of medicine oakland calif see related letter "letters to the editor full alert skepticism on ddt exposure study" wsj sept
