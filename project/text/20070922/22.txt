green thumb the climate for investing or vice versa could global warming burn your portfolio as climate change emerges as a hot topic in corporate boardrooms and on the political stage investors are scrambling to figure out how the reams of newly available data about companies"carbon footprints" and other environmental risks should influence their investment decisions several tools are aimed at helping investors sort out the future winners from the losers on monday former president bill clinton will release the results of the carbon disclosure project a survey requesting data from public companies on how they manage climate change risk the report accompanied by online materials cataloging hundreds of companies self reported carbon emissions and energy costs was conducted for more than institutional investors including goldman sachs group inc and calpers the california pension fund advocates for this kind of disclosure argue that climate change is a bottom line risk that investors should factor in its "no different from litigation risk or hazardous waste risks or anything else disclosed in normal financial filings " says mindy lubber of ceres an organization focused on corporate governance and sustainability climate change regulations are already affecting business more than states including california and illinois have already passed laws related to global warming and business leaders and policy makers say additional federal legislation is likely within the next few years regulations like these could drive up costs for some companies by putting a price on emitting greenhouse gases citigroup recently downgraded coal stocks for among other issues the uncertainty of future costs associated with carbon emissions yet investors are struggling to obtain reliable information about companies exposures to costs like these in recent days a coalition of investors and corporate governance groups filed a petition with the securities and exchange commission urging the agency to force public companies to disclose potential impacts of global warming on their businesses in financial statements also recently new york states attorney general andrew cuomo subpoenaed five power companies to determine whether they disclosed enough information to investors about the financial risks of coal fired power plants there are some steps individual investors can take to filter through the new data the place to start is with sec filings check a companys k or its annual report and read "management discussion &amp analysis" to see if climate change is listed there as a risk that means the management thinks the threat is "material " but it can also help you gauge if the company is focused on the risk the amount of disclosure varies french insurance firm axa group goes into comparative detail in its filings it says that in the insurance industry climate change is "more important than interest rate risk " by contrast some oil companies only briefly address the effect that climate change and regulatory pressures could have on their business watch what companies omit last year about half of the firms in the s&amp p published "sustainability reports" outlining their commitment to environmental issues a study of them by the global reporting initiative which encourages disclosure of environmental strategies found that reports focused on positive impacts of climate change such as new business opportunities from clean energy while ignoring risks also look within sectors for clues to how similar companies are reacting differently

auto makers the risk to big emitters of carbon dioxide is that tightening regulations might require them to cut back or buy carbon "credits" from others there is a cost to do either a recent auto report by innovest estimates a cost of euros &# per ton for auto makers to reduce of their current carbon dioxide emissions that matters because some auto makers have higher overall carbon emissions than others data on overall carbon emissions can be tough to find but are outlined on some corporate web sites and carbon reports the carbon disclosure project is one place to gather data the cdps web site www cdproject net will have firm specific reports on hundreds of companies some analysts also suggest looking at company management to see if executives have made public statements about issues like these "you can assess the degree to which the ceo is proactively addressing climate change " says fred wellington of the world resources institute in washington all this is an inexact science the data are self reported and even companies are struggling to figure out exactly how to measure the impact on their own bottom lines "theres a profit and loss impact for us but its not an easy thing to get your head around " says douglas eu chief executive of allianz global investors asia pacific email jane spencer wsj com and carolyn cui wsj com smoking out good investments go to cdproject net for
