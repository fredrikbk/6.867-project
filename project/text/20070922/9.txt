cross country mass testing boston massachusetts gov deval patrick has produced one surprise after another since taking office nine months ago he stunned people by spending &# on office curtains by suggesting that union construction workers be asked to find illegal immigrants at job sites and by saying that the terrorist attacks were partly about "the failure of human beings to understand each other and to learn to love each other " but his biggest surprise is the scope of a planned overhaul of what is probably the nations best public school system a reform effort he calls his "readiness project " he has asked for reports on proposals ranging from making school days longer to dropping tuition in community colleges the fear is that hes about to emasculate testing requirements put in place more than a decade ago its not an irrational fear the governor is strongly supported by labor unions that oppose the tests has appointed a testing critic to the board of education and aims to kill school district performance audits back in the school year the bay state instituted rigorous testing requirements including exams th graders must pass in order to graduate from high school massachusetts students usually do well on the exams of the national assessment of educational progress but fourth graders and eighth graders in the past two years came in first or statistically tied for first in both english and mathematics on the naep no state had ever done that many credit the success to the states testing regime the massachusetts comprehensive assessment system mcas and the reforms that came with it including money inflation adjusted state aid to local education has doubled since unlike the dumbed down standards of some states the mcas "proficiency" award tracks well with the same naep designation a writer for the liberal washington monthly said in when the tests were given for the first time "the mcas and the reforms that have come with it may be the best thing to happen to poor students in a generation in terms of improving the quality of their education " each student gets five chances to pass english and math exams and may continue to try after leaving school eighty seven percent of the class of passed both on the first try an increase from last year and for the class of more than two thirds achieved a "proficiency" rating after five tries pass even a majority of dropouts have passed the tests are sophisticated english requires a brief essay math requires a showing of the work on some questions for which partial credit is possible the anti testers however arent happy "in states throughout the country student assessment is done with multiple measures including course work projects in depth study and grades along with standardized test scores " two of them wrote earlier this year gov patrick insists he supports mcas as one measure of achievement in announcing his "readiness project" in june he said "being ready means public education that is about the whole child not just success on a single standardized test " thats the kind of language that can be code for junking standardized tests former state senate president tom birmingham a democrat and rhodes scholar is from chelsea mass a gritty boston suburb with schools so bad that they were given to boston university to run in the s he worked with three republican governors to strengthen education he found the governors appointment of ruth kaplan an activist and founder of the alliance for the education of the whole child to the board of education "troubling " and he has said that his "understanding of ruth is that shes janey one note" against mcas james peyser chairman of the board of education until last year also says he "worries" about ms kaplans appointment as does former board of education member roberta schaefer she fears the governor "is about to gut" the testing requirement by making it just one of several measuring sticks schools use gov patrick has already demonstrated a willingness to bend to union desires in january the state labor relations commission ordered the boston teachers union to back off of a threat to call a strike gov patricks response was to propose a budget that would zero out the commission the legislature funded it anyway the legislature however went along with his proposal to get rid of another union bugbear the office of educational quality and assessment the eqa examines the performance of dozens of school districts across the state each year and according to an analysis of eqa reports by the boston based pioneer institute of those districts had curricula that did not meet state standards their students could have been facing mcas without having been taught some of the material on the tests the governor this year recommended defunding the agency and the legislature agreed giving it just enough funding to wind up its work ms schaefer calls the move "a mistake " instead she says the agency "should have been strengthened " so far many of the people the governor has turned to help him institute reforms dispute the idea that the governor will water down standards one of whom is paul reville hes a lecturer at harvard and in the early s was instrumental in helping to create mcas this year the governor tapped him to be the new chairman of the state board of education if the governor did want to dilute mcas he said recently "i hardly think he would have chosen me to be chairman " chris anderson executive director of the massachusetts high technology council and a member of the board of education says the state needs to do better and not view "the other states as competitors " instead massachusetts educators need to worry about india and china but the fact that debates over education center on whether the state will backslide is a bad sign massachusetts should be pressing ahead closing the achievement gap between white and minority students for one thing not resting on its laurels the governor wants reform but if he wants better schools hell need good testing mr darst is a retired deputy editorial page editor of the boston herald see related letters "letters to the
