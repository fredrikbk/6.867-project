weekend journal entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies a stretch too far why distorted flat panel pictures are ruining tv shows and movies wherever i go these days homes bars restaurants airports hotel rooms i see beautiful flat panel tvs displaying awful distorted pictures yet no one seems to notice or care i feel like a guy spouting off about the emperors new clothes except this emperors problem is that his wardrobe doesnt fit why should anyone care and what does it have to do with movies first things first why it happens american television is moving inexorably if belatedly from analog to digital and from conventional to high definition broadcasting at the moment though were in a period of higgledy piggledy transition thanks to bungling by the government which is increasingly befuddled by new technologies and to resistance by broadcasters and consumers almost all flat panel tvs are tailored to the proportions of hi def transmission they have screens with aspect ratios but they dont all receive hi def signals and most programs are still being beamed conventionally in a squarish format that was never meant to fill a wide screen many owners of wide screen tvs dont make the distinction since they paid a premium for the width they want their programs to fill the screen never mind that programs are correctly displayed on panels only with black bars flanking the image so people set their tvs to stretch the picture or allow their tvs to set themselves either way the result is distortion compact cars resemble stretch limos puffy faces look like their cheeks have been pulled out in opposite directions as a movie critic i try to tell myself that its only tv moviegoers can still find impressive images on theater screens where projection has actually improved in recent years but condescension toward television doesnt wash as everyone who watches tv knows some programs and series are terrific lots better than the average feature films that fill the multiplexes and everyone watches tv which is one reason i obsess about the visual quality of what theyre watching if people dont care what they see then what future can there be for the dazzlingly powerful and proportionate images ive been smitten by ever since i was a kid it doesnt pay to obsess about things you cant change but i forget that each time i find myself a captive audience in a hotel room with a flat panel tv thats been set to stretch every picture it processes the setting cant be switched with the hotel remote you need the remote that came with the display but getting your hands on one can drive you crazy first comes a call to the front desk "theres something wrong with my tv i need the remote that came with it so i can fix it " the response may vary by hotel or region but in new york its always the same "ill send up the engineer " rather than being a designer of airplanes or skyscrapers the engineer is more likely to be a bleak overworked handyman who looks at the tv and says "its fine " not really i begin hating my obsessive self as i start to explain yet again why the picture is cockeyed sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt i had so much trouble communicating with the last engineer who may have been russian that i pinched my cheeks and pulled them out to demonstrate the problem the man stared at me as if i were insane but he did bring the remote watched patiently as i changed the setting and then shrugged a semi private it takes all kinds shrug before moving on to another nut job in another room in the course of my obsessing ive sometimes wondered how such ubiquitous distortion and the publics indifference to it affects the people who create those dazzling images on the big screen cinematographers of the first rank writing this confessional gave me an excuse to call two of the best shooters i know caleb deschanel said the way his films get stretched on tv bothers him a lot and public indifference puzzles him "it is odd when people dont notice that actors or even basketball players seem to have put on pounds but all sorts of things in modern society bother me kids in their s and s think absolutely nothing of stealing intellectual property on the internet " john bailey is not a heavy tv watcher "im the guy who finally got rid of my year old pioneer square screen tv not long ago and i only did that when the sound went out " but he acknowledged the subjects crazy making potential "it makes you ask the question what the hell am i doing what are we all doing once you get beyond the theatrical exhibition its a free for all but you really can go crazy if you start to think of the downstream implications the only thing i feel i can control and shoot for is to make negatives or show prints as good as they can be then if they go back and remaster something years later at least the archival material is of the highest quality " thats good philosophical advice and i plan to take it the next time im tempted to make a call that will summon the engineer ill call room service and order a drink morgensterns picks square pegs its a stretch to think that viewers wouldnt notice if these dvds of movies made for a squarish screen were stretched to fit a newfangled wide one beauty may be in the eye of the beholder but a prescribed aspect ratio isnt and the ratio to be set here is the cowboy and the lady gary cooper plays stretch willoughby a rodeo cowboy and merle oberon is mary smith yes people had names like that in those days a socialite whose father is running for president the plot contrivance that brings them together is silly even though the credited writers include s n behrman gene fowler lillian hellman anita loos and dorothy parker todays movies often come equipped with a dozen or more credited producers still the performances are pleasant and in keeping with our theme of visual integrity the cinematographer was no less a light than the great gregg toland who shot "citizen kane " monty pythons flying circus the shows in the discs of this set were originally shot to fit a squarish tv screen but the tv medium couldnt possibly contain them generations of entertainers to come were influenced by these sketches which are of variable quality and by the revolutionary comic anarchists in them such masters in the making as john cleese terry gilliam graham chapman michael palin terry jones and eric idle among my favorites are the dead parrot sketch and of course john cleeses ministry of silly walks oh yes one of the original working titles for the series was "owl stretching time " yellow sky gregory peck is james "stretch" dawson the leader of a band of bank robbers on the run from a posse stretch and his boys stumble into what seems to be a ghost town but is colorfully inhabited in a beautifully photographed black and white film with a color in its title by a prospector and his granddaughter who is played by anne baxter the movie which came out the same year as "the treasure of sierra madre " is much more interesting than it sounds peck and baxter under the direction of the great william a wellman come alive from the moment they first meet
