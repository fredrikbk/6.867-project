moving past fee based accounts with the deadline looming for brokers to shut their fee based brokerage accounts many wall street firms are trying to entice these clients into more expensive advisory accounts as a result of a federal court decision firms have until oct to end their fee based brokerage programs a popular account in which clients typically pay an annual fee for an unlimited number of transactions along with basic investing advice the problem the court ruled last spring brokers were giving advice without being registered as investment advisers about a million investors at firms such as merrill lynch &amp co morgan stanley and ubs ag with assets totaling about &# billion are going to have to move out of fee based brokerage accounts at many firms the accounts will automatically revert to traditional brokerage accounts which charge a commission for each trade but firms have been trying to entice clients instead to move to another type of account known in the industry as a fee based nondiscretionary advisory account with these accounts which can hold individual stocks and bonds mutual funds exchange traded funds and cash investments investors can get more comprehensive advice from a registered investment adviser but still call the final shots since the adviser must get the clients permission before making changes to help lure clients into its strategic advisor account ubs this summer lowered the investment minimums to &# from &# in investable assets citigroup inc s smith barney has a minimum investment for its smith barney advisor program of &# which it recently broadened to include household assets most affected is merrill lynch the largest player in fee based brokerage accounts with about &# billion in assets the firm is pitching its nondiscretionary advisory account known as merrill lynch personal advisor as the main alternative to fee based brokerage accounts merrill brokers say merrill declined to comment on the transition saying it is in the process of communicating changes to its clients wall streets efforts to promote the advisory accounts got a boost this past week the securities and exchange commission issued a temporary rule letting brokerage firms enter into so called principal transactions in which clients buy securities from the firms own inventory in these nondiscretionary advisory accounts as long as they provide proper disclosure previously principal transactions often werent available in these accounts without getting written disclosure for each and every trade due to conflict of interest concerns now that disclosure can be oral the sec rule will expire at the end of firms say the rule will let them offer clients better pricing on securities or access to ipo shares smith barney for example says it will offer taxable and municipal bonds on a principal basis in smith barney advisor so are these new advisory accounts right for you for one thing investors with smaller amounts to invest may pay more an extra or higher for the advice they get in an advisory account than they did in a fee based brokerage account where annual fees average of total assets also many investors will have to open a new account to transfer money into an advisory program there is typically no paperwork to sign if the firm defaults you into a traditional brokerage account an advisory account is often suited for people looking for an adviser to review their portfolios offer advice and build a strategy without having to worry about how the adviser is getting paid but for investors who are looking for periodic stock tips and who dont make a lot of trades the most economical move may be to a commission based brokerage account which charges per transaction wealthier investors meanwhile who want to hand over their money management to someone else may want to move to one of their firms managed accounts where they could end up paying fees ranging from to of assets a year another factor to consider in order to offer an advisory account the advisers at brokerage firms must act as fiduciaries a legal standard requiring that they act solely in your best interest with a traditional brokerage account brokers are held to a lower "suitability" standard which means they are required only to offer investments suitable to a clients needs most brokerage firm clients arent likely to see any disruption in their holdings during the changeover although some investors in moving to an advisory relationship may be encouraged to change their asset allocation if their portfolio isnt diversified d a davidson &amp co a brokerage firm in great falls mont which launched a nondiscretionary advisory account in july has converted about half of its accounts in its fee based brokerage program to the new account dubbed choice account on oct if clients havent made a decision their accounts will default into a commission based account "my expectation is that probably or more will convert to choice if not by the first of october then by the first of the calendar year " says jim searles senior vice president some firms are trying to ease their clients transition to a new pricing structure smith barney which isnt using a traditional brokerage account as its default friday automatically converted clients in its fee based brokerage accounts to its smith barney advisor program which it rolled out in for now the firm hasnt changed the pricing for these clients even though the new accounts carry higher fees but clients could see their fees change if they decide to put together a new asset allocation plan or make other changes meanwhile morgan stanley which will automatically convert its fee based brokerage clients to traditional brokerage accounts on oct is giving brokers flexibility to provide some discounts on commissions says a spokesman morgan stanley last month launched a nondiscretionary advisory account with investment minimums of &# it now is looking at
