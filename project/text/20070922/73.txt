weekend journal food &amp drink hows your drink mixing it up with cognac with no little fanfare courvoisier is rolling out a new cognac meant to slay the vodka beast exclusif as it is called is being described as the "first ever cognac made for mixing " and to prove it they did a sort of pepsi challenge "in a blind cocktail taste test among target consumers " proclaims the press release exclusif drinks "received better scores than vodka based cocktails " now im not the least bit surprised that there are cocktails that taste better with brandy than vodka but i do think it is a stretch to suggest that this is a function of this particular cognac having some uniquely mixable property if brandy hadnt been mixable all along why does patrick gavin duffys classic "the official mixers manual " contain some cognac based cocktails when the cocktail was a toddler in the s one of the most common mixed drinks was made of brandy sugar and bitters i have yet to meet a well made v s cognac that doesnt play nice with other ingredients in a cocktail shaker that being said the new courvoisier is a very good youngish brandy with a light pleasant fruitiness perhaps more important to its success than the taste of the spirit however will be the style of its package exclusif comes in a tall slightly flared bottle clearly meant to be within the aesthetic comfort zone of drinkers accustomed to slender vodka bottles and likely put off by the squat shape of courvoisiers traditional container i also think that the price is an essential part of the marketing and that it has been set somewhat high on purpose you can get a good cocktail friendly v s cognac for under &# exclusif sells for about &# a price that i suspect is meant to lure the status conscious what to make with exclusif or any decent cognac for that matter courvoisier suggests some options including a traditional champagne cocktail of brandy champagne and sugar so far so good but we can do much better than the other offerings a cosmo made with cognac and a courvoisier strawberry lemonade each a waste of good brandy i think a better prospect for reviving cognacs fortunes is the sort of drink made when brandy was in its cocktail prime of which one of the best is the between the sheets a variation on the sidecar the drink combines cognac rum cointreau and lemon juice together with a suggestive title one might be inclined to pass up the between the sheets cocktail on basic principle as a rule the naughtier the name the worse the cocktail happily for the sake of taste in both senses of the word we are past the heyday of such embarrassments as the sex on the beach slippery nipple and screaming orgasm such drinks are almost always cloyingly sweet reflecting a certain lack of maturity in the taste buds that matches a sensibility amused by cartoon sexuality sex on the beach is made with vodka peach schnapps and chambord together with cranberry juice cocktail and pineapple juice in other words one sugary ingredient after another spiked with bland vodka and without anything sour astringent or bitter to balance the sweetness the most obnoxious of these drinks all seem to involve baileys irish cream loaded with sugar and dairy baileys is a favorite of neophyte drinkers eager to ingest alcohol without tasting it in particular the drinks with naughty names tend to be what are called shooters shot glass sized concoctions meant to be tossed back in a gulp thus the slippery nipple is baileys and sambuca in a shot glass the screaming orgasm is baileys kahlua amaretto and vodka and thats just the drinks that can actually be named if just barely in a respectable newspaper popular in australia it seems is a shooter made of baileys and butterscotch liqueur the drinks elaborate and unprintable title vividly describes a "cowboy" engaged in an activity the supreme court adjudicated in bowers v hardwick frankly i cant decide which is more distasteful the lewd logo or a drink of baileys and butterscotch liqueur and that drink is hardly the worst of the nadir scraping lot i suspect that the vulgar and scatological names serve a dual purpose there is the supposed humor yucking it up if you will but they also provide a cheap and easy way to indulge in an action movie aesthetic belly up to the bar and call out a string of pseudo tough expletives and you get rewarded with a sweet creamy trifle one could say of cocktails what humphrey bogart says of elisha cook jr s gunsel in "the maltese falcon" "the cheaper the crook the gaudier the patter " "between the sheets" may have been slightly scandalous in its day but the title was in keeping with the aesthetic of the time which called for allusion rather than the blunter sort of anglo saxonisms the cocktail itself also exhibits somewhat more subtlety than the shooters that would later assume the naughty drink mantle the sweet orange liqueur is balanced with the tart acidity of the lemon juice and neither overwhelms the brandy and rum at the core of the cocktail it is also a drink that rewards tinkering with any cocktail that involves an orange liqueur i experiment with the options everything from generic triple sec or curacao to the more individualistic brand names to see which works best the traditional between the sheets recipe calls for cointreau and it is certainly a successful drink so made but when mixing with cognac its worth trying grand marnier an orange liqueur that is brandy based i found that it makes the drink better other improvements can be made the early published versions of between the sheets specify light unaged rum whereas i think an aged rum such as the year old barbancourt from haiti harmonizes best with the brandy over the years some have substituted lime juice for the lemon just as some authors have championed the same substitution in the sidecar ill stick with the lemon juice but the lime is a worthy alternative though you can make the between the sheets cocktail
