restaurateurs are running afoul of rules designed to protect peoples personal data smaller shops have proven ill prepared for the complexities of safeguarding credit card information since more than of the instances of unauthorized access to card data have involved small merchants according to visa usa inc the largest payment card network these businesses account for of the seven million locations nationwide that accept plastic according to visa all merchants are supposed to follow card industry rules to prevent account information from falling into the wrong hands but the industry has generally focused on larger retailers for instance starting oct big merchants face fines of &# a month for noncompliance many small merchants arent even aware that the rules exist these store owners "are provided with no information and sometimes with erroneous information " says anita boomstein a lawyer at hughes hubbard &amp reed llp who represents small merchants among them roger rehmke owner of lodi beer a microbrewery and restaurant in lodi calif in january lodi beer was identified as a common point of purchase among some cardholders whose accounts had been compromised exposing them to potential fraud it was then that mr rehmke discovered his computer system had stored account data on customers a violation of card industry rules which prohibit retailers from retaining some of this information on their local computers he says he had no idea about the violation "all someone had to do is tell us you cant do that " he says "we would have changed it " the magnetic strips on the backs of credit cards contain cardholders names and account numbers expiration dates and security codes used to authorize certain purchases when a consumer uses a card the merchants computer captures that information yet storing that data puts cardholders at risk computer hackers who get their hands on the information can use it to make fraudulent purchases consumers typically arent liable for fraudulent purchases on their credit cards but the theft of card data can still create big headaches particularly if the information is used to create a fake identity industry experts recommend that cardholders scour their account statements regularly and report irregularities as soon as they are spotted u s financial institutions that issue credit cards incurred a record &# billion of losses from fraud last year up from according to nilson report an industry newsletter based in carpinteria calif most credit card fraud by dollar volume tied to merchants occurs because hackers broke into the networks of big retailers there are no nationwide laws against storing card data indeed the card industry lets merchants store some data but its rules prohibit storing the most sensitive information such as the special three digit or four digit security codes that sometimes are on the back of cards despite those rules a recent survey of more than businesses with fewer than employees found that of them were storing sensitive customer information on their computers according to visa and the national federation of independent business a trade group "you wonder how they got hacked and then you find that there is no security on their system whatsoever " says bryan sartin vice president of cybertrust inc a data security firm hired by mr rehmke until recently card industry efforts to educate small merchants were haphazard on july visa international inc s visa usa began requiring about card processors to submit plans for getting small businesses to comply with the rules visa and mastercard inc are working with small business organizations and data security firms to spread the word in february local police told ohio restaurant owners richard and paulette schnipke that some of their customers cards had been compromised the schnipkes say there were surprised to discover that their computer system was storing card information "when we purchased the computer system and saw that the account numbers werent showing up on the customer receipt i just assumed we were compliant " says mrs schnipke whose family owns red pig inn restaurants in the towns of findlay and ottawa lodi beers problems started when mr rehmkes wife sam who handles the books noticed that the restaurants checking account wasnt reflecting credit card deposits after several phone calls the couple learned that patrons had experienced fraud on their cards although there was no conclusive evidence that hackers had broken into lodi beers system its card processor abanco international llc decided to freeze its account which caused the rehmkes to bounce several checks credit and debit cards account for about of their restaurants sales an audit of lodi beers computer system revealed that it had been storing cardholders data including account numbers for three years the couple has since spent thousands of dollars to upgrade the computer system visa and mastercard fined abanco &# for lodi beers noncompliance abanco passed on the fine to the rehmkes the equivalent of five days of sales michael rosenbloom a lawyer for abanco says the company didnt typically provide recommendations to its customers about data security card processing contracts he explains call for merchants to follow card industry rules still he concedes that its "a little bit far fetched" to think that merchants will know that they must "actually go on the visa web site and review the rules " in april abanco sold its merchant processing business to new york based cynergy data the biggest merchants face the toughest requirements because they are most often targeted by hackers yet only of the nations largest merchants have proven that they are in compliance according to visa since october visa has levied &# million in fines against processing companies whose large merchant customers arent following the rules mastercard doesnt disclose fine totals while most large retailers upgrade their computer systems regularly using one of the dozens of versions of payment software that has visas stamp of approval that isnt the case for small merchants many of them grow comfortable with one type of software in may minnesota passed the plastic card security act which prohibits companies doing business in the state from storing sensitive card information the law which took effect in august makes violators liable for costs associated with computer breaches or fraud brad friedlander who owns two cleveland restaurants says he has paid about &# for fines and computer upgrades after being alerted by law enforcement officials of a possible security breach "i had passwords and a firewall " says mr friedlander "i thought i was doing everything i was supposed to do im not a computer person "
