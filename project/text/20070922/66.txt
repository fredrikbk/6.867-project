contemporary pieces collector and philanthropist louise blouin macbain just auctioned off &# million worth of hermes handbags manolo blahnik shoes and furniture from two of her homes and an anonymous european seller is parting with pieces including works by andy warhol edward ruscha and furniture designer marc newson these sales and a host of other prominent works headed for the auction block in london in a few weeks are sending a ripple through the art market with an unusual number of works up for sale some dealers and collectors say they are concerned about signs of potential weakness in what has been a gravity defying market for years now some dealers are referring to the series of london auctions that kicks off oct as "judgment week" a potentially watershed moment market players will be watching the level of bidding for signs that a downturn is at hand the sheer volume of works planned for sale is fueling the nervous buzz christies has estimated the works it will have on the block at its major london sales in october at &# million compared with the &# million it made at those sales last year and &# million in sothebys is selling works at its london auctions next month compared with last year and the year before the london sales come at a time when the art markets anxiety level about a bursting bubble is reaching new heights turbulence in the financial markets has some collectors and dealers worried about wall streets woes spilling into the art world to be sure concern that the art market may slow has been a persistent theme in recent years but the market keeps defying the naysayers a few years ago contemporary dealers pointed to julian schnabel whose average annual selling price fell by between and as the harbinger of a downturn in the high end art market began to panic after a chinese art sale in new york turned up disappointing profits with sothebys moving only of its works its weakest returns since the early s when a financial crisis throughout asia prompted a crash in nearly every area of collecting through all of this though the overall market has continued to climb christies auction in new york this past may broke the record for the top sale of post war and contemporary art that evening andy warhols "green car crash green burning car i " from sold for &# million fall auctions especially tend to be fraught with uncertainty because the art world largely goes on vacation from june through september when auctions are barely held many dealers go away for july and august the season typically kicks off in september with smaller auctions in new york the first major sales of the season take place in london during "frieze week" in october thats when collectors from around the world flood the city for the frieze art fair a major contemporary event started four years ago by the founders of frieze a european art and culture magazine these sales focus primarily on younger contemporary artists who have seen steep price increases at auction in the past few years the biggest fall sales come in november in new york when collectors gather for key auctions of modern impressionist and contemporary works the soaring prices for art in recent years partly reflect booming financial markets with hedge fund managers delving into collecting and the creation of new wealth in russia and china those factors have fueled speculative investments from stocks to real estate in the case of art however the attraction is twofold investment potential combined with the social cachet of owning important works last fall christies set a new record for money spent at auction in a single evening when its november sale of impressionist and modern art in new york brought in &# million in june a stainless steel cabinet containing handcrafted and painted pills by damien hirst broke the record for highest price paid at auction for a work by a living artist &# million but now speculative investments of all sorts are coming under increased scrutiny in the wake of the subprime real estate lending meltdown at the same time wall street bonuses are expected to drop this year which could see people curtailing spending on luxuries like contemporary art works the art market has suffered from the woes of financial sectors before in the early s problems in the real estate market set off a freeze in speculative investment and luxury spending that contributed to the collapse of the art market hope tate is a banker at fine art capital who back then worked at citibank on a series of defaulted art backed loans sparked by a serious correction in the real estate market as people were called on their real estate loans she says they were more likely to default on their art loans james sproule an economist in london who collects art himself says that he predicts this fall will witness a correction in the art market after years of swiftly rising prices "its judgment time and it will be very interesting to see who weathers the storm " he says some dealers and collectors say its possible that the speculative excess seen in contemporary art could come down to earth while the broader market continues to thrive in some cases the mere possibility of a downtown in the art market may have been enough to get sellers to bring works to auction "the art market is fueled by rumors and there has been a lot of naysaying recently " says cristin tierney who runs a fine arts advisory service in new york most sellers in the fall auctions consigned works in june as headlines about mortgage woes began appearing almost daily phillips de pury held its first frieze week auction last year this year it is ramping up its schedule to compete with the other houses holding four auctions on a single day in london three are single owner collections where an individual is selling off a range of pieces marino golinelli an italian collector chemist and philanthropist is auctioning off contemporary works including a christopher wool painting on alumnium estimated for &# to &# one of a few s artists to survive the market crash of the early s mr wools work has had strong sales at auction in recent years going for nearly &# million in some cases in the early s mr wool developed a new form of abstract expressionism that uses media such as spray paint rollers alumnium and paper john l stewart is auctioning works the same day all russian contemporary art mr stewart a top collector of contemporary american art started collecting work by russian artists in the s often directly from the artists themselves one of the most important works in the sale is a piece by erik bulatov a forerunner of art that rebelled against soviet idealogy and transgressed its social norms his seminal work "soviet cosmos" is considered among the earliest works from the "sots art" movement which used irony and pop art to critique the soviet state it is estimated to sell for &# million to &# million neither mr golinelli nor mr stewart could be reached for comment some experts say the auction houses themselves are partly fueling the selling craze by issuing more guarantees to sellers to encourage them to sell when an auction house guarantees a sale it promises upfront to pay the seller a certain amount for the work regardless of whether the work of art actually achieves that amount at auction as of aug sothebys had outstanding guarantees of &# million according to an sec filing on aug during an aug conference call about earnings with securities analysts sothebys ceo william ruprecht said that this years outstanding guarantees works for which the auction house has guaranteed a price to the seller but has not yet been sold are the highest ever revenues related to guarantees refer to the net amount the auction house keeps after selling a guaranteed work and paying off the seller revenues related to guarantees were &# million lower for the first half of compared with the first half of according to an sec filing in its filings sothebys said the returns in the first half of were unusually high because of one guaranteed work that brought in a particularly high price jussi pylkkanen president of christies europe attributes the large number of works being sold to the prominence and popularity of the london fall auctions rather than to sellers concerns about the market "the frieze week has established itself as an extraordinary moment in the collecting world with an influx of international collectors " he says the fall auction season began earlier this month with christies first open sale and sothebys contemporary art sale in new york both of which feature less prominent works while both auctions brought in dollar figures well above presale estimates christies sold of its inventory less than it had in the past two years when it began holding the sale jonathan laib head of the first open sale at christies says that the sale is "a more risky undertaking" than the day and evening sales in may and november because the first open sale doesnt "solely go for the safe values " despite wall streets woes some experts say they dont expect to see a big drop in auction buyers at a time when many top spending collectors are based in russia asia and the middle east philip hoffman who runs the fine art fund in london an art investment fund says that while the credit crunch might cut out or of buyers there is already a new group of collectors on the scene to replace them "i met with a representative of four or five russian families today who have decided they want to invest &# million to &# million in art and want our advice " says mr hoffman who worked at christies for more than a decade mr hoffman himself is selling a couple of works at the upcoming october auctions "in the range of a million dollars " he says the auction houses have already called with interested buyers he says mr hoffman says he thinks one area of the market that could see a drop in prices is work that has already been flipped a few times recently "my view is that the slightly second rate art is going to take a tumble such as the stuff that has been bought last year and sold again this year " he says works priced from &# to &# million that are fresh to the market will continue to sell he predicts several dealers say the artists most susceptible in any downturn are up and comers whose sales prices or estimates have risen steeply recently "any artist between the ages and who sold for more than seven figures recently are most overvalued and most vulnerable to a crash " says kenny schachter an american dealer based in london he points to peter doig a scottish painter whose painting "white canoe " sold for a record &# million at sothebys in february another possible example the "leipzig painters " a group of young contemporary german artists educated at the leipzig school of painting in leipzig germany who have become hot in the contemporary market recently mr hoffman says he thinks that the very top end of the market might also encounter some softening "the top end will be difficult to shift " he says "im not sure that another bacon will sell for &# million " last spring a francis bacon painting "study from innocent x " sold for that price at auction londons royal college of art is selling a francis bacon work next month christopher frayling the rector of the college says that while the auction houses have told him to expect about &# million he hopes that the work will sell for as much as &# million "all of the big guys are in town during frieze " he says mr frayling passed up offers of an auction guarantee hoping to take the majority of the profits instead to fund the colleges new campus in battersea which will cost upwards of &# million jeffrey deitch who runs a gallery in manhattan and advises collectors says hes both selling and buying at the upcoming october auctions and isnt worried about a downturn "im already having conversations with collectors about what they want to buy " he says while he says that "there is no question that the art market is interrelated with other markets and can go up and down and stagnate " he says that even some correction wont affect his buying or selling "if prices are moderate this fall thats nothing to worry about " he says amanda sharp the co director and co founder of londons frieze art fair says she has heard little talk of a possible art market turn "nobodys said anything to me " she says "but if we were to get a crash or a correction there would be a nice cleaning out youd lose the less interesting material on the market "
