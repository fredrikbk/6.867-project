aids effort suffers big blow as merck vaccine fails in a major setback one of the leading experimental aids vaccines not only failed to prevent test subjects from becoming infected with hiv but it didnt offer any indication it might delay the onset of full blown aids which had been a key hope the collapse of the trial leaves merck &amp co which had spent a decade developing the vaccine with no remaining prospects in the global hunt for an aids immunization the vaccine was tested in a network funded by the national institutes of health "weve been kicked in the teeth " said bruce walker a veteran aids researcher at harvard university who wasnt involved in the study lawrence corey a leader of the nih funded hiv vaccine trials network said he was "mourning " the results are particularly disappointing because it is widely agreed that only a vaccine could end the epidemic last year more than four million people world wide contracted hiv the virus that causes aids and nearly three million died according to united nations estimates almost million people are currently living with hiv but researchers cautioned against overreacting mercks vaccine is one of many in or heading into clinical trials and different types of vaccines are known to stimulate different kinds of immunity for example an experimental immunization now in human trials that was developed by the hiv vaccine research center of the nih had shown more promising results in monkey trials than did the merck vaccine "it isnt the end of the line " said mitchell warren executive director of the aids vaccine advocacy coalition a new york group advocating prevention mercks data "arent the answers we wanted but they will help improve our other vaccine candidates " tuesday the trial was stopped early by independent overseers known as the data &amp safety monitoring board comparing two groups those who received the vaccine and those who received a placebo the overseers determined there was virtually no statistical difference in infection rates between them indicating the vaccine wasnt working also the amount of hiv in the blood of those who did get infected a predictor of how fast a person will get full blown aids was virtually the same in each group the ultimate fear among researchers is that the whole theory underlying the merck vaccine might be flawed which if true could doom an entire class of experimental vaccines most classical vaccines such as those against smallpox or polio stimulate the body to produce antibodies that ward off infection but stimulating antibodies that neutralize a broad range of hiv strains has been notoriously difficult so researchers focused on the other arm of the immune system killer t cells which attack and kill cells that hiv has already infected such vaccines have been considered less likely to prevent someone from getting infected instead it was hoped they would enable an infected person to suppress the virus and so delay perhaps for many years the onset of disease "given that this study was the leading edge" of research on t cell based hiv vaccines said mark feinberg vice president for medical affairs and health policy in mercks vaccine division "there was great disappointment " "there is nothing on the horizon" at merck he said "we dont have any other vaccine candidates weve identified as promising enough to advance into clinical studies " dr feinberg added that merck is "committed to finding ways to share information accumulated over two decades to facilitate the broader effort" to develop an aids vaccine the merck vaccine did stimulate the immune systems t cells a notable development but not in a way that helped infected test subjects control the virus now researchers will try to figure out why mercks shares reflecting downplayed hopes that such an early vaccine would work were up cents to &# at p m friday in new york stock exchange composite trading sarah rubenstein contributed to this article
