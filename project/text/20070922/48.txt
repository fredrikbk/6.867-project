politics &amp economics broader economic concerns spurred fed federal reserve vice chairman donald kohn defended the central banks aggressive interest rate cut saying it was driven by concerns about the broader economy rather than an interest in protecting investors or the value of housing and fellow fed governor kevin warsh said the feds next move depends on economic events rather than on financial markets "the goal of our policy is not to look at any particular asset class" but instead is to watch "whats happening in the real economy " mr warsh said after a speech at the state university of new york at albany "we are going to stay very closely focused on real time indicators and forward indicators " in remarks at a frankfurt conference marking the th anniversary of the deutsche bundesbank mr kohn acknowledged that the feds actions through low interest rates early this decade helped feed the start of the latest housing boom but he says the housing markets "worst excesses" came when short term interest rates guided by the fed were already higher while longer term rates stayed down because of other factors "i suspect that when studies are done with cooler reflection the causes of the swing in house prices will be seen as less a consequence of monetary policy and more a result of the emotions of excessive optimism followed by fear experienced every so often in the marketplace through the ages " he said the fed lowered its target for short term interest rates tuesday by half a percentage point to the first rate cut in four years amid concerns that the financial market turmoil spurred by the housing sectors deepening slump would tip the economy into recession mr kohn a longtime skeptic of setting a formal target for inflation levels offered measured support for the concept the feds policy committee is now weighing whether to institute such an approach though "for me the case remains open " he said "i am relatively more persuaded" that inflation targeting helps keep the publics inflation expectations in check in turn damping price increases mr kohns remarks are particularly significant because he chairs a fed committee working on communications issues mr kohn defended the feds decisions to cushion the economy from a downturn because of falling prices for assets such as stocks and homes the feds interest rate target wouldnt have been as high as it was in if not for high stock prices "i doubt policy would have been eased this week if housing prices had continued their upward march " mr kohn said interest rate policy instead "was motivated not by the desire to achieve any particular level of asset prices but rather by the federal reserves assessment of how changes in asset prices were affecting the forecast of growth and inflation " michael derby contributed to this article
