open waters with more boats and destinations available would be cruise passengers are opting to charter their own yachts heres a novel travel idea instead of a cruise ship taking you places it wants to go why not tell the captain where you want to go thats the thinking and at times the challenge behind yacht charters a small but growing niche in the cruise industry rather than rub shoulders with other passengers some families and small groups of friends are chartering and foot yachts which might hold eight or people and designing their own cruises such trips involve more homework than traditional cruises says kim kavin author of "dream cruises the insiders guide to private yacht vacations " in most cases youll need to find and work with a charter broker a person who specializes in matching travelers with yachts youll also have to explain to the boats captain what you want from your trip but the payoff can be a highly personalized cruise "its all designed around your wishes and changed at your whim " ms kavin says "if you decide you want to have dinner late in the evening on the beach your yachts chef is going to say no problem tell me a cruise ship that will do that " to get an idea of whats involved in chartering a yacht we spoke with elaine stewart a broker in roswell ga who has run her own chartering business caribbeansailing net for more than two decades here are excerpts from the discussion the wall street journal how is the business changing ms stewart more boats are being built and more boats are available for charter at the same time more destinations are opening up the european venue has opened up the barges that use the canals in france and germany thats all opened up alaska has opened up the seychelles off the coast of africa thailand were chartering in places that nobody ever imagined most of the boats now have professional crews making good salaries the mom and pop days are pretty much over wsj how does someone charter a yacht ms stewart you start with a date when youd like to sail the approximate number of people a destination you might like and a budget most people will call me and say "i have eight friends who say they want to go " well ill make recommendations for boats that carry four people six people and eight people because by the time they all start talking about it someone will cancel because of their kids schedules or a conflict at work so try to be as realistic as you can on pinning people down wsj lets talk about budgets what do these trips cost ms stewart a lot of people think of this as a vacation for people with big bucks and there are a lot of those you can look at boats that cost &# a day or &# an hour but thats not what most people want in the caribbean for a boat captain cook and all your food and beverages i would say realistically the cost is between &# and &# per person thats for a week wsj what are some of the drawbacks in chartering a yacht ms stewart having a mismatch between the crew and the guests is probably the biggest drawback lets say you want to take your family on a boat you dont want to put somebody on a boat where the crew doesnt interact well with children that could be a disaster thats why its important for a broker to know the boats and crews and to understand what the clients needs are wsj why use a broker can people charter boats on their own ms stewart you can do it yourself the internet has opened up this business but a web site doesnt allow you to visit the boat itself and thats what a broker does brokers good brokers spend a lot of time each year at boat shows these arent the boat shows you see at your local lake these are shows specifically for charter yacht brokers they arent open to the public the broker goes aboard the boats interviews the crews looks at the boat and gets a feel for what a charter aboard that boat will be for example i go to the shows in newport r i st thomas in the virgin islands tortola in the british virgin islands i usually go to a european show either genoa in italy or greece or turkey and then i go to the antigua show in the caribbean out of those four or five shows ill see about boats the only thing that i can offer a client is my personal idea of what a boat offers and how i would feel on that boat there are boats ive been on that i wouldnt offer for charter one of my clients called me and asked me about a boat he had seen online and i told him i cant recommend that boat the management company the boats are handled by management companies is unstable your money might be going somewhere other than where you think its going wsj how much do brokers charge ms stewart the client doesnt pay me anything the boat pays the brokers fees so if a boat charges &# its going to be &# if you get it through me or &# if you go through a web site wsj so how does one find a good broker ms stewart there are three professional organizations theres the american yacht charter association the charter yacht brokers association and the mediterranean yacht brokers association any broker that you use should be a member of one of these organizations most of the time a potential client will call at least two brokers and end up hitting it off with one more than the other as long as the broker has the credentials like membership in one of the professional organizations and is visiting the boat shows youre probably going to be ok wsj what do you look for in a boat how do you decide which boats to recommend ms stewart i start with the outside of the yacht is it seaworthy is it clean does the equipment appear well cared for then i go below and check out the number of cabins the size of berths number of heads or bathrooms what type of facilities they have some have hot tubs the amount of living space and again how clean all of this appears i also want to know what extras the boat might have scuba gear windsurfers water skis kayaks wave runners underwater cameras tv computer and internet and satellite phones but the most important thing is the crew if you have a perfect boat but dont have a crew that meets the needs of the guests then the charter cant be perfect i ask questions about hobbies education professional skills what they have done in prior years ages nationalities one broker friend always asks what the captain is reading at the moment wsj how much input do guests have when it comes to where a boat goes or daily activities ms stewart usually there are no set itineraries you work with the captain and within limitations weather and things like that hell do exactly what you want to do if you want to go snorkeling you go snorkeling if you want to go ashore and go hiking you go hiking each day plays out the way you want it to wsj can i charter a boat without a crew and sail myself ms stewart yes you can do what we call a bareboat for a lot of people thats the only way they ever want to charter of course you need to have experience sailing a similar vessel theyll check your credentials wsj what are some of the biggest mistakes that people make when chartering a yacht ms stewart some people dont understand whats feasible there are people who want to scuba dive every day now thats a great vacation but you have to understand that you arent going to pick up a boat and go scuba diving every day and move very much because it takes time to dive you have to get ready you have to make the dive you have to come back to the boat you have to come out of the dive so you arent going to move that boat very far when youre taking up five or six hours a day just diving if youre expecting to have air conditioning every minute that isnt going to happen on most boats you cant air condition the outside at night the boats will probably run air conditioning if you want to but if you run the air conditioning all night youre going to hear the generator running dont expect to hear water lapping outside your window while the air conditioner is running those are things we want to clear up before you ever step on the boat and if the broker is doing a good job and explaining everything to a client there shouldnt be any misconceptions wsj do you and other brokers actually sail on every boat you recommend ms stewart laughs i havent sailed on all of them but occasionally we get to go and live the good life
