canada is giddy about the loonie and twitting u s currency parity is a point of pride but americans wont like the prices with the canadian dollar surging against the u s greenback robert katzman is dealing with situations they dont teach in economics the owner of five strip clubs in detroit and windsor ontario says american dancers are heading to canada to earn the strengthened canadian currency and canadian customers are heading to detroit because their dollars go further there hes fighting back by advertising more in the u s and offering free limo service to get detroit men to visit his windsor clubs but like most canadians mr katzman is brimming with national pride "were feeling for the first time like weve caught up to our big brother " says mr katzman after years of playing second fiddle the canadian loonie so called because of the bird on the dollar coin overtook the u s greenback this week a nation that has long been the butt of jokes from its neighbor to the south puffed out its chest and grinned at the start of the year one u s dollar bought canadian dollars late friday in new york it bought just a slide of on thursday the two currencies hit parity for the first time since in january of the u s currency touched its recent high against the loonie with one dollar buying canadian dollars the rise is a boon for canadians looking to buy american real estate stocks or just about anything for sale at the mall of america in bloomington minn which has seen a uptick in the number of canadian customers this year but it isnt good news for canadian hotels or tourist destinations or exporters of everything from beer and maple syrup to lumber and wheat meanwhile prices on products sold in both countries are suddenly out of whack alan greenspans new book "the age of turbulence " for instance is priced at us&# vs c&# the canadian dollars rise to parity with the u s dollar has several causes high commodity prices globally the overall weakness of the u s dollar the strength of the canadian economy and the canadian governments enviable fiscal surplus the result has injected a touch of national giddiness into canadas traditional reserve as a slew of opportunities present themselves from real estate deals south of the border to substantial breaks on college tuition for parents sending their kids to school in the states barry campbell a former member of parliament whose son is studying at cornell university in ithaca n y says that thursday was "a good day for any canadian spending money in the u s " mr campbell was on a plane returning to toronto from san francisco when the man next to him turned on his blackberry "canadian technology " mr campbell notes and related the good news "he said hey look at this and we smiled at each other " even canadas finance minister jim flaherty couldnt resist the opportunity to stand up and speak thursday soberly telling reporters he has been worried about the fragile u s housing market canadas housing market on the other hand is "remarkably different " mr flaherty recalled that the last time the canadian dollar hit parity in november he was a "budding young trial lawyer earning about c&# a year " of course the loonies performance has its down side economists fear that canadian exporters will face an uphill battle since their goods just became more expensive for canadians living in the u s who are paid in u s dollars its also not such great news noah charney a toronto native who works for a hedge fund in new york says he has three trips planned to canada in the near future one for a wedding and two for bachelor parties "maybe my friend will get a slightly less large wedding gift " he says norman tobias a toronto tax lawyer whose son is a sophomore at harvard says hes able to tell you "to the penny" what the exchange rate was back in july when the first semesters bill came due tuition and board at harvard costs about &# a year he says last july that translated into about canadian dollars the canadian dollars strength together with the subprime mortgage mess in the u s has mr tobias and his wife thinking about property he figures that "now is probably the right time" to buy florida real estate paul godfrey president and ceo of baseballs toronto blue jays said it might also be time for canadian sports teams to seize the moment every time the loonie goes up a penny against the u s dollar his organization saves us&# he says "a lot of folks in the manufacturing sector are being hurt but were one of the guys running victory laps around the financial buildings right now " mr godfrey says in the past few years the team has increased its payroll from &# million to &# million in part because of the strength of the loonie asked whether the jays could someday outspend the yankees he laughed "cmon nobody outspends the yankees " in hockey the six canadian based nhl teams havent brought a stanley cup back home since but ian clarke executive vice president of business development for the toronto maple leafs said even though the team would stay under the leagues salary cap the strength of the loonie has enabled the organization to invest in facilities better locker rooms better weight rooms nicer coaches offices another stanley cup "its going to help all the canadian teams " mr clarke says the rise of the loonie is especially gratifying to those who remember the deficits canada struggled with in the s "we never allowed ourselves to dream" that the loonie would one day return to par with the u s dollar says mr campbell the former member of parliament who spent part of the s working on financial policy for the canadian government thanks partly to the initiatives begun over a decade ago those deficits are a thing of the past and the canadian economy is surging on the back of record oil prices mr campbell suggests the u s could learn a thing or two from its neighbor "i should not presume to tell the u s how to manage its fiscal house " he says with characteristic canadian reserve "but you cant cut taxes and fight a war and balance the books " mr katzman the windsor strip club owner is philosophical he says that last year of his dancers were canadians about of them drove down from toronto and montreal to take advantage of the u s dollars american men typically paid with this year he has more american women dancing in his canadian clubs about than he has canadians its a nine hour trip from montreal to windsor mr katzman explains and with the loonie as strong as the dollar the dancers can earn just as much money up there "as a business decision it just doesnt make sense " says mr katzman
