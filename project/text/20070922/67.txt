weekend journal books book review fighting for a tie david halberstams last work illuminates u s blunders in korea the coldest winter by david halberstam hyperion pages &# a war employing limited force in defense of distant allies and in pursuit of disputed objectives a home front in which civilians need share no hardships with men at war an angry opposition party whose hatred of an unpopular president undermines the war effort troops in the field being asked in a g i phrase "to die for a tie" or for something less sound familiar if iraq is the latest such post world war ii conflict the first was korea with "the coldest winter " david halberstam has given us a most memorable book published posthumously about a war that "m a s h" reruns notwithstanding has left only a small and fading imprint on our national memory mr halberstam a distinguished vietnam era journalist and the author of more than books including "the best and the brightest" died in an auto accident in april this last of his works is a fitting memorial to his exceptional talents as a reporter and a writer "the coldest winter" chronicles what the military historian s l a marshall termed "the twentieth centurys nastiest little war " a conflict that mr halberstam observes "sometimes seemed to have been orphaned by history " because of mr halberstams efforts that orphan may now be adopted by a great many readers mr halberstam covers all four bases of a military history home run he sets the conflict in its political and geopolitical context perceptively profiles the eras leading statesmen and scoundrels analyzes the many strategic and tactical miscalculations by all parties and provides gripping descriptive narratives of battles and the men who fought them there are few heroes in this book other than the men in combat there are however plenty of villains beyond the trio of communist despots north koreas kim il sung chinas mao tse tung and the soviet unions joseph stalin the books leading black hat is gen douglas macarthur americas elderly and arrogant proconsul for asia from the splendid isolation of his tokyo headquarters surrounded by courtiers ignoring relevant military intelligence and defying responsible civilian authorities gen macarthur makes one brilliant military move outflanking the enemy with his inchon landing in september he follows it with a series of catastrophic military blunders above all pressing his forces north to the china border that turn a limited defensive war into a larger lengthier and more lethal one against not just the north koreans but also chinas peoples liberation army mr halberstam chronicles the korean war as a succession of mounting miscalculations on all sides americas fuzzy definition of its asian security perimeter encourages north koreas kim to invade across the th parallel dividing the korean peninsula the soviets always eager to bog america down in cold war quicksands tacitly bless kims ambitions america taken by surprise quickly goes to south koreas defense but badly underestimates the north korean army and badly overestimates its own depleted military capabilities the u s regains the initiative with the inchon landing but a cocky gen macarthur promising that american boys will be "home by christmas " ignores military intelligence and civilian direction and presses toward china even as pla divisions are infiltrating into north korea half a million chinese troops overwhelm american units in the bloodiest fighting of the war but then press their initiative too far south overstretching supply lines and ultimately having to settle as does america for a sour stalemate along the th parallel where the conflict had begun three years before and where american troops are still stationed today more than americans and countless koreans and chinese had died for a tie the bitterness of the conflict was echoed by the sourness of politics at home "it was one of the enduring myths in the s and s that politics stopped at the waters edge nothing was further from the truth " mr halberstam writes it was the "mean season" in american politics with vicious republican attacks on the competence and character of president harry s truman secretary of state dean acheson and even gen george c marshall the iconic defense secretary whom indiana sen william jenner took to calling a "front man for traitors a living lie " moveon orgs venomous "general betray us" ad is the direct descendant of this mccarthyite malignancy korea was a war waged by a centrist democratic administration and undermined at home by the republican right two decades later another war effort in vietnam was undermined by the radical left and today that scenario is being repeated as the democratic left including virtually every democratic presidential candidate is demanding that the u s abandon iraq the inescapable conclusion though not one that mr halberstam quite makes is that post world war ii america has proved incapable of the national unity needed to keep military commitments and support its troops in a sustained war effort mr halberstam writing of korea attributes some of this divisiveness to president trumans failure to seek formal congressional approval for the war thereby letting the opposition off the accountability hook it is no small irony that president bush having secured formal congressional support for the iraq war now finds himself in the same leaky boat as president truman while democratic presidential candidates who voted for the war hack away at the rigging the korean war as mr halberstam explains took place in the shadow of a larger concern the emergence of communist china it is difficult to comprehend today the fervency with which many republicans in the early s believed that america had "lost" china the degree to which they sought domestic scapegoats for this loss of something that america never owned and the extent to which many prominent conservatives very much including gen macarthur hoped to encourage a corrupt and incompetent chiang kai shek regime to retake the chinese mainland gen macarthur came to view chinese intervention in korea as an opportunity for america to "unleash" chiang against communist china conversely mao had his own agenda of using an external enemy america to consolidate his fledgling totalitarian regime and root out political enemies at home the fabled "wise men" who peopled the truman administration and indeed the gutsy president himself became largely paralyzed by this "china lobby" and by the domestic political clout of an increasingly disdainful and defiant gen macarthur in april president truman finally fired the general who returned home to a heros welcome while the presidents popularity sank to new lows and the war ground on though now under the leadership of a new commander gen matthew ridgway who understood the tactics of a modern war in pursuit of limited objectives in richard roveres analogy the pacific in the early s was the "republican ocean " while the atlantic was the "democratic ocean " however unrealistic some republicans were in seeking to expand the korean war into a crusade to reverse the results of the chinese revolution it is hard not to think with more than a half century of hindsight that republicans were more prescient than democrats in at least one respect seeing a potentially dynamic asia as more important to americas future than a stagnant and self centered europe it is true that gen macarthur was foolhardy to seemingly invite chinese intervention in korea but had his high risk roll of the dice succeeded in defeating north korea how much better off we would all be today without kim jong ils nuclear armed pariah polity beyond geopolitics mr halberstams book offers penetrating profiles of the leading men of the era his account of gen macarthur includes devastating details on a military leader who never slept a night in korea during the entire conflict and hadnt set foot on the asian mainland since gen macarthur repeatedly refuses presidential invitations to washington to meet president truman who finally flies to guam where gen macarthur contemptuously refuses to salute his commander in chief truman himself described gen macarthur as worse than the cabots and lodges "they at least talked to one another before they told god what to do macarthur tells god right off " there are similarly illuminating profiles of kim il sung and south korean leader syngman rhee of chairman mao and his gen peng dehuai later tortured to death on maos orders of secretaries acheson and marshall and of american generals ranging from the heroic marine gen oliver smith to the martinet gen ned almond mr halberstam is at his very best narrating the bitter battles of the war and the courage of men in close combat he does this through in depth interviews with aging korean war veterans whom he tracked down all across america he thereby not only captures the detail of war but also reconstructs from veteran memories the dialogue of men under fire "it was going to be a turkey shoot but then there were so many of them and so few of us that we soon realized that we were the turkeys " says former pfc rusty davidson recalling the battle of naktong bulge where two divisions of north koreans overwhelmed an american battalion "exhausted men in both armies stumbled into one another in small fire fights that often ended with bayonets as the arbiters of victory " mr halberstam writes "the victories were anything but clear or grand surviving for another day was everything " mr halberstams description of pfc bruce ritter a pound radio operator in an infantry company overwhelmed by a chinese regiment who is left for dead but somehow survives to carry wounded comrades out of the death zone is riveting so on a larger scale is his description of the marine breakout in the winter of from the chosin reservoir where the first marine division is surrounded by seven chinese divisions in minus degree cold asked about how the retreat is going marine gen smith responds "retreat hell we are simply attacking in another direction " most powerful of all is mr halberstams narrative of the disastrous retreat of the armys second infantry division "running the gauntlet" with chinese enemy holding the high ground on both sides of a narrow defile littered with the wreckage of american vehicles and the corpses of american soldiers the losses suffered by the second division in the course of several days were comparable to total american casualties in our four year engagement in iraq if mr halberstam awes us with stories of individual americans at war he perplexes us with the total absence of any tales of heroism or even of suffering by individual koreans koreans make occasional mass appearances as divisions fleeing battles or as hordes of refugees trekking toward safety but in more than pages of narrative remarkably mr halberstam finds no single korean other than leaders kim and rhee worth depicting or describing no korean soldier showing similar courage to that of americans no prototypical refugee with a home and family destroyed it is an odd omission for an author as sensitive as the late mr halberstam the korean war with its brutal combat heavy casualties and stalemated conclusion could hardly be considered a success in its own time with the vantage point of history however mr halberstam grants that the south korea we helped to save now stands as a shining example of economic success and political liberalization history has a way of reversing contemporary pessimism and cynicism the stalemated korean war resulted in a dynamic and democratic south korea it seems similarly evident today though mr halberstam would not see it this way that the war america finally fled in vietnam wound up buying time for the rest of southeast asia to build stable prosperous and free societies the iraq war effort given half a chance might yet do much the same for the middle east mr kann a pulitzer prize winning reporter was until recently chairman of dow jones &amp co which publishes the wall street journal
