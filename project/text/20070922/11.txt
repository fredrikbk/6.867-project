egyptian exile far from the public eye a drama is playing out that will have the utmost consequences for the bush administrations goal of promoting democracy in the middle east the regions most prominent dissident egyptian sociologist saad edin ibrahim suddenly finds himself in a kind of perambulatory exile hopping from conference to conference in nine countries in the last three months the one place he dare not go is home to egypt because well placed officials have warned him not to put himself within president hosni mubaraks grasp what has mr ibrahim done to enrage president mubarak he has loudly advocated democracy in public writings interviews with western reporters and most unforgivably in a face to face meeting with president george w bush as a result members of mr mubaraks ruling national democratic party filed nine formal requests with the state prosecutors office this summer for indictments against mr ibrahim for "damaging the states economic interests" and even "treason " the state run press has conducted a smear campaign against him most recently egypts largest paper al ahram carried a front page editorial signed by osama saraya its editor in chief that branded mr ibrahim an "agent" of the outlawed muslim brotherhood and a "criminal " still more ominously the author averred that mr ibrahim had "repeated his old crime itself by giving false information to a foreign reader" to obscure "the environment of freedom and reform that egypt lives in " the real point of this absurd argument was to encourage and justify a repetition of the ordeal to which the egyptian state subjected mr ibrahim seven years ago in he became the regions most celebrated political prisoner when he was jailed on spurious charges stemming from the efforts of his ibn khaldun center to monitor egyptian elections altogether he spent two years behind bars before egypts highest and most politically independent judicial body the court of cassation overturned his conviction alas this did not come before his health had been permanently damaged torture is all too common in egyptian prisons but his jailers were reluctant to leave scars on mr ibrahim because the u s government followed his case closely he is married to an american and holds american as well as egyptian citizenship instead they resorted to sleep deprivation after days of being roughly wakened each time he started to doze mr ibrahim suffered a stroke a fit athletic man who was still jogging at the age of mr ibrahim now walks with a severe limp another term in prison could literally seal his doom worse egyptian dissidents do not put it past the intelligence services or mukhabarat to arrange an "accident" that would rid mr mubarak of this meddlesome advocate without generating the international campaign that will ensue if he is imprisoned they point to the recent mysterious defenestration in london of ashraf marwan an alleged spy for israel whose death the israeli press suggests may have been caused by egyptian agents fears of such dirty tricks are not paranoid just prior to mr ibrahims imprisonment in an unidentified truck ran his car into a ditch the campaign against mr ibrahim is the latest evidence that egypt is marching backwards on democracy and human rights in his state of the union address president bush had called upon "the great and proud nation of egypt to show the way toward democracy in the middle east " when mr mubarak announced egypts first ever presidential election it seemed as if his exhortation was being heeded to no ones surprise the election was not fair but hopes for the future were kindled by mr mubaraks pledge to inaugurate an era of political reform after his re election instead mr mubarak had his main competitor ayman nour tossed in prison on trumped up charges where he languishes in declining health mr mubarak then pushed through constitutional "reform" in the form of amendments adopted as a single indivisible package precluding meaningful deliberation this was followed by arrests of dissident bloggers and other critics both secular and islamist and then by the vicious persecution of a group of "quranists " muslim reformers who want a return to original scripture as opposed to subsequent interpretations that are often more narrow minded now the hounding of mr ibrahim completes the mockery of the hopes of the new attacks on mr ibrahim began in late may this year when the wife of the emir of qatar hosted a conference to launch the arab foundation for democracy the qatari government endowed it with &# million with which to support reformers in the region and mr ibrahim was named to the board some of egypts state controlled media portrayed the whole operation as a front for mr ibrahims disloyal activities ironically he had been condemned previously for accepting western donations for pro democracy work but now it turned out that arab donations were no better apparently it was the purpose of the funds rather than their source that made them taboo a week later mr ibrahim spoke at a conference on democracy held in prague where president bush met with him and dissidents from other countries the egyptian press again went into high dudgeon some even dubbing mr ibrahims organization the "son of zion center" when mr bush in his highly publicized speech there mentioned ayman nour as one of those "who couldnt join us because they are being unjustly imprisoned " the other absentees named by mr bush were from belarus burma cuba and vietnam the egyptian government bristled at being placed in such company and accused mr ibrahim of putting mr bush up to it in his own prague remarks mr ibrahim appealed to western governments "as freedom fighters we ask you to stop supporting dictators in our countries in the name of stability and continuity " soon thereafter the u s house of representatives voted to reduce u s aid to egypt by &# million unless that country showed progress on human rights mr mubarak blamed mr ibrahim all of this has profound consequences not only for mr ibrahim and egypt but for washington too mr ibrahim is being persecuted more for the actions of the u s president and congress than for what he himself did can we tolerate this in may the syrian dissident kamal labwani was sentenced to years in prison for the simple act of meeting u s officials but syria is a hostile state an unindicted coconspirator in the axis of evil egypt in contrast is an ally to which we give &# billion each year this relationship of course is exactly the problem no u s administration wants to butt heads with egypt and the senate declined to go along with the houses conditional cut in egypts aid mr mubarak may see mr ibrahims alleged offenses as a matter of national honor but is our own national honor not also at stake if someone an american citizen no less is persecuted for holding a conversation with the president of the u s somehow mr bush and congress must convey a stern warning to mr mubarak hands off saad edin ibrahim mr muravchik a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute is writing a book about democrats in the middle east
