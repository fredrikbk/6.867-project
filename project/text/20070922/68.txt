weekend journal books five best as the jewish high holy days conclude with yom kippur yiddish scholar ruth r wisse chooses essential works about judaism  days of awe by s y agnon schocken during the days between the jewish new year rosh hashanah and the fast of yom kippur jews submit themselves to the all knowing and unerring judgment of god it is sometimes a challenge to experience this soul sifting in the modern world as most others go about their daily business for those who desire help or for those who simply want to gain a deeper understanding of the observances look no further than "days of awe " a nonfiction work by novelist s y agnon who won the nobel prize in literature in his compendium of jewish practices legends and commentaries traces the rhythm of these september rituals from the pre holy day preparations to the aftermath of the concluding meal the material includes simple customs like eating an apple sweetened with honey kabbalistic interpretations of the rams horn blasts that are sounded in the synagogue and prescriptions for a thorough moral accounting though my devotions do not approach the intensity of those of my ancestors who in the words of a yiddish saying trembled with the fish in the seas in the days of judgment this little book puts me in awe of generations of jews as they stood in awe of god  a historical atlas of the jewish people edited by eli barnavi schocken my teacher the late salo baron published volumes of a "social and religious history of the jews" a project that he did not live to complete obviously no single book can encompass all of jewish experience but when i want to find out about jews in palestine under the romans or learn how jews fared in muslim lands or trace the migration of jews to america i turn to "a historical atlas of the jewish people " an attractive volume of maps documents time lines and basic information if i dont find exactly what im looking for i become engrossed in something else like an account of jewish agriculture in south america the books organization is quirky but its mixing of anthropology history religion and culture reflects how they are woven into the life of the jews  daniel deronda by george eliot one of the finest books about jewish experience was written by an englishwoman george eliot studied judaism for years before writing this novel her last and her heros gradual discovery of his jewish origins seems to reproduce her own evolving appreciation of what jews were about daniel derondas mother despised being jewish and when he was born she arranged for him to be raised as the ward of a wealthy english gentleman but deronda is pleased as his self discovery unfolds and he dreams of helping jews find their own land "such as the english have" in effect becoming a zionist more than two decades before theodor herzl founded the zionist movement the novel has its painful side derondas jewish path thwarts his potential romance with the lovely gwendolen harleth and well meaning christians who want to envelop deronda in their embrace must learn from him the art of "separateness with communication "  tevye the dairyman by sholem aleichem no one did more than the yiddish writer sholem aleichem to forge the connection between jewishness and comedy and no character does it better than tevye the dairyman in aleichems tevye stories set in russia and collected in various forms over the years the monologues of this first stand up jewish comedian treat many of the crises that jews experienced in confronting modernity a traditional father of many daughters whittled down to three in the musical adaptation "fiddler on the roof" tevye must face both their challenges to his paternal authority and the dangers posed by the czarist regime he does so with a philosophical humor that many readers attribute to jewishness itself "what does it say in the prayer book were gods chosen people its no wonder the whole world envies us " whenever i teach this work filled with specifically jewish quotations and expressions students of other minorities especially those from religious families recognize tevyes predicaments and they appreciate the moral balance he strives to maintain between metaphysical confidence and the disillusioning evidence presented by daily life  the bellarosa connection by saul bellow penguin in this cautionary tale about the dangers of forgetting the narrator a cultured american jewish widower is the founder of the mnemosyne institute in philadelphia appropriately for someone who teaches the techniques of memory he lives in a house filled with antiques a sudden inquiry from jerusalem sends him in search of harry fonstein a near relative he hasnt seen in years harry was once saved from the nazis in italy by the personal intervention of showman billy rose mangled in italian as "bellarosa" and for the remainder of this brief book the unnamed narrator recalls for us the story of the rescue and his encounters with harry and his wife sorella the woman he married after immigrating to america oversize yet delicate sorella functions as the books oracle when she says "the jews could survive everything that europe threw at them but now comes the next test america " wryly and at his own expense the memory man describes how by neglecting harry and sorella he himself has failed that test ms wisse whose "jews and power" has just been published by schocken teaches yiddish literature and comparative literature at harvard
