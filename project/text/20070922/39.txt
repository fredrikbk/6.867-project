mattel seeks to placate china with apology mattel inc made a public apology to china for damage to the countrys reputation stemming from a spate of toy recalls it was an extraordinary attempt to placate mattels most important supplier but it is likely to shift the spotlight to the companys own responsibility in the crisis in its apology the worlds largest toy maker said its own "design flaw" was responsible for the biggest recall by far involving around million playsets studded with potentially dangerous magnets while soothing chinas pride the apology could make mattel a target in lawsuits "i cant think of any other instance where" a major toy company "has actually come out with such a public announcement of a defect " said andrew krulwich a former general counsel for the u s consumer product safety commission who now practices at wiley rein llp coming from a company with a history of fighting liability accusations the move also suggests the escalating diplomatic and public relations pressure mattel faces around the world chinese officials have ratcheted up criticism recently of mattel and u s regulators believing they are putting too much blame on china in the recent recalls of toys and other chinese made products mattels apology is a reminder that u s companies dependent on business in china offend beijings government at their peril mattel which gets of its products from china quietly began to mend fences three weeks ago in a letter dated sept on mattels corporate letterhead jim walter the companys senior vice president of world wide quality assurance wrote directly to the director of chinas quality control agency li changjiang to "address any possible misunderstandings " mr walter wrote that mattel has a "deep commitment to working together with the chinese government " according to a copy of the letter seen by the wall street journal within the top levels of chinas government concern is growing that significant damage has been done to the "made in china" label the product quality issue came up during a meeting between president bush and chinese president hu jintao earlier this month mattel has recalled more than million toys world wide in recent weeks some of the recalls involved excessive lead paint found in chinese made toys flaws in the manufacturing process at chinese plants have been blamed for the problem leading to a cavalcade of negative headlines in the u s that added to the concerns about tainted chinese imports ranging from pet food to toothpaste as recently as this week mattel chief executive robert eckert told congress that the companys "standards were ignored and our rules were broken" at chinese plants by the numbers however the vast majority of the recalled toys didnt have a lead problem the biggest recall affecting million toys involved tiny magnets that can fall off toys and be deadly if swallowed the recall of those toys mattel is now stressing had nothing to do with a failure of chinese manufacturing but rather stemmed from mattels own flawed designs for everything from barbie accessories to batman action figures on friday thomas a debrowski mattels executive vice president for world wide operations met with mr li the chinese product safety chief in beijing mr debrowski listened to criticism of mattels actions then delivered a prepared apology "mattel takes full responsibility for these recalls and apologizes personally to you the chinese people and all of our customers who received the toys " mr debrowski said in remarks reported by news agencies he added "its important for everyone to understand that the vast majority of those products that we recalled were the result of a design flaw in mattels design not through a manufacturing flaw in chinese manufacturers " mattels stark admission surprised m eric johnson a professor at dartmouths tuck school of business who conducts research on chinese factories and has published studies about mattels manufacturing operations "this is a first " mr johnson said he called the apology a "novel policy move" designed to avoid "potential friction " mattel also said friday that it recalled more toys than necessary over lead related issues in another apparent attempt to soothe chinese sentiment it said subsequent testing showed some of the recalled toys "may not have had lead in paint in excess of the u s standards " in a statement issued friday in the u s mattel sought to play down the significance of its statements in china without giving details it said some reports "mischaracterized" fridays meeting the company said it "apologized to the chinese today just as it has wherever its toys are sold " fridays exchange culminates a period in which china and mattel sometimes offered different public explanations for the toy crisis mattels mr eckert has at times focused heavily on the lead paint issue in his public statements in an opinion piece he wrote for the wall street journal earlier this month he referred to "three voluntary recalls of products due to impermissible levels of lead in paint" and said "lead paint is topmost on parents minds " he made no mention of the million toys with the magnets the company did raise the magnet issue in newspaper ads last month and mr eckert discussed it in a recent interview with the wall street journal behind the scenes mattel was working to assuage the anger of chinese officials who felt their country was being scapegoated the sept letter by mr walter the mattel executive gave a preview of fridays statements about the magnet toys "all statements made by mattel and by our executive management including me have consistently attributed the safety concern regarding those products to an emerging design issue rather than a manufacturing issue " mr walter wrote some of the chinese factories involved in the recalls have shut down cheung shu hung an owner of hong kong based lee der industrial co one of mattels suppliers involved in producing the faulty toys killed himself aug at his factorys warehouse in chinas southern guangdong province in an interview with the wall street journal on sept in beijing mr li acknowledged that some chinese exporters were using too much lead but shifted part of the blame to the u s companies that order and sell the products he said the recall crisis is "largely due to the fact that our chinese toy makers produced these toys upon the request of american designers and according to importers specific requirements " mr lis agency the general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine employs people mattels embrace of responsibility for the magnet issue could raise thorny legal issues many toy manufacturers have used small magnets that when swallowed can bind in the stomach lining and sometimes tear through the intestines a wakeup call came to the industry in when kenny sweet a redmond wash toddler swallowed a magnet and died the canada based manufacturer of the toy issued a recall in march seven months later mattel issued its first recall over a similar magnet problem after toys in its polly pocket brand caused three children to suffer intestinal perforations that required surgery on aug of this year it expanded that recall to include more toys with magnets mattel has consistently employed a formidable team of outside lawyers to deny defects with its toys in some cases even after millions of them had been recalled and determined to be unsafe and defective by u s regulators "if you have an admission by the company its very very important evidence for the plaintiffs " said mr krulwich the former consumer product safety commission general counsel peter biersteker an outside lawyer in washington representing mattel declined to comment on how fridays apology affects mattels legal position in late august mr eckert said in an interview that the magnets "have emerged as a significant issue for the toy industry " he said mattel has been "at the forefront of establishing the new standards" to reduce such hazards
