from the campaign to the battlefront mark lippert helped obama oppose the war now hes being sent to iraq coronado naval base california after a long day training to be deployed to iraq navy reservist mark lippert unlaces his desert boots and pulls out a blackberry email device from his dusty backpack checking his messages he spots an email from the presidential candidate sen barack obama "i miss you brother " mr lippert a lieutenant junior grade sporting a buzz cut and desert camouflage is training here before being shipped out to iraq where he will serve as an intelligence officer for the navy seals in his civilian life he is the chief foreign policy adviser for sen obama the democrat whose most well known foreign policy stance is his opposition to the iraq war lt lippert is about to join sen obama not only opposes the war he has tried to distinguish himself in the democratic field by stressing that he alone among the major candidates opposed it from the outset and lt lippert years old has helped hone those views particularly on a pullout of american troops even as he prepared to go to war since being called up for active duty and going on the navy payroll lt lippert wont talk about his views on the war "now isnt the time for me to debate iraq policy " lt lippert says in an interview "my job is to serve my country and to execute the decision of the commander in chief " however friends say that lt lippert from a family with a long military history joined the navy reserve in even though he knew the deteriorating situation in iraq meant the odds of fighting in the war were high "mark knew that he probably would be called to active duty " says his fiancee robyn schmidek "its not the war he would have scripted but he felt a higher calling to support the troops " the deployment of lt lippert who will be gone for about six months means a hole in sen obamas foreign policy team at a perilous point for the candidate sen obama is under sharpening attack by opponents and critics who say he lacks the experience in national security affairs to lead the country in a time of wars in iraq and afghanistan and a global fight with islamic extremists it also means worrying about a friend whos suddenly in harms way over the past two years sen obama and lt lippert have traveled around the globe together played one on one basketball and shared each others shoes lt lippert has continuing email exchanges with the senators half sister in africa sen obama encouraged lt lippert to get engaged sen obama calls lt lippert "one of my favorite people in the world " says former navy secretary richard danzig an obama adviser "the two men are experiencing what it means to have someone dear to you go to war " the war has touched others on the campaign trail and in washington republican candidate sen john mccain has a son deployed in iraq at the end of june when lt lippert went to norfolk va for processing he met sonja maria miller an aide to first lady laura bush who was also activated as a navy reservist here at the coronado base a vast naval complex where navy seals train lt lippert is routinely asked by other sailors about his civilian job at first he says he tried to answer that he worked in the senate on foreign relations some navy officers pressed for which senator lt lippert trying to play down his role with the presidential candidate answered "barack obama " lt lippert braced for some military personnel to debate the war once they found out he worked for sen obama but that hasnt happened instead he says some sailors seem impressed that he is working for a politician whose name they recognize lt lippert grew up in cincinnati and played basketball baseball and football many of his mothers relatives served in the military an uncle also named mark served for years james lippert lt lipperts father and a lawyer received a deferment during the vietnam war but he says "ive talked to mark that i truly regret not serving my country i had some of my best friends killed in vietnam " as a teenager lt lippert dreamed of becoming an intelligence officer like the fictional jack ryan in the movie "the hunt for red october " while obtaining a political science degree at stanford university he considered officer candidate school but instead stayed at stanford for a graduate degree in international relations he then went to washington seeking a foreign policy job after a stint at the state department he worked for democratic sens diane feinstein and tom daschle before joining the foreign operations panel of the senate appropriations committee rising fast based on his smarts and ability to forge strong relationships with capitol hill staff on both sides of the aisle lt lippert said he felt an urge to join the armed forces as the u s undertook more military actions following the sept tragedy he got the lengthy application in labored over it for months and finally applied to be a navy reservist in january he was commissioned he began working one weekend each month at the office of naval intelligence in suitland md around the same time sen obama newly elected from illinois joined the foreign relations committee a perfect perch for a politician with presidential aspirations to burnish his foreign policy credentials and speak about international hot spots he asked his new chief of staff pete rouse who had run u s senate majority leader tom daschles office before his defeat for recommendations of a foreign policy aide mr rouse had worked with lt lippert and suggested him among others lt lippert saw a brand new senator with little traditional foreign policy experience still "i could tell barack loved foreign policy " lt lippert says as the two men began to travel the world on senate business their personal ties began to grow tall and solidly built lt lippert is laid back and jovial at ease joking with sen obama between meetings or riding in the car with him during a "smoke" before the senator quit recently they also have intense bursts of serious conversation debating what are considered realistic timetables to secure nuclear material around the world in september the two men traveled to russia on a weapons inspection trip they arrived hours early in moscow and wanted to work out when the senators luggage was delayed he borrowed lt lipperts size sneakers even though they were two sizes too large after lifting weights at the u s embassy in moscow lt lippert recalls sen obama said "lets play one on one " the men played an intense game until they quit sweating with sen obama the winner "barack has better moves and longer arms " says lt lippert sen obamas take "excuses " in january sen obama as part of a congressional delegation visited iraq where he bunked with lt lippert in the old pool house of saddam hussein a year into his reserve training lt lippert was gaining more insight into the military a development that sen obama valued in fallujah while sen obama met with one military official lt lippert stepped off to the side for a conversation with a marine colonel when sen obama caught back up with him he asked lt lippert "what did he say we should do to turn this situation around " lt lippert replied "leave " the trip lt lippert says helped strengthen sen obamas growing belief that the u s needed to start bringing its troops home the two men grew closer when sen obama set out in august for a trip to kenya his fathers homeland lt lippert asked retired air force maj gen scott gration who speaks swahili to join them gen gration later signed on to advise the presidential campaign he arranged for sen obama and his wife michelle to get an hiv test in an effort to publicize the problem of aids and promote testing and arranged for sen obama to go on live tv imploring kenyans to root out corruption as sen obama has built his presidential campaign he has attracted members of the democratic foreign policy establishment including anthony lake president clintons former national security advisor and former carter national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski lt lipperts role is largely behind the scenes working to refine sen obamas own ideas and finding other experts for input "im like a point guard " lt lippert says "barack is about ideas and questions and i dont have all the answers he trusts me to pass the ball to others to give him points of view " lt lipperts biggest influence may have been in focusing sen obama to stress confronting "trans national" threats that dont emanate from nation states threats such as genocide and weapons of mass destruction in april lt lippert helped draft the speech where the senator would lay out his foreign policy goals as a presidential candidate largely ignoring old line threats and institutions prominent since world war ii this speech laid out a "new vision of american leadership and a new conception of national security " sen obama said "whether its global terrorism or pandemic disease dramatic climate change or the proliferation of weapons of mass annihilation the threats we face at the dawn of the st century can no longer be contained by borders and boundaries " sen obama has also called for a far more aggressive approach to diplomatic engagement around the world including talks with iran syria and north korea and an easing of the travel ban with cuba hillary clinton harshly attacked sen obama after one debate calling his suggestion that he would meet with the leaders of hostile countries weak and naive a line of attack that others are sure to emulate "i honestly feel the senator is not nearly ready for prime time" on foreign policy says douglas mackinnon former adviser to sen bob dole sen obama "has lived foreign policy " says lt lippert with a kenyan father an american mother and a childhood spent in indonesia "barack has a unique and deep rooted understanding of the world and the u s place in it " adds samantha power a harvard professor and pulitzer prize winning author who advises the obama campaign "obama has plenty of people rounding out his foreign policy circle but ultimately he wants st century not conventional ideas " at the start of this year as the need for fresh troops intensified lt lippert sensed his time to get in the war was approaching just as sen obama announced his candidacy for the democratic nomination for president "i want to get called up " he told ms schmidek his fiancee "i dont just want to drill on the weekends i want to make a difference right away it will be fine with me if i go to iraq " in june lt lippert received word that he was being activated and had to report to duty he reached sen obama on his cellphone in chicago "hey i got mobilized " he recalls saying "its definitely happening " "im worried about you " sen obama replied "i want you to be safe " but lt lippert still worried about his job "the timing isnt great " "i dont care about that " sen obama said according to both men "dont worry about us just get back here in one piece " lt lippert helped enlist denis mcdonough onetime foreign policy advisor to former sen daschle to take over his role over the past three months while preparing to be deployed lt lippert has remained in touch with his office from his bachelor officer housing he has been briefing his successor by email and cellphone recently the campaign sent him a terrorism speech that sen obama was set to deliver on another night it was an op ed column on cuba but lt lippert says he has ignored much of the campaign material sent to him because of his current mission he also says hes just too busy drilling with an m and full suit of body armor in the california desert and learning wartime intelligence gathering techniques recently lt lippert fulfilled his final training dropped into a simulated operations center to provide intelligence to a seal team in a fake iraqi village complete with coyotes and scorpions and fake insurgents lt lippert says he is looking forward to coming back in several months rejoining the obama campaign and getting married to his fiancee "when youre going off to iraq your horizons become more short term " he says earlier this week he returned home to washington for a few days sen obama on the way to the gym spotted lt lippert on the street near the capitol "come work out with me " he yelled lt lippert said hed stop by the office that afternoon when they met sen obama and lt lippert embraced "i think ive gained weight during training " lt lippert complained within minutes the two men had shut out the rest of the bustling senate office they sat in a corner and whispered sharing deep throated chuckles and gossip when sen obamas secretary tells him for the third time that he has to go to a meeting the men are momentarily silent then stone faced "be careful over there " sen obama says lt lippert replies "dont worry " sen obama adds "i need you back here "
