billy paid &# billion to buy seven new york buildings from equity office properties trust the deal was stunning for its speed the contract was signed less than two weeks after talks began and for its stratospheric price at about &# a square foot it also looked like a coup for mr macklowe allowing him to complement his already sizable new york property collection with seven buildings in prime locations in midtown manhattan much of his fortune is on the line including a &# billion personal guaranty by mr macklowe on a short term equity loan from wall street according to debt offering

market appears to have changed significantly since that time " says peter hennessy president of the new york office of staubach co a real estate firm "however harry and billy macklowe are extremely creative and im confident they will solve whatever issues they face " through a spokesman mr macklowe declined to be interviewed for this story a spokesman for deutsche bank also declined to comment

expensive real estate deals in u s history symbolizing the skyrocketing prices paid for buildings at a time of unprecedented liquidity cheap debt and demand for office buildings particularly in the worlds financial capitals the transaction was emblematic of the lax underwriting standards of the real estate boom macklowe properties put in only &# million of equity and borrowed &# billion according to the documents mr macklowe borrowed more than the purchase price to cover closing costs and other fees the deal also had "negative debt service " meaning that the rents from the buildings werent expected to cover the debt payments for five years according to someone involved in the sale mr macklowes son billy who is president of macklowe properties and the public face of the company has said previously that the companys plan was always to reduce risk by refinancing bringing in an equity partner or selling "one or two" of the buildings howard rubenstein the companys public relations representative said all those options are still being considered "the present occupancy rate of approximately provides stable cash flow to allow for the appropriate repositioning of these assets " says mr rubenstein he adds that the buildings themselves and the income they generate could rise significantly in value nonetheless the credit crisis has made refinancing extremely difficult as few commercial mortgage loans are being done at all much less for properties that dont provide enough cash flow to cover the current debt service real estate experts say and while well located properties in core markets such as manhattan have held their value better in this crisis fewer big transactions have taken place making it difficult to get a true sense of how sales prices have held

of the general motors building a glistening two million square foot cash cow office tower on fifth avenue near central park for &# billion a record price at the time the building is now widely believed to be worth twice that amount the value of the gm building was one reason why mr macklowe could pull off the eop acquisition according to the debt documents the &# billion bridge loan is backed by pledges of "available" equity interests in all existing macklowe portfolio properties as well as the companys limited partnership interest in the gm building thus should mr macklowe default on the bridge loan deutsche bank and fortress which holds of the loan could grab his interests in a list of new york commercial buildings that macklowe properties owns in addition to the partial stake in the gm building fortress deutsche bank could also gain access to as much as &# billion of mr macklowes personal fortune forbes recently listed mr macklowe as no on its wealthiest list estimating
