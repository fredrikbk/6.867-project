encore a special report health matters boomers aging jaws spark more interest in dental implants when vince narcisi cracked a dental crown he was surprised at the advice he got his dentist told the year old to replace the tooth with a bridge but mr narcisi an information technology specialist with international business machines corp who lives in point pleasant beach n j says he didnt "want to have dentures in my life my mother in laws hurt her so much that she only wears them to go out i want to have a full set of teeth that are stuck to my gums " so after interviewing two other dentists he wound up getting a dental implant basically a substitute for the tooths natural root that is screwed into the jaw to anchor an artificial tooth "its as solid as a rock " mr narcisi says and the procedure required only a routine novocain shot many baby boomers and their parents have mouths full of aging dental work large fillings in particular are likely to crack as they grow older dentists say so older adults increasingly are turning to implants when regular crown work and root canals can no longer shore up problem teeth and new research and technology are reducing the time it takes to design fit and insert implants dentists oral surgeons and periodontists are now performing about one million procedures a year according to the american academy of implant dentistry a trade group in chicago "implants have increased dramatically in the boomer age group " says daniel hardy an atlanta dentist who does restorative work placing new artificial teeth on top of the anchors the cost is high about &# to &# a tooth depending on where you live that can be double the cost of a bridge or many times the cost of a set of dentures but implants can last years bridges by contrast can give out within a decade in some cases private insurers and medicare managed care plans are starting to cover at least parts of implant procedures until recently dental implants typically took at least three to six months to bond to the bone and involved at least two steps first the dentist or surgeon would drill a hole into the jawbone to secure a titanium screw at the same time he might also insert a post attached to the anchor to eventually hold the false tooth or teeth or he might attach the post later either way the patient would have to wait at least three months while the bone and tissue grew back and bonded to the implant finally the dentist would attach a porcelain piece on top of the implant and post but now dentists have done enough research to conclude that in many cases they can do everything in one appointment lasting an hour or two or alternatively insert the implants one day and add temporary false teeth the next in about minutes most dentists and surgeons refer to that part of the process as "loading" the implants one note to get the best fit you still have to wait a few months for the bone and tissue to grow back before positioning permanent replacement teeth five periodontists including robert jaffin of hackensack n j published an analysis of implant procedures over five years that found "theres no difference between waiting or putting the teeth on the implants immediately " dr jaffin says the study was published in march in the international journal of oral &amp maxillofacial implants other studies also claim long term success rates for "immediate loading " another advancement is "radiographic imaging " says wes blakeslee a board certified implant dentist in manasquan n j who did mr narcisis implant new software tools give dentists three dimensional pictures of a patients jaw so they can plot the best spot for an implant design what sits on top and show the patient what its going to look like "the new ct machines let you do a fantastic diagnosis in your office " says kim gowey a dentist in medford wis and past president of the american academy of implant dentistry "you can see the bone and exactly whats there instead of looking at a two dimensional x ray where you cant see the thickness " finding out if a dentist periodontist or oral surgeon has such software is a good way to separate a dentist who is just starting to do implants from those who do them regularly you also can check a state by state directory online at aaid implant org which spells out different credentials in the field and several dentists recommended asking about experience and training and getting patient references the health and soundness of the jawbone helps determine whether a patient is a good implant candidate but bone grafts from other parts of the body often can help patients whose jaws otherwise couldnt support the screws dr blakeslee says some conditions and personal habits can make it tough for implants to bond to the bone including uncontrolled diabetes smoking and heavy drinking some patients on long term osteoporosis medication have problems as well says olivia palmer an implant dentist in charleston s c advanced age though shouldnt necessarily rule you out insurers are starting to offer help with costs principal financial group inc guardian life insurance co of america dominion dental services inc and unifi mutual holding co s ameritas group in some cases cover dental implants as an alternative to traditional dentures or bridges if youre and older and youre covered by a medicare advantage plan with dental coverage as an add on benefit you might have some coverage for related costs according to a spokeswoman for the centers for medicare and medicaid services in washington ms greene is a
