lifestyles baby sit maybe next time grandparents today are busier than ever and thats not good news for their adult children john and joan bissell of silver spring md embraced their new roles as grandparents with great enthusiasm upon the arrival several years ago of their first grandchild but there was one exception "no regular baby sitting " says mr bissell age who retired from his full time position at a marketing and consulting firm in the reason "were busy people " says mr bissell who works part time and enjoys travel the bissells and their peers are recasting what it means to be a grandparent in the early st century gone are the days of rocking chairs and compliant and somethings whose availability to mind the kids was taken for granted instead grandparents today "are often working far beyond the typical retirement age " says lillian carson a psychotherapist in santa barbara calif "if they are retired theyre doing things theyve wanted to do all of their lives " while increased vitality among older adults is something to celebrate some young parents say it comes at a cost both emotional and financial in more families grandparents arent able or willing to step in and give adult children a much needed break "when i was a kid if anyone in the family was in a pickle wed always know our grandparents would be there " says matt davidson who is a firefighter and owns an erosion control business in greenwood ind he figured that once he had children his parents would fill the same role but now that he has two boys ages and when the pickle arises mr davidson calls a baby sitter mr davidsons mother leigh kirk has a home nearby but is always on the run as a leading national salesperson for partylite a candle company based in plymouth mass its not that mrs kirk doesnt enjoy her grandkids immensely rather "my life is just crazy " she says "when i get the chance i suck up those grandbabies all i can then i have to be off again " while a grandparents absence because of work can be frustrating a preoccupation with diversions such as golf luncheons and travel can be even harder to accept brooke collier a part time speech therapist in boston has two boys ages and her parents who are retired have become interested in curling a team sport played on ice ms collier says she doesnt have high expectations for seeing her parents frequently because they live six hours away but even when a curling competition brings the couple to the boston area their involvement in the sport makes getting together problematic "im having a hard time coming to terms with my parents priorities " ms collier says nancy k schlossberg a counseling psychologist in sarasota fla says many grandparents arent available to help because they view their children as being better off than they were at the same age the numbers though suggest otherwise the median income of households with men in their s increased from an inflation adjusted &# in to &# in according to a study on economic mobility by the pew charitable tusts the brookings institution and several other think tanks but thats only because both spouses are working in a much bigger portion of families the study found once child care expenses for many two earner families are taken into account household income is likely to be lower than it was a generation ago those costs for one child range from &# to &# annually according to the national association of child care resource and referral agencies in arlington va that leaves many parents financially strapped and stressed after working long hours and in need of help from the grandparent generation jennifer leeds a mother of two sons ages and in a boston suburb works "more than full time" in the pharmaceutical industry while her husband works full time and attends law school at night though her husbands parents dont live nearby she says that even if they did she would never expect them to provide daily nanny care but she did hope that once they retired last year they would visit more frequently and provide relief from regular routines instead mrs leedss mother in law merle leeds says that upon retiring she and her husband moved farther away to florida for half the year while maintaining a home in the catskills region of new york for the summer moving closer to their grandkids "wasnt a consideration " merle leeds says "we just like our lifestyle " while some may see that kind of thinking as selfish dr schlossberg disagrees if parents are feeling disappointed the problem usually isnt what the grandparents are doing she says rather "its that there is an expectation gap between the two generations and it hasnt been talked about " to avoid strained relations parents and grandparents should begin discussing their expectations of the grandparents role before the first grandchild is born says dr carson in los angeles the conversation she adds should be broached by parents with non challenging questions to avoid making the grandparents feel any obligation for instance rather than asking a grandparent "how often will you baby sit " a better question may be "would you be open to baby sitting " dr carson says if parents ask for "a little help " they may assume that means baby sitting a few times a week but grandparents might think it means twice a month the generations also should try to understand each others needs their plans for how they want to spend their time and their feelings about child care dr schlossberg says some parents might be surprised to hear for example that their mother or mother in law is uncomfortable taking care of an infant and would rather wait to baby sit when the child is older or that a grandparent doesnt offer to baby sit because she worries about being perceived as intrusive and view discussions as continuous as circumstances change such as the birth of a second child so may the needs and priorities of the parents and grandparents dr carson says in some cases it may help for young parents to discard the image of a traditional grandparent dr carson says sage morris webster of orlando fla says she happily accepts her mother as a non traditional grandmother thanks to small adjustments she has made to avoid conflicts as her mother susan morris also of orlando tells it she has a strong bond with her year old grandson kaia but is so busy working as a commercial real estate broker that she has developed a lousy record of reliability as a grandmother ms morris recalls a few times when she agreed to pick up kaia from preschool "i was at work and something came up and suddenly im not minutes late im an hour and a half late " ms morris says now mrs webster makes sure there is always a backup plan in some families grandparents agree to help out by funding child care rather than providing it themselves "my husband and i are paying for before and after school day care for our granddaughter " says kathy evitts of clarksville ind who owns and runs a travel agency grandparents who arent interested in regular baby sitting should make it clear that it isnt because they arent interested in bonding with their grandchildren dr carson says the bissells explained to their daughter mary that they wanted to spend a lot of time with their grandchild but didnt want to baby sit on a regular weekly basis the couple also explained that they would be happy to watch the kids for longer periods say a long weekend to give the parents an occasional break their daughter says that knowing where to set her expectations helps her appreciate the ways her parents do spend time with her children "they dont sit around and bake cookies " she says "theyre active so theyll take them on a smithsonian tour instead " ms hube is a writer in westport conn she can be
