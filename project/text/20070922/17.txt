essay sleepless in retirement enjoy taking a nap you might want to keep it to yourself youd think it would be one of the incontrovertible highlights of retirement living a perk that we of a certain age free of the daily grind could indulge in without apology but no in some quarters it seems that the simple act of taking an afternoon nap has become vaguely suspect if not ill advised to nap or not to nap is a much discussed question among my acquaintances rivaling the days when we were young parents consumed with how to get our toddlers to nap and also sleep through the night sleep doesnt come so easily to most of us seniors our nights are often restless affairs punctuated by long boring spells around a m when we awaken suddenly completely rested and alert but know its way too early to switch on the coffeemaker if youre lucky you keep slumbering until the far more sensible hour of a m when you can make the case its time to actually get up both my husband and i tend to rise before dawn and get some of our most productive work done before breakfast what this means is that by midday sometimes earlier we are tempted to take naps my husbands pattern is to make himself a big bacon and egg brunch late in the morning then an eerie silence descends on the house i cant find him in the garden or at his computer ill tiptoe halfway upstairs where i can spy his bare toes peeking above the footboard of our bed hell be out for an hour at least and im ashamed to say it sometimes irritates me if chores and errands need to be done my own naps are more scattershot ill drift off on the couch reading the morning newspaper or occasionally ill log a marathon three hours of deep afternoon sleep better than anything i get at night but not without guilt pangs in which the terms "slug" and "sloth" figure prominently the puritan work ethic dies hard even for retirees it also crosses my mind ominously that my mother never napped until the last couple of years of her life its hard to imagine that i ever worked full tilt for eight or hours a day without so much as briefly resting my head on my desk in those days not so many years ago i got my best sleep on the metro north commuter train during my two hour slog home to connecticut from manhattan im sure that my snuffles and snores were notorious among the hard charging crowd of traders and investment bankers who shared my commute and on whose shoulders my nodding head would sometimes inadvertently rest even now it can be trouble if word gets around that youre a habitual napper once when i mentioned to a retired friend that one of our former co workers was given to sleeping away part of his afternoons my friend murmured dolefully "uh oh thats a bad sign " the implication our friend was depressed bored or seriously ailing could it simply be that the poor guy had finally learned to relax my brother rod who has been known to snooze the occasional afternoon away argues that for most of history in most other countries on the planet naps have been an established way of life still its hard to imagine pioneers on the american frontier ever having had time to nap and i suspect thats why our society of go getters tends to look askance at the practice two of the most vigorous seniors i know have turned napping into an art form indulging in what i like to think of as the "baroque" nap it all started years ago when ralph was posted to the american embassy in the african nation of chad the workday began at a m so he and barbara rose by after lunch the entire embassy took a siesta mainly because the heat was so enervating and the evening social schedule so demanding what with late night receptions horseback riding and tennis now retired and still rising by a m our friends bed down every afternoon turning off the phone and closing the shutters to darken their bedroom they sleep anywhere from minutes to an hour and rise "ready to start the day all over again " barbara says this usually means lifting weights a game of tennis or a bike ride or hauling rocks and mulch around their extensive garden when their doctor marvels at their vitality they credit their naps some doctors however perpetuate the notion that naps are to be avoided as assiduously as fatty foods nap and youll regret it they say conjuring up images of insomnia plagued nights sleeping pill dependence and other horrors i once consulted a new doctor after a sleepless hour bout with a vicious stomach flu after my examination i casually remarked "well i guess ill go home and get some sleep " he stopped in his tracks peered at me sternly and scolded "for gods sake whatever you do dont do that " it was then that i noticed his office was plastered with signs exhorting patients to "keep moving " his lifes mission seemed wrapped up in ridding the world of couch potatoes of course i ignored his advice and took a nap anyway the tricky part is deciding when a nap is merely a nap and when its a sign of something less benign for years now my husbands brother david who lives across town has been a champion napper we knew better than to call or drop in on him and his wife after lunch lest we disturb their sleep it was far easier to reach them at a m when they had already been up for at least an hour then on a routine visit to his doctor david complained that his blood pressure medication made him drowsy all the time he assured the doctor he was getting a full hours of rest a night at that point davids wife brenda piped up begging to differ she told of his nightly "sleep tantrums" how he did battle with threatening nightmare opponents flailing his arms and legs thrashing yelling and stomping on the floor exhausted from his exertions david sometimes needed a nap right after breakfast brenda wasnt exactly sleeping like a baby either so david was sent off for an overnight session at a local sleep clinic where he was wired to a computer with cords glued to his skull cheeks torso and legs a tiny microphone was hung over his moustache and a tube was inserted in his nose while a tv camera hovered on the ceiling bound and gagged with digital apparatus david was instructed to get a good nights sleep fat chance at a m the nightmares began so did the kicking punching and stomping david let fly with a pungent expletive he woke himself up shrieking for help then he glanced at the tv camera blinked mumbled "sorry about that " and fell back to sleep amazingly not a single wire had been dislodged in the commotion when the doctor later rolled the video he told david that he lacks a mechanism in his brain that renders most people virtually paralyzed while dreaming so davids legs for example twitch times more per hour than the norm his rem behavioral sleep disorder as its called cant be cured but its treatable with anti seizure medication the dosage had to be adjusted after one relapse but otherwise both david and brenda now sleep soundly all night and their afternoon naps those are mostly a thing of the past my brother and sister in law have their afternoons back and david has so much newfound energy hes taken up long distance bicycling ms graham is a writer in
