the week ahead our take on coming events climate will the developing world risk growth for green by jeffrey ball back to back high profile meetings on global warming this week are likely to produce a lot of hot air about whether the industrialized world should subject itself to tighter greenhouse gas "caps " in new york on monday a united nations session is likely to call for tighter emission mandates in washington on thursday and friday a bush administration conference is expected to talk up voluntary pledges but the debate over how to prod emission cuts by industrialized countries is fast being eclipsed by a more practical question how to create incentives for the cuts in the developing world many industrialized countries that have promised emission reductions under the kyoto protocol the existing climate change treaty are likely to miss their pledges even in ostensibly "green" europe and japan politicians tend to flinch from rules their domestic industry protests are too onerous meanwhile the u s which refused to ratify kyoto is about to be eclipsed by china as the worlds biggest greenhouse gas emitter the upshot even if say spain met its target and the u s signed up for one the atmosphere wouldnt feel much benefit unless china and other developing nations followed suit developing economies have made clear they arent about to subject themselves to emission caps the west enjoyed its fossil fueled century of economic growth they point out now it is their turn so the task facing the diplomats in new york and washington this week and in december at a bigger u n global warming conference in bali indonesia is to come up with a system that makes cutting emissions worth the developing worlds while more than a decade ago when the kyoto treaty was negotiated diplomats tried to do this by creating an international "carbon market " it lets industrialized countries earn credits toward their kyoto obligations by bankrolling emission reducing projects in the developing world where theyre cheaper that market essentially a capital shift from west to east is worth billions of dollars a year yet it still isnt significantly slowing emissions growth in developing nations china continues to build new coal fired power plants at a feverish pace now new ideas for green financial carrots are popping up one involves trees trees matter to the atmosphere because through photosynthesis they take in and store carbon dioxide the greenhouse gas thats emitted when fossil fuels are burned but cutting down trees is big business in many developing nations the kyoto treaty tries to encourage tree planting in the developing world by letting companies that do it peddle carbon credits an additional revenue stream some forest rich developing nations want to be able to sell such credits not just for planting new trees but for preserving existing ones that otherwise might be logged kyotos negotiators rejected that idea as too vulnerable to abuse how for example to ensure that protecting one stand of forest wouldnt push loggers to another tract but developing countries backed by some environmental groups now say forest monitoring technology has improved to the point where the rules should be loosened in the weeds financial debates like this tree fight are likely to prove at least as telling an indicator of progress in addressing global warming as more rhetoric about carbon caps housing rate cut perked up builders stocks but price cuts will sell the homes by michael corkery the federal reserves interest rate cut worked like a strong cup of coffee for home builders it jolted their sliding stocks as investors hoped that lower rates would help to stabilize the mortgage market the dow jones wilshire u s home construction index shot up the day of the fed move twice as strong as the rally in the broader market in reality the feds move may do little to restore the availability of higher risk mortgages that boosted the builders sales during the housing boom "i dont think the feds move is going to bring back subprime or is going to bring back alt a " toll brothers inc chief executive robert toll told investors at the credit suisse home builder conference this past week so when two of the nations biggest home builders kb home and lennar corp hold conference calls with analysts this week to discuss their fiscal third quarter earnings reports dont expect to hear much talk about interest rates instead listen for what these builders say about how much they plan to discount home prices cutting prices more than cutting interest rates is likely to address the builders biggest problem bloated inventories lennar of miami reports on tuesday kb home based in los angeles reports thursday aggressive discounting was on display last weekend when hovnanian enterprises inc held a hour fire sale offering discounts of as much as on certain homes for example a hovnanian home in southern californian originally listed for &# million was discounted to &# million a haircut the sale was partly aimed at reducing hovnanians supply of unsold homes and it worked the red bank n j builder generated sales about times greater than its average weekly sales pace in recent months "it proves there is pent up demand " hovnanians chief financial officer larry sorsby said "there are home buyers out there who are willing to buy a home if they think they are getting an attractive price " in its second fiscal quarter ended may lennar said average incentives were &# on houses valued at an average of &# that is up from a year ago when incentives averaged &# in july kb said its average home price had dropped in the previous months deeper discounts may be ahead if hovnanians success touches off a race to the bottom next saturday there is an auction of units built by d r horton in san diego one condo that was previously valued at &# has a starting bid of &# according to the auction web site "in markets where home prices almost doubled in four years you could easily see price cuts of to " said thomas lawler a housing economist based in vienna va that isnt to say that the feds move will have no impact on builders bottom line lower interest rates could assist the highly leveraged companies by reducing the cost of servicing the debt that they used to pay for land and construction the cut may also help avoid a broader economic recession which would cause housing demand to erode further but discounting to move inventory may be the builders most effective cure even if it means sacrificing profit indeed investors were facing reality by weeks end home builder shares gave back most of their gains "there is no easy way for this to be solved " says robert stevenson a real estate analyst at morgan stanley "everyone knows that pricing needs to fall dramatically to return the equilibrium of supply and demand " radio clear channels next act reducing debt could drag out by sarah mcbride clear channel communications inc shareholders on tuesday are expected finally to approve one of the years most contentious deals the radio titans &# billion privatization now the question is whether clear channel as a closely held company can successfully battle the tough conditions that have challenged the industry in recent years the clear channel vote has been delayed four times since the original date in march and the price has changed twice since the original &# a share the current offer to shareholders from bain capital llc and thomas h lee partners lp is &# a share but if getting the deal through has been tough building more value at the company may be tougher the radio industry is suffering from lagging advertising revenue and competition from ipods and satellite radio among other forces already the new owners have run into delays with one of their first key tasks selling off lower revenue generating stations in smaller markets unloading those assets is key to paying down the debt the company is taking on to privatize in a worst case scenario failure to do so could delay clear channels return to public markets "its tough to go public again at anywhere more than seven times leverage " says david bank an analyst at rbc capital markets referring to debt as a multiple of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization he thinks the companys new private holders initially hoped to go back to public markets within two or three years in current conditions "the new owners have to be prepared to own the company for as long as five to six years " he says bain capital and lee declined to comment as a largely closely held company clear channel will still have to make quarterly and annual filings with the securities and exchange commission in part because of "stub equity" stock a small portion of stock in the new company reserved for former new york stock exchange shareholders that will be quoted on the over the counter bulletin board but the company wont be in the public eye as much as when its stock traded on the nyse its hope is that the lower profile will free it to try new things without facing as much scrutiny for example it could increase or change the advertising inventory it gives to google inc to sell which currently represents less than of the companys spots that would be a controversial move in radio where many executives fear google will undercut rates the company could also more easily make game changing moves outside radio many industry analysts expect it to sell its outdoor assets outside the u s billboard titan j c decaux sa has already expressed interest inside the u s it could try new strategies for raising revenue from outdoor perhaps by selling outdoor advertising space through google to a large extent clear channel has already reshaped itself even before the votes come in it is selling off its television stations and smaller market radio stations while its former concert business is approaching its second anniversary as a separate entity "theyre a different company " says victor miller an analyst at bear stearns cos the paring down of operations should leave management free to concentrate on large market radio stations and outdoor ads he says ideally finding more efficiencies in the way those two businesses are run
