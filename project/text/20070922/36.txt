offers them where do i sign up dave steffes new brighton minn medicare msa plans first offered this year combine a high deductible health plan with a tax sheltered medical savings account these are part of medicare advantage the program in which the government pays private health plans to provide coverage to some medicare beneficiaries in an msa plan part of the money the government pays goes into your special savings account to pay medical bills medicare msas are similar to the health savings accounts some employers offer their workers and like hsas are potentially attractive to people with limited medical expenses unused sums carry over into future years both the deposits and investment income are tax free if spent on qualified medical expenses one plan offered by a wellpoint inc unit this year has a &# annual deductible and comes with a yearly msa deposit of &# someone with negligible medical expenses could see much of that contribution accumulate for health spending in future years but a participant with significant expenses would exhaust the account balance and then pay &# out of pocket before the coverage kicks in most health companies didnt venture into msas for but abby block the u s administrator of medicare advantage expects more offerings for and "increased growth over time " for a guide to medicare msas go to medicare gov and search for publication number im a year old semiretired consultant and do all my work as an employee of my s corporation i want to start collecting social security benefits and avoid exceeding the annual earning limit &# in can i avoid this by taking &# in salary and either leaving any additional corporate earnings probably &# or less in the company or declaring a dividend hank mcdermott moraga calif i understand your desire to avoid the social security rule that costs early retirees &# of benefits for each &# of salary and other earned income over the annual limit the earning test doesnt apply to dividends and other investment income and goes away when you reach full retirement age but be forewarned internal revenue service and social security officials also understand the advantages of limiting s corporation salaries and a too low figure may not pass muster theres a long history of the irs stepping in to challenge some s corporation salaries as unreasonably low says mark t nash a partner in the personal financial services practice at accountants pricewaterhousecoopers the irs may recharacterize dividends as salary social security spokeswoman kia green says that agency also may question such an arrangement and "may determine that the persons income for earnings test purposes is more than what the person reports as wages " mr nash says "the key is to try to document why you picked the number you did " for instance you might rely on salary surveys that show what consultants with similar experience are paid your strategy may work but "you can get too greedy " he adds another option obviously would be to delay claiming social security for a few years which would also increase your benefit down the road my husband is years old and started collecting social security at age i am years old and had planned to start collecting social security also at age under my own earnings record but since my social security payments will be significantly higher than my husbands i am considering waiting until i am age which will increase my payments even further in that case if i were to predecease my husband would he be able to collect my full social security payment or would he only be able to receive the amount which i would have been entitled to at age since he started his own social security at age erika redmond mahopac n y the social security survivor benefit isnt affected by the age at which the survivor began collecting social security retirement benefits however filing for survivor benefits before reaching full retirement age does reduce those survivor payments a surviving spouse who has reached full retirement age generally qualifies for a benefit equal to what was being paid to the recently deceased individual so in your example if you were to start collecting at age and die shortly thereafter your husband would get the benefit you were then receiving that survivor benefit would replace the smaller retirement benefit he was collecting based on his own work record looking at it slightly differently if you delay receiving social security past age both your retirement benefit and your husbands potential survivor benefit would be increased and what if you predecease your husband and you havent yet filed for social security in that case says social security spokeswoman kia green his survivor benefit would be either the same amount you would have received at full retirement age or it would be reduced by for each month he is under full retirement age i am years old and have several i and ee savings bonds that mature down the road would it be advisable to cash them in now and put the proceeds in one to five year cds don walters stuart fla this isnt an easy decision arguing against making the change cashing in savings bonds can trigger a substantial tax bill since tax on the interest is typically deferred until you redeem you cant cash bonds held less than one year and if any of the bonds are less than five years old you face a three month interest penalty notes james wilson a financial adviser in columbia s c also with bank cds you would then owe tax on interest as you earn it that said the highest yielding certificates of deposit pay more than topping most savings bonds how much you could gain is "largely dependent on when the bonds were purchased " says greg mcbride senior financial analyst at bankrate
