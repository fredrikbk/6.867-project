guns and butter how wars expense didnt strain economy foreign lending lessons from lbj how long will it last washington since president bush took office hes boosted annual defense spending by including &# billion over five years for fighting in iraq and afghanistan and doubled spending on homeland security at the same time hes cut taxes expanded medicare to cover prescription drugs approved &# billion to clean up after gulf coast hurricanes and signed bills that spend a little more each year on domestic programs for years critics said it couldnt last backed by some historical precedent president johnson is blamed by many for triggering inflation in the s by spending on both guns and butter but this time its been nearly painless inflation is in check the federal budget deficit is down from its peak and rests near its historical average of of gross domestic product a measure of the nations total output long term interest rates are relatively low whats mr bushs secret ingredient one strong revenue growth driven by an economy distinguished by surging profits and rising incomes at the top which are taxed more heavily than incomes at the bottom ingredient two tax cuts and spending increases which arrived when the u s economy needed a boost ingredient three and perhaps the most significant the willingness of foreigners to lend to the u s which finances the budget deficit without pushing up interest rates at a time when americans dont save very much "this situation is what youd call an exorbitant privilege " says menzie chinn a university of wisconsin economist "weve gotten a pretty good deal so far " no one knows when this bonanza might end although end it must for the coming year mr bush is expected to shave costs from programs and agencies unconnected to defense in the future the flow of cash from foreign lenders could dry up health care and social security could swamp the federal budget in the shorter term the combination of military spending and tax cuts could collide with spending priorities outlined by the capitals newly empowered democrats for now the budget the president will offer today essentially counts on continued good luck both he and congress recognize that neither the war in iraq nor the buildup in homeland security spending is a one time only expense both sides are talking about the need for a larger military a sharp contrast to the decline in post cold war defense spending that helped produce bill clintons surpluses mr bushs budget estimates iraq and afghanistan over the next two years alone will cost about &# billion and analysts say the five year price tag could reach &# billion mr bush is seeking to add troops to overall pentagon forces over the next five years democrats are even more eager to increase homeland security spending than mr bush indeed the congressional budget office last week estimated a bill the house has passed to improve aviation security and implement other recommendations of the commission would cost &# billion over six years a sum equal to roughly half the department of homeland securitys current annual budget democrats also have a long list of other domestic priorities to fund which include lower student loan rates and more science and health research theyve pledged to balance the budget and adhere to rules that require tax cuts and benefits increases to be offset somehow "it will be hard to attain those goals because of the squeeze that the defense budget and in particular that the cost of war in iraq is placing on us " says house budget committee chairman john spratt a south carolina democrat "these expenditures at this sort of level are consequential they necessitate trade offs " in the budget for fiscal which begins oct mr bush has said he will show how the deficit can be eliminated by without raising taxes the budget will give the administrations best guess about &# billion at the cost of iraq and afghanistan for a departure from past practice and what one administration official calls "a plug number" for an estimated &# billion but nothing beyond that the president is also expected to project spending less in inflation adjusted terms on annually appropriated spending outside of defense and homeland security much of that squeeze is expected to come in proposed freezes or cuts to federal agencies and programs "its going to be the tightest budget weve seen " says brian riedl a budget expert with heritage foundation a conservative think tank he predicts a call for "freezing most discretionary programs for the next five years " the big problem however remains the governments entitlement programs treasury secretary henry paulson says the budget deficit is "well below where anybody would have expected it to be several years ago" despite the costs of war and hurricanes he credits a strong economy and record tax receipts but he warns of "a looming collision with entitlements " and adds "i have no doubt we will deal with it but the longer we wait to deal with it the more expensive and the more painful its going to be to do it " some academic economists are beginning to gauge what the sums spent on iraq could have financed a down payment on a social security fix for instance nobel laureate joseph stiglitz predicts iraq will cost at least &# trillion assuming troops are withdrawn by "half that sum would have put social security on a firm grounding for the next years " he wrote last year in a paper "if we spent even a small fraction of the remainder on education and research it is likely our economy would be in a far stronger position " comparisons to vietnam are tempting but iraq isnt at least yet as costly as vietnam when compared to the overall economy its running about &# billion a year or about of gdp by the time it was over vietnam cost the equivalent of about &# billion in todays dollars overall defense spending today is higher than it was during vietnam when adjusted for inflation but is just about of gdp thats an increase from when mr bush took office but far from the vietnam peak of of gdp in and less even than the s cold war buildup even with the planned troop surge the u s will have about troops in iraq well below the vietnam peak it was the combination of military spending and president johnsons "great society" programs medicare health insurance for the elderly and medicaid for the poor that many say led to the "great inflation" of the s like mr bush mr johnson at first tried to fund the war through supplemental spending bills a move historians and contemporaries believe was aimed at cloaking the true costs so congress wouldnt scale back his ambitious domestic agenda inflation which had been below in the early s was running at above in by the u s was in a recession vietnam era defense spending added fuel to an economy that was already running at full employment and producing at capacity mr johnson resisted calls for tax increases to reduce the inflation risk fearing southern democrats would instead insist on cutting social programs the federal reserve partly under pressure from mr johnson but also because it mistakenly believed the economy had spare capacity was reluctant to raise interest rates to control inflation it had to raise rates higher later on by the time mr johnson imposed a surcharge on individual and corporate income taxes in it was too late although the government borrowed heavily in the s most of its borrowing came from inside the u s interest rates rose as a result the yield on year treasurys a benchmark interest rate began the s at it ended the decade at but the private sector saved enough to offset government borrowing and the u s economy was a net lender to the world this time interest rates havent risen as much because foreigners particularly in asia are eager to lend to the u s economy at fairly low rates the economy as a whole is a heavy borrower from the rest of the world in fact the u s government is particularly dependent on the willingness of foreigners to lend it money as of november foreigners owned about &# trillion of u s treasury securities or about of the public debt not held by the u s government compared with about in the early s the total u s debt which includes what the government owes itself is about &# trillion mr bushs ability to sustain spending and tax cuts depends largely on the willingness of foreigners to continue lending the u s money mr chinn the economist says that at some point global investors will lose their appetite for ever larger amounts of american debt that would trigger a decline in value of the u s dollar and an increase in interest rates "so far its not a problem because foreigners are willing to lend but youve got to wonder what happens when the rest of the world says were tired of taking paper that loses value pretty quickly " says mr chinn the bush era upturn in defense and homeland security spending came not during a s style boom but in a lull in the u s economy which had tumbled into recession even before the sept attacks that meant the economy had plenty of slack to absorb increased government spending without sparking inflation lee price an economist who until recently was research director at the economic policy institute a liberal washington think tank says defense spending created million private sector jobs between and while all other private sector employment fell by million at the same time the bush administration cut taxes in and on individuals dividends capital gains and estates among other areas the administration and some economists credit the cuts with spurring economic growth saying they provided incentives to business to invest and buoyed consumer spending the moment of economic slack may be in the past which raises the specter of inflation unemployment is about as low as the fed will tolerate and there are some hiring bottlenecks of the sort that were common during vietnam "were starting to see tightening up in the high tech market and people who were tied up with defense or homeland security are not available " says epis mr price war has other costs too some companies are struggling to keep jobs open for military reservists a congressional budget office report found that "some businesses may absorb the loss of personnel at little cost but others may experience slowdowns in production lost sales or additional expenses as they attempt to compensate for a reservists absence " the problems are more severe for small businesses or those that employ highly specialized workers the cbo said at fallon ambulance service in quincy mass more than of the companys full time employees are reservists and several have been deployed for stints lasting as long as two years "it does at times put a strain when we have large deployments " says stephanie eastwick director of human resources for the family owned company in the end it may be johnsons ballooning programs that prompt tough decision making the government has expanded greatly since the s and has made all sorts of promises to pay benefits particularly to older americans in coming years as war costs preoccupy official washington the retirement of the baby boom generation is growing closer the oldest boomers turn this year there is no sign of a political consensus on changing social security which has expanded since roosevelt launched it or on making more affordable mr johnsons health care programs social security medicare and medicaid already consume cents of every dollar that the government spends about &# trillion this year and are growing faster than the economy as a whole defense accounts for about cents of every dollar up from cents when mr bush took office in more than the government spends on education transportation scientific research and housing aid combined "we can continue doing what were now doing subject to foreigners being willing to finance it but eventually its going to do us in because medicare and social security are going to overwhelm the budget " says charles schultze a brookings institution economist who was among jimmy carters advisers the fed is watching carefully the lessons from the s inscribed in the minds of todays policy makers "there were plenty of signs in the s that inflation was accelerating yet monetary policy wasnt fundamentally changed " says former fed governor edward gramlich "today the fed would be more alert and is more likely to react forcefully to signs of accelerating inflation " greg ip contributed to this article
