monthly mutual funds review years after bubbles bursting a reinvention continues alliancebernstein aims to be anti hot idea avoiding data overload one afternoon in late ranji nagaswami chief investment officer of alliancebernstein investments met with a dozen morningstar inc analysts running through plans to close some formerly hot mutual funds and broaden some narrowly designed ones she asked if there were questions "do you work for alliance capital " don phillips managing director of the fund research firm responded many who knew the mutual funds business of alliance capital management holding lp back then might have been tempted to ask the same question in the s alliance was among money managers that became well known for niche mutual funds loaded with the go go stocks of the technology stock boom funds that left many small investors cold when the bubble burst under new management "we have now become the anti hot idea firm " ms nagaswami says the transformation of the new york firm majority owned by french financial services giant axa sa is one of many overhauls in the mutual fund world with roots in the bear market while alliance primarily is an institutional money manager overseeing investments for pension funds endowments and the like it has weathered withdrawals of money by individuals like many other firms that once promoted highflying stock funds the alliancebernstein story has a twist a merger with nearly perfect timing in hindsight which provided the executives to drive the change in june alliance capital known among institutional investors for its expertise in the "growth" style of investing agreed to acquire the smaller sanford c bernstein &amp co a closely held institutional money manager known for its bargain hunting "value" style back then the acquisition was viewed as a hedge by alliance for the day when growth stocks those of companies with rapidly increasing earnings or revenue would go out of favor and value investing would rule again as it turned out the deal happened as the handoff was taking place technology and other growth stocks were entering a bear market and undervalued diamond in the rough value stocks were poised to surge in one sign that change has taken hold alliancebernsteins stock and bond mutual funds are once again pulling in money since june investors have put more money in than they have taken out about &# billion through december according to financial research corp before this the companys mutual funds had net redemptions for every month between july and may totaling about &# billion according to frc at a morningstar conference last year mr phillips told an audience that the firm was on its way to becoming a "first class" fund manager with &# billion in its mutual funds alliancebernstein is the nations th biggest fund company in terms of money under management up from th in according to frc including accounts for wealthy and institutional clients alliancebernstein said it had a total of &# billion under management as of dec the bernstein acquisition brought &# billion in money under management still challenges loom while funds like alliancebernstein value and alliancebernstein international value delivered stellar returns in some including alliancebernstein large cap growth fund lagged behind peers according to morningstar industry consultant geoff bobroff of east greenwich r i thinks alliancebernsteins growth investing team could be more conservative than before which could damp results relative to some peers alliance executives say they are on the right track james reilly a manager on the firms large stock growth investing team says the firms investment strategy is as aggressive as before and is in line with what investors pay them to do he says it has been tough for growth managers to outperform unless they took on a more value oriented investment approach which alliancebernstein large cap growth fund hasnt "the worst thing we can do for our investing client base is to change our philosophy " he says morningstar analyst dan culloton points out that some of the companys mutual funds are relatively expensive expense ratios eat into returns and even after a recent fee cut ratios for some alliancebernstein funds are or more compared with for the average u s diversified stock fund according to morningstar ms nagaswami says there is a "firmwide effort" to control expenses adding that some funds arent big enough to have economies of scale to pass on to investors much of the change began in june when then alliance capital chairman and ceo bruce calvert handed over the ceo reins to lewis sanders who had been chairman and chief executive officer at bernstein and became alliances vice chairman and chief investment officer after the merger mr sanders now years old didnt get much time to ease into the job the firm faced litigation brought by the florida state board of administration which oversees the state employees pension fund filed in may the suit alleged that the retirement fund lost more than &# million as a result of purchases of enron corp shares by alliance that "were negligent from the start and became reckless over time " the houston energy company collapsed into bankruptcy court protection in late alliance denied wrongdoing in jurors in a state court in tallahassee fla decided alliance didnt do anything wrong in the matter alliancebernstein spokesman john meyers says during the years the firm managed a portion of the pension funds assets it created more than &# billion of wealth for the fund above the return of the broader market including enron losses as that litigation was unfolding many mutual fund investors burned by the market rout were moving their money then in october alliance became embroiled in an industrywide investigation into alleged "market timing" abuses market timing refers to the rapid buying and selling of fund shares which can raise costs and lower performance for other fund investors in november two alliance managers one who headed the mutual funds unit and the other who was in charge of funds distribution were replaced by bernstein veterans a month later alliance settled market timing regulatory charges agreeing to pay &# million in restitution and promising fee cuts in its u s mutual funds according to the complaint filed by the securities and exchange commission the market timing arrangements involved five of the largest funds and occurred even though it was acknowledged within alliance that they hurt fund shareholders the firm neither admitted nor denied the allegations the good news mr sanders "had the ability to shall we say calm the waters of most institutional clients " says mr bobroff mr sanders recalls "the most important thing by far and away was to establish a sense of purpose a clear mission for the firm overall " mr calvert retired in late beginning what some observers call the "bernsteinization" of alliance the mutual funds unit generally is led "by people with a bernstein heritage " mr sanders says "the set of objectives the mission the values were trying to promote have a long heritage at bernstein and by the way did too in parts of alliance but not all of alliance " mr calvert says "i dont particularly view it as an alliance thing or a bernstein thing " while alliance had been successful he says the managers wanted more centralized management a broader array of investment products and a bigger presence globally "in many ways the firm has evolved the way we had envisioned it maybe even better " he says the experience of then named alliance premier growth fund illustrates the changes the firms flagship fund during the tech stock boom it returned nearly in and swelled to nearly &# billion by it was one of alliance mutual funds ranked by morningstar with four or five stars meaning it was a top performer in its category though the research firm cautioned in that investors "uncomfortable with a lot of volatility would do well to look" at another fund from the fund averaged a a year decline a performance worse than nearly three quarters of rival funds among losing positions a big enron stake the funds manager was alfred harrison who also oversaw the florida pension fund account retired from alliance mr harrison has denied any wrongdoing in the purchases of enron stock he declined to comment for this story mr meyers says mr harrison was fooled about enrons problems like everyone else an member team now helps to decide on holdings for the fund renamed alliancebernstein large cap growth fund many members are from the old alliance ms nagaswami says there was always a team overseeing the fund but mr harrison had leeway in stock selection today final selection is made by five team members while the fund gained in to finish in the top of its category it was in the bottom in with a loss of besides mr harrisons old fund six others from alliances stable were renamed and investment guidelines broadened for some eight stock funds were liquidated alliance has added funds many in a booming category industrywide known as "target date" funds these are funds of funds aimed at meeting investors retirement needs with broad based holdings overall of alliancebernstein mutual funds that have three year track records were in the top of their categories on an annualized basis at the end of compared with of funds that held top quartile records in for the previous three year period as the bull market neared its peak mr sanders has launched research teams to focus on "strategic change" themes such as the broadband revolution and hybrid vehicles the firm is increasing use of quantitative techniques in the research process feeding computers with market data to help figure out the right time to buy or sell securities mr sanders says conventional methods of choosing securities are "pretty much hopeless" in a world of information overload "quantitative methods are really helpful in bringing order to what is a clearly complex information management problem " the approach long had been applied at bernstein
