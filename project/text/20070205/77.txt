politics &amp economics hong kongs baby boom expectant chinese travel to dodge one child policy hong kong in china longstanding family planning policies limit most urban families to just one child but that didnt stop a year old merchant named ms li two weeks ago she gave birth to her second child here in the former british colony of hong kong a hour bus ride from ms lis home in fujian province hong kong maintains separate government records from the rest of china so ms lis newborn son wont count toward her familys quota "i wanted to have a second child to keep my daughter company " says ms li who asked to be identified only by her last name from the hospital ward she and other well off chinese women are discovering ways to wriggle through bureaucratic loopholes in their governments one child policy some pay rural women who are often allowed two children under the policy to pretend a child is theirs others accept a fine of between two and times a familys yearly income dubbed "social alimony" for having too many children giving birth in hong kong has become one of the most popular ways to dodge the system it has even spawned an industry of so called birth tours run by operators who charge as much as &# including hospital fees to arrange trips for pregnant women from mainland china to hong kong a hong kong company called smartbb provides accommodation food and help with legal paperwork "having your babies in hong kong will guarantee your children glorious future " smartbb advertises on its web site breaches of the one child policy by wealthy chinese with the means to dodge the ban have fueled anger in china where the growing gap between rich and poor is a sensitive topic one recent survey conducted by the china youth daily newspaper found that of people surveyed online thought violations of the policy were "getting serious " two weeks ago zhang weiqing minister of the national population and family planning commission held a news conference to reiterate that china wouldnt loosen its one child policy he said a baby boom generation born in the early s has reached childbearing age and dropping the restrictions would risk another population surge enforcement of the policy at the local level can be extreme "after having a first child married women are required to have checkups at the local obstetrician every three months " ms li says if they are pregnant her understanding is that "theyre required to have an abortion " she says the family planning commission said it "explicitly forbids any forms of coerced abortion being used to carry out birth control policy " it also said the agency discourages mainland mothers from giving birth in hong kong and is revising existing laws to deter mothers from flouting chinas birth control policies dodging the one child policy has had a huge impact in hong kong a special administrative region of china where the policy doesnt apply in nearly mainland chinese women gave birth in hospitals here making up more than a third of all births in this city of seven million that is up more than from hong kong births to mainlanders in all those babies are putting a strain on hong kongs public hospital system some mainland chinese women show up without appointments or prenatal records some leave before they pay costing the government hundreds of thousands of dollars annually after the issue became a point of contention in hong kongs legislature government hospitals increased their rates but immigration authorities rather than trying to stem the tide entirely have simply tried to make it more orderly last month they announced that women more than seven months pregnant crossing the border from mainland china would have to provide proof that they have booked hospital space until now public hospitals have admitted women like ms li mostly as emergency cases but as of feb they can make appointments private hospitals are hoping to capitalize on the opportunity baptist hospital a top private hospital does two thirds of its obstetrics business with mainland women and will be adding beds to its facilities in april "its still definitely not going to meet the demand and we have even further expansion plans " says the hospitals chief executive dr hak fai chiu ms li says she was able to pass through her pregnancy without her local government taking notice and forcing her to have an abortion by leaving town frequently she might have still been able to have her second child at a local hospital but it would have been costly "my family is wealthy so even if i manage to give birth stealthily in fujian i would have to pay a big penalty once i was caught " she says giving birth in a public hong kong hospital cost her about &# in fees during her pregnancy she took several uncomfortable overnight bus rides from fujian to hong kong getting in was no problem ms li said she had a day entry visa and could extend it easily if needed "so in theory i can stay here as long as i want " she says nonetheless mainland chinese parents planning a hong kong birth face big hurdles timing a birth with a trip to a foreign city requires experience and patience back in mainland china ms lis son will be considered an outsider and might have problems enrolling in public schools and getting treatment in local hospitals because he wont be registered as a local resident on the other hand many parents think being born in hong kong will give their children a leg up in life "the hong kong identity is a plus to my baby " ms li says he will enjoy special privileges out of reach to those born in mainland china including the right to residency and schooling in chinas most prosperous and developed city and a hong kong passport affording greater freedom to travel abroad chinese officials may yet find a way to penalize families for dodging the quota through hong kong but for now ms li remains sanguine "if anything happens ill deal with it when it comes " she says
