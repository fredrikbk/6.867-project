particular produced a series of ads that resonated among a group of ad executives and consumers who talked with the wall street journal after seeing the super bowl ads among the most popular was a bud light spot crafted by omnicom group inc s ddb showing a string of men slapping each other the ad was "one of the favorites of the game " says greg yeadon a year old student at northwestern universitys kellogg school of management in evanston ill who was watching the game with a group of students and faculty "it is something i can imagine catching on like other bud ads have in the past like the whassup stuff " says kristi bridges creative director at the sawtooth group ad agency in new jersey referring to the popular budweiser ads that ran in despite the standouts this years super bowl ads overall didnt live up to the hype surrounding them even a surprise cbs corp promo managed to outshine some of the big spending advertisers the spot showed indianapolis native david letterman wearing a colts jersey and chicago resident oprah winfrey sporting a bears jersey snuggling on a couch "it is one of the best things ive seen so far " says christopher celeste a year old who works at a technology startup in cleveland about million viewers in the u s were expected to watch the game on cbs an audience far bigger than any other television broadcast attracts advertisers paid as much as &# million for second spots confident that viewers would pay special attention to the commercial breaks more than half of u s adults who watch the super bowl do so as much or more for the commercials as for the game itself according to a survey conducted by harris interactive inc for hanon mckendry the brand consultants while anheuser busch is an old hand at producing winning super bowl ads nationwide mutual insurance co catapulted into that territory for the first time with an ad starring kevin federline wannabe rapper and singer britney spearss soon to be ex husband as a worker in a fast food joint the idea be prepared with an annuity if life throws you a surprise blow "i loved it insurance and pop culture together now thats an accomplishment " says jon bond co chairman kirshenbaum bond + partners interpublic groups tm advertising created the ad successfully tying into the countrys obsession with celebrity nationwides ad managed to generate millions in free publicity over the past three weeks early polling on wsj com had coke ads and bud lights classroom spot leading the pack coca cola co returning to the super bowl after an eight year hiatus was the clear winner of a much anticipated matchup with its archrival and prolific big game advertiser pepsico inc ad executives said "coke was brilliantly done superb " raves christian barnett an ad executive at brand buzz a unit of wpp groups young &amp rubicam even though cokes ads have aired in recent weeks on foxs "american idol " and lacked the advantage of surprise they still captured the attention of advertising experts and viewers last night good news for coke which has struggled with lackluster advertising in recent years one made to look like a videogame showed an ominous looking do gooder character passing out coke to the people he meets while the other whimsical spot reveals what happens inside a coca cola vending machine "it made me feel good " says steve archer a year old vice president at a financial firm in st louis mo both spots were crafted by wieden + kennedy in contrast pepsicos ads promoting sierra mist brand were seen as generally missing the humor mark though one featuring a man with a freaky looking beard comb over did leave some chuckling pepsi sponsored the half time show user generated ads those created by consumers rather than ad agencies created a buzz maybe the biggest winner of the night was year old dale backus an amateur filmmaker who won doritos contest for a member of the public to produce a super bowl commercial doritos are made by pepsicos frito lay in the latest example of how the user generated content trend has swept madison avenue doritos revealed the winner publicly only when the ad aired the high quality of the spot featuring a guy getting into a car accident had some on madison avenue a bit nervous "its kind of scary that a consumer can come up with stuff that good " says simeon roane executive creative director at the new york office of publicis usa a unit of publicis groupe doritos seemed to agree yesterday the company announced that the top five finalists in the contest would run on national television through march the company also decided at the last moment to air the runner up in the contest a funny ad showing a supermarket checkout girl during the super bowl broadcast also tapping into the user generated phenomenon was general motors corp s chevrolet whose ad originated with an idea proposed by katie crabb a freshman at university of wisconsin but the spot was a bit more polished than that of doritos because chevys ad firm helped to produce it the commercial featured a group of girls in a chevy hhr a retro style miniwagon enjoying watching their car being washed by a group of half naked men who cant seem to take their hands off the car all super bowl advertisers though had a tough task trying to drown out anheuser busch which aired a total of nine ads for budweiser bud light and bud select the brewers super bowl ads are routinely among the most popular with viewers and this year was no exception among the group of advertising executives among the spots generating a positive reaction was one heartfelt spot featuring a dog making his dreams come true and another funny ad showing a game of rock paper scissors another spot showing latino comic carlos mencia teaching english to a room of immigrants was a particular crowd pleaser "i love the spot it was hysterical " says holly ross a year old who was watching the game in cincinnati one spot that is likely to generate much water cooler discussion today is mars inc s ad for snickers featuring two mechanics sharing the candy bar in what is a somewhat bizarre spin on the famous scene from "lady and the tramp " where two dogs simultaneously eat the same strand of spaghetti "its very funny but also disturbing on so many levels " says mark dimassimo ceo of dimassimo goldstein in new york general motors won the battle of the automotive titans its ad via interpublics deutsch featuring a robot that dreams about losing his job got high marks from advertising executives for using a different approach to the typical car ad that shows cars speeding around curvy roads many said the ad was "epic" but some predicted the spot would rub certain viewers the wrong way "how many folks in detroit were put out of work because of robots " asks rob feakins president and chief creative officer of the new york office of publicis usa the hype surrounding super bowl ads has raised expectations of viewers about what they will see making it difficult to please audiences and overall this years crop of ads fell a bit short "the game is better than the ads for a change " says michigan state university advertising professor bruce vanden bergh ad folks blame the lackluster output on the larger number of marketers who jumped into the game late in the process and either ran ads that had been seen before or ran new ads that werent designed specifically for the super bowl "if you are going to pay that price tag you better go big " mr dimassimo added honda motor co for instance ran two ads that have aired before revlon inc jumped into the game only in recent weeks producing a new spot starring singer sheryl crow but one that wasnt designed specifically for the super bowl some ad executives gave the company credit for entering the male dominated arena its ad promoted a new womens hair coloring product also disappointing were several advertisers that have previously scored big in the super bowl including fedex corp careerbuilder com and e trade financial fedex which scored strongly last year with an ad set in the stone age this year went for a moon setting but the ad created by omnicom group inc s bbdo didnt measure up "it was a big ad but it doesnt pay off " says brand buzzs mr barnett "last years dinosaur ad was so much better " still the package delivery giant didnt entirely flame out another ad that exaggerated the saying "its not what it seems" managed to get some points the spot was "amusing and fun " says jeff kling executive creative director of the new york office of havas sas euro rscg also drawing some grumbling this year was careerbuilder com the online job site jointly owned by the newspaper publishers gannett co mcclatchy co and tribune co it has pleased viewers in recent years with super bowl spots showing offices where monkeys sat working at desks but this year the company left its monkeys behind in favor of such spots as one showing office workers fighting hand to hand over a promotion "where are the chimps " says mr roane but the biggest fumble of the night come from flomax the prostate drug from boehringer ingelheim corp the spot which described the drugs side effects as including a "decrease in semen " showed men competing in a bike race ad executives questioned whether such ads should run during the super bowl "call me a prude but there are kids watching the game " says mr feakins the company is required to list the drugs side effects in ads the drug maker recognizes the personal subject matter in the spot and told the wall street journal last week that it elected to run the commercial late in the game to avoid younger audiences
