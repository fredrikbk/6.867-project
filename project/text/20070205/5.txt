bangladesh on the brink and sumit ganguly with the worlds attention focused on whether accountable government can take root in iraq the democratic life blood of a much larger muslim country bangladesh is seeping away with hardly a murmur from the international community home to million people and once considered a stable secular muslim democracy bangladesh is becoming a de facto military controlled state earlier this month scheduled elections were cancelled and a state of emergency was imposed when the caretaker government stepped down under military pressure the government is now headed by fakhruddin ahmed a former world bank official along with advisors and no functioning parliament mr ahmed has pledged to hold elections soon but all indications suggest that the army is in control while some foreign and domestic observers are optimistic that the army can clean up the corruption and dysfunctional political structure this is wishful even dangerous thinking the international community must act immediately to compel dhaka to lift the state of emergency restore full rights withdraw the army from the political arena and establish a specific date for credible elections some troops have been deployed in recent weeks and more than people have been detained with a history of prolonged military rule since gaining independence from pakistan the armys political adventurism is unlikely to rehabilitate bangladeshs feeble democracy the international community has not learned from pervez musharrafs similar experiment in pakistan under gen musharraf democracy has not flourished and the political parties have not become more competent the roots of bangladesh problems run deep the political system has been destroyed by an acrimonious power struggle between the bangladesh national party led by the most recent prime minister khaleda zia and the opposition awami league led by the former pm sheikh hasina wajed both have prioritized personal gain above the needs of the state they have forged faustian bargains with islamist groups to maximize their chances of victory since the elections islamist parties have become king makers and enjoy some ministerial positions which are not earned by their electoral strength some of these parties have been linked to terrorist groups these terrorists have targeted secular artists and intellectuals sufi shrines the minuscule ahamaddiya community and key members of the opposition in august within an hours span islamist militants detonated hundreds of small bombs across the country and demanded that bangladesh become an islamic state based on shariah while some of the most notorious islamist militants were detained key members of harkat ul jihad bangladesh and jagrata muslim janata bangladesh remain at large bangladesh is responsive to public exhortation and receives significant international aid donor countries can achieve leverage if they coordinate and render some forms of assistance conditional multilateral agencies can pressure dhaka by convening high profile meetings to discuss democracy some bilateral programs such as u s aid to security forces are subject to the provisions of the leahy amendment which restricts aid when there are human rights abuses public discussions of the leahy requirements may exert pressure on those institutions that value u s security programs finally the u s and the commonwealth of which bangladesh is a member have a suite of punitive measures should there be martial law the army must be reminded of this to discourage any extraconstitutional action and to teach it that the suppression of democracy cannot be a cost free business ms fair is the managing editor of india review mr ganguly is a professor of political science at indiana university bloomington
