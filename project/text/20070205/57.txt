indian growth story he spends his days analyzing step into the hallway outside his fourth floor office and find workers with head wraps and slippers installing an air conditioning system for the building on the ground floor find a directory of employee recruiting and computer software companies that are rapidly filling the floors while vendors sell fruit and chinese food at bustling stalls outside drive a few minutes to the sleek asian heart institute where foreigners are flocking for surgeries mr kothari years old is on the lookout for indian stocks that can benefit from all this change stocks that might find themselves in the portfolios of u s mutual fund investors last year indias benchmark stock market index finished up on top of a gain in and it is soaring to new records this year emerging markets mutual funds have been one of the u s mutual fund industrys fastest growing segments and indian stocks are well represented in many of these portfolios but mr kothari who works for the &# billion eaton vance greater india fund is one of surprisingly few stock pickers on the ground full time to assess companies across this vast country for american investors the emerging markets mutual funds category totals about funds buoyed by more than &# billion in net new money last year according to fund researcher morningstar inc more than a dozen of these funds were launched since including some in a niche known as the brics funds focused on brazil russia india and china in focusing exclusively on india the nearly year old eaton vance fund is something of a rarity offerings from amvescap plcs powershares unit and jpmorgan funds are poised to join this club as more u s savers seek to get in on the india action fund companies are grappling with how to staff the vehicles for their investment prices of many indian shares have started to approach valuations seen in developed countries and some analysts think stock picking will be more crucial to success than in the past when many stocks rose with the markets momentum many u s fund firms are content making stock picks from afar sending staff in for occasional visits some prefer the better oversight they have when portfolio managers are based in the u s or in the offices of an investment firm under contract in places like hong kong in particular many fund companies like their managers trades to go through a major office where conflict of interest or other quality controls can be better monitored some of the out of country arrangements are prompted by restrictions on foreign institutional investors by indian securities regulators some funds say keeping offices outside india also can help limit how much they are subject to potential indian taxes on fund management companies last year the investment company institute the u s fund industrys trade group sent a letter to indian tax authorities discouraging the imposition of such taxes the portfolio manager for the eaton vance fund is among those based in hong kong he is samir mehta for lloyd george management a hong kong firm that serves as investment adviser while a unit of eaton vance corp of boston handles

beyond what lead manager mark mobius does matthews india fund which has ramped up to &# million of assets under management since its october launch keeps its entire staff in san francisco "the thinking there is we lose out on the day to day news flow and corporate access but pick up a bit more objectivity and filter out some of the short term noise " said andrew foster a co manager who travels to india every few months to check on holdings usually at different times from fellow manager sharat shroff finding local staff also can be difficult the boom in indias own fund industry is creating a "huge huge scarcity of fund managers " especially those with several years of experience said mr kothari noting he may need a second analyst this year the indian mutual fund industry is flourishing as investors shift money out of traditional investments like gold and bank deposits and into the stock market drive through mumbai and giant billboards advertising new funds blanket the

to mr kothari almost daily to discuss trades their research focuses on "defensive elements" as the fund doesnt want to "own mistakes " said mr mehta on one three day road trip last year messrs mehta and kothari traveled from mumbai to the nearby town of pune to check on some holdings and potential investments on the way they quizzed strangers like a bridge contractor and farmer about their
