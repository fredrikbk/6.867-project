the daily fix manning and reinvented colts beat bears in soggy super bowl in four playoff games the indianapolis colts reinvented themselves a transformation culminating in the most wondrous metamorphosis of all into super bowl champs the colts won of regular season games despite being outgained on the ground by an average of yards per game yet in the playoffs they became the ball hogs outgaining all four opponents including three of the leagues top six rushing defenses and the leagues three stingiest in points allowed by an average of yards per game and in each game winning the time of possession battle and running at least more plays than their opponent in the colts last two games their patient balanced postseason attack and suddenly stout defense led them to comebacks from deficits of and eight points respectively in last nights wet sloppy super bowl even after the customary two weeks rest the chicago bears defense was worn down by the third quarter and indianapolis came back from a first half deficit to win its first major pro sports championship south florida sun sentinel columnist charles bricker captures a moment with four minutes left in the third quarter when "chicago bodies were splayed everywhere" as the colts racked up another big rushing gain "if ever a team was worn down in a championship game this was it " mr bricker writes "and it was done by a quarterback the great peyton manning who on the most euphoric day of his career displayed for the fourth time in these playoffs how a short controlled passing game with extended sapping drives can be just as lethal as deep strikes this was more joe montana than dan marino this was manning checking down throwing underneath the coverage using his tight ends and running backs to whip chicagos cover defense manning not only played great offense but in a sense great defense too by controlling the clock for more than minutes and running plays to chicagos his defense continually came on the field fresh and down after down smothered the bears offense " the boston globes ron borges marvels at the flipped script "the colts are the first team to win a super bowl after finishing last in the nfl in run defense making a postseason transformation that was nothing short of remarkable " mr borges writes that remarkable transformation brought joy to first time champion mr manning to his football clan to nice guy head coach tony dungy and back in indy to celebrating colts fans some shirtless despite temperatures barely above zero phil richards and diana penner write in the indianapolis star but the game didnt bring much joy to fans in miami who shelled out &# or more to get drenched for more than three hours at the game the first super bowl played in steady rain or to columnists who stayed dry in the press box but concluded the game was a disaster for the league "there was a scene in the third quarter that likely sent chills up the spine of the league honchos " mike freeman writes on sportsline "as the rain came down there were a few thousands empty seats spread out across portions of dolphin stadium many fans decided to go inside and watch the game instead of staying outside " after watching the teams fumble the ball on three straight plays in the first quarter the kansas city stars jason whitlock declares hes just watched the "worst super bowl ever " mr whitlock adds "wake me when the bears and colts are done exchanging field goals turnovers superconservative coaching decisions personal fouls dump passes to running backs and foolish slings to double covered receivers " still the game looked awfully pretty as captured by the lens of sports illustrated photographers in this gallery mr mannings steady performance in the downpour of yards one touchdown and one interception earned him an mvp award despite the worthy candidacies of running backs joseph addai and dominic rhodes and the approval of miami herald columnist edwin pope "you want to get picky about it other quarterbacks have lit up super bowl skies brighter than manning " mr pope writes "but no skies were blacker than the one manning was standing up against " mr pope knows from super bowl quarterbacks having covered every big game and lots of other major sporting events in his year career as noted in fridays fix the win now frees mr manning and the rest of us from "pressure monkeys or regret " as dan bickley writes in the arizona republic the belief that a great quarterback must win a title is as real as it is unfair mr bickley notes "funny but no one holds it against a stud left tackle if he never wins a super bowl " coaches are more understandably also judged by their finger jewelry and mr dungys win the first by a black coach in a super bowl has columnists cheering "dungy had overcome " joe posnanski writes in the kansas city star "he had stayed true to himself to his faith to his loyalty " when it was all over coach dungy was thinking about one word and it wasnt ring houston chronicle columnist john p lopez says all the coverage of mr dungy and his bears counterpart lovie smith who is also black failed to mention tom flores who years ago became the first hispanic coach to lead his team to the super bowl mr dungy praised before the game for prioritizing his family above football is rumored to be contemplating retirement "its no secret that being a coach in the national football league is a punishing job no matter whether you sleep in the office as so many coaches do or you dont " ashley fox writes in the philadelphia inquirer "it requires long tiring hours and time away from family time that cant be reclaimed once something at home goes horribly wrong dungy knows this his son committed suicide just over a year ago nothing could be worse than a loss of a child no matter how strong your faith " the colts played well but a better opponent could have made indy pay for repeatedly failing to close out long drives with touchdowns instead after "flirting with disaster all season the bears finally married it " bill plaschke writes in the los angeles times and now these bears can forget about supplanting or even complementing the legacy of the chicago champions mike mulligan writes in the chicago sun times "theyre just a footnote now the chicago bears " mr mulligan writes adding "it hurts too much to come this close and lose " the bears started stunningly well taking a lead in seconds on a kickoff return for a touchdown by devin hester the bears remarkable rookie return man ohio state collapsed after opening college footballs season finale with a kickoff return for a touchdown in part because return man ted ginn jr was injured on the play last night mr hester stayed healthy but was rendered irrelevant by squib kicks and high arcing punts meanwhile the bears suddenly soft defense and continually reckless quarterback rex grossman soon coughed up the lead before the game mr grossman called the press "ignorant" for criticizing his playoff performances despite not having watched as much film or practiced as long as he has his high arcing passes last night two of them picked off suggest he was running drills for the wrong sport perhaps helping the cubs shag infield flies one of his passes with the bears trailing by just five points with more than minutes left was returned for a clinching touchdown by colts defender kelvin hayden "grossmans decision to attempt such a throw given the situation could be described best as reckless " david haugh writes in the chicago tribune "ill advised even ignorant to use the word grossman himself introduced into super bowl week the sideline pass grossman floated to muhsin muhammad in the fourth quarter changed the super bowl more than any other play muhammad wasnt that open and the bears didnt really need to take such a risk at the time it turned out they couldnt afford one either " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at
