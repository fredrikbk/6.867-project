americas lights out in caracas venezuelas congress didnt sing the internationale last week when it granted president hugo chavez the power to rule by decree in a ceremony on caracass historic plaza bolivar but it did pledge unwavering allegiance to a socialist revolution that rivals the paris commune it was the moment venezuelans had been dreading for years the official installation of the dictatorship mr chavez had asked congress for the power to rule by decree because he said "it is necessary to draw up the mother of all revolutionary laws especially in the area of economics " now that he can govern unchallenged the first order of business under the new rules he says will be to seize control of the largest private electricity company in the country electricidad de caracas the privately held oil operations in the orinoco belt and the countrys largest telephone company known by its spanish initials as cantv this is shades of cuba and if things go according to plan it wont be long before caracas could start looking like havana venezuelans have been watching their democracy slowly suffocate for seven years now the militarized government has methodically gobbled up institutional independence it has bribed where it couldnt bully it has sowed hateful class envy each valiant effort by democrats to hold ground and salvage civility sapped a shrinking supply of fortitude thoroughly frustrated by a rigged system opponents called for a boycott of the congressional elections in december an abstention rate of to confirmed widespread dislike for the president but the few who showed up gave mr chavezs sympathizers of the congressional seats thats how the president "reelected" in december in a process that was neither free nor fair managed to get the legislative branch to hand him dictatorial powers one venezuelan newspaper captured popular opinion last week with the headline "heil hugo " comparisons between mr chavez and europes th century dictatorships are natural but they overstate the venezuelan presidents management skills at least mussolini made the trains run on time mr chavez on the other hand seems to possess a reverse midas touch under his leadership the country has soaring murder rates double digit inflation food shortages oil field depletion and a massive brain drain petroleum prices are coming off all time highs but a jan economist intelligence unit briefing referred to venezuelas "difficult economic climate " as well as "unattractive" labor markets and "severely distorted" financial markets the most high profile infrastructure news in the past seven years has been the collapse of one of the countrys busiest bridges the more likely fate of venezuela under mr chavez is that of cuba once the third richest country in latin america and now so poor and backward that it would take a major economic upgrade to qualify it as a banana republic sadly this is where venezuela seems to be heading much has been made of the threat to seize private property in the orinoco oil fields and to be sure this is a serious matter oil companies tend to yield to tyrants and venezuela is likely to get away with a lot even though it badly needs private sector technology but the oil industry is not the only one getting pummeled an equally alarming assault on property rights is the promised expropriation of the most reliable supplier of electricity in the country electricidad de caracas edc now owned by the u s company aes edc is not only a well run private sector enterprise it is also a symbol of the entrepreneurial ambition of venezuelans before the oil boom that changed the psyche of the nation the company was founded by a young engineer named ricardo zuloaga who read about hydroelectric transmission in a scientific journal in spent years raising capital traveled to europe to acquire the necessary equipment and once back in venezuela transported it on mules to build the plant edc began supplying electricity to caraquenos only about one year after the niagara falls electric plant started up in the u s edc remains caracass power supplier today and is one of the few things that still work in the country but that could soon change the government doesnt have a very good record of running utilities in according to the venezuelan daily el universal the state owned electric company cadafe which supplies most of the rest of the county was responsible for of the major power outages that affected venezuelan electricity users other state owned generation transmission and distribution facilities were responsible for a majority of the remaining failures edc which both generates and distributes electricity experienced only three major outages last year things got so bad halfway through that according to a report in the july issue of the economic newsletter veneconomia there was a spate of protests some violent against the headquarters of cadafe and its subsidiaries for the increasing frequency of power failures veneconomia commented on "the incomprehensible paradox" of cadafes performance in a country with abundant energy sources the explanation is simple there has been serious underinvestment in power generation and transmission at cadafe during mr chavezs tenure "from to cadafe completed barely of its investment objectives at a time when it registered millions of dollars in operational losses " veneconomia noted meanwhile energy demand increased per year nationwide since and in some areas of the country demand jumped by as much as per year over the same period though cadafe had been budgeted more than &# billion in government funds veneconomia said the company warned that the new thermal generation projects would take between two and three years to complete when aes bought edc in a hostile takeover in investors were already bailing out of venezuelan assets due to the shadow mr chavez was casting on his country aes thought it got a bargain but it may turn out to have overpaid the venezuelan government has still not said how it will value the company but it is doubtful that investors will receive the market price the real losers in this deal are likely to be the people of caracas they will not only have to suffer all the tribulations of a state owned electric company they will also be living in an environment where investors have been driven away write
