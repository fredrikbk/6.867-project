innolux lights up lcd sector taiwan firm thrives with unique model help from big parent taipei taiwan sometimes it pays to be small but have big friends innolux display corp a little known taiwan company with a powerful parent is managing to make money in the notoriously volatile liquid crystal display or lcd business even as larger rivals suffer from plunging prices shares in innolux which were listed on the taipei stock exchange oct surged in january but investors who want exposure to the lcd sector might still find them worth buying some analysts and fund managers say the lcd business has grown into one of the technology industrys biggest segments in recent years as the popularity of the flat screen televisions and computer monitors that use lcd panels has skyrocketed but the sector has also been bruising with boom and bust cycles that regularly send makers of lcd panels into the red innolux has two main distinguishing attributes first it has a unique business model that combines production of key components with assembly of finished lcd monitors and other products a strategy that helps insulate it from the lcd markets gyrations second it is an offshoot of taiwan giant hon hai precision industry co the worlds biggest contract manufacturer of electronics by sales which makes personal computers and other gadgets for a range of big name companies as a result innolux has access to some of those clients making lcd monitors for pc vendors including dell inc hewlett packard co and acer inc hon hai and its affiliates own a controlling stake in innolux their

most producers of lcd panels the large slabs of specially modified glass and other components sell their products to other companies that then assemble them into finished monitors or television sets innolux founded in as a subsidiary of hon hai instead integrates panel manufacturing and the assembly of final lcd products mainly pc monitors which account for of its sales it also makes panels for dvd players and mobile devices the company produces roughly half of the lcd panels it uses buying the rest from other lcd makers including fellow taiwan company chi mei optoelectronics corp that approach helps cushion innolux from the lcd industrys volatility allowing it to thrive even when lcd prices fall as they have recently "innolux makes big money when the panel supply is unable to meet demand but it also keeps a decent profit on the bottom line when the market is flooded with panels " says ken yu a flat panel industry analyst with sinopac securities in taipei he has a long term

maker to report declines in net profit for lin liang chun an analyst at j p morgan chase in taipei attributes innoluxs profit growth to rapid cost cutting in large part because the company is able to get good prices on parts from hon hai which makes a vast array of electronics components it also gets help from the parents global network of facilities which stretches from a huge manufacturing complex in southern chinas guangdong province to factories in the czech republic and scotland innolux benefits from hon hais "core competence of vertical integration of components customers and global logistics " mr lin says the j p morgan analyst says he thinks innolux could soon become the worlds biggest pc monitor maker he says he expects innolux to ship million monitors this year an increase of
