the evening wrap spending salvo president bush dropped his hulking four volume budget proposal on congresss doorstep this morning but lawmakers may take it up only long enough to heave it back down to the other end of pennsylvania avenue the &# trillion budget plan even in its broad strokes seems fated to provoke a spittle flecked catfight in washington the proposal would largely freeze spending on domestic programs at its current levels and seek almost &# billion in savings from benefits programs such as medicare and medicaid that alone would be more than enough to get the fur flying since democrats regained power on the hill with an extensive list of campaign promises on domestic issues but underlining the high price of the unpopular war in iraq the white house is also requesting &#

which has been snowing under more and more middle income taxpayers and which democrats have vowed to fix and then theres the war the administration is setting aside &# billion for the war in well short of current levels which makes a supplemental bill that year seem likely and after that no war funds are being held in reserve some smaller proposals tucked into the budget were also attracting attention the administration asked congress to slash the subsidies and fees collected by institutions that make student loans in what lender sallie mae called "harmful cuts" that would cause lenders to bolt from the program and "move us closer to a government run student loan monopoly " the food and drug administration would see a increase in funding the request for that agency also includes a
