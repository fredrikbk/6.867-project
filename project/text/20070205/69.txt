pentagon lowers space horizons satellite effort is likely to face budget pressures the defense departments budget proposal today will generally rein in spending on space programs previously one of the fastest growing defense segments partly by slashing funding and slowing development of the militarys most advanced satellite communications system according to industry and government officials the air force has opted to significantly stretch out its so called transformational satellite communications or tsat program reflecting broader budget pressures and continuing skepticism of big ticket pentagon space projects on capitol hill these officials said tsat is intended to be the centerpiece of a global network using lasers and internet like links in the sky to provide ultrafast and secure data and video transmissions connecting military ships planes unmanned aircraft and troops on the ground pentagon officials now want to spend less than &# billion for work on tsat in the fiscal year beginning oct according to these officials that is &# million less that the militarys last official projection and only half of what was seen two years ago such a cutback means at least an additional delay of a year in launch of the first satellite pushing it out until at least followed by further spending constraints and delays in building the remaining four spacecraft the move highlights how funding for various space programs is being curtailed partly to help pay the bills for the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan the tighter lid on space budgets is expected to affect a range of programs from space borne radar initiatives to ground based technology to track foreign satellites and orbiting debris at the same time pentagon planners face escalating pressure to find interim solutions to boost space based communications and surveillance capabilities ranging from expanded leasing of commercial capacity in orbit to stepped up procurement of existing military satellite hardware envisioned as the air forces most expensive space procurement item by the end of the decade the tsat program also was slowed in the last budget cycle now five years behind the original timetable project managers estimate the price tag for the project has been pushed above &# billion almost higher than the last pentagon estimate of around &# billion and almost double the original cost estimates around the latest problems come even before the air force chooses a prime contractor later this year in late the air force restructured the program in order to reduce technical and budget risks including plans to field simpler but also less capable satellites at the start as rival teams led by lockheed martin corp and boeing co compete for the long term prize various contractors and their supporters continue lobbying the pentagon and congress to funnel extra money into stopgap satellite programs to help bridge the gap between current systems and the arrival of tsat lockheed martin for example is pushing additional models of high frequency satellites designed to send encrypted messages boeing is pushing an alternative interim design lacking laser enhancements at the same time the pentagon office responsible for securing commercial satellite capacity is mulling ways to aggressively obtain more bandwidth at lower prices both companies declined to comment until the release of budget documents other contractors involved in the development of tsat include northrup grumman corp raytheon co ball corp s aerospace and technology unit and general dynamics corp
