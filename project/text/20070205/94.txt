toyota plays coy with tundra push new line priced less than big threes comparably equipped trucks toyota motor corp is about to launch its most aggressive assault yet on detroits profitable large pickup franchise but the japanese auto giant is trying not to be too obvious about it the bigger more powerful tundra is due to begin arriving in showrooms this month and toyota is counting on selling by year end and eventually more than annually triple last years volume with such ambitious sales goals some dealers had hoped toyota would roll out the new tundra with an eye catching base price well below competitors but toyota is eschewing the lower end of the market and instead taking aim at the most profitable feature loaded trucks toyota is putting features such as side curtain air bags and traction control into the tundra options that ford motor co and general motors corp charge customers extra for that options loaded model is roughly close to the base price of competing models at the heart of the truck market like the ford f and chevrolet silverado but is a couple thousand dollars less than the other trucks when loaded with similar options the strategy allows toyota to appear not to be massively undercutting big three model prices although when it comes down to the most profitable loaded trucks the tundra is priced to sell though the current tundra is considered too small to be a true american full size truck the model has helped the company capture of the big truck market according to autodata corp a niche that carries fat profit margins for auto makers jim farley a senior executive at toyotas u s sales unit in torrance calif says he is ready to allow customers who want a bare bones truck to go elsewhere to buy their trucks but when it comes to the high priced vehicles that drive the most profit "we are going to be right there with our competition " he says the pricing strategy stems from concerns among toyota executives in japan about a possible backlash as toyota continues to gain market share in the u s while detroits big three shut factories and ax jobs according to a toyota official familiar with the matter analysts expect toyota to outsell ford in the u s on an annual basis as early as this year toyota outsold ford in january to grab the no spot in the u s market the pricing strategy on the tundra helps avoid the appearance that toyota is overly eager to attack the market for beefy trucks that gm ford and daimlerchrysler ags chrysler unit have dominated for decades some toyota dealers express concern about toyotas premium strategy earl stewart who operates a toyota dealership in north palm beach fla says the lack of a bare bones work truck in the lineup could make it difficult to boost the trucks appeal to contractors plumbers and other small fleet buyers a market that would give the truck some rugged work legitimacy in a niche that values a working class image "they dont want to feel they have to move up in class to a luxury truck to buy a tundra " he says those small business fleet buyers "dont really care about expensive antirollover technology or side curtain air bags " he said mr farley acknowledges that selling new tundras this year is a lofty goal tundra sales fell in to trucks as toyota cleared out the old model and as trucks overall suffered from higher gasoline prices gms redesigned chevy silverado came out late last year ford is launching a new super duty version of its f series truck and daimlerchrysler is working on a redesign of its dodge pickup meanwhile japanese rival nissan motor co is set to unveil its restyled titan and more models this week at the chicago auto show the increased competition in the pickup truck segment could lead to an incentives war upsetting efforts by the auto makers to curb profit eroding incentives gm spokesman john mcdonald declined to discuss the silverados future pricing strategy but said the company would be very competitive on pricing and incentives and is watching the tundra launch very closely in part to fight the tundra ford is launching a new marketing campaign that emphasizes fords years of truck leadership in the u s "our goal is to maintain truck leadership " said francisco codina group vice president of fords north american marketing and sales "we believe we have the best product out there " last month toyota announced that the cheapest tundra model a two door v version would be priced at &# by contrast gms redesigned chevrolet silverado starts at &# and fords f series pickups start at &# the tundras price tag is relatively high compared with some rivals base models because it will come equipped with antilock brakes four wheel disc brakes and vehicle stability control among other features consumers buying chevy and ford pickups would have to dish out additional money for many of those features the tundra offers as "standard" equipment still in the heart of the segment where consumers buy fully loaded high capability trucks toyota believes the new tundra will be as one marketing manager put it "a tremendous value proposition " for example a four door tundra with two rows of seats standard bed and liter v engine will be sticker priced &# less than a comparably equipped chevy silverado the model also costs &# less than a comparably equipped dodge ram nissan which began chipping away at detroits dominance in big pickup trucks several years ago with its pickup model has had to resist offering big incentives on the titan even as demand for full size pickups cooled last year and ford and dodge began offering deep discounts nissan chief operating officer toshiyuki shiga said the reason why nissan hasnt offered sizable discounts on the titan was to "save room financially" to fight toyota and its new truck depending on how the pricing landscape changes after the tundras start hitting dealer showrooms this month "were holding our guns for now " mr shiga said in an interview while some american sales and marketing executives in california are disappointed with the conservative pricing strategy toyota chose to adopt they now are cranking up for the advertising campaign last month second teaser commercials for the tundra began airing on network and cable stations the full broadcast print and radio campaign kicks off this month to ensure the tundra launch goes as smoothly as possible toyota has spent more than &# million to train people from its dealer organization from sales managers to receptionists about half of toyotas u s dealers spent &# billion to build new facilities to handle the expected increase in tundra demand other dealers invested in new equipment for service bays and other areas to accommodate the larger vehicle
