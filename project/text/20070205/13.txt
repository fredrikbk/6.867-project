changing the channel after months of fruitless negotiations viacom has ordered google inc s youtube to remove all of its content from the popular video web site noting the companys content accounted for more than billion youtube video streams viacom defended its decision by saying the enormous youtube exposure didnt actually contribute anything to viacoms bottom line popular comics such as jon stewart and stephen colbert and their battalions of clever writers cost viacom a lot of money and the company wants youtube to help pick up the tab with googles market capitalization of &# billion viacom isnt happy with what it perceives as youtubes freeloading but by pulling its content viacom is infuriating the millions of fans of its various programs such as those who constitute the "colbert nation " they want their leader on youtube the internets premiere watering hole for all things video angering customers is typically not a good thing to do viacom is a traditional broadcaster that wants to be paid for its content for its part youtube says talk of profit sharing is premature "they are more focused on the money they can make in the short term " said david eun googles vice president of content partnerships "were still more focused on innovation than the short term economics " when mr eun talks about "innovation " lets be clear its really just a euphemism for enormous upheaval the television broadcasting industry is on a fast track to becoming as much a dinosaur as todays music recording industry with its swat teams of lawyers hauling children and grandmothers into court for sharing mps online blockbuster programs such as yesterdays super bowl and its estimated million viewers are increasingly rare events the television audience is splintering and the top shows in the regular week to week lineup capture a small fraction of the households that hits such as "ed sullivan" and "all in the family" reached in decades gone by the fine art of compiling a networks prime time programming schedule is fast becoming an irrelevant art with tivo and similar recording technology built in to personal computers and consumers downloading programs on to their video ipods what time a program is actually broadcast matters less and less this is particularly true for programs targeting young viewers as i and others predicted years ago prime time has become anytime youtube makes this alarming for the networks situation even worse with its millions of visitors uploading their favorite tv snippets for others to freely enjoy youtube then pours more salt into the wound by encouraging viewers to contribute so called "user generated content " armed with digital gadgets like camcorders and video capable cellular phones wannabe stephen spielbergs around the world are creating and uploading tens of thousands of videos a day to be sure much of this amateur created content is drivel with skateboarders falling on their heads and pet cats jumping through hula hoops but at this juncture thats not really the point youtube is pivotal in recasting televisions relationship with its audience and no one really knows how this universe will unfold youtube is just one part of the phenomenon now called web rather than just downloading content as passive recipients internet users are collaborating and uploading video audio photographs and text the internet is becoming a platform for global creativity viacom has the old model bring people to our site youtube on the other hand is creating a platform for everyone to participate the social community site myspace is growing at new registrants per day and will soon have a billion members over a million enthusiasts work and live in a virtual online community called second life this month the online encyclopedia wikipedia will become times larger than the encyclopaedia britannica and with about the same quality yesterday super bowl viewers watched a frito lay advertisement that was created and chosen by its customers on the internet ever second of the day a new blog is created and time magazine chose "you " the online collaborator as its person of the year but this is just the beginning throughout the economy the web is enabling new modes of innovation and production google understands this and is keen to experiment and see where it leads them by following this business model the company has already become a digital conglomerate of sorts entering not just the media industry but software retail high speed networking telephony payment systems and even hardware google is now the fourth largest maker of servers in the u s google and other smart companies know that just as people from every walk of life can self organize to upload content on the web they can also collaborate to invent new products create software or help find a cure for cancer throughout the economy astute corporations are beginning to harness this mass collaboration to conceive design develop and distribute products in new ways the notion that a corporation has to attract develop and retain the best and brightest inside its corporate boundaries is becoming inappropriate in many industries with costs of collaboration falling dramatically companies increasingly source ideas innovations and uniquely qualified minds from a vast global pool of talent as much as viacom may resent youtubes sudden towering presence in the television industry the popular web site has reinvented the television ballpark and viacom should pick up a mitt and stay in the game thats what the "colbert nation" and jon stewarts millions of fans want viacom to do rather than "i want my mtv " its "i want my youtube " mr tapscott is the author with anthony d williams of "wikinomics how mass collaboration changes everything"
