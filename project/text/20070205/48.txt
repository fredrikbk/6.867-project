tattoos and traveling for days to attend far flung bike rallies sponsored by the company the year old milwaukee companys management team however has shown less fidelity judging by its recent history of selling shares together with a slowdown in harleys u s motorcycle sales and its aging leather clad customer base the trend of insider selling may be a reason to gear down expectations for the companys high octane stock price an american icon and one of the worlds most recognizable brands harley has seen its earnings and shares climb steadily since the company went public in despite a walkout by union members at its largest manufacturing plant in p m trading friday on the new york stock exchange harley shares closed at &# up &# or while that is below its record close of &# in november the stock which trades under the symbol hog is up over the past five years leaving the s&amp p choking on its exhaust fumes harley has a market value of more than &# billion that is rich for wall street "we would become more aggressive with the stock in the mid &# s " says craig kennison a research analyst at robert w baird &amp co like of the analysts who cover harley he has a hold rating on the stock one analyst has a sell and another has a strong sell mr kennison says he doesnt own any harley shares nor does his employer apparently the share price also is rich for harleys management as the stock rocketed to dizzying levels in october and november seven executives including chairman jeffrey bleustein chief executive james ziemer the general counsel and the chief accountant sold a record number of shares which represented the highest amount of insider selling in dollar value in harleys history in several days over those two months harley insiders sold shares valued at &# million on the same day or a few days earlier those insiders exercised options to buy shares at prices that valued their purchases at &# million that means the insiders made net profit of &# million or a gain of harleys mr ziemer said that "half the sales were for a retired ceo " referring to chairman bleustein whose deadline to cash in his shares was approaching mr bleustein on two days sold shares valued at &# million as for the other sales which in total exceeded the amount of stock bought through options harley spokesman robert klein said they were prompted by "financial planning and other reasons " mr ziemer who owns three harley bikes sold &# million in shares in he continues to directly or indirectly own at least shares still the cluster of sales around the stocks record share price raises some eyebrows "when you have consensus selling its definitely more telling of how investors should play the market than when just a few insiders sell " says jaseem hasib a senior research analyst in new york at thomson financial the recent insider selloff is the latest in an interesting trend says mr hasib during three periods in and insider sales at harley occurred after run ups in share price and preceded periods of either flat performance or a fall in share price for example in april four insiders sold &# million in shares the stock had risen about from the start of the year through the end of april and was up more than over the previous months in july six insiders sold &# million in shares over the next nine months "the stock flat lined " mr hasib says "its clear management has a good sense of whats happening at the company if history has a way of repeating itself this is something investors should take note of " he adds harley has the reputation of being a well run company that makes high quality motorcycles its return on equity a measure of the companys profitability was a hefty in and some analysts are expecting it to climb past in its free cash flow the amount left over after paying all expenses was &# billion last year up from the year earlier while the company has been active in buying back stock and boosting dividends in the fourth quarter harley had a year on year increase in revenue to &# billion and a increase in profit of &# million while sales in the u s were basically flat edging up just international sales vaulted the company recently opened dealerships in china and india but currently sells mostly to japan canada and europe the slowdown in u s sales growth is a worry since they make up of the companys revenue the age of a harley buyer has been rising that customers median age is years he is a male with income of &# and at least two years of college education according to the company as those baby boomers exit the prime riding age and enter the twilight of motor home adventures growth is likely to slow further harley has been trying to capture a younger more diverse set of riders including women with the reintroduction of its classic sportster for example which has been retooled to have less vibration and a lower seat height its buell subsidiary which makes so called sport bikes the type where riders lean forward as opposed to sit back in the "cruiser" style sells about half of its units to women "i dont know that any of these is the magic bullet " says robin farley an analyst at ubs in new york who learned how to ride on a honda nighthawk "its really important to try to appeal to the less experienced and younger rider who has cheaper alternatives " she has a hold rating on the stock ubs doesnt do any banking with harley and doesnt own its shares while harley says it has about market share of the "heavyweight" category of motorcycles or bikes with engines exceeding cubic centimeters it had closer to about a quarter of total u s market share in a little behind japans honda motor co according to the motorcycle industry councils latest available data another issue is the high percentage of harley sales that it finances with loans though its harley davidson financial services division about in compared with in that isnt out of step with recent auto financing trends but the financed sales growth could be a sign the company seeking to lure younger or cash strapped buyers is "being more aggressive in extending credit " says douglas pratt a portfolio manager at mesa capital management llc a money manager in tucson ariz with slightly under &# million in assets "thats really only something the company knows " he adds it is also taking harley longer to collect on those loans in the average number of days that payments were outstanding was compared with days in meanwhile harleys losses on its loans to individuals increased in to of the total from in the company says the losses reflect lower recovery values for repossessed motorcycles mr ziemer the ceo says the growth in days to collect payments reflects the greater number of loans harley has extended in what has
