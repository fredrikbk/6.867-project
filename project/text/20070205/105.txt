why are the border guards treated like criminals i felt your jan editorial "bonkers at the border" was a bit one sided granted the border patrol agents should not have broken protocol or tried to cover up the episode and should be punished accordingly at the same time you essentially depict the men as rogue agents for shooting a man in the back how would the agents know that the man wasnt a suicide bomber with an explosive strapped to his body if he had been wouldnt shooting him in the back have been justified and while the article claims that the agents didnt know the man was trafficking pounds of marijuana when they shot him dont you think their instincts would have told them that a man who refused to stop twice and would rather get shot escaping than be apprehended was up to no good an instinct which was proven correct luther campbell alexandria va after listening to pious statements from u s attorney johnny sutton about his reverence for the law and how he had no choice but to ignore the statements of two seasoned border patrol agents as well as pounds of marijuana the drug smuggler left on our side of the border he went on with a sanctimonious demeanor to relate how he tracked down the mexican drug smuggler and gave him immunity in order to have sufficient evidence to convict agents ignacio ramos and jose alonso compean how in gods name can any rational and competent law enforcement official give more credence to a drug smuggler than to american border patrol agents i hope the congressional uproar over this travesty will eventually result in a pardon and reinstatement for the agents its probable that most americans feel more comfortable with agents like messrs ramos &amp compean guarding their border than having johnny sutton prosecuting alleged criminals michael scott glendora calif
