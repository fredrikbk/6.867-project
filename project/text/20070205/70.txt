politics &amp economics homeland security attracts more scrutiny veteran spy seeks bigger seat at table for departments intelligence operations washington in a move last summer that wasnt made public the department of homeland security was tapped to join an elite group of seven agencies that would form the heart of americas spy network it was a surprise choice by john negroponte then national intelligence director who selected dhs to join the intelligence program managers group over more established entities such as the army and state department that decision perhaps had less to do with the departments mission and capabilities than with the reputation of its chief intelligence officer charles e allen many officials say mr allen has made progress in trying to transform the squabbling agencies that comprise dhs into better data collectors but as the intelligence system comes under scrutiny with the expected appointment of a new director of national intelligence dhs and mr allens efforts there are coming in for a hard look mr allens nearly five decades at the cia earned him the nickname "the legend " but his experience has yet to turn dhs and its constituent agencies into top notch intelligence collectors or analysts say both dhss congressional overseers and officials in the department since taking over in he has faced problems such as turf battles with other agencies staffing issues and pushback from some of his agents mr allens success or failure will be pivotal in determining whether the department created after the attacks will be a counterterrorist bulwark or a bureaucratic backwater security officials who know mr allen years old said it is hard for anyone with experience in the business to dismiss him "most of the people he deals with today were trained and shaped by him " said cresencio arcos a retired u s ambassador and a former director of international affairs for dhs mr allens career spanned most of the cold war in every aspect of the central intelligence agency from case manager to agent he also worked as a senior intelligence official on iraq iran and north korea his vision is to turn the department into the prime source of border intelligence critical infrastructure information and global supply chain data and into the conduit through which the government shares information with state and local authorities one of his innovations has been sending intelligence officers to state and local "fusion centers " these centers in locations around the u s seek to blend law enforcement information and intelligence analysis collected at the local level to share with federal officials he now has officers stationed in centers and expects to have a presence in the remaining centers by the end of next year he also established an initiative on the nations southwest border sending intelligence officers to el paso texas to support border and customs agents and local law enforcement agencies last week rep bennie thompson d miss chairman of the house homeland security committee took mr allen and the department to task for allegedly trying to exclude state and local police from participating in a new federal intelligence unit called the interagency threat assessment and coordination group the group would be based outside dhs at the national counterterrorism center and would share information about possible terrorist threats to the country a job now done exclusively by dhs a number of state officials as well as police officers say that until now mr allen has been working more to control their involvement than to include it for months big city police chiefs have stressed that they are on the frontlines of counterterrorism efforts needing access to real time threat information to be able to respond to the possibility of an attack acting washington d c police chief cathy l lanier told senators two weeks ago that dhs policy of not sharing threat information unless the threat is "imminent" does not work because imminent is "too late " intelligence officials say mr allen sees dhs representing the interests of state and local officials and that including them in the unit would undermine dhs by making the departments input redundant or unnecessary mr allen says he isnt opposed to including police in the unit which is due to start work today after it becomes better established dhs has faced tension with other agencies since its creation senior counterterrorism officials from rival agencies routinely criticize dhs intelligence about terrorist threats and suspicious activities in the u s mr allen agrees that dhs intelligence reports have relied heavily on information from other agencies but that his focus recently on core areas such as border security is beginning to result in more unique dhs information making its way into the presidents daily briefings last week mr allen met with mike mcconnell the retired admiral chosen by president bush to succeed mr negroponte as the countrys spy chief to explain why the department deserved a seat in the intelligence program managers group the group meets weekly with the director of national intelligence to discuss strategy and chart the direction of foreign and domestic intelligence operations the other members are the cia the federal bureau of investigation the national security administration the defense intelligence agency the national reconnaissance office and the national geospatial intelligence agency adm mcconnell who couldnt be reached to comment was taking stock of institutions he was inheriting mr allen said he argued that the department which has fewer than intelligence officers and a budget smaller than most local police departments has a unique mission to prepare for terrorism that and the fact the some of the countrys oldest and most experienced law enforcement agencies like the secret service and customs and border protection led homeland securitys efforts were more than enough reason to keep dhs in the group he said "where i am throwing down my marker is i do not want the other members of the national community working without my knowledge with dhs components without me being briefed and knowing what they are doing " mr allen said john gannon a former cia deputy director of intelligence and former colleague of mr allens said congress and the white house havent given mr allen the resources or authority to make his department work in some cases the white house ended up creating other entities like the national counterterrorism center that undermined dhss intelligence efforts by giving it the responsibility for threat analysis that dhs was created to do but failed because it was spending its energy trying to knit agencies into a new department until recently dhs had problems attracting analysts and agents with intelligence clearances for those who joined the department sometimes didnt have desks or computers for them because of funding shortfalls its budget is secret some law enforcement agencies inside the dhs have been openly resisting efforts by mr allen to get more involved in their operations trying to direct their collection efforts and get them to report directly to him rather than to their agency heads one senior intelligence official at u s customs and border protection said the direction that mr allen is pushing the department ultimately will improve its ability to detect and thwart terrorism and turn it into a major intelligence player but that still appears to be a long way off the official said corrections &amp amplifications charles e allen chief intelligence officer for the department of homeland security is years old a politics &amp economics article yesterday incorrectly said mr allen was wsj feb
