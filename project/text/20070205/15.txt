climate of opinion last weeks headlines about the united nations latest report on global warming were typically breathless predicting doom and human damnation like the most fervent religious evangelical yet the real news in the fourth assessment from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc may be how far it is backpedaling on some key issues beware claims that the science of global warming is settled the document that caused such a stir was only a short policy report a summary of the full scientific report due in may written mainly by policymakers not scientists who have a stake in the issue the summary was long on dire predictions the press reported the bullet points noting that this latest summary pronounced with more than " confidence" that humans have been the main drivers of warming since the s and that higher temperatures and rising sea levels would result more pertinent is the underlying scientific report and according to people who have seen that draft it contains startling revisions of previous u n predictions for example the center for science and public policy has just released an illuminating analysis written by lord christopher monckton a one time adviser to margaret thatcher who has become a voice of sanity on global warming take rising sea levels in its report the u n s best high end estimate of the rise in sea levels by was three feet lord monckton notes that the upcoming reports high end best estimate is inches or half the previous prediction similarly the new report shows that the assessment had overestimated the human influence on climate change since the industrial revolution by at least one third such reversals and there are more are remarkable given that the ipccs previous reports in and have been steadily more urgent in their scientific claims and political tone its worth noting that many of the policymakers who tinker with the ipcc reports work for governments that have promoted climate fears as a way of justifying carbon restriction policies more skeptical scientists are routinely vetoed from contributing to the panels work the pasteur institutes paul reiter a malaria expert who thinks global warming would have little impact on the spread of that disease is one example u n scientists have relied heavily on computer models to predict future climate change and these crystal balls are notoriously inaccurate according to the models for instance global temperatures were supposed to have risen in recent years yet according to the u s national climate data center the world in was only degrees celsius warmer than it was in in the range of measurement error and thus not statistically significant the models also predicted that sea levels would rise much faster than they actually have the models didnt predict the significant cooling the oceans have undergone since which is the opposite of what youd expect with global warming cooler oceans have also put a damper on claims that global warming is the cause of more frequent or intense hurricanes the models also failed to predict falling concentrations of methane in the atmosphere another surprise meanwhile new scientific evidence keeps challenging previous assumptions the latest report for instance takes greater note of the role of pollutant particles which are thought to reflect sunlight back to space supplying a cooling effect more scientists are also studying the effect of solar activity on climate and some believe it alone is responsible for recent warming all this appears to be resulting in a more cautious scientific approach which is largely good news were told that the upcoming report is also missing any reference to the infamous "hockey stick " a study by michael mann that purported to show years of minor fluctuations in temperature followed by a dramatic spike over the past century the ipcc featured the graph in but it has since been widely rebutted while everyone concedes that the earth is about a degree celsius warmer than it was a century ago the debate continues over the cause and consequences we dont deny that carbon emissions may play a role but we dont believe that the case is sufficiently proven to justify a revolution in global energy use the economic dislocations of such an abrupt policy change could be far more severe than warming itself especially if it reduces the growth and innovation that would help the world cope with say rising sea levels there are also other problems aids malaria and clean drinking water for example whose claims on scarce resources are at least as urgent as climate change the ipcc report should be understood as one more contribution to the warming debate not some definitive last word that justifies radical policy change it can be hard to keep ones head when everyone else is predicting the apocalypse but thats all the more reason to keep cool and focus on the actual science see related letter "letters to the editor out in the cold" wsj february
