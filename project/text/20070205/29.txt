dow theory seems in play for some bulls transportation average joins the industrials at a high more gains as they try to predict the future some analysts are sneaking a peek at a year old investment theory based on the writings of charles dow one of the founders of the wall street journal it is called dow theory it is catching peoples attention because until recently the theory was flashing a yellow warning light about the stock markets future just lately the light has turned green or very close to it dow theorys most prominent tenet is that for a stock market rally to have legs it needs not only the dow jones industrial average to hit highs but also the dow jones transportation average last fall that looked like a problem as the dow industrials finally surpassed their january record on oct the transports were languishing far from the record they had set in may behind those numbers some investors saw trouble dow theory holds that the industrial average represents companies that produce goods while the transports are the distributors railroads airlines truckers and package delivery companies if both are strong it means a broad swath of the economy is supporting the markets gains if not it is time to check the market for lurking problems back in october the industrials were doing well because of hopes that slower economic growth might lead the federal reserve to cut interest rates thus lowering borrowing costs for businesses and consumers the transports werent keeping up because a softer economy would weaken demand for their services since they benefit less from low interest rates than from a vibrant economy the transports managed to rebound in october but flopped again in november short of a record some investors worried that even though the dow was hitting records the gains were too narrow as arrived new data suggested that consumer spending and economic growth were stronger than previously thought on that news both the industrials and the transports could rally on friday although the industrials pulled back slightly from their latest record set thursday to end at the transports hit their first record since may finishing at "it is the good economic news " says richard evans an investment adviser in flossmoor ill and a proponent of dow theory "the transports thrive more on that than they do on the price of oil " among the transports leaders at the moment are trucking and railroad companies which are seeing strong demand analysts are noticing "i am not a huge proponent of the dow theory but i do very much care about the breadth of the market rally how many different sectors are participating " says ken tower chief market strategist at cybertrader a charles schwab unit mr tower likes to use other broader means of measuring how widespread the markets gains are "and we are seeing the midcaps and the small caps and the transports join the dow industrials at record highs this is a good sign for the markets strength going forward " the russell small stock index and the s&amp ps index of midsize stocks both finished at records on friday "it is kind of hard to make a case that it isnt about as good as it gets " says john wilson chief technical strategist at memphis tenn based brokerage firm morgan keegan who sees the broad gains continuing this year some analysts point out of course that if things now are as good as they get it is hard to imagine them getting better the market has a way of topping out when things are as good as they get and some expect at least a temporary pullback now it is unusual for the market to rise for six months straight without a retreat of or says brian luedtke head of technical research at minneapolis brokerage firm piper jaffray "you could have a technical correction of to from this level at any point " he says he is warning clients that the year could see some volatility and that overall market gains could be half of last years and possibly less than that mr luedtke is concerned that the nasdaq composite index full of tech stocks has been sluggish since hitting a six year high on jan it remains far from the record high hit in march during the tech stock boom back in the s many investors felt tech stocks were more important than transports they noted services were a far bigger piece of the economy than manufacturing and services are distributed not by truck but often by technologies today however the big economic driver is consumers who use a lot of transportation for themselves and the goods they buy including tech goods whatever the case the broad number of stocks included in the markets recent gains is making even some skeptics say that they dont see the market running out of steam just yet phil roth chief technical market analyst at new york brokerage firm miller tabak has been expecting to see a market top for some time now the gains arent as broad as some people think he says in early december nearly new york stock exchange stocks were at new highs lately it has been half that number the s&amp p transportation index calculated differently than the dow jones transports hasnt rebounded as much still the markets strength has been broader than mr roth had expected leading him to conclude that even if a big decline is coming it probably isnt coming immediately
