running back with the most carries in the game brett lofton finished right behind with points he picked the colts to win by and expected the teams to combine to score points earning of available points for the first three questions joining messrs costa and lofton in the annex to the fix skybox of champions are the other three readers with more than points robert mullarkey ward cullum and william krieger here are the contests complete results  who will win the game colts bears right answer colts  by how much those who picked the colts average of points range to bears points range to right answer colts by winners ward cullum and brett lofton and also ron bibler and stephen shewmaker picked the colts by  how many points will the teams combine to score those who picked the colts average of points range to bears points range to right answer austin johnsen and sean mcnicholas were the only readers to guess an improbable combined score made possible by the colts botched extra point attempt in the first quarter nearly one in seven readers picked an impossible combination either an odd number of points in the margin coupled with an even number of total points or vice versa dont believe an odd even answer combination for nos and is impossible try one yourself  which team will go for it not kick on more fourth downs bears colts none right answer colts or bears the three readers who guessed none were in good shape until halfway through the fourth quarter from that point on both teams tried and failed once on fourth down as reader ron bibler predicted "indy will go because they want to and chicago will be doing it in the fourth quarter because theyll have to " just people thought the same team that won would go for it more on fourth down  which running back among cedric benson thomas jones dominic rhodes and joseph addai will get the most carries jones addai benson rhodes right answer rhodes addai had the most touches with but of those were on receptions so rhodes gets the nod with for yards it was more carries and more yards than hed had in a game in over five years  which quarterback peyton manning or rex grossman will be responsible for more turnovers well count interceptions and fumbles lost grossman manning none right answer grossman manning and grossman both lost fumbles but grossman won this dubious category by throwing two interceptions to mannings one for both qbs it was a reversion to regular season form manning had thrown six interceptions in the colts three prior playoff games after tossing just nine in the regular season while grossman had thrown picks in the regular season but just one in the bears two conference playoff games  which player will gain the most yards from scrimmage rushing and catching not passing or returning kicks or turnovers in the fourth quarter joseph addai thomas jones marvin harrison reggie wayne cedric benson dallas clark bernard berrian muhsin muhammad dominic rhodes desmond clark rashied davis peyton manning rex grossman mark bradley bob sanders ben utecht right answer desmond clark desmond clark had all six of his catches for yards in the fourth quarter thomas jones was next with yards on rushes and catches while dominic rhodes helped eat the clock by gaining yards david bartlett jason ruter chris taylor and bob trost picked desmond clark  which player will make more tackles brian urlacher or cato june urlacher june right answer urlacher urlacher had tackles to junes of course the bears had lots more chances to tackle as the colts ran more plays chicago outside linebacker lance briggs led all tacklers with  who will be named the games most valuable player peyton manning thomas jones brian urlacher rex grossman marvin harrison joseph addai devin hester bernard berrian reggie wayne adam vinatieri cedric benson robbie gould muhsin muhammad lance briggs ricky manning bob sanders dallas clark tank johnson nathan vasher right answer peyton manning joseph addai combined yards rushing and receiving or dominic rhodes yards combined but picked by no readers would also have been worthy winners  which team will attempt more field goals colts bears right answer colts of all readers thought the winning team would go for more field goals while thought that the team that went for more field goals would go for it less on fourth down which makes sense as field goal is usually a fourth down option vinatieri hit three of four field goals for the colts giving him points in the playoffs this year and seven career super bowl field goals write to carl
