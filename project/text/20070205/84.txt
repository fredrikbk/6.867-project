style &amp substance gq jr menswear brands launch lines for younger buyers z zegnas first ever runway show yesterday at new yorks fashion week marked a coming of age of the young mens tailored clothing market the label is the more fashion forward line of ermenegildo zegna the italian luxury mens clothier and fabric supplier the silhouette is slimmer and hipper its aimed at to year olds and since its introduction in it has been selling strongly at stores such as saks fifth avenue and bloomingdales now traditional american menswear brands are going after younger guys too taking a page from the playbook of zegna and other european labels like giorgio armani and hugo boss rather than tucking a younger looking item or two into their regular collections these companies are producing junior lines with slimmer fitting jackets and pants last fall the joseph abboud brand launched joe joseph abboud a line aimed at to year olds jos a bank clothiers inc introduced joseph hartmarx corp s hickey freeman started selling hickey hartmarxs hart schaffner marx and oxxford clothes also have lines aimed at young guys who dont want to look like their dads or grandfathers the reason sales of tailored clothing such as suits and blazers are growing fastest among to year olds according to market researcher npd group of port washington n y last year unit sales to this age group grew making it the sweet spot of the &# billion u s tailored clothing industry overall sales of mens tailored clothing fell last year in dollar terms by launching junior labels the companies also hope to build brand loyalty among men who will eventually trade up to their pricier lines where similar items can cost hundreds of dollars more the younger offshoot labels favor flat front pants instead of pleated that sit lower on the waist the suit jackets and blazers are often of a slightly shorter length and have higher armholes which helps create a narrower silhouette and while the difference between the chest of the jacket and the waist size of the pants is typically six to seven inches for the main lines it is seven to nine for the junior lines resulting in a trimmer waist and look whats not clear is whether young men are buying suits and sport coats for work or social activities in their off hours if its the latter suits could be a fashion fad that peters out "trying to expand the target audience is a great idea but thats a fickle age " says jay mcintosh director of consumer products at ernst &amp young llp menswear makers also risk diluting their image by creating new labels say fashion experts they face stiff competition from retailers from h&amp m to target and labels like banana republic j crew and theory that sell jackets and pants separately and they face a steep learning curve in figuring out younger styles according to fashion experts jos a bank for instance ran into problems with the fit of pants in its joseph line in a conference call with investors officials have said they had to rework the pants they were too tight according to brian g rafn portfolio manager at morgan dempsey capital management llc which owns jos a bank shares jos a bank did not return calls seeking comment and last year high end clothier paul stuart decided to integrate slimmer fitting styles into its traditional line rather than launch a separate brand aimed at young men "but after studying how to build the product it became clear paul stuart had too strong a franchise and it didnt make sense to create a sub brand " says sandy neiman director of merchandising getting the message out to younger guys also can be difficult since that age group is hard to target with traditional advertising rather than buying print ads ja apparel corp advertised joe joseph abboud on yahoo youtube and myspace and threw parties in bars hickey freeman which doesnt advertise its main label in gq or details magazines bought ads for its hickey label in both publications z zegnas runway show is another way to generate buzz "its a big attraction and builds excitement around z zegna at a good time for the mens market " says gildo zegna chief executive of ermenegildo zegna and grandson of the firms founder its choice of new york as the venue for its z zegna show recognizes that american men "have responded very well" to the label mr zegna says the young label generated close to of ermenegildo zegnas &# billion in revenue last year with much of that coming from north america and asia saks fifth avenue which was initially nervous about carrying the brand for fear that there wasnt a big market plans to carry z zegna in stores by fall up from seven last fall according to michael macko mens fashion director at saks z zegnas creative director alessandro sartori adds that the runway show is an important rite of passage for the label "until you get on the catwalk its really impossible with advertising to give a feel of what you think " he says he adds that he is appealing to a different customer than the traditional ermenegildo zegna customer "the gentleman who buys ermenegildo zegna is in love with the best product and the best make and then after the look and the silhouette " says mr sartori "the z zegna guy is looking at the style and the silhouette first and then afterwards the product he likes the jackets look even before touching it " george dawson a year old student at syracuse university who is interviewing for jobs and internships with accounting firms agrees "you want to get a look and image more suited to our age group " he says
