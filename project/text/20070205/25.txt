eurolinks daily view u s wars curtail space spending u s funding for various multi billion dollar space programs is being curtailed partly to help pay the bills for the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan a pentagon budget proposal on monday will generally rein in spending on space programs previously one of the fastest growing defense segments partly by slashing funding and slowing development of the militarys most advanced satellite communications system the tighter lid on space budgets is expected to affect a range of programs from space borne radar initiatives to ground based technology to track foreign satellites and orbiting debris at the same time pentagon planners face escalating pressure to find interim solutions to boost space based communications and surveillance capabilities ranging from expanded leasing of commercial capacity in orbit to stepped up procurement of existing military satellite hardware the u s air force has opted to significantly stretch out its so called transformational satellite communications or tsat program reflecting broader budget pressures and continuing skepticism of big ticket pentagon space projects on capitol hill these officials said tsat is intended to be the centerpiece of a global network using lasers and internet like links in the sky to provide ultra fast and secure data and video transmissions connecting military ships planes unmanned aircraft and troops moving on the ground pentagon officials now want to spend under &# billion for work on tsat in the fiscal year beginning oct according to these officials that amount is &# million less that the militarys last official projection and only half of what was envisioned two years ago such a cutback means at least an additional delay of a year in launch of the first satellite pushing it out until at least followed by further spending constraints and delays in building the remaining four spacecraft read the report by andy pasztor http online

railroads airlines truckers and package delivery companies if both are strong it means a broad swath of the economy is supporting the markets gains if not its time to check the market for lurking problems back in the s many investors felt tech stocks were more important than transports they noted services were a far bigger piece of the economy than manufacturing and services are distributed not by truck but often by technologies today however the big economic driver is consumers who use a lot of transportation for themselves and the goods they buy including tech goods whatever the case
