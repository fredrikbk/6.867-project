the afternoon report oil intrigue a former russian oil magnate who angered the kremlin by dabbling in politics is facing yet another slate of charges in a development that russia critics see as yet more evidence that the putin government is consolidating its power russian prosecutors indicted imprisoned yukos tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner on money laundering charges which seems all but certain to keep the energy baron frozen out of the countrys political process until after the presidential election convicted of fraud and tax evasion in mr khodorkovsky was sent to break rocks at a siberian prison camp for eight years but he was soon to be eligible for early release the new charges could change that however prosecutors allege mr khodorkovsky and his partner platon lebedev embezzled and laundered as much as &# billion in illegal oil money and if they are convicted they could receive another year sentence though prison terms are most often served concurrently in russia the fresh indictment ensures that mr khodorkovsky who before his conviction showed political ambitions will be locked away and tied down with a new legal fight as president vladimir putin prepares to step down mr khodorkovskys defenders argue that his arrest and imprisonment and the dissolution of his oil company once among the largest in russia are clearly designed to prevent him from using his vast financial resources to challenge mr putin and his efforts to strengthen the kremlins grasp of russias enormous and enormously lucrative oil and gas industry whatever threat mr khodorkovsky might pose seems rather inconsequential at present yukos is rapidly being scattered to the winds after its descent into bankruptcy and mr khodorkovsky who has little backing among russian voters would appear to have no chance of winning a national election himself but his lawyers argue that the motivations behind the new indictment are as plain as day russia has "brought these new charges now to keep our clients incarcerated at least through the next presidential election in and to stop them from effectively opposing the final destruction" of the once mighty yukos lawyer yuri schmidt sneered that the charges are "simply absurd they are insane whoever wrote them was either mad or drunk " mr khodorkovskys case is often used by kremlin critics to press the argument that as moscows wealth has expanded thanks to soaring energy prices so has a frightening authoritarian streak with dire consequences for russian democracy it has also roiled relations with neighbors some say mr putin has withheld access to oil and gas to command political concessions from countries such as ukraine and belarus state run gazprom says it was simply trying to get those countries to pay market rates for gas and that gas was only shut off after annual contracts had expired but theres no question that russias political and energy fortunes have become intertwined some commentators have even suggested that once rolls around mr putin and the ceo of gazprom may simply switch jobs stocks flatline amid deal flurry a wave of mergers and acquisitions developments didnt do
