monthly mutual funds review fund fiend investors take heed the bond market is a muddled affair the bond market looks about as orderly as a goat rodeo these days and mutual fund investors should beware it is hard for many of us to think of bonds as risky because they seem like the driest part of a portfolio after all the average bond fund gained more than during the bear market for u s stocks as the average u s diversified stock fund lost more than a quarter of its value according to morningstar inc today bonds look less than appealing the year treasury note yields less than compared with a monthly average yield since according to ryan alm inc that is up in recent weeks as economic reports have turned stronger and investors have altered their expectations that the federal reserve soon will lower its overnight interest rate still if inflation rises from its mellow levels the prices of these bonds will fall in a hurry bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction complicating the situation payouts by and year treasurys are below those of three month treasury bills this rare situation known as an inverted yield curve upends the common rule that investors demand a higher interest rate from governments and companies to tie up their money longer term an inversion often is an indication that investors expect the economy to head south in coming quarters believing the fed will have to lower its overnight rate to perk things up they accept seemingly modest long term yields today because those yields are higher than what they expect down the road at the same time the yield difference between bonds issued by lower rated companies and the u s government is thinner than usual that implies some investors expect the economy to be strong enough for these companies to keep paying their bills this flies in the face of the treasury note investors who expect an economic slowdown to some degree long term rates may be low because of strong overseas demand for plain vanilla u s bonds many market strategists say the mismatch in u s investors views is evidence of a sorting out period one that will entail losses for some and volatility for everyone concern is mounting that there is "a lot of risk in the fixed income market " said eric jacobson director of fixed income strategies for morningstar rather than bolting out of bonds risk averse small investors have a few options they can emphasize mutual funds that eschew both big bets on interest rate direction and shaky companies searching out funds with money spread across a broad range of bonds owning several types of bond funds or an income oriented fund of funds can help investors strike a similarly balanced stance that will be the equivalent of heading to the sidelines and that is where you want to be during goat rodeos please send comments to ian mcdonald wsj com
