monthly mutual funds review in the top cops office in washington the search for more fund skeletons fines have shaken industry but mr donohue stays busy when less disclosure is more washington now that regulators have pulled many skeletons out of the closets of the mutual fund world and are deep into a cleanup effort can ordinary investors relax and trust that the worst is over or already betrayed should they brace for more surprises those are among the questions we put to andrew donohue sworn in as director in may of the securities and exchange commission unit that oversees mutual funds and exchange traded funds among other investment products in the months before mr donohue arrived at the division of investment management it went through a director and two acting directors regulators have grappled with problems in the mutual fund industry special trading privileges granted to some large investors secret revenue sharing pacts in which fund companies paid securities brokers to push their sometimes inferior products and possibly improper use of mutual fund investors money to pay for research and other services disproportionately benefiting the fund adviser a former lawyer with merrill lynch investment managers and oppenheimerfunds inc mr donohue has traveled the country making speeches at financial services industry conferences about his plans some priorities include improving regulatory disclosures for investors and working on ways to speed the approval of exchange traded funds also on his plate is figuring out how to proceed with a controversial rule requiring mutual fund boards to have independent chairmen here is our conversation wsj there have been a lot of negative headlines over the past five years are all the problems solved mr donohue i dont think i would ever tell people not to worry there are over registered funds with over &# trillion in assets and the fund industry has gone from being a pretty straightforward business to being somewhat complicated with a lot of relationships among advisers and funds a lot of different intermediaries a lot of service providers when participants dont take their responsibilities seriously its devastating to the industry just in response to the mutual fund scandals weve had eight new rules that weve wound up proposing and adopting theres a heightened sensitivity inside the industry as there should be the industry has paid huge amounts of penalties and fines and restitution and billions of dollars back to investors and that will get their attention quite quickly wsj you said in a recent speech that arrangements where advisers pay brokers extra to sell their funds continue to be troublesome even though there have been fines for such "revenue sharing" practices what are you doing beyond those remedies mr donohue ive asked my staff to identify all the different areas where revenue sharing occurs and to do an analysis for me of whether or not there are any regulatory investor protection or disclosure issues that arise from this and then whether or not theres something we should do relative to those youve seen some of the revenue sharing type arrangements out there youre seeing it in the k area with allegations that clients are being overcharged for retirement savings plans you saw it in the case against bisys a firm that provides back office services to mutual fund companies which settled with the sec last year over alleged arrangement kickbacks to fund companies and youve seen it in the broker dealer context with payments to promote certain funds and there may be revenue sharing in other areas id like a more detailed view of that wsj the sec also has looked at the issue of mutual funds paying inflated trading commissions which come out of mutual fund investors pockets in return for research and other services that may benefit the fund company more than its small investors you provided guidance in the summer to help clarify whats allowed under such "soft dollar" arrangements and more guidance is in the works why is more guidance needed and what is it likely to be mr donohue the soft dollar guidance that came out for mutual fund advisers really addressed the parameters within which you can use a brokerage firm for services what was missing from that are disclosure issues for the advisers and also some guidance to fund boards to help them understand their responsibilities so those are the two follow on things we might have to do i think the commission also should work with fund directors to ensure they appreciate that their responsibilities arent just limited to equity trades but all the assets of a fund by way of example they should be asking the investment adviser to give them pretty good information about how they place trades in the fixed income area this isnt being driven by any problems or abuses its just an area that if i was a director i would be focusing a fair amount on wsj the first regulatory probes into "market timing" of mutual funds the special trading privileges granted to favored big investors surfaced several years ago but the deadline to implement the secs new rule to help curb such abuses known as rule c has yet to go into effect the rule requires things like more trade monitoring what should small investors make of the delay mr donohue rule c has provided the level of transparency that fund companies needed that they werent getting its still a work in progress while the rule and then the subsequent amendment to the rule that took place in september have clarified a number of things the fund families have until october of this year to implement the rule fully well monitor it to see whether implementation is achieving goals but i think in combination with other things that have happened it will go a long way ultimately this was intended to protect investors if it winds up costing investors more than were saving them or potentially protecting them from thats something that we should be looking at if it needs fine tuning well fine tune it this is supposed to be helpful not hurtful wsj many have protested the secs push to mandate that of a mutual funds directors including the chairman be independent two federal courts have ruled against the effort and protesters include vanguard group why so much opposition to the rule and what is its fate mr donohue on a personal level ive witnessed that people feel passionately about this at two ends of the spectrum many people have commented on the benefits that theyve seen from independent chairmen while other firms feel that their way of operating is much better with a nonindependent chairman and thus the debate should the government be mandating an independent chairman or should it leave it to the discretion of the boards to make that determination there are over areas about which we require fund directors to make determinations they have a very important role to play i dont want to be in a position or the commission to be in a position of trying to second guess determinations that boards make so that leads you then if you dont want to be second guessing to be very concerned about how the board operates its makeup and whats best for making boards effective one approach particularly after the scandals was the independence mandate thats one approach theres another area that i hope to be reaching out to fund directors more on in which is what can we do to make them more effective if we have plus things that were asking you to do are we hindering your ability to focus on those things that are really important that may result in lessening of some regulations my goal isnt to make fund boards job easier its to make their job better and let them focus on things that are far more meaningful to investors wsj so what is next for the independent chairman rule mr donohue right now there are two economic studies out evaluating the issue and are available for comment back to the sec the sec will consider the comments and decide next steps wsj what are some of the plus things you are talking about and which do you think might be unnecessary if thats what you are suggesting mr donohue this can include major activities from annually reviewing and re approving investment advisory contracts to some more administrative tasks like reviewing and approving a funds insurance were not saying these arent necessary but that we need to reassess in totality all the requirements placed on a funds board to see if their focus is in the right place wsj the commission has been putting a lot of focus on increasing fund disclosure and making investors better informed whats ahead here mr donohue within a month after my arriving at the sec there was a disclosure round table that brought together investor advocates plain english experts lawyers third party providers of fund information fund industry representatives and regulators it was unanimous that simplified disclosure for investors was something that was needed in preparing for that roundtable one of the things i did was to go to two of the large fund complexes and print out some of the documents that we would expect an investor might be interested in when making an investment decision including the prospectus statement of additional information annual report and semi annual reports for one fund it was over pages i think we have a unique opportunity here the fund industry has been very inventive in terms of coming up with sales material for potential investors usually that information is about two pages many times its on their web site were hopeful that we can come up with a two page disclosure document that will help investors the key to this is interactive data in an online project under way at the sec if you could electronically access information in the format that you would like you would have the ability then to compare several different funds quickly i think ultimately that will benefit investors in a much better way than us just adding on a couple more pages onto the prospectus or statement of additional information wsj but given people dont always read the documents mailed to their home do you think theyll go online and make this extra effort mr donohue we cant mandate that people read disclosures what we can do is to require that the disclosures are more meaningful to them were also looking at coming up with a mechanism for simplifying the annual and semi annual reports for an index mutual fund is providing every particular security thats owned in the standard &amp poors stock index a useful exercise maybe access to information in a slimmed down version will allow investors to focus on those attributes that are most important wsj youre trying to speed up the approval process for exchange traded funds but some financial advisers complain there already are too many etfs mr donohue whether or not there are too many etfs or not enough etfs out there i dont think thats our role were not here to limit market participants or to try and determine what the right number of investment vehicles are out there the market and its providers ultimately do that we are taking some steps to make future approvals for etfs easier weve also been looking at the opportunity to develop an etf rule and were hopeful well have one out for proposal in
