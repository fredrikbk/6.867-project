beijing olympics in architecture for olympics beijing believes big is best beijing china is a land littered with monuments to past grandeur the great wall the terracotta warriors and the forbidden city now chinas modern rulers are using the olympics to reshape beijing and cement their own legacy the nearly &# billion price tag for the beijing games and related infrastructure will surpass that of previous host cities and even by the estimates of some chinese economists make up as much as of total spending on all games since those held in montreal in almost everything it seems will be bigger in beijing beijings olympic green a park that is the planned site of several competitions is six times the size of athenss and three times the size of new yorks central park the national aquatic center an innovative design that resembles a cube covered in bubble wrap is twice the size of one sydney australia beijing is even enlarging its airport making it so big it can eventually handle in annual traffic million people by roughly equal to the population of france the beijing games "are probably going to be the grandest games ever " says brian newman chief executive of the sydney olympic park authority but the size and grandeur of the beijing olympics are also raising questions as to how the city will manage its sports facilities after the games a question that plagues every host city but never before on beijings scale olympic sites are designed to have huge spaces around stadiums for strong crowds to mill around says mr newman "but youll never see that number of people in the precinct after that so what to do with these huge spaces " he asks as it is sydneys olympic park which is about a quarter the size of beijings is still running at a loss after the games though it is on track to pay for itself by even so it is widely considered by many sports management professionals as an exemplary use of post games facilities because they are often in use and have hosted major sporting events such as the rugby world cup london the city hosting the games isnt waiting to plan its post games legacy the city which has already exceeded its original olympic budget several times over has designed some olympic venues so they can be easily dismantled and carted away to other parts of the country says peter mann executive chairman of pmp a sports management consultancy involved in the planning process "if there is no sustainable case for the sports venue it wont exist" after the games he says unlike sydney beijing doesnt have a single organization managing its olympic facilities after the games instead management will be carved up among state owned enterprises that bore the massive olympic buildup cost sparking fears this could lead to cutthroat competition among venues vying to host major events "theyre all going to compete against one another to hold the same fashion shows and rock concerts " laments gilbert van kerckhove a belgian national who acts as an adviser to the beijing municipal government on olympic issues kang wei chief executive of beijing state owned asset management co the group managing five of the stadiums admits the splintered management "is the biggest problem " the government is aware of the dangers of the "fierce competition" it could engender he said but "at the current stage the goal and the mission for the government is to hold a successful olympic games " for its part bsam an investment arm of the beijing municipal government has ambitious if still undefined plans to make use of its stadiums plans for the &# million national aquatic center known as the watercube include a shrinking of competitive facilities and more leisure offerings such as a spa three indoor tennis courts and tiered pricing plans to target different customer groups it is no small task beijing officials have no specific time frame for when the watercube or other stadiums under bsams management can achieve commercial viability says one official as it is commercial uses will be limited for the national stadium a graceful tangle of steel loops designed by the swiss firm herzog &amp de meuron and nicknamed birds nest to cut costs authorities decided to ax plans for a retractable roof making it difficult to rent out the stadium during beijings winter months beijing is banking on a huge and rapidly expanding population projected to grow by to million to fill its massive stadiums city planners are also adding a museum several hotels and an underground shopping mall to the olympic green to ensure the area remains vibrant after the games already the facilities built to house the olympic athletes are being quietly sold to buyers willing to pay more than &# per square meter pricey by beijing standards for the privilege of living where olympians dwelled beijings olympic planners have also placed some olympic venues within the citys network of university campuses however chinas lack of well developed professional sports leagues as well as chinese property developers history of neglecting maintenance could add to the citys post olympic hangover say people in the industry beijingers like to joke that chinese buildings age in dog years with a one year old building resembling a seven year old structure many facilities built for previous chinese sporting events are poorly kept chinas yabuli ski resort constructed for the asian winter games now looks like a ghost town with decaying empty buildings and an ice pond covering the remains of a miniature golf course yabuli attracted so few visitors even in the height of ski season this year that the staff has given up issuing ski lift tickets relying on a simple counting of heads bsams mr kang predicts it will be different with the olympic facilities authorities cant afford to ignore such a massive investment he said "i am sure the government will take all these operation matters into serious consideration later " sue feng contributed to this article
