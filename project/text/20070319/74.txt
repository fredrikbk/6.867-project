the daily fix in ncaas opening rounds underdogs dont have a day amid the hubbub over ncaa snubs last week and calls for an expanded mens basketball tournament field texas tech coach bobby knight went against the prevailing tides surprise "the best tournament that you could conceivably have" would have the best teams mr knight said this year that may have been four too many the teams still alive after the tournaments first two rounds came from the top seeds amid the first rounds carnage of the underdogs just two seeds both conference champs rather than big conference bubble teams and three seeds won no texas tech apparently didnt deserve to make their coachs proposed cut it was the least cinderella friendly opening in at least a dozen years that didnt make for scintillating viewing with the exception of eight second rounders on saturday that were all competitive but this all spells vindication for the selection committee which seemed to correctly assign the best seeds to the best teams a couple of bubble team duds aside "its a good thing athletic administrators arent allowed to participate in your office tourney pool as we learned from rick neuheisel because these guys would undoubtedly be running away with it " stewart mandel writes on si com there wont be a george mason this year no seed from a small conference will be playing in april in atlanta nor there will be a villanova no seed from a big conference or any conference is still playing nonetheless there are underdogs to be found if you look hard enough the lowest seed still playing is the midwests no the unlv runnin rebels "and now the ncaa mens basketball tournament having finished its first week of best wishes and crushed hopes heres unlv starring in its new role as cinderella " gannetts mike lopresti writes its a strange role for the program that won the national championship in by a record victory margin of points in the title game then went undefeated the next season before losing in the national semifinals but ncaa sanctions for excesses during those years of success weakened the program and removed it from the national spotlight until yesterdays upset of no wisconsin "the rebels underexposure meant much of the nation up until this week was unfamiliar with an astoundingly good basketball team " si coms luke winn writes "one that even at this late juncture is still in need of a proper introduction " mr winn starts with coach lon kruger and his son point guard kevin kruger or as philadelphia inquirer columnist phil sheridan writes "this is not your fathers unlv actually this is kevin krugers fathers unlv " unlv is one of four sweet sixteen schools outside the nexus of power that resides in the nations top six conferences the other three all have high seeds no memphis no southern illinois and no butler nonetheless they will serve as teams for neutral fans to support going forward even if southern illinois doesnt fit the mold of an undersized plucky team there may be no tougher group left than the salukis who dominated virginia tech defensively in a victory yesterday "there are rules of engagement at a salukis practice " rick morrissey writes in the chicago tribune "the first rule is that there are no rules no fouls are called no out of bounds lines exist " big runner up texas a&amp m has a no seed but the aggies are three years removed from an record in conference play which gives them a solid case for underdog status their defeat of louisville in the second round was a sweet reversal of last years loss to lsu on a last second three pointer this time their opponents last second shot "banged off the rim into the hands of marlon pompey who three years ago was on that team " john p lopez writes in the houston chronicle then theres the team that struggled in the first half of their opener and was outplayed for most of their second game but managed to survive and advance another contender for underdog the florida gators whose maddening inconsistency makes them quite vulnerable for top seeded defending champs "it suddenly seems a little too easy to see some gloom in the offing as they head to st louis next weekend " sam borden writes in the florida times union but the south florida sun sentinels dave hyde urges fans to enjoy the moment like the gators did after their defeat of purdue "there was al horford smiling " mr hyde writes in a passage that will double as an entry for the fewest words per sentence award "there was joakim noah hugging there was corey brewer throwing his arms in the air turning around taking it all in " then there are those overmatched jayhawks from kansas who bravely outscored kentucky despite being outrebounded by two "it was a miracle " jason whitlock writes in the kansas city star "had i not sat courtside and witnessed it with my own eyes im not sure i would believe the hawks could overcome such a glaring disadvantage ok hes kidding and so is the fix mr whitlock now straight faced writes "i believe were witnessing the emergence of one of college basketballs best teams potentially the best team ive seen since" the running rebels of unlv cbss coverage of the grim march of the favorites kept in tune with its focus mostly on the court "where are the tears where are the wives and girlfriends biting their nails and praying " chris zelkovich asks in the toronto star "and wheres the usual cbs march madness coverage that makes the average viewer wonder if hes watching dr phil instead of a basketball tournament no answer is required by the way because this certainly isnt a complaint wherever theyve gone good riddance " no ones bidding good riddance to texas and its star freshman kevin durant his points werent enough to fend off usc which ousted the longhorns houston chronicle columnist richard justice says texas coach rick barnes botched this one "on a day when the young longhorns finally played scared durant should have been given the vince young role of winning the game " mr justice writes "durant is the most unstoppable weapon in college basketball if texas was going down it should have been with the ball in his hands " though he may have been right about the size of the tournament mr knight was wrong to blast the nbas rule that high school players must spend a year in college before going pro at least in the case of mr durant "knight said freshmen with no intention of returning wouldnt have to attend one class in the spring semester " blair kerkhoff writes in the kansas city star "but durant is carrying a full load and dont expect him to drop out now " but will he stay past the spring mr kerkhoff puts the chance of that at the lures of being a likely top two pick in the nba draft are too strong and the risk of injury next season too great "if they did it like we do it in football theyd stop after the conference tournaments wait a month for the championship game and lose all this momentum that everyone loves being a part of " auburn football coach tommy tuberville on march madness "while tuberville is a basketball fan hes an even bigger fan of deciding championships on the field " ray melick writes in the birmingham news mr tuberville wants to see a four team football playoff thats a positive sign though he and mr melick acknowledge that more powerful people would have to sign on and thats not likely any time soon imagine if the ncaa tournament was suspended today and kansas was awarded the title on point differential edging florida something like that happened in rugbys six nations tournament won by france over ireland on a day in which neither team played each other but both won in routs capped by controversial tries scored in the final moment each reviewed and affirmed on instant replay ireland playing first allowed a seemingly meaningless try to italy while france playing later and knowing how many points it needed scored late against scotland as peter berlin points out in the international herald tribune "the format of the final saturday of the six nations is inherently unfair with the three games running not simultaneously but in sequence " nonetheless the daily telegraphs brian moore castigates ireland for allowing that final score "a team with their potential should not add their name to the ignominious but illogically cherished list of plucky losers " and the independents simon turnbull notes the "surreal" end to the day with just hundreds of onlookers on hand for frances point differential triumph found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix
