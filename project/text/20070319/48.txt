more outside directors taking lead in crises directors of new century financial corp have met nearly every day for the past two weeks typically talking by phone late into the night as they try to salvage the beleaguered mortgage lender fredric forster the former mortgage banker who became new centurys outside chairman in january has temporarily installed himself at the companys irvine calif headquarters richard zona chairman of the boards audit committee confers almost daily with new centurys outside auditors independent board members typically provide oversight and monitoring of a company while managers run operations but when a crisis erupts as at new century such directors increasingly are assuming a more hands on role stronger governance standards adopted following corporate scandals and the prospect that directors could be held personally liable reinforce the trend "your wealth is at stake and your reputation is at stake " says charles elson head of the weinberg center for corporate governance at the university of delawares business school who also serves on two public company boards as a result "the line between directors and managers is getting a little more blurry than what it has been " says david larcker a professor at stanford universitys graduate school of business when a company gets in trouble outside directors may be part of the problem and the solution whether they share the blame for poor oversight depends on the nature of the crisis according to mark nadler a partner at mercer delta consulting some crises like product tampering or natural disasters arent within a boards control whereas in a massive scandal like enron corp s he argues that the board should have been asking the kind of tough questions that would have revealed the underlying business problems every crisis is different and the degree to which directors will or should get involved will vary at the same time directors must be careful not to overstep their bounds "the board should never supplant the ceos authority unless the ceo really lies at the heart of the crisis " cautions allan j reich a corporate attorney at law firm seyfarth shaw in chicago boards "shouldnt cross the line into becoming managers or micro managers " he adds for all their involvement new century directors appear to be respecting that line directors arent running the company but "counseling management on a real time basis " says one person familiar with the situation the subprime mortgage lender is searching for a lifeline after its bank lenders cut off funding new century which offers mortgages to borrowers with weak credit has stopped making new loans it is the target of a federal criminal investigation into its accounting and securities trading in addition the

new century once one of the nations largest subprime mortgage lenders has been plagued by rising defaults on its risky loans directors decided to get more involved because management feels overwhelmed according to the informed individual brad a morrice working hour days after being promoted to chief executive last summer welcomes the directors help this person says there are other reasons for new century directors to be highly involved present or former company officials may be implicated in the investigations and the board will likely soon choose a strategic move such as selling portions or all of the business or filing for bankruptcy protection during board meetings via telephone senior executives and advisers from lazard ltd brief directors about negotiations with creditors and potential bidders in a statement a new century spokeswoman said the board "has been deeply engaged" in the crisis monitoring developments meeting frequently and talking to executives and outside advisers "given the serious challenges we have faced during this period new century is fortunate to have a board so tirelessly committed to both their fiduciary duties and the companys future " the statement said one of new centurys outside directors hedge fund manager david einhorn resigned march he had won the seat in march after tangling with company management over strategy mr einhorn isnt among those being investigated for insider trading and quit the board because he "wanted the freedom to protect his funds investment " according to the individual close to the situation mr einhorn is president of greenlight capital llc new york which holds a stake in new century a spokeswoman says the suggestion that he resigned his directorship to protect his funds investment "is incorrect" but added that "mr einhorn has not disclosed his reason for resigning " commenting on governance in general thomas j neff chairman of recruiter spencer stuarts u s operations says the demands of crisis management are a good reason to have at least one ceo or former ceo on the board that way "there will be someone who will either step up to the plate or who has the experience and the judgment to know what to do " and a smart ceo mr neff says will encourage board involvement and tap fellow directors expertise jerry w levin says he welcomed help from sunbeam corp directors when he was named ceo of the consumer products maker in after directors fired albert j dunlap amid accounting problems mr levin previously had run coleman co before sunbeam acquired it directors met almost every day by phone for months recalls mr elson the delaware governance expert who was a sunbeam director at the time the board counseled mr levin on such subjects as strategic shifts and executive recruitment "i was plenty happy to have their support " says mr levin but mr levin says he was surprised that the board knew so little about the extent of sunbeams accounting problems as his team uncovered them "they said its unimaginable that such massive fraud could have taken place under our noses " mr levin recalls mr elson replies "the board had been seriously misled by prior management " sunbeam ultimately restated months of earnings and filed for bankruptcy protection renamed american household inc it was later acquired by jarden corp gaps in a boards collective expertise can hurt its ability to manage

seeking bankruptcy protection but mr may ultimately convinced them otherwise he invited directors to help him draft a survival plan and offered weekly phone updates during his first six months "we were much better off trying to solve the problems collectively " he says mr may remained interim ceo until may was chairman of the board until october and now runs calpine corp joe costello former ceo
