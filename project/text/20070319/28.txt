euro zone jobs growth may aid global economy berlin europes economy is finally creating jobs underpinning the regions recovery and promising to help stabilize the global economy as growth in the u s slows after struggling for years with high jobless rates the nation euro zone is expected to enjoy significant employment growth this year thanks to rising business investment and consumer spending from german engineering firms to the italian auto industry companies are planning to hire again after a long period of staff reductions and cost cutting aimed at restoring their global competitiveness more jobs should mean more robust spending by europes consumers that in turn should help to keep global growth on track economists say as europeans snap up more imported goods at a time when the u s economy is expanding at a slower pace than the euro zone while countries such as spain and the u k where employment has been relatively strong in recent years are expected to continue creating jobs there are also signs of strengthening demand for labor in former laggards germany and italy france remains behind the curve mainly because it hasnt changed its labor market rules to make hiring more attractive but stronger growth in the core european economies also is spurring job creation in central european countries such as poland and hungary typical of the recovery is ksb group an engineering firm in the german rhineland after completing a three year job cutting program last year ksb plans to increase its work force of by as much as the hires mostly skilled technicians are needed for big industrial projects such as building power stations says edgar marmitt ksbs personnel director germanys jobs revival has cut unemployment to million or of the labor force from five million or a year ago the recovery is starting to reach parts of germanys former communist east where unemployment has been rampant for a decade in the eastern town of bitterfeld joblessness has fallen to from a year ago one fast growing local employer solar cell maker q cells ag added jobs last year expanding its work force to this year q cells plans to hire as many as more employees and build its fifth and largest factory in the next four years it expects to need an additional workers says chief financial officer harmut schuning some of this years hires will be physicists and chemists with ph d s but most will be production workers including many locals who have been out of work for years mr schuning says a global labor market survey published last week by employment services company manpower inc found that hiring intentions are rising faster in germany than in any other major economy although net hiring plans are still higher elsewhere such as in the u k and spain forecasters disagree on how much job growth to expect in europe this year because of worries that economic growth here could weaken under the pressure of the strong euro a possible further slowdown in the u s and the effect of recent interest rate increases by the european central bank many german companies are still shy of putting workers on their permanent staff because of the countrys strict rules on layoffs and other labor market regulations instead many firms prefer to borrow workers from temporary employment agencies which are booming as a result but the revived manufacturing strength of germany europes biggest economy prompts much optimism that the euro zone economies will build on the two million jobs created last year "my impression is that there will be some acceleration of employment growth in the euro zone coming particularly from the better german outlook " says raymond torres head of employment analysis at the organization for economic cooperation and development which represents the worlds developed countries surveys of employers by the european commission the brussels based executive arm of the european union show a strong rise in hiring intentions by german employers both in manufacturing and services germanys long depressed construction sector is also making a comeback the manpower survey also shows that more italian employers plan to hire than to fire italys job creation has been volatile and slower than germanys but prospects have brightened since the italian economy made a surprise rebound last year expanding by nearly after years of stagnation italian industry has undergone a shakeout with many small scale manufacturers losing market share to lower cost rivals from asia and eastern europe but the survivors in industries from shoes to machine tools have improved their competitiveness as shown by a recovery of export sales in the past year turin car maker fiat spa is hoping to add to its work force this year as it continues its recent turnaround ceo sergio marchionne has overseen a sales revival at the formerly unprofitable group after slashing its internal bureaucracy specialty steelmaker arvedi group based in cremona in italys north plans to add about workers to its staff by next year with the launch of a high tech process for making thin gauge steel eased labor regulation also has helped turn the tide in europe in spain slightly less costly layoff rules combined with subsidies are encouraging more spanish employers to shift their short term staff onto permanent contracts last year they hired million people on such contracts more than more than a year earlier employment in central and eastern european countries is benefiting from the improved economic growth in europes core economies continued strong investment by multinationals in the eus relatively low cost east combined with stronger exports to germany and other wealthy euro zone countries have lifted net job creation in poland slovakia and hungary from fairly flat levels a couple of years ago according to the oecds mr torres
