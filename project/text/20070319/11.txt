batteries can power us to oil independence i was a bit taken aback by holman jenkins jr s twice iterated charge in his march business world column "ethanol liberation movement" that i was teamed up with satan in backing ethanol i knew that i was guilty of at least second degree ethanol support but i was surprised about satan so i gave him a call old nick says nope he is entirely invested in geothermal as i wrote on the editorial page last dec "gentlemen start your plug ins" i believe the key enabling technology for moving away from oil dependence is the improved batteries that make possible plug in hybrid gasoline electric vehicles plug in hybrids will still need liquid fuel although only about half of what todays non plug in hybrids need because they will drive for say to miles a day on their overnight charge of inexpensive electricity before reverting to a hybrid driving mode that requires some liquid fuel as renewable liquid fuel technology matures ethanol made from corn has led the way but coming up quickly are more desirable renewable fuel competitors among them ethanol made from cellulosic biomass less carbon emitting than corn ethanol renewable diesel can be made from many types of waste and biobutanol better energy content and more pipeline friendly than ethanol mr jenkinss perfervid satan sightings seem to derive from his loathing of subsidies to american producers of alternative fuels but there are subsidies and then there are subsidies a major federal subsidy the grant of a right of way made possible the transcontinental railroad and nasa led us into space but the government doesnt today design locomotives or communications satellites once the pathbreaking was done the market took over this country has worked that way for a long time actually there is a form of subsidy that although mr jenkins doesnt mention he seems to have no problem with the one we pay to the rentier states of the oil cartel by borrowing nearly a billion dollars a day to import oil thus subsidizing both the spread of hate promoting wahhabi madrassas and the payment of well protection money to the pool of potential terrorists mr jenkinss fellow opponents of some subsidies messrs jerry taylor and peter van doren are more straightforward about this latter purpose underlying their subsidization preference they wrote recently in the milken institute review that they dont want to see alternative fuels lead to "smaller producer state subsidies" to the "young" and "underemployed" of oil exporting states since "reducing revenues flowing to islamic terrorists might perversely increase the recruitment pool for islamic terrorists " now theres a battle cry for our times billions for tribute but not one cent for oil alternatives say just asking but is beelzebub advising this gang r james woolsey washington mr woolsey is a former director of central intelligence see related letters "letters to the editor does cutting oil revenue help or hurt al qaeda " wsj march
