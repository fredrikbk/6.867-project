trash talk new haven conn its hard out there for a law student all the stuff to stumble through on the way to that j d torts property contracts evidence civil procedure autoadmit that last item is a new development a web site of postings for law schools prestigious and otherwise where students blab about whatever an awful lot of it is about other students most of it mean spirited this is all extremely weird for those of us born before the carter administration who tend to assume that scrutiny about breast implants there was a whole thread of discussion devoted to whether one ms j d to be was silicone enhanced is reserved for celebrities the flat affectless sexual bravado of the trash talk on autoadmit is also a bit of a shock coming from allegedly intelligent legal minds the autoadmitters were happily going about their gossip yakking away like yentas pinning laundry on the clothesline until sometime last week thats when the washington post ran a front page story about some young women here at yale law school whose careers if not their lives had been ruined by some salacious postings the descriptions of them sluts and whores and the suggestions about what might be done to them rape and sodomy were showing up on google searches of their names and had prevented at least one of them from securing employment since then dean elena kagan at harvard law school and dean harold koh here at yale have sent out open letters condemning the nasty communications weve had speak outs and write ins organized blue ribbon panels and worn red outfits for solidarity theres talk of legal remedies and media campaigns mostly the young women would simply like the offending postings removed from the bulletin board this is not likely to happen not because it shouldnt of course it should but because once again for about the th time in my memory and for at least the th time in the life of this country here is an issue in which the right to free speech as opposed to the need for everyone to just shut up is going to overwhelm us all cybertalk is about as governable as iraq and the first amendment allows for most other expression making the u s a very loud place for every interest group that says its being silenced for all the people who think theyre not permitted to talk back to power there are the real rest of us for whom the din is deafening the firstness of the first amendment trumps everything that competes with it this is particularly so if youre going to take your case as high as the supreme court which has struck down rape shield laws and permitted pictures that resemble kiddie porn in the name of first amendment freedom for all congresss threats to pass a bill banning the burning of the american flag even justice antonin scalia has voted for the right to set old glory ablaze because the first amendment guarantees it free expression is an issue that everyone can agree on old fashioned conservative textualists because its in the constitution and new fangled liberal interpreters because well its in the constitution the federalist society and the aclu all believe the same thing the first amendment means that anyone can say just about anything and really short of that old chestnut screaming "fire " on the main floor of bloomingdales theres not a whole lot you cant say in public including the word "faggot " as we recently found out social norms may force you to go to rehab for your stupidity but the law cant touch you at all likewise theres not much that cannot be said about you "exposure of the self to others in varying degrees is a concomitant of life in a civilized society " opined the supreme court in this was decades before "cops " in the century before youtube in such a world what to do about autoadmit to start with pray for mercy because based on the content of its postings the future of jurisprudence does not look good having done that plead for civility just because we can say anything does that mean we must say everything while i could never advocate censorship i would certainly ask for sensitivity we all have to live in this world all seven billion of us brushing closer and closer together and bristling in this claustrophobia maybe we ought to be slightly more careful before we say whatever it is we feel compelled to freely express maybe we ought to stop have a hesitation before pressing the send button because people are delicate the neighborhood rumormongers of yore could cause enough trouble in a small town but the unpoliced world wide web is really a mess its unpoliced which demands that we be better people gentler and more humane because if not we will surely all go mad as it is we are overwhelmed it never stops we dont know how to stop it we wouldnt want to anyway and then we relish complaining about it this is how we live now do we want to add random postings about ourselves our private selves that arent even true into this volatile mix autoadmit for adults in the mean time the three young women here at yale law school whove been most harmed by autoadmit beautiful and brilliant all deserve a way out of this electronic shock miss wurtzel a student at yale law school is the author of "prozac nation" houghton mifflin see related letters "letters to the editor yes vileness is legal but why indulge in it " wsj april
