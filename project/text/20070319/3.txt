alive on arrival congresss joint committee on taxation has been a thorn in the side of tax cutters for years but recently its number crunchers delivered a half trillion dollar gift to the doorstep of the white house let us explain this unlikely turn of events because it may have a big impact on the health care debate in the months and years ahead earlier this year president bush proposed to restructure the &# billion of annual federal tax subsidies for employer sponsored health insurance by treating it as taxable income and then capping the tax deduction at &# a year per family the savings would be used to provide new tax incentives for uninsured low income workers to purchase private insurance democrats declared the plan dead on arrival and have refused even to hold hearings on it but the jct which "scores" tax policy changes has breathed new life into the bush plan by estimating that it would actually save the federal government &# billion over the next years its first estimate was &# billion this means that the bush proposal would not only reduce the inequitable tax treatment of health care and the number of uninsured but it would do so while saving the government lots of money the revenue windfall the jct is predicting would be so large over time that there would be enough money left over to underwrite a &# health care insurance voucher to millions of the nations uninsured without increasing the budget deficit so congressional democrats who claim to want "universal" health insurance and to balance the budget are celebrating right not quite congressman pete stark of california exulted that mr bushs tax cutting credentials have vanished because this health proposal is "sure as heck a tax increase " north dakota senator kent conrad who fancies himself the scourge of budget deficits fired off a press release claiming that the jct analysis proves the plan would "undermine employer provided health care while doing little to expand coverage to those in need " the press has been almost as tilted the associated press report on the score carried the headline "bush health plan would cost &# billion " congressional quarterly declared "new estimates give critics of bush health plan more ammo " but hold on a minute how does a report showing that the bush plan saves money provide new "ammo" for its opponents wed bet our pensions that if joint tax had calculated that the bush health plan added &# billion or &# billion to the deficit messrs conrad and stark would have sprinted to the nearest tv cameras to denounce its fiscal recklessness when mr bush proposed tax cuts in and the media aped democrats who called it a huge "cost" to the government now when mr bush proposes a tax plan that raises revenues the plan is also attacked as a "cost to taxpayers " theres no winning with these people al hubbard the head of the presidents national economic council and an architect of the health plan says messrs conrad and stark can relax he says the health proposal is intended to be revenue neutral and that "this president is committed to not raising taxes period " mr hubbard suggests one option to move forward "we would probably use this extra money to increase the &# health care deduction to &# or more " this would certainly sweeten the deal for workers who already have very generous employer sponsored care heres why the bush health plan changes the tax treatment of health insurance by counting the value of employer provided health care as income to the worker but then provides a standard deduction of &# per family &# for an individual for health care purchases if the workers health plan costs more than &# the family pays a tax on the difference but workers with health plans that cost less than &# would get a tax cut this gives families a financial incentive to be price sensitive in choosing health insurance and to select high deductible plans that cover for major not minor medical expenses one attractive feature of the bush plan is that individuals who buy insurance on their own rather than through an employer would also get the &# deduction the average family buying insurance on their own would thus save about &# a year on their federal taxes because the deduction also applies to payroll taxes paid the plan provides a strong financial incentive for even low income households to purchase health insurance estimates are that between three and million additional families would get health insurance under the bush plan so how could joint tax and the bush treasury which had estimated that the bush plan would be revenue neutral come up with "cost" estimates a half trillion dollars apart the answer comes back to the age old complaint with joint tax its bean counters fail to assume any change in behavior from tax changes so joint tax believes that the bush plan will have zero impact on the rate of health care inflation over time the bush economists believe their plan will shave the nations total health bill by or &# billion a year and the left leaning urban institute says in a recent report that the "current tax breaks encourage us to buy excessive amounts of health insurance because the more we spend the bigger the subsidy that tends to increase health costs partly because the oversized health plans include less in the way of cost constraints and partly because we are simply less cost conscious when someone else is paying the bill " precisely yet joint tax believes that changing these perverse incentives will do nothing to curtail health costs and thus americans will eventually be forced to pay more than the &# exemption which would be adjusted for inflation each year under that scenario americans with pricey plans will have to pay more in taxes every year which is what has mr stark all worked up but its all a fiction what we have here is a case of static analysis working in mr bushs favor because joint tax says the plan would raise much more in tax revenue than it will in the real world the bush administration should now claim this revenue to expand coverage options and subsidies at the lower end of the income spectrum with so much surplus revenue the proposal could provide a &# health care voucher to millions of families and reduce the ranks of the uninsured this would be preferable to raising the &# deduction because the lower the deduction the greater incentive for judicious consumption of health dollars what all of this means is that the bush health care plan deserves to get more backing from democrats and republicans alike we suspect the main unspoken complaint about the plan is not that it raises or loses revenues but that it moves america away from a government takeover of the health insurance market mr stark and others want the private health insurance market to fail which is why they celebrate when the number of uninsured americans rises mr bush has an attractive workable and now as certified by the democratic joint tax committee affordable health care reform if democrats lack the courage to debate it then the gop presidential candidates ought to pick it up and run with it in
