the evening wrap bongs banners &amp speech online edition the first major test of the free speech rights of students in years flapped into the supreme court this morning on the back of a "bong hits jesus" banner but some say the issues at hand may be best settled using a different case joseph frederick when a high school senior in alaska set the case in motion by unfurling a huge banner that read "bong hits jesus" just in time to be captured by television cameras as the olympic torch wound its way through juneau en route to the salt lake city games in principal deborah morse saying that the school couldnt abide a pro drug message suspended the year old student for days mr frederick sued and five years down the road the case has become an important test of students speech rights the bush administration backed the actions of ms morse arguing that school administrators should be permitted to clamp down on speech that is inconsistent with the basic educational mission of the school but that argument hasnt gone down well with conservatives or with civil libertarians indeed justice samuel alito told bush administration lawyer edwin kneedler that he believed that the governments position was a "very very disturbing argument " explaining that such a standard could lead schools to define their mission so broadly as to suppress all political speech as the case has wended through the courts the two sides have displayed a vast disagreement over the facts of the matter the school says mr frederick was participating in a school sanctioned event during school hours but he says that the torch ceremony was a public event in a public place away from school and that he hadnt even gone to school on the day in question further the two sides disagree as to what was actually meant by the message on the banner the school officials argue that it was a pro marijuana message but mr frederick now years old says he wasnt advocating that anybody smoke pot that the message was intended to be nonsensical and he was trying to get a rise out of administrators with whom he had previously battled kenneth starr the former federal judge and special prosecutor who pursued president clinton over whitewater and the monica lewinsky affair and who was arguing the case on behalf of ms morse said that the message "is in fact critical " but douglas mertz representing mr frederick argued that the case was about constitutional rights not drugs and that the free speech rights of his client should be shielded justice stephen breyer told mr mertz that he was struggling over whether a ruling in mr fredericks favor would clear the runway for students to engage in all manner of absurd demonstrations in order to test the limits of the precedent but he also was worried that deciding for ms morse might curtail speech the supreme court blog of law firm akin gump pointed out that the conservative american center for law and justice filed a brief asking the justices to toss the case aside since the constitutional issues are too important to be settled by such a frivolous case they said it "would be regrettable if the court were to resolve the important questions of constitutional law at issue here in the context of a jokesters prank rather than a students bearing of a serious message " indeed as the akin gump blog also notes the students attorneys wrote in a brief that theres "ample basis" to argue that "this is not a student speech case at all " a vietnam era decision allowing students to wear arm bands in protest of that war set an expansive speech standard for schools but subsequent cases have chipped away at that precedent the court is expected to issue a decision by the end of june wave of deals supports stocks sharp gains in overseas markets along with a high tide

longer and cost more than his administration had anticipated the televised remarks made in washington were clearly targeted at a withdrawal measure now winding through the house mr bush said that while it may be "satisfying in the short run" to pull forces back "the consequences for american security would be devastating " house democrats may find the votes for their withdrawal plan but it faces uncertain prospects in the senate where another withdrawal plan went down just last week and where republicans and democrats locked themselves into a parliamentary stalemate over previous war resolutions even if democrats manages to ram the measure through mr bush has vowed a veto national security adviser stephen hadley said lawmakers are aware of the calculus and dismissed their exercise as a "charade " amid the back and forth over funding and timetables violence in iraq pounded on an explosion ripped through a shiite mosque in baghdad killing eight just a few steps away from a market where a truck bombing last month killed over a security crackdown around the city seems to have had some success in preventing the kind of execution style attacks that ended with mutilated corpses being dumped in alleys or fields but bombings like the one on the mosque have proved to be a stubborn problem and the intense drive to tighten security in the capital may have had the ancillary effect of fanning the bloodshed in other iraqi cities indeed kirkuk was the site of a series of car bombings that left a dozen people dead today separately iraqi officials asked the u s for custody of saddam
