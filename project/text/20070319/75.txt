the doctors office benjamin brewer tells all about his familys health habits some candy and soda part of his kids daily fare online edition how do doctors handle their own health like our patients we have more knowledge and health recommendations available to us than ever before but a lot of information is conflicting eat more fish but fish has mercury eat fewer carbs but eat more often eat more protein but eat less fat eat six times a day to boost your metabolism but dont over eat exercise an hour a day but get more sleep from the magazines in the grocery aisle to your mother to your family doctor everyone has advice what do we do with multiple recommendations that seem so tough to follow my family and i arent textbook examples of healthy behavior but we may be examples of reasonable behavior given the factors we all face from time pressures to tv commercials weight has long been an issue in my life not a major issue but an issue nonetheless i put weight on in medical school and ive been working on taking it off with diet and exercise ever since right now im feet tall and weigh about lbs i learned a long time ago an overweight doctor is like a skinny santa nobody really trusts either one if patients dont comment on how much thinner i look than the last time they saw me for an annual exam then i realize im gaining weight or looking older or both there was a time when i ate too many carbohydrates in an attempt to keep meals low in fat that was the medical recommendation of the day when i actively started trying to put on muscle with weight training and increasing my protein intake to one gram per pound of body weight daily i started seeing results i get the recommended minutes of exercise on four days out of seven i do weights three times a week karate three times a week and some cardio my wife hides the chocolate from me ive found that skim milk and chocolate flavored protein powder makes an acceptable and more filling substitute we do keep soda in the house and i admit to a two can a day diet coke habit im not a coffee drinker simply because i dont like it as for the kids the older children and drink regular soda on occasion not exceeding one can per day according to house rules some days they sneak more and get caught and then we cut them off for a few days portion control is key the boys get candy in their lunch at school typically a small "fun sized" bar of some sort they sneak more after school if mom doesnt catch them first when the weekly allotment is gone its gone on the plus side my kids are pretty good about vegetables i chalk that up to the fact that we had them grow their own vegetables in the garden when they were younger even today in the summers the kids will knock each other down to eat the first broccoli or tomato from the garden we do have a challenge of getting five servings of fruits and vegetables down in the winter but its an area were working on and most days we get at least three servings often theres a banana with breakfast and an apple at lunch if they take lunch from home school lunch usually has a vegetable we have a vegetable with the evening meal they finish at least half the portion most of the time we have no trouble getting our three servings of dairy products in a day i drink skim milk and the rest of the family drinks my little guy years old likes apple juice mainly from a large bottle served by mom who waters it down he drinks about eight ounces a day which is more than the four to six ounces recommended for kids his age but we keep control of it by storing it up out of reach soon hell start climbing the refrigerator shelves like his older brothers before him the older kids like oj and apple juice the calcium and vitamin c are a positive result the extra calories havent been an issue with our kids who are of normal body weight the kids occasionally eat some processed foods like eggo waffles for breakfast but mostly whole grain cereal and some fruit when i remind them for meat we buy regular not organic they dont sell the organic variety much around here we eat salmon and halibut on the grill in the summer were teaching the kids how to cook so they dont have to rely on highly processed foods or fast food when theyre older they make their own lunches now with some supervision as much as we try to keep on top of things the kids have their own methods a recent shakedown of my year olds room revealed a hidden stash of two orange sodas a snickers bar and a bag of cookies in the summer the older boys send little brother into the house on secret spy missions i find the empty soda cans stuffed in the bushes around the house an archeological expedition to my year old daughters room uncovered mountain dew and other assorted junk food beyond diet i dont take any vitamins nor do my wife or kids and i dont take an aspirin a day yet i wear sun glasses and sunscreen so i cut my risk of cataracts and hopefully skin cancer im considering starting a vitamin for my eye health when im next year i may start taking an aspirin for my heart ive had a physical in the last three years and a cholesterol measurement yearly when i hit ill be checking in with my dentist twice a year my family doctor and my eye doctor once a year the old docs around here used to say "walk two miles a day and drink more water " that works too write to dr benjamin brewer
