politics &amp economics sowing seeds of democracy in hong kong leongs losing bid to lead city stirs its political order hong kong alan leongs campaign for the leadership of hong kong has no chance of succeeding nevertheless mr leong thinks he already has won a united kingdom educated lawyer who favors conservative ties and pocket handkerchiefs mr leong is no political firebrand but he is shaking up the political order in this financial capital by contesting the process of choosing the citys top leader a decision that has historically happened behind closed doors the election to be held march will be decided by the votes of local dignitaries a majority of whom have already thrown their support to incumbent chief executive donald tsang hong kongs special status within china allows it to enjoy many trappings of western civil society and governance a raucous competitive free press a plethora of nongovernment organizations and a clean and competent civil service many human rights groups critical of the chinese government are based in hong kong which has a separate legal system that protects them from official interference hong kong doesnt have real elections to fill positions of power hong kongs colonial rulers were appointed not elected even as demands for more popular representation grew louder in the final years under british rule china promised that elections for the post of chief executive would be allowed sometime after it took over hong kong in since then advocates for a quick move to democracy though shunned by chinese officials have done well in the elections that are allowed held to fill half of the seats in the local legislature which has very limited power yet pro democracy legislators have been riven by infighting and have struggled to fashion themselves into a coherent political force mr leongs candidacy was controversial as some thought he shouldnt participate in an undemocratic process he says it will pay dividends in future political battles "we have achieved what we set out to do " mr leong says in his book lined law office in downtown hong kong his biggest accomplishment he says is reviving public interest in politics he and other democracy advocates led a few thousand protesters in a march yesterday to demand a one person one vote election in when the next chief executive is due to be chosen this years contest even with a foregone conclusion has given the local media something to cover the two candidates held two widely watched televised debates this month and have been heading into neighborhoods to canvass for support even though the people they meet cant vote for them mr tsang has covered hong kong with billboards bearing a campaign slogan in his own handwriting "ill get the job done " in both chinese and english what mr leong hasnt been able to do is persuade most people that he deserves to be chief executive all indications are that mr leong whose campaign is centered around a demand for democratic elections would lose if a popular vote were held an early march poll by the university of hong kong found that of respondents supported mr tsang while backed mr leong "the various events in this election show that hong kong people prefer more political competition " says ma ngok a professor of politics at the chinese university of hong kong however he says support for that principle hasnt translated into concrete backing in the contest for mr leong and his allies "the average hong kong person didnt think they were a credible alternative " mr ma says there is little incentive for hong kong people to agitate for change these days mr tsangs administration is basking in the glow of a years long economic expansion that has made hong kong people feel wealthier he also benefits from comparison with hong kongs first chief executive the shanghai born shipping magnate tung chee hwa mr tung had little aptitude for retail politics and a series of missteps eventually inspired a protest march by about people in july mr tung stepped down in before his term was over and mr tsang a career civil servant who had been his chief deputy took over and promised a more open government in recent months mr tsang has increasingly talked about protecting the environment and improving education dropped a proposal for a new sales tax that had been in the works for years and promised to lower other tax rates mr leong says his candidacy helped push mr tsang to change course a spokesman for mr tsang said the policy changes had been researched well before the campaign began and were made in response to public opinion mr leong says he is now looking beyond the march election to figure out how to sustain some political momentum mr tsang for his part has pledged to have a program for electoral overhaul in place by the time his new term ends in though any such plan will require the approval of the central government in beijing analysts say mr leongs candidacy by demonstrating that hong kongs pro democracy politicians are willing to work inside the political restraints set by china may have sent a positive signal to beijing but it will still be difficult for them to convince the chinese leadership and the people of hong kong that they should run the city
