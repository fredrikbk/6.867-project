takeover approaches from several large european banks since coming under pressure from activist shareholders last month to consider selling off operations people close to the situation say abn has been rebuffing the queries and is working on a defense plan abn has a market capitalization of more than billion euros or &# billion with operations in countries including chicago based lasalle bank chairmen and chief executives of several large european banks have made inquiries about whether a friendly deal would solve abns pressing need to placate hedge fund shareholders who last month demanded the bank split up its operations or join with a rival people close to the matter say barclays plc of the united kingdom made a call french banks bnp paribas sa and societe generale sa also expressed interest these people said the banks either declined to comment or couldnt be reached for comment an acquisition of abn amro would be europes largest cross border banking deal abn has also talked to bank and insurance company ing groep nv about an all dutch tie up they said an ing spokesman declined to comment on whether the company has talked with abn amro about a deal the fact that abn is in play could trigger other banking deals across europe where executives have said the industry has too many players and needs to consolidate into several cross border titans companies across europe have faced similar fights in recent months hedge funds buy small stakes in companies where management has promised to improve operations but has been slow to deliver or where the stock price has been slow to reflect improvement at abn the hedge fund shareholders calling for the company to break itself up hold just a small stake in the company the childrens investment fund management llp a london hedge fund known as tci which often advocates big changes started the campaign against abn though it holds just of the companys shares abn based in amsterdam plans to defend itself by spelling out additional details of its continuing restructuring plan and adding new steps the measures include cost cutting further sales of noncore businesses and other actions aimed at increasing the efficiency of its current portfolio of major businesses in the netherlands the u s italy and latin america it has already been shedding stakes in businesses outside these markets management expects to disclose details of the plan just before abn amros april annual shareholders meeting said people close to the situation abn could be forced into agreeing to a deal if enough shareholders keep up the pressure although if it isnt any potential bidder is unlikely to make a hostile bid hostile banking deals are tough to pull off because regulatory and political approval is more difficult to obtain if management opposes the transaction abn represents a large part of the economy of the netherlands so any deal is sure to draw close scrutiny abn has struggled in recent years because it didnt focus its operations while rivals did since chief executive rijkman groenink has been trying to rectify that focusing on retail and corporate banking with some investment banking operations he has laid out plans to slash almost jobs overhauled the organizations structure and pledged to remove at least million euros from its cost base by still abns stock performance had lagged behind its peers until tci

statement within days to clarify albeit briefly its intentions and inform shareholders it is in early exploratory talks according to these people a tie up with abn would give barclays the ability to expand on a number of global fronts including in the u s asia brazil the benelux region and italy all offer barclays the chance to expand its capital markets and retail banking businesses still for barclays abn amro could drag on earnings another potential suitor would be fellow dutch bank and insurer ing which has a market capitalization of billion euros "we dont feel pressure to undertake any large acquisitions " said spokesman peter jong "if there is consolidation we would want to participate so we are following developments closely but we feel we have the engines to grow organically " because abns reach is vast the bank could also attract the likes of spains banco santander central hispano sa which could use abn to expand in brazil a santander spokesman said the bank isnt interested in buying abn and the potential for a breakup of abns operations also opens the door to a rare joint transaction where several buyers could split up abns business by geography bank of
