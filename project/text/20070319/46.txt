managing technology selling software new email marketing tools make it easier to customize sales pitches and keep track of web site responses for small companies email can be a crucial marketing tool without a big marketing budget small companies can use email to reach lots of customers quickly and cheaply and easily customize their sales pitches to fit different customers needs thats the theory anyway but in the real world email marketing has often proved to be a headache for small companies the top software for managing email campaigns has been too pricey and too complex for small firms so they were stuck with low end packages that lacked key features for instance companies often couldnt see how many people clicked on a link in the email or what they did on the companys site once that link took them there or the email software couldnt pull contact information from the companys customer database "the technology hasnt been there " says sheryl kingstone director of the enterprise research group at yankee group in toronto now thats beginning to change a host of companies are offering software packages designed to help small businesses with email marketing and web site monitoring the programs let you grab contact names from a customer database for a mailing list and then tell you which emails bounce and which lead to web site hits some packages also let you see which pages customers viewed on your site and break that information down in customizable marketing reports for instance you can ask to see how many manufacturing executives clicked on the web site link or how many customers with more than &# million in revenue forwarded the email to a colleague once a company has data on how customers did or didnt respond to an email campaign salespeople can use that data to winnow a long list of clients down to the subset of clients who should be called they can also improve their marketing tactics for the next campaign at thought lava llc a web site design and strategy firm with about a dozen employees executives turned to the new software because they realized they needed more information about the results of their email marketing so last year phoenix based thoughtlava began using a new software service from genius com inc of san mateo calif to better track its customers data and the services likely to interest them "ill send an email to a prospect and know if it bounces if its received and if the recipient follows any of the links to my site " says john scott dixon president of thoughtlava "salesgenius shows me what you looked at on the site for how long and if you go back to it " in fact through a salesgenius feature called geniustracker mr dixon can see a replay of the exact pages that a customer has visited as a result thoughtlava salesmen can customize their sales calls to pitch services that have clearly interested the customer other products that offer similar features include the marketlead bronze edition from marketlead inc of santa clara calif imarketing automation from vtrenz inc of fargo n d and icentera enterprise edition from icentera inc of burnsville minn like thoughtlava netpro computing inc a person network services firm turned to the new email software to get better information about its campaigns the phoenix based company used to run its email marketing with an in house software program but the tool didnt track if the messages arrived if they were opened or if they drove traffic to the firms web site "we didnt know what was happening with our marketing program " says christine forbes mcdermott vice president of customer experience at netpro so netpro started using software called eloqua express a service that toronto based eloqua corp targets at small businesses it was a shock to discover that "about a quarter of our emails were registering as bouncebacks " says scott salkin netpros product marketing manager "without eloqua we would not have known that " adds ms mcdermott "our customers are our lifeblood " mr salkin estimates that eloqua express helped the company shave to off its sales cycle because "theres less time spent following up on nonqualified leads " the new software offerings can even help a sales team know when to call customers "its easy to get burnt out from calling to people a day " says dean rabbani sales vice president at print runner inc an online printing service based in chatsworth calif "it was rough it was hard to catch them at their desk " now the sales staff at print runner uses salesgenius which alerts them with music that sounds like the theme from "get smart" when a marketing email has led a customer to print runners site "we dont have a bunch of people wasting time on the phone " says mr rabbani when we hear the alerts "we know customers are sitting at their desks theres no point barking at an empty tree " mr rabbani would like to approach the problem from the other end when an email link takes customers to print runners site he suggests the customers should have a button they can click to get a telephone link with a salesperson still while hes dreaming of future features hes already gotten bottom line results by using salesgenius to track email marketing messages and web site activity the person firm closed print orders in november rather than the usual meaning more than &# in new sales of course start ups must carefully weigh which package if any is the most useful laura ramos a vice president at forrester research inc in foster city calif recommends judging softwares potential by three key criteria usability the ability to link up with databases of customer information and the usefulness of the data the software collects for the first two criteria that means giving the software a hands on test to see if the staff is comfortable with it and making sure it will work with the companys database program judging the usefulness of the data the program collects can be the most complex of the three criteria ms ramos recommends choosing an application that lets companies extract the specific data when they need it rather than on say a weekly reporting schedule by choosing a program that lets a company zero in on the data it needs small firms can "focus on data that matters " rather than getting overwhelmed by data ms ramos says "too much data can drown you " meanwhile some programs collect data that may not be very useful in the end for example netpros mr salkin says that data about how many customers open an email message a standard metric in many email marketing applications may not be helpful many email packages open notes automatically in a preview pane when users scroll over them which could give the sender a misleading picture "be sure the software gives you the information you need and are going to be able to use " mr salkin recommends "the most important thing is to see how this is going to drive sales " small business executives also recommend judicious use of the software kathleen glass marketing director at drivecam inc a san diego firm that sells driver safety equipment and services uses eloqua software to keep an eye on how many customers opt out of receiving email from drivecam a spike in customers asking to opt out of an email list can be a clue that a company is sending out too much email she says she also recommends caution with phone calls to avoid giving customers the sense theyre being stalked ms glass remembers reading a marketing email from a company one day when her phone rang and a salesperson on the other side of the country said "i noticed you were reading my email " ms glass hung up on the salesperson as quickly as possible "it was spooky " she remembers how quickly a salesperson follows up with a phone call should depend on the salespersons relationship with the customer she adds "if a salesperson has been speaking with a contact regularly they can come back pretty quickly " she says but if the client doesnt have a standing relationship with a client an instantaneous call may be too abrupt ms borzo writes about business and technology from california she can be reached at reports wsj com
