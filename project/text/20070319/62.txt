romance a murder and an american in nicaraguan jail mr volz found guilty appeals year sentence exculpatory evidence san juan del sur nicaragua eric volz saw himself as a bridge between american baby boomers looking for beachside dream homes and local families of fishermen and laborers in this languid pacific village a surfer turned real estate broker mr volz years old published a bilingual magazine called el puente literally the bridge but now hes tumbled deep into nicaraguas cultural divide mr volz is a few weeks into a year sentence for allegedly killing his girlfriend a ruling he says is ludicrous and he is appealing several eyewitnesses said he was in another town at the time of the crime testimony that was dismissed by the judge many here remain convinced of his guilt partly because he acted the way a headstrong american might not a bridge builder and that appeared suspicious the victims mother became so suspicious of him that she organized angry protests outside the courthouse closing arguments were punctuated by demonstrators shouting "viva nicaragua " as police fired warning shots to hold them back in the past few years the young americans who flock to san juan to surf have been joined by an older generation looking to build retirement homes although few have been built so far real estate offices hotels and bars are sprouting up in anticipation of a boom beneath the gloss though san juan remains a small town where outsiders are never totally above suspicion doris jimenez was one of the locals excited by the changes she quit her job as a waitress to start a clothing boutique sol fashion and started dating mr volz a cocksure curly haired native of nashville tenn who speaks fluent spanish he helped her write a business plan and set up her store and encouraged her to take computer and english classes she strived for a version of american chic sometimes wearing a t shirt that said in english "hotter than your girlfriend " mr volz first encountered nicaragua as a backpacker in the late s after studying latin america at the university of california san diego he moved to san juan to surf and pursue a dream of starting a bilingual magazine to fund the venture he took a job at century s busy san juan office he says he was making &# a year in a country where most people live on a few dollars a day but the relationship between the two young people displeased some in ms jimenezs family especially when mr volz would call her after midnight and she would meet him "it was disrespectful " says ms jimenezs mother mercedes alvarado mimicking how her daughter would jump out of bed and fluff her hair before going to see mr volz when he moved two hours away to managua in the middle of last year and the romance turned into casual dating ms alvarado took it as another slap at her daughters honor "i was trying to keep it mellow " says mr volz on nov ms jimenez was found gagged and strangled in the backroom of her boutique seven eyewitnesses provided testimony that they were with mr volz all that day in his managua home office they vouched that when he received the call with the bad news he rented a car and sped to san juan along the way he picked up ms jimenezs father who is divorced from her mother phone records show calls being made from mr volzs phone through managua cell towers starting at around a m and moving through new coverage areas headed to the coast mr volz says he was appalled at what he saw in san juan police acted "dismissively" to the victims father he says and so many local officials milled about the sol fashion store he feared they could inadvertently wreck evidence although mr jimenez stood silently as is customary in latin towns where police are treated with caution mr volz says he pressed police for information later that day at the police station he became "stern" with an investigator who he felt wasnt following all leads after that rumors started to fly that mr volz had confessed to the crime which he denies even his offer to pay for an autopsy by specialists from managua raised suspicions ms alvarado says she figured that anyone willing to do that must be trying to rig the results she had the body embalmed "im not naive i knew that youre not supposed to get too involved " mr volz said "but its hard to put that kind of advice into practice when its someone you care about " on nov mr volz helped carry the coffin at ms jimenezs burial later that day he was stunned when police cuffed him and prosecutors charged him and three other men with rape and murder the rape charge further heightened local emotions even though a crime scene report and an autopsy conducted after ms jimenez was embalmed didnt conclude rape occurred worried that the local court would free an american to avoid problems with the u s ms alvarado an organizer for the ruling sandinista party arranged for truckloads of protesters to surround the tin roofed courthouse for a dec preliminary hearing "i wasnt going to let the murderers of my daughter have impunity " she says at the hearing prosecutors dropped charges against two nicaraguan defendants with crowds building outside that left mr volz in the docket along with martin chamorro a lanky san juan native according to the official court summary of the trial mr chamorro was seen with fresh wounds near the store around the time of the murder in addition a store owner testified that mr chamorro had been grumbling that ms jimenez only dated gringos after the hearing police hustled mr chamorro into a pickup and sped off leaving mr volz and a u s embassy security officer mike poehlitz to face the angry crowds with dozens of protesters at their heels they fled to a gymnasium office and barricaded the door after mr poehlitz called the local police for help the pair broke through the offices particle board back wall crept through a workout area and escaped into a waiting police pickup truck at the trial the judge threw out the eyewitness reports cell tower records and other evidence that mr volz was in another city at the time of the killing the judge ruled that the witnesses lacked credibility because they were employees or prospective business partners of mr volz she said the cell tower evidence proved nothing because anyone could have used the phone prosecutors didnt produce blood hair or other physical evidence "the police did such a bad job handling the evidence that its really unusable either for the prosecution or the defense " says one of the prosecutors isolda ibarra instead the judge relied on the testimony of one of the original defendants nelson lopez dangla who testified for the prosecution after charges against him were dropped mr lopez dangla testified that he saw mr volz coming out of the sol fashion store at the time police say the crime occurred on the stand mr lopez dangla said he was "an alcoholic" but "not a liar " according to defense attorney fabbrith gomez who was there mr lopez dangla couldnt be reached for comment investigators also testified that a scratch on mr volzs back was made by ms jimenezs fingernails though no tissue was found under her nails forensic reports show mr volz says he got the scratches carrying her coffin on his shoulders finding them guilty of rape and murder the judge gave year sentences to mr volz and mr chamorro who is also appealing now mr volz awaits his appeal in nicaraguas maximum security modelo prison guards bring a single plate of beans and rice per day and water must be retrieved in a bucket his family back in tennessee has held benefit concerts to raise money and hired someone to bring him fresh vegetables "the experience has opened my eyes to a lot of things " mr volz says
