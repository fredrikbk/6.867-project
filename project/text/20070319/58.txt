politics &amp economics palestinian deal puts u s on spot hamas fatah accord raises question will u s still lead boycott jerusalem a u s led international boycott of the hamas dominated palestinian government is coming under pressure after hamas and the u s s main palestinian allies formed a coalition government on saturday the new government formed under an agreement between the islamist group hamas and its secular rival fatah creates a quandary for washington at a crucial moment israel the u s s closest ally in the middle east has rejected the new palestinian government and is publicly pressing washington to continue leading the global boycott the u s and israel consider hamas a terrorist group as does the european union but key arab allies of the u s who are increasingly important to president bushs broader middle east strategy have embraced the new government in order to form it they say hamas made important concessions toward israel europeans so far have also expressed optimism over the agreement the new developments mean secretary of state condoleezza rice who returns to the region this weekend must navigate some difficult challenges how the bush administration proceeds could affect not only prospects for renewed peace talks between israelis and palestinians but also washingtons efforts elsewhere in the region washington has been using the promise of progress toward a permanent palestinian state to help bring the arab world together for two related efforts an attempt to stabilize iraq and to work in common cause to contain irans influence in the region on saturday hamas formed a new ruling coalition with rival palestinian faction fatah hamas has dominated the palestinian authority government for a year since elections that the bush administration had supported but hadnt expected hamas to win since taking power the hamas led government has been under a world wide diplomatic and financial boycott led by the u s the secular fatah movement dominated for decades by the late yasser arafat is led by palestinian president mahmoud abbas who came to power in a separate election the unity government followed months of tense negotiations and fighting which at times bordered on civil warfare between the two sides for palestinians the new unity government is aimed at calming strife between the factions and lifting the economic and diplomatic siege they have endured since hamas assumed power western nations had hoped the formation of a unity government would give them and hamas a sort of political cover isolation could end if the new government if not hamas itself renounced violence accepted israels existence and agreed to respect previous peace accords entered into by mr arafat but israel says the new governments platform doesnt go far enough it does recognize previous peace accords reached between israel and the previous fatah led palestinian governments perhaps implicitly recognizing israel in the process and calls for negotiating a long lasting peace that seems much further along than anything hamas whose platform calls for israels destruction had ever ceded to in the past but in israels view it is a significant step back from where things stood with the palestinian authority under fatah before hamas won elections even if the u s follows israels lead and maintains its boycott the crucial question will be how much pressure if any washington will exert on the rest of the world to do the same it is a far tougher question now than it was a year ago because the future of the new palestinian government has become closely linked with the bush administrations wider middle east agenda saudi arabia which heads the diplomatic coalition of arab states involved in washingtons efforts to contain iran and stabilize iraq also led efforts to forge the agreement that brought about the new palestinian government if ms rice slams the door too hard on the new palestinian government during her trip here she could jeopardize saudi diplomatic efforts slated for an arab summit beginning on march in the saudi capital of riyadh in the coming weeks the saudis plan to push harder for progress toward the establishment of a permanent palestinian state under an initiative they launched in and that is likely to be a key topic at the march meeting that framework would also give israel long sought recognition from the arab world only two arab countries jordan and egypt currently recognize the israeli state all of this means the u s may hesitate in openly undermining the new palestinian government to keep the saudis and other arab allies enlisted in the broader regional diplomatic efforts and the saudis seem to be raising the ante "the saudis are putting not only arab countries into the basket behind their initiatives but the entire muslim world " said mahdi abdul hadi head of the palestinian academic society for the study of international affairs mr abdul hadi said he thinks the importance to washington of these broader moves will eventually force the u s to adopt a more pragmatic attitude toward the palestinian government "they will not embrace it for sure this will never be " mr abdul hadi said of the bush administrations attitude toward a coalition involving hamas "but maybe they will be practical in it " the bush administration used to shun this sort of "grand" diplomatic strategy in the middle east but mr bush and ms rice groping for progress in iraq after antiwar sentiment contributed to the republican partys loss of control of congress in novembers elections traveled to the region together in november to launch the new drive just one sign of its importance ms rices expected trip here beginning this weekend will mark her fourth visit in less than four months she visited here only four times in each of the past two years puzzle pieces washingtons current middle east strategy links several important initiatives the kind of diplomacy president bush used to shun some key interlocking elements progress toward the creation of a palestinian state a linchpin of sorts that could help lead to talks aimed at winning recognition for israel from arab states a notion contained in a saudi initiative unveiled in an israeli peace with the palestinians and with the broader arab world are also significant carrots offered in exchange for support from arab governments needed for a coalition to contain growing iranian influence in the region this top bush administration priority is also linked to stabilizing iraq where iran has significant clout the arab states being lined up against iran also might help stabilize iraq
