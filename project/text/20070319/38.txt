fly by night behind crashes abroad ill regulated airlines some nations furnish flags of convenience without safety checks kam air flight was approaching kabul on feb when it slammed into a mountaintop the crash killed all people on board the boeing jet including american and italian aid workers the accidents cause remains a mystery kam air a small private afghan carrier had leased the plane and its crew from a company registered in kyrgyzstan phoenix aviation and neither outfit could offer clues the planes voice recorder was never found amid wreckage strewn across a snow covered minefield and a recovered data recorder was blank due to a technical failure although the investigation ended inconclusively it prompted the european union to place phoenix aviation on its blacklist of nearly foreign carriers considered too dangerous to fly within the eu this blacklist originally created to ensure the safety of eu citizens is now shedding light on an obscure but widespread threat to global aviation even as air travel grows safer in the developed world a parallel universe of hazardous aircraft exists across africa the middle east latin america and the former soviet union the root of the problem is "flags of convenience " or countries mainly in africa and the former soviet union that register carriers without properly regulating them the phenomenon is similar to a trend that has plagued maritime commerce liberia and panama for example gained notoriety in the s as flags of convenience these nations indiscriminately certified decrepit freighters and tankers some of which sank with their crews or caused devastating oil spills according to eu and united nations officials there are potentially hundreds of planes in dozens of countries that are either illicit or operate on the edge of illegality their operators put passengers lives at risk by flying with little regard for safety and they endanger many more people on the ground by funneling money and weapons that fuel wars numbers are hard to come by but crashes of suspect carriers have killed several hundred people over the past four years phoenix aviation illustrates the menace in examining the kam air crash investigators discovered that phoenix the planes lessor held an operating certificate from kyrgyzstan an impoverished former soviet republic phoenixs headquarters however were actually a continent away in the united arab emirates by registering in one country and operating from another for many years phoenix escaped oversight that might have prevented the afghan crash western aviation officials say phoenix last year ceased operation the companys former owners could not be reached for comment in kyrgyzstan or the u a e and former managers declined to comment kyrgyzstan liberia and equatorial guinea are among the countries singled out for failing to monitor air operation licenses international safety officials say regulators from these countries dont check where the planes they license actually fly or even whether they ever land on home soil unscrupulous or criminal aircraft operators in turn move among these havens to chase fast profits by flying cargo without asking questions and carrying passengers without taking basic precautions these operators "create an airline like theyd set up a fruit juice factory " says paul louis arslanian director of frances aircraft accident investigation bureau known as bea officials from equatorial guinea sierra leone and kyrgyzstan say they are trying to improve regulation regulators from liberia could not be reached for comment the problem of unregulated carriers emerged as a byproduct of the cold wars end and economic globalization the soviet unions breakup in left hundreds of antonovs ilyushins and other rugged cargo planes in the hands of almost anyone who could grab them mainstream airlines compounded the problem by modernizing their fleets thousands of outdated jets landed on world aircraft markets at garage sale prices many wound up in africa latin america and parts of asia carrying passengers on routes shunned by established carriers africa in particular became a magnet for rickety aircraft and profiteers willing to land where conventional freight carriers fear to fly a surge in demand for raw materials sparked a wild west style air cargo market that has even figured in recent movies including "blood diamond" on the illegal diamond trade africas wars also created an import market weapons dealers in the balkans and eastern europe shipped munitions to both sides in conflicts like angolas battles for oil and minerals rwandas ethnic feuds and liberias civil war "it can be arms it can be natural resources people just want to make big profits at the smallest cost possible " says abdoulaye cissoko an aviation expert from mali working on a u n panel monitoring an arms embargo on the congo in a russian antonov cargo plane overloaded with weapons for angolan rebels failed to get airborne from the airport in kinshasa zaire and plowed into a crowded market killing more than people over the following years as officials from the u n and researchers from amnesty international and other groups focused on how weapons were reaching conflicts across africa they zeroed in on a handful of middlemen one person fingered as a kingpin of weapons dealing and transportation was viktor bout a russian citizen and former kgb officer a u n team monitoring the arms embargo on sierra leone in december said mr bout controlled "a complex network of over planes tens of airline companies cargo charter companies and freight forwarding companies many of which are involved in shipping illicit cargo " the team gathered evidence at remote airfields in offices of shell companies and through interviews with air crews and managers its report and later investigations detailed an operation based on money laundering forged documents painted over aircraft tail numbers and planes licensed using flags of convenience the u s treasury in april slapped sanctions on companies linked to mr bout and four of his associates labeling him "an international arms dealer and war profiteer " mr bout who lives in moscow and could not be reached for comment has eluded authorities in a december interview on russian tv he denied charges against him alongside mr bouts network investigators found scores of other shadowy transient carriers among which planes trade repeatedly for example air cess and santa cruz imperial companies blacklisted by the u s treasury for links to mr bout several years ago operated aircraft that ended up in the fleet of phoenix aviation according to aerotransport data bank a web site based in paris that tracks planes world wide aircraft and operators that flit among nationalities to avoid oversight present "the biggest problem in african aviation " accounting for around half of all aircraft accidents says nigerian civil aviation authority director general harold demuren who is trying to fix nigerias woeful safety record with its own carriers some of these dodgy airlines carry emergency relief and workers the u n humanitarian air service or unhas part of the world food program is often first on the scene at earthquakes floods and wars operating in areas without airports to do this it uses carriers willing to fly in almost any conditions officials try to enforce strict safety standards but face harsh economic realities in sudan unhas set a ton weight limit for antonov freighters but officials have seen the same planes flying for other clients with tons of cargo said pierre carrasse head of the aviation section at unhas headquarters in rome "someone gives the pilot &# to carry extra cargo then someone else gives the first officer &# and soon youve got to tons " mr carrasse said in an interview while the powerful turboprop can usually lift off flying becomes far more dangerous with an overloaded aircraft a similar disregard for safety threatens passenger flights union des transports africains flight on dec was scheduled to fly to beirut from cotonou benin on africas atlantic coast the geriatric boeing was packed with passengers and baggage stowed in an "anarchic manner " concluded inspectors from frances bea who were called in by benin to investigate the overloaded plane unable to climb smashed into a shack at the end of the runway and plunged into the ocean killing around people although passenger figures were one of the "numerous inconsistencies" bea investigators found the bea also discovered that the had changed hands three times between its purchase out of storage in californias mojave desert in january and the crash as it jumped among companies registered in afghanistan swaziland and guinea no national authority inspected the plane and no maintenance documents were kept a gross safety lapse the bea found the planes cockpit lacked basic emergency equipment and operating documents the crew was not certified to fly a and utas ground staff had no training in loading aircraft "a flight is not a game of chance luck should not play a part in it and all of the calculations show that the takeoff should never have been attempted " wrote mr arslanian the bea chief in the final accident report the uta crash drew little attention but a series of accidents that killed hundreds of europeans on unknown carriers in locations from egypt to venezuela sparked calls within the eu for tighter supervision of foreign airlines eu officials reacted in late by announcing plans for a blacklist of unsafe carriers around the globe europes push for safety and its budding battle against flags of convenience quickly spread to other parts of the world as the eu presented its blacklist the u n s international civil aviation organization also moved to tighten safety enforcement at a meeting in montreal then in may aviation officials of the african union met in libreville gabon to improve mutual safety inspections and support by august ukrainian plane maker antonov bowed to international pressure and published a list of aging aircraft it had built that engineers deemed unsafe for continued flying icao rules oblige all countries to ground the planes safety officials said this increased vigilance in africa boosted the appeal of kyrgyzstan a central asian country of five million people snowy mountains and shepherds who drink fermented mares milk kyrgyzstan became a magnet for cowboy carriers vera m perelygina president of kyrgyzstans itek air estimates that no more than six of her countrys registered airlines actually do business there itek which was founded in is one of the few that does serve the kyrgyz market from its base in the capital bishkek ms perelygina said many newcomers appear to be "temporary airlines" with little presence but a desk and telephone established for one off operations like hajj flights to mecca "if you can fly say people there and back then you really dont have to work the rest of the year " because its so profitable ms perelygina said eu officials visited bishkek in september to meet airline officials and regulators managers from one kyrgyz registered carrier that apparently had no office in the country received the inspectors in a coffee house eu officials say another meeting occurred in a hotel eu specialists say they found kyrgyz civil aviation authority officials receptive to improving safety but still had to blacklist all of the countrys airlines including itek for safety reasons kyrgyz officials were furious "they dont understand our money problems " fumed kyrgyz caa deputy head alymbai abakirov days after the oct blacklisting caa staff are being lured away by higher salaries in the middle east he said in his office at the agencys headquarters a crumbling disused control tower accessible only by a rutted road mr abakirov admitted that his agency lacks resources to police a list of air carriers that has almost quadrupled from only seven in the past five years many inspectors supplement their &# average monthly salary by moonlighting as safety consultants for the same carriers they regulate said mr abakirov on his desk sat a clock inscribed "with compliments of phoenix " phoenix aviation illustrates how hard suspect carriers can be to pin down after the kam crash phoenix split into several new companies say kyrgyz and international aviation officials at bishkeks manas airport where phoenix kept an office the owners of a company called phoenix agency deny any relation to the lessor whose plane crashed outside kabul mr abakirov at the kyrgyz caa said contact details for phoenix aviations successors are secret although most air authorities world wide consider such information public phoenixs old phone number and post office box number in sharjah in the u a e are now used by a u a e registered carrier called ave com which in december ran a wanted ad for aircraft in speednews an industry publication describing itself as "previously phoenix " a number of aves planes formerly flew with phoenix according to aerotransport data bank and other aircraft registries ave marketing official sergei shcherba said by phone from sharjah that several former phoenix staff now work at ave but he said that "ave is a different company from phoenix" and denied a connection the real successor to phoenix he said was an airline based in kyrgyzstan max avia which has also flown boeing s previously operated by phoenix according to independent aircraft registries but max avia executive alexander puchyev also denied any link to phoenix though he said some former phoenix staff now work for his carrier max avias marketing manager in sharjah arsen babayev said by phone that phoenix had ceased operating in "it is now called ave com " mr babayev said pointing the finger back the eu blacklist meanwhile hasnt stopped kyrgyz airlines like max avia from flying mr babayev said his carrier mainly flies in the former soviet union and middle east avoiding europe "i dont think it has affected us much " mr babayev said "apart from the bad publicity "
