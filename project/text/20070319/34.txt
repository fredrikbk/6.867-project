hurray for higher prices wal mart abandoned its plans to seek a banking license last week and all of washington seemed overjoyed at the news what a weird notion of victory the regulators at the federal deposit insurance corporation are delighted because wal mart withdrew its application before the fdic had to make a decision they were afraid their regulatory clout would have been reduced if a commercial enterprise could compete with the banks the fdic supervises liberal activists are celebrating because the retail giant has been forced into a political retreat and most relieved are the community bankers who feared wal mart would bring to financial services the same kind of lower prices it has brought to every other product it sells from apparel to electronic equipment to groceries washingtons prevent defense here was all the more bizarre because wal mart said it wasnt going to engage in retail branch banking it sought a banking charter mainly to reduce the interchange fee that banks charge retailers to process credit card transactions wal mart believed it could pass the savings along in the form of lower prices at the cash register one of the more outspoken critics of wal marts banking plans was house financial services chairman barney frank who has also been moaning about the high cost that banks charge on credit card transaction fees go figure wal mart already performs many bank like functions popular in low income neighborhoods including wire transfers money orders paycheck cashing and express bill payment a wal mart bank inside its stores might have been able to provide lower cost loans to minorities and the poor the same clientele that commercial banks are often criticized for ignoring or sticking with "predatory" interest rates theres more at stake here than wal marts growth aspirations this is the first big success for this coalition of regulators the fdic liberal politicians and the banking industry that wants to bar all commercial firms from retail banking mr frank is sponsoring a bill to impose a moratorium on so called industrial loan companies ilcs which are commercial firms that are chartered by states to provide banking products target and general electric already have been designated as ilcs to provide banking services and home depot and daimlerchrysler have pending applications if mr frank succeeds the result will be higher fees reduced banking competition and less customer convenience so why is the allegedly pro consumer left celebrating this "victory "
