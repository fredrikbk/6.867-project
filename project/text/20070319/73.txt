the afternoon report four years later online edition four years after the first american ordnance rained down on baghdad the bush administration defended the war in iraq as democrats on capitol hill attempted to gather the votes to bring u s involvement to an end president bush said that americans must summon greater patience with the war even though it has gone on for longer and cost more in blood and treasure than his administration had anticipated "it can be tempting to look at the challenges in iraq and conclude that our best option is to pack up and go home " mr bush said "while that may be satisfying in the short run the consequences for american security would be devastating " the remarks made in washington were clearly targeted at the withdrawal measure now winding through the house democrats there may succeed in passing the bill but it faces more uncertain prospects in the senate where another withdrawal proposal went down in flames last week and where republicans and democrats locked themselves into a parliamentary stalemate over previous war resolutions even if the majority leadership manages to ram the measure through mr bush will certainly veto it national security adviser stephen hadley said last weekend that democratic lawmakers are aware of the calculus and dismissed their exercise as a "charade " earlier in the day other senior administration figures were also arguing that while the war in iraq hasnt unfolded as hoped to withdraw would be perilous secretary of state condoleezza rice who was the presidents national security adviser at the time of the invasion defended the decision to go to war but acknowledged that the administration may have miscalculated the size of the force that would be required to keep order following the overthrow of saddam hussein making the morning chat show rounds ms rice warned too against the measure that is being debated in the house white house spokesman tony snow also tried to shoot holes in the legislation which is attached to a bill funding the wars in iraq and afghanistan arguing that it essentially is an admission of defeat "it would provide victory for the enemy and not the much needed and deserved victory for the people of iraq furthermore it would forfeit the sacrifice that our troops have made in the field " mr snow told reporters at the white house amid the back and forth between the administration and congress over funding and timetables violence in iraq pounded on an explosion tore through a shiite mosque during services in baghdad killing at least eight worshippers just a few steps away from a market where a truck bombing last month killed over a security crackdown around the city seems to have had some success in preventing the kind of execution style attacks that ended with mutilated corpses being dumped in alleys or fields but bombing attacks like the one on the mosque have proved to be a stubborn problem and the intense drive to tighten security in the capital may have had the ancillary effect of fanning the bloodshed in other iraqi cities indeed kirkuk was the site of a series of car bombings that left a dozen people dead today though fighting there isnt a new development arabs kurds and turkmen have fought over control of the city and its oil making violence there a fact of life and settlement of its status a critical issue for the future
