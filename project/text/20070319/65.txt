small business a special report entrepreneurship colleges used to ignore their students business aspirations now they are trying to nurture them two years ago arizona state university graduate student greg peterson and a friend hatched plans for a tv show that would instruct homeowners how to renovate in environmentally and socially responsible ways but the two didnt have enough money to cover the production costs or the expertise to market the show they submitted their idea to a new campus program helping students bring business concepts to life called the edson student entrepreneur initiative the program gave them &# in seed money and access to on campus office space along with training seminars devoted to student start ups on topics like product development intellectual property and finance it also hooked them up with the chief executive of a local e commerce business whom they met with every other week to discuss online marketing tactics "that in itself was worth the price of my tuition " says mr peterson who in december earned his masters degree in urban and environmental planning he and his partner recently finished the pilot show and are trying to sell it to various cable networks small business is becoming a big deal on college campuses these days the arizona state program hands out &# to student ventures annually accepting about to of the roughly submissions that are made each year and hundreds of other u s colleges and universities also have awakened to the fact that many of their graduates are likely to work for themselves someday many are bolstering their courses and extracurricular activities for aspiring entrepreneurs and helping students create businesses before graduation its a far cry from just a decade ago when most colleges ignored students entrepreneurial ambitions or just offered basic business planning courses in the business school now many schools are adding entrepreneurship majors and minors holding business plan competitions for cash prizes and teaming students up with local entrepreneurs and many campuses are teaching entrepreneurship beyond the business school to get students in other disciplines interested in business development this fall the university of north carolina at chapel hill will begin offering a three course certificate in entrepreneurship for graduate students in all academic fields those looking to eventually start businesses can pursue an "enterprise" track while those just seeking basic business skills and an understanding of the entrepreneurial mind set can choose the "literacy" track says ted zoller executive director of the universitys center for entrepreneurial studies the school also is creating a venture capital fund to be run by professional venture capitalists who will consider investment recommendations from students among other things the exercise is designed to help students learn what it takes to attract private equity investors mr zoller says the university of wisconsin at madison which launched an undergraduate entrepreneurship major last fall wants to encourage its students to learn from one another it plans to designate dorm rooms by the academic year so that students who have an interest in entrepreneurship can live together and network the school also is opening an entrepreneurial law clinic by this fall where law students will give free advice to student and faculty entrepreneurs on legal matters such as intellectual property law and business structure washington university in st louis is trying to help student entrepreneurs move past the idea stage with a program it started in called ideabounce several times each year students and locals usually about to give two minute "elevator pitches" of their business ideas before a live audience and judging panel five winners get &# each and dinner with the judges who are often faculty members venture capitalists and local entrepreneurs "we saw lots of situations where people had good ideas but of the time they wouldnt act" on them says ken harrington managing director of washington universitys skandalaris center for entrepreneurial studies the school hopes that giving students a little boost will compel them to think more seriously about starting ventures for profit schools also are jumping on board grand canyon university a phoenix for profit school with about students opened a new entrepreneurship college in january with students starting this fall a new &# million venture capital fund created by a local entrepreneur will dole out &# in seed money to each of about of the business concepts submitted by students those students will then be eligible for &# each in second round funding if their businesses achieve certain benchmarks overall about two year and four year colleges now offer entrepreneurship courses up from about in and fewer than in according to research from the kauffman foundation a kansas city mo resource center for entrepreneurs kauffman has doled out about &# million in matching grants to universities in the past four years to expand entrepreneurship education beyond the business school advocates of entrepreneurship education say the new momentum stems partly from a growing understanding of entrepreneurships key role in economic and job growth and a realization that more college graduates will start ventures or work at small firms after graduation instead of flocking to corporate america also more young adults are arriving at college having already started businesses or ready to do so a shift from the past when most people didnt launch ventures until middle age "weve got a generation coming up that has a very different outlook on life than the one before it " says jeffrey cornwall an entrepreneurship professor at belmont university in nashville tenn "theyre more interested in balancing their work with their family life and that makes entrepreneurship attractive to them " three years ago belmont introduced "hatcheries " where student businesses get shared office space and mentoring from faculty local entrepreneurs and attorneys about student businesses now participate schools also are starting to realize that traditional business school curricula do a poor job of teaching the basics of business formation focusing instead on management and prepping students to work for large corporations says judith cone the kauffman foundations vice president of entrepreneurship "what weve learned is really that the m b a s role has not been to train the entrepreneurial mind people who know how to run businesses " she says of course there are also some financial incentives for schools to push entrepreneurship campuses that spur innovation often earn prestige and perhaps even more direct financial rewards successful entrepreneurs in many cases have given generous bequests to their alma maters or local universities orin edson the founder of a luxury boat company gave arizona state &# million in to start the student entrepreneur program now named for him some skeptics might question the value of teaching entrepreneurship in the classroom after all some of todays most successful entrepreneurs including legends like steve jobs and bill gates dropped out of college or never attended at all and learned their business through trial and error but supporters and academics counter that while the drive and high risk tolerance natural to most successful entrepreneurs indeed cant be learned there are helpful skills that can be taught entrepreneurial curricula include courses on identifying good opportunities cash flow management handling growth intellectual property law venture capital and marketing and many courses are now geared toward entrepreneurship in particular fields such as engineering science and technology "i cant teach somebody to have passion but i can teach them things to improve their chances of success " says mr cornwall of belmont he cites studies that have found above average survival rates for businesses founded by college educated entrepreneurs universities also offer a less hostile environment for starting a business so students can get hands on experience without many of the real world financial risks of business failure many schools are offering students seed money or helping them launch businesses with little or no capital contributed by the students themselves so theres little to lose if the business goes bust and campus programs that foster entrepreneurship give students the advantage of an extensive network of people to work with both on campus and potentially after graduation adam bates the year old head of the student entrepreneurship club at the university of rochester in rochester n y is launching a social networking web site this summer where users can build online family newsletters he met his business partners at a "preseed" workshop on campus that pairs undergrads with m b a candidates his team also was assigned a coach a local entrepreneur who helped them get a patent "at the academic institutions theres a broad community of people" to consult with says mr bates who returned to school after being involved with a few other start ups "its very hard to go at most start up projects solo " ms spors is a staff reporter for the wall street journal in south brunswick n j she can be reached at kelly spors wsj com
