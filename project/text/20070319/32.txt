how busted is your bracket dan shanoff identifies his hits and misses and offers his second chance bracket online edition special to the wall street journal "so how many sweet teams do you have left " thats the ncaa tournament question of the week if you stuck with the favorites you should be in great shape of the remaining teams are from the top four seeds in each region if you took a flier on a few longshots in any "normal" tournament year not just a common bet but a safe one you could be out of luck the tournaments first round came and went as one of the most uneventful least interesting in recent memory all but a smidgen of favorites advanced fortunately for those of you us who picked underdog vcu duke wasnt one of them the second round whittling teams down to the current "sweet" was packed with sensational games and enough wild finishes to make up for the first rounds dearth of drama but still favorites mostly continued to advance if you pinned your bracket picking hopes on the annual appearance of a cinderella or several you realized that she wasnt particularly welcome at the ball this year its almost like the tournament gods decided that last years run by george mason was so epic that fans needed a year off from fantastic underdog stories with all that in mind i return to that question of the week last weeks lamentable misses are already forgotten well almost forgotten and we look forward to the games ahead let me answer my own question "how many sweet teams did you have right " for the record i missed six out of sweet teams you can see my original list of picks and reasoning here predictably most of my "hits" were the ultra conventional picks within the top four seeds in each region seeds like florida ohio state unc and kansas or popular choices like georgetown ucla and texas a&amp m my biggest miss probably sounds familiar to many of you picking texas to the sweet when in fact the longhorns were bounced by usc on sunday in the second round given the level of hype for the horns mainly driven by their sensational freshman superstar kevin durant the question was supposed to be whether ut could beat unc in the sweet not whether texas would even get to the sweet unfortunately for my bracket i had texas beating unc in the sweet and advancing to the elite eight yikes you might be able to empathize with my other key mistakes they resulted directly from making bold first round upset picks that this year in particular missed the mark georgia tech and creighton were the most notable that had me going "what was i thinking " i find some solace but not much that i correctly predicted that south seed wisconsin would lose in the second round i only wish i had picked unlv to be the team to beat them not georgia tech this simply wasnt the year to pick upsets if you used something like espn coms national bracket a "wisdom of crowds" style consensus of every fans picks you would have had of the sweet picks and currently be beating percent of the other people in your pool in my greatest glory i picked vcu to beat duke in the first round yes but i also had the rams beating pitt to make the sweet no like many others i didnt see vanderbilt beating washington state but the commodores proved that the sec with three teams in the sweet is stronger than many thought as a florida fan i should have seen vandy coming factoring in the way the commodores whupped the defending champion gators late in the regular season the follow up question you should be ready for is "how many of your elite eight and final four teams are still alive " ive got and sweet storylines  top heavy of the top seeded teams in the field advanced to the sweet but beware three of the four seeds had to survive very tough games in order to advance interestingly "power" conferences acc big east and big ten who together accounted for ncaa bids combined for as many sweet teams four as four so called mid major conferences that combined to account for seven total bids whos the real power  wheres cinderella forget george mason the highest remaining seed is midwest seed unlv which delivered the ko of the tournament so far on seed wisconsin other contenders east seed vanderbilt brings the cinderella story of the academic powerhouse turned basketball success and even though their lofty seedings projected their place in the sweet west seed southern illinois and midwest seed butler still project the aura of the scrappy overachiever  player to watch with national player of the year kevin durant of texas out of the tournament look to another player from texas texas a&amp ms acie law as the fields top go to guy mr law racked up points in a&amp ms second round win over louisville  sweet matchup to watch ucla vs pitt two seasons ago ucla coach ben howland left pitt to take the bruins job he was replaced by his protege jamie dixon many of the pitt players were recruited by mr howland and the teams styles are similar enough to make this the most intriguing game of the round  home court advantages each region brings together all of its teams from the various "sub regional" sites to one common "regional" location which might create an advantage for particular teams that have made it this far midwest consider that st louis the regional site was the city where florida swept through the final four to a title last year west do you know the way to san jose ucla is the only team actually from the "west" to be in the regional and staying in state no less south seed ohio state will find the confines of regional site san antonio far less friendly than seed texas a&amp m will find them east seed unc relocates from its first weekend site in nearby winston salem to east rutherford n j much closer to seed georgetowns home base i appreciate having to stick with your original bracket riding it out through what has by now been foreshadowed as yet another bitter end but i wish the concept of the "second chance bracket" had more traction why cant the same pool manager in your office or group of friends offer up a new pool bracket this week starting fresh covering the final four rounds of the tournament charge double i dont care after being immersed in the tournaments first two rounds doesnt everyone feel like they absolutely know what will happen next no just me anyway following up last weeks overall bracket projections let me reevaluate the rest of the tournament based on what we now know about what will happen next thanks to the last four days games but im also not afraid of a little accountability for my original
