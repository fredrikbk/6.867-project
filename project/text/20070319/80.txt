theory &amp practice how understanding the why of decisions matters employees more likely to embrace changes when fully informed in a group of workers at foremost farms usa got a new directive make each block of american style cheese weigh as close as possible to pounds avoiding the usual to pound variation in size at first the initiative went well recalls doug wilke vice president of manufactured products for the baraboo wis dairy cooperative once managers stopped checking though workers resumed making cheese the old way as fast as possible "weights started fluctuating " mr wilke says foremost farms cheese problem illustrates a common managerial problem how to communicate directives so that workers follow them management gurus agree that employees are most likely to get on board when they are involved in the decision making process in the many cases when thats not possible the next best thing is to make employees feel as if they were involved consultants say that means telling workers not only what was decided but why and how says phillip g clampitt a consultant and communications professor at the university of wisconsin green bay in a study last year mr clampitt found that employees are more likely to support decisions when they are told about the rationale the study surveyed roughly managers and employees at more than u s employers asking what they knew of decisions and how supportive they were of them mr clampitt says employees of companies that explained decisions more fully were more than twice as likely to support those decisions as workers who got less information the more information is better rule sounds like common sense but it is easy to neglect in practice mr clampitt says executives may feel too busy to explain their thinking they may be so wrapped up in the decision making that they think their conclusions are obvious they also might not want to disclose sensitive information or arguments that could undermine their decisions divulging details about rejected alternatives may "raise the ire of people who now know what you didnt accept " warns paul argenti a professor of corporate communication at the tuck school of business at dartmouth college still managers can breed skepticism by pushing their conclusions too hard on workers "youre trying to sell " explains robert dekoch president of construction company boldt co who has collaborated with mr clampitt on research "but if you sell too hard youre going to be uncredible " sharing information helps employees see how executives made their decisions he says for instance appleton papers inc historically did not explain personnel moves to employees leading workers to think the shuffling was random says plant manager paul mccann now mr mccann says the paper maker tells workers why each supervisors expertise is needed in a new post if management doesnt offer explanations "people will work together to develop their own reason " he says at foremost farms the rise of bigger producers made the co ops mass produced milk and cheese less competitive mr wilke says in response foremost farms management chose to tailor products to specific clients and five years ago it started changing its production processes to match one plant started cutting pound cheese blocks in half to accommodate a customers delicatessen needs at another plant workers were told to stop using automated equipment to package cheddar cheese rather they should box it manually in the case of the pound cheese blocks the customer wanted precise weights so it could cut the blocks into smaller chunks for sale in their hurry to reposition the company foremost farms executives had not told workers why they had shifted strategy leaving people confused and resistant to change mr wilke says last year the co op hired mr clampitt to help with internal communication messrs clampitt and wilke developed a presentation explaining the competitive threat and the changes in simple terms "were target " mr wilke told workers referring to the retailer "were too big to be neiman marcus were too small to be wal mart " mr wilke took the presentation to each of foremost farmss cheese plants telling workers why the plants had changed processes and the alternatives executives had considered workers asked for more such meetings and they said they better understood the changes mr wilke says mr wilke says he was encouraged recently by an unusually smooth switch to making long cylinders of provolone at a plant that had previously produced pound loaves of mozzarella the provolone which fetches a higher price had fewer quality problems than normal for a new product even though it is more complicated and time consuming to make than the mozzarella mr wilke says as for the pound blocks their weight now deviates much less he says online today theory &amp practice is a weekly look at people and ideas influencing managers send comments to theorypractice wsj com for past columns visit
