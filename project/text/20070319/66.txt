small business a special report learning from others mistakes you know that incredible franchise deal youve heard about maybe it isnt so incredible after all buyer beware if it sounds too good to be true it probably is these familiar warnings arent enough to keep many people from stumbling into scams involving franchises so to remind people to watch their step the federal trade commission periodically publicizes a collection of cases involving allegedly illegal pitches to potential franchisees and other aspiring entrepreneurs the ftcs latest effort is called project fal&# e hope&# a compilation of more than cases pursued last year by state and federal authorities the fal&# e hope&# cases range from fly by night fleeces operated by ex felons and professional con men to paperwork stumbles by established franchisers or so called administrative violations but in all cases laws were broken or regulations ignored each case is unique and instructive in its own way but there are also some broad lessons to be learned in general authorities warn that the more promising the pitch the more cautious would be entrepreneurs should be in considering it "all too often theyre talking to salespeople and theyre excited and want to believe that this opportunity will lead them to a good investment " says dale cantone chief of the franchise and business opportunities unit in marylands office of the attorney general his admonition "take your time when the sellers try to get the buyers to invest as quickly as possible its an absolute recipe for disaster " regulators also emphasize that before potential investors write any checks they need to read and be sure they understand the disclosure documents called uniform franchise offering circulars that franchisers are required to file in certain states in places where these documents arent required which includes most states people should insist that the company supply them anyway in studying the disclosure documents regulators say its particularly important to look at the pages showing franchisee turnover typically names and phone numbers of former as well as current franchisees are listed contacting some former franchisees and asking why theyre no longer in business often can save the inquirer from a similar outcome mr cantone says many fraud victims also "regret not having consulted a professional an accountant or lawyer with some experience in franchising " this is important right from the beginning as offering circulars may be hard to understand or worse misleading mr cantone also warns against being thrown off guard by the ease of investing over the internet he says he is amazed at the number of victims who bought a franchise or other business opportunity online without having spoken to anyone in person a closer look at some of the cases the ftc is publicizing as part of project fal&# e hope&# offers further lessons shame on me both maryland and wisconsin have obtained temporary court orders to stop an operation called united business solutions inc from selling consulting businesses in those states that werent registered as franchises and both are seeking permanent bans the company sold people the right in the form of a license to act as a consultant in a given territory the consulting business consisted of calling on local businesses and encouraging them to contact "experts" lined up by united business solutions to help the businesses recover overpaid taxes and unspecified "operating expenses " the licensee would get a commission based on the fees the clients paid to the "experts " one united business solutions promotion cited by wisconsins securities division held out the possibility of making "an incredible income potential of &# to &# a year " in fact there is no evidence of such successes but among those drawn in was retired philadelphia lawyer robert hochberg who says he mistakenly assumed that the company which also operated as ubs group inc was affiliated with the swiss banking giant ubs ag after purchasing what he thought was an exclusive territory mr hochberg says he discovered that it had already been sold to someone else he also learned that in the state of iowa had revoked the insurance agent license of the companys principal officer johnathan c ahlf after he had been terminated by an employer for alleged forgery fraud and misconduct mr hochberg also came across mr ahlfs personal bankruptcy "shame on me for not checking ahlf out" beforehand mr hochberg says luckily he says he had put his payment on a credit card and was able to recoup the money curbing such operators can be difficult asked for comment mr ahlf said that united business solutions is no longer in business but that he is now operating other tax and
