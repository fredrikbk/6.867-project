running the show the perils of being first with a brazilian berry called acai the black brothers were ahead of the pack that often isnt the safest place for entrepreneurs to be in july two young entrepreneurs clad in surfer attire strode into the offices of juice it up s california headquarters to present top executives with a rather audacious request prominent display of their new brand on the chains menus the brand was sambazon and its product was the frozen pulp of a brazilian berry called acai pronounced ah sigh ee which was chock full of antioxidants and healthy omega fats the fruit was virtually unknown in the u s and these two brothers who ran sambazon inc ryan and jeremy black by most accounts were the first u s supplier but to larry sidoti juice it up franchise corp s vice president of development acai was just another smoothie ingredient like a banana or blueberry "we arent in the business to promote brands " mr sidoti says he told the blacks "were in the business to promote juice it up " to mr sidotis surprise ryan looked at his brother and shot back "i guess we dont have anything else to talk about then " explains ryan now "they must have thought we were crazy but if they were going to say well just sell acai but not sambazon i didnt see that as even an option " fortunately mr sidoti kept listening and an hour later the brothers left with an agreement to supply juice it up with acai and have it billed under the sambazon brand one cornerstone of entrepreneurship is to be at the forefront of trends pushing the envelope to find and deliver the next big thing but being ahead of the pack can also be a tough place to be and as the story of sambazon shows being first can be even tougher from educating consumers to outmaneuvering new rivals and perfecting packaging trailblazers like the blacks face a raft of challenges "the first guy on the beach usually gets shot " warns jeremy black "thats the danger when you are a small guy a pioneer " today some half dozen serious players with names like zola and bossa nova compete in the acai space billion dollar beverage giants including coca cola co pepsico inc anheuser busch cos as well as bolthouse farms inc are adding the fruit to their beverage lineups proctor &amp gamble co recently infused acai into its herbal essence shampoos and conditioners as a result sales of acai products catapulted to &# million in the weeks ended last october from &# in the same period two years earlier according to natural food tracker spins inc amid it all sambazon which now has employees has more than survived the san clemente calif companys sales totaled about &# million last year and the blacks this year expect sales to increase by and to turn a profit their products are distributed at such stores as whole foods wild oats and jamba juice as well as many conventional grocery chains while sambazon acai is found in hundreds of other companies products including those of stonyfield farm and haagen dazs is the companys future guaranteed not yet but how the black brothers made it this far offers a road map for others forging new ground what exactly is acai thats what ryan black wondered on a turn of the century surfing trip to brazil where he marveled at the crowds downing bowls of the frozen purple mush acai grew atop palms dubbed the "trees of life " and locals waxed about its mystical powers of vitality workers would shimmy up trees pluck the berries into baskets and send them by boat to processing plants where the skin was scraped off the seed blended with water into a pulp and then pasteurized and frozen to preserve its nutrients and flavor a curious earthy blend of chocolate and red wine a health conscious former college and briefly pro football player ryan black sensed acai would appeal to mainstream u s consumers craving healthier fare after raising &# from friends and family he and his brother began setting up an infrastructure in brazil to harvest acai organically and do it in a way that protected the rain forest and promoted fair trade the trouble was almost no one stateside knew what acai was or even how to pronounce it for that matter so how could they get their story out with no real marketing budget the answer was essentially to be traveling professors on their own they would personally teach the nation what acai was all about by visiting stores and giving the stuff away from the beginning the black brothers hit music and environmental festivals and marathons setting up booths and building a grass roots following they canvassed smoothie vendors their first customer base blending acai into drinks leaving literature behind and hawking their broader mission "theyd put on quite a show going from store to store and putting on this barnum and bailey act " recalls mr sidoti of juice it up which now has stores in california and other states "it helped get people behind them " such education is crucial if youre introducing consumers to a strange new product steve demos now a member of sambazons board spent years struggling to educate consumers about soy before his company white wave hit the jackpot with its silk soy milk mr demos believes its imperative for sambazon to "feed people everywhere you can " even as sambazon segued into mainstream retail outlets even as it received some &# million in outside financing it pressed on with its educate the customer by giving it away approach sambazon spent &# last year on store demos doing a week top retail executives took note "typically smaller companies dont have payroll to compete with bigger players who can kick in money for advertising " says chris jacoby a category manager for albertsons grocery stores "but sambazon has been first class in terms of setting up demos i run into their reps in our stores more than any other company " adds whole foods market inc president walter robb "guys like this you keep an eye on " in the meantime acai buzz spread best selling author and dermatologist nicholas perricone extolled the fruit on oprah early last year a study touting the robust antioxidant properties of acai was published in the journal of agricultural and food chemistry this year foods from the amazon "such as acai" are among top supermarket trends according to mintel international a trend spotting firm based in chicago and london the key for sambazon is to now take advantage of the rising tide and not fall behind its competitors which can take advantage of the trail that sambazon has already forged concedes ryan black "acai is moving a lot faster than sambazon " deciphering the best way to sell acai wasnt as easy as with say a new bottled water frozen berry pulp in small blocks sambazons original item was fine for smoothie bars but not for mainstream retail in other words how did consumers want to consume this new product mr demos of silk soy milk recalls his own battle on this front "we went through hundreds of iterations of soy foods we made hot dogs hamburgers dressings dips and entrees before we found milk " putting silk in clean familiar refrigerated milk cartons took away the "weirdness" of the soy category he says mr demos sold his company to conglomerate dean foods co in the sambazon brothers threw a lot of spaghetti at the wall perhaps too much trying to find what would stick with consumers and simultaneously protect the taste and superfood qualities of acai they tried boxed juice packs that would be shelf stable without refrigeration but they thought it distorted the flavor "we had test runs that cost us over &# and we were doing less than that in monthly revenue " jeremy black says going into refrigerated coolers made more sense they started with a smoothie product in that had a day shelf life but realized that wasnt a long enough window to get bottles shipped stocked and sold so they went looking for a packer that could bottle and flash pasteurize the acai so it would be stable for days finding that partner delayed their entry into bigger stores and required a &# million investment in the meantime the company launched a line of acai pill and powder supplements and a juice line its still selling its frozen smoothie packs and recently introduced a sorbet in total sambazon now has flavors and makes of products which has spread it thin on a manufacturing level "the business guys say which ones are you going to go big with " jeremy black says "the fear is that as we take it to the next level well have too many moving parts " he plans to cut out nine products this year one of the hardest tasks with both being first and then competing against new rivals has been honing the brand message when consumers dont even know what the product is how much can they really think about the rain forest consumers says mr demos of silk "think its great warm and fuzzy that you are saving everything but the whales but all i care about is saving my sorry ass and if you can do that with your food great if not i gotta keep looking " to that end sambazon has boiled its message down to simple slogans such as "superhealthy supertasty superfood " and "get with the purple berry " it now relies on its web site to explain its social work in the amazon and it has scaled back the size of the word "acai" on its bottle focusing more on promoting the sambazon brand to stand out given all its competitors "the calculated gamble is people might be looking for acai and miss our product " jeremy black says the surge of acai players has tested sambazon in several ways in the blacks sued a rival claiming his acai company used similar marketing verbiage "it was really rough " says jeremy black "they sent out all their marketing material to our customers we were very fragile and barely making any revenue " the lawsuit cost sambazon &# and the imbroglio underscores the fragile nature of nascent competitors the suit was settled with the defendant amazon preservation partners inc agreeing not to use certain phrases such as "amazon acai" or "power fruit of the amazon" in its marketing but today the companys zola juice products are in some accounts nationwide competing directly with sambazons new juices and the rivalry is intense chris cuvelier zolas founder says it was never his intention to create confusion among consumers still he adds "some people out there are more litigious and some people just want to be entrepreneurs " larger rivals brought other obstacles "the big companies want to wait and then jump in and blow it up bigger " jeremy black says "the danger is then that someone can take it from you " for instance sambazons acai products sometimes get stocked inside the coolers of odwalla acai juices odwalla is owned by coca cola because coke distributors are in stores several times a week the blacks say sambazon product often gets pushed to the back of coolers the only way to fight this is to get more sambazon sales staffers into stores a costly order meantime growth has brought trade offs once sambazon began signing deals with other big juice chains juice it up stopped promoting the sambazon brand on its menus "i dont blame them " mr sidoti of juice it up says "but loyalty like that is a two way street " the crowded field and sambazons success has raised another predicament whether to sell out if an offer is made its a choice not totally up to the blacks their angel investors now own one quarter of the company "i was in one board meeting and i said i started this to do positive things with the world and to do good in the amazon not necessarily to get a big payout " ryan black says "and one of these guys looked me in the eye and said well the problem is then you went out and took &# million of other peoples money " signs suggest they can stand alone for now sambazon acai products accounted for of total frozen fruit sales in natural foods channels in the year ended january according to spins and by one account their early juice it up gamble has paid off as planned says mr jacoby of albertsons "when i think of acai i think of sambazon " ms bounds the wall street journals small business news editor in new york served as
