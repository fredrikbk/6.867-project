franchising closing time if youre ready to sell your franchise heres a look at what you need to know maybe running that franchise business has been great but now its time to retire or perhaps its too much work or hasnt lived up to expectations whatever the reason what happens when a franchisee wants out selling a franchise is not like selling just another store the parent company for starters usually has rights of first refusal and must approve the new owner as well but while franchisers can have a major say over the outcome they arent always eager to help with preparing the sale what follows is a primer for franchisees who are thinking of selling out tell your parents when a franchisee decides to sell experts recommend telling the parent company immediately franchisees are sometimes "terrified" to do so says rick shampaine vice president of the franchise consultant network frannet llc based in louisville ky "one of the biggest mistakes people make is thinking their franchise company will abandon them " he says "in fact the franchiser would probably be willing to help " if for no other reason than to "get rid of a lame duck and get someone who is going to maximize the territory " when a franchisee of ben &amp jerrys says he or she wants to sell the company opens up its database of potential buyers to the owner sends an email to people who have asked about locations in the past and screens the responses "we want to make sure we have strong operators " says chuck jones senior global manager of franchise development at the unilever plc unit franchisers also may assist with other aspects of the sale process such as assembling a presentation of the business for potential buyers "one of the reasons you become part of the franchise system is so you have the experience and support from the franchiser " says lawrence cohen chairman of the washington d c based international franchise association and a franchisee of great american cookies a unit of mrs fields famous brands salt lake city at ben &amp jerrys "franchisees dont need a broker" when they move to sell their businesses says the ice cream chains mr jones but will they help a lot of franchisers though arent so helpful some industry sources say so it may be a good idea to check out the franchisers policies on such matters at the time you join the system "most franchise systems today do not have an exit strategy built in for their franchisees " says dennis fuller executive vice president of franchiseresales llc a sarasota fla firm specializing in helping franchisees sell their businesses he says many franchise organizations say they have programs to help but in essence only refer the franchisees to outside brokers or pass along leads on interested buyers and other franchisees in their proximity most franchisers he says prefer to focus on new sales instead of transfers of current operations mr cohen says most franchisers "would be cooperative in an exit plan " but adds that "they really do not want to be deeply involved in finding a buyer for a franchisee who wants to exit " he says the amount of help from a franchiser often depends on whether the brand is saturated in the area in question if the franchiser is not looking to add stores there the only way for a prospective buyer to get into the system is to buy an existing store in which case the franchiser may be more willing to pass along inquiries and may even approach the franchisee itself if an area isnt saturated mr cohen says the franchiser is likely to be more interested in selling new units than in transferring existing ones dennis wieczorek a chicago based partner at the international law firm dla piper u s llp says some of the biggest chains including mcdonalds corp and subway owned by doctors associates inc of milford conn tend to be more heavily involved in resales because they are often responsible for the lease "its important in those situations that the franchisers make sure they have someone to come in " says mr wieczorek dla piper is general counsel to the ifa subway confirms that nearly all of its locations are leased and that its real estate arm is extensively involved in resales as a result a mcdonalds spokeswoman similarly confirms mr wieczoreks description of its practices hire a professional if a franchise is not getting much assistance from the parent company it will probably want a professional sellers themselves often put too high a price on their store because of their emotional attachment once a decision to sell has been made some owner operators also stop working so hard bringing in a professional with an objective eye can help make the business look as good as possible and keep the books strong in the final weeks and months franchiseresales says it helps owners sell in three ways it uses an outside valuation firm to help owners estimate the worth of their franchise it helps broker the deal in the negotiations between buyer and seller it also coordinates with the franchiser to make sure potential buyers meet with the parent companys approval but the price can be hefty franchiseresales charges of the sale price with a &# minimum in addition to franchise brokers there are many real estate companies that help sell businesses an attorney who specializes in franchise matters carl zwisler of counsel at dallas based haynes &amp boone llp notes that franchisees who retain a broker should make it clear in their agreement with the broker that no commission will be paid if the franchise parent ends up buying the business finding buyers fellow franchisees can be some of the best potential buyers for an existing store they can be easily located and they already know the business having that network of potential buyers out there is "one of the big advantages of being in a franchise system " says the ifas mr cohen joe chandler chief business development officer of proforma a cleveland based print and promotional products franchiser says of his companys franchise sales are made to other proforma franchisees to cast a wider net franchise sellers can try newspaper ads and web sites that offer franchise for sale posting services these include franchiseresales com businessesforsale com a unit of u k based dynamis plc businessbroker net atlanta and franchiseadvantage com atlanta franchisees that dont want employees or customers to know about a pending sale should use details sparingly closing deals when it comes to closing deals the franchiser usually has the right to match the terms offered to a potential buyer mr cohen recommends trying to sound out whether the franchiser is interested before getting too far in sale negotiations with another buyer even if the franchiser declines the purchase it still has to approve the ultimate purchaser many franchise agreements dictate that the buyer must sign the current franchise agreement which could be far different from the one the seller signed "its very important for the franchisee to understand what the current terms are and what the buyer would be buying " mr zwisler says in most cases the franchiser likely will stay out of the details of the sale but it could intervene if it feels the sale price is skewed in one direction if too high for example the deal might not be approved because the buyer might not be able to earn back the investment in a reasonable time "i think franchisers have a duty to protect the system and to make sure a prospective franchisee is fully informed " says mr cohen ms ossinger is a staff
