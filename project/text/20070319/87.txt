whats wrong with billionaires the worlds super rich are getting increased attention of late courtesy of a new report in forbes magazine listing the worlds billionaires the list starts with bill gates worth &# billion and reaches down to those with "just" one billion such as arkansas chicken magnate donald tyson the wealth of these people is so vast that it is difficult to comprehend the new york times helps out by noting that larry ellison founder of oracle and the eleventh richest man on the list would need to spend &# million per week or &# per hour just to avoid increasing his wealth what could explain these billionaires will to accumulate such unspendable fortunes and to keep on earning more year after year and most of the americans on the list did earn their money as opposed to inheriting it it might appear that the rich are deluded because virtually every study of the subject has shown that money by itself does not bring happiness worse yet many charge that the wealthy accumulate money simply so they have more than others some economists believe that wealth acquisition in the developed world is nothing more than a social arms race these explanations for the acquisitive tendencies of the worlds billionaires and all the rest of us for that matter are convenient for social critics and tax collectors but they ignore an explanation that doesnt reflect quite so poorly on the rich what people hunger for is not money per se but success at creating value money just tends to come along for the ride consider a few brief facts according to the general social survey about of american adults say they are "very happy" in their lives at the same time about half the population say they feel "very successful" or "completely successful" in their work lives happiness and perceived success are intimately linked if you feel very successful you are twice as likely to be very happy than if you dont feel very successful even after accounting for differences in income as well as education age race sex religiosity and other characteristics in fact while people who feel successful earn about a third more than others on average income by itself creates no happiness at all above the level needed to get by money is just an expedient measure of the value we feel we create do the worlds billionaires need a spiritual awakening of some sort so they gauge their value and success more transcendentally than with cold hard cash perhaps but there are good reasons to hope they dont wake up anytime soon to the reality that earning another billion is less satisfying than enjoying the morning sun first the super rich have the ability and increasingly the willingness to be super givers as well bill gates is an obvious example through philanthropy he has turned his attention to giving away the vast wealth he has accumulated proving that giving money can signify as much success to a person as accumulating it can second as long as a fortune is earned as opposed to stolen squeezed from governments or otherwise extorted from citizens pecuniary acquisitiveness is directly related to the comfort of others larry ellisons company has created tens of thousands of jobs introduced technology that has benefited all parts of the economy and paid billions in taxes when mr ellison measures his success with money he spills opportunity and economic abundance onto all of us directly or indirectly better than convincing todays billionaires and the rest of us to stop chasing filthy lucre or looking for creative ways to confiscate it we should understand this wealth as an enabler of everyones success and through increasing philanthropy as the fuel for social good mr brooks a professor of public administration at syracuse universitys maxwell school of public affairs is the author of "who really cares the surprising truth about compassionate conservatism" basic books see related letter "letters to the editor success itself not money is a begetter of happiness" wsj april
