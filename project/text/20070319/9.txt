an economists courtroom bonanza whether its motley crue or antitrust law berkeleys david teece is ready to testify berkeley calif he has testified in court about baby formula and cigarettes software and cement on the witness stand he is a sage about semiconductors a maven of music a pundit on patents meet david teece renowned expert on lots of things and pioneer of a lucrative consulting niche that has transformed business litigation the university of california berkeley business school professor is one of americas busiest expert witnesses billing corporate clients as much as &# an hour for his insights he has built a publicly traded person research shop lecg inc that does much of the legwork for him and other economists so they can zoom through more assignments for high profile economists like the year old prof teece expert testimony has become a way to earn &# million or more a year their rise has its roots in the reagan era of the s when a free market view of the law inspired by university of chicago scholars gained ground courts now rely far more on economic analysis with its apparent precision to reach decisions as a result big companies in legal disputes race to enlist top economists on their side paying top dollar in an arms race for talent cases that might have been expert free years ago now involve as many as eight experts four on each side says russell frackman an intellectual property lawyer at mitchell silberberg &amp knupp in los angeles economists are part of each sides roster so are specialists in a myriad of other fields "even if you dont think the other sides expert will have much influence " says mr frackman "you dont want the jury to wonder why you couldnt find another expert to offset him or her " prof teece and a few other stars deliver the rare combination of knowledge and showmanship marshaling the analysis of dozens of aides while knowing how to tell a persuasive story in the courtroom born in new zealand prof teece came to the u s in the early s hoping to join the world bank then while working toward a ph d in economics from the university of pennsylvania he learned that exxon corp needed help fighting price fixing charges that became his summer project for a fee of &# he moved west and won tenure at berkeley at in a widely cited paper "profiting from technological innovation " he argued that the big winners from breakthrough ideas can be companies that control distribution and customer service not the inventors he published prolifically his output today includes papers and more than a dozen books corporate lawyers took note prof teeces economic work was so panoramic that he could be plugged into almost any industry dispute and presented as knowledgeable he didnt fluster under cross examination and his new zealand accent worked nicely on the witness stand it made him sound erudite without being pompous "david had this aura of credibility " recalls john keker a san francisco lawyer who was one of the first to hire him as an expert witness "he could explain complicated ideas to people who werent used to thinking about economics people believed him " by prof teece was being offered more expert consulting work than he could handle even though he works until a m most nights so was berkeley law professor tom jorde they decided to set up law &amp economics consulting group an off campus research shop in nearby emeryville calif there they and some similarly busy berkeley professors built a staff full of newly minted ph d s to help pull together their testimony this arrangement not only saved time but also pumped up economic experts incomes besides billing hundreds of dollars an hour for their own work these experts also collected a markup on their aides time much as partners in a law firm do for associates work on big projects with dozens of aides working round the clock the markup could be worth &# or more to the scholar in charge "i wont get many thank you notes for this but weve given economists the chance to earn investment bankers incomes " prof teece says "if youre successful with us it isnt hard to make half a million dollars a year " he estimates that lecg experts topped the &# mark last year this research boutique idea has caught on at other college campuses even before lecg got started mit economists helped form cra international inc university of chicago economists started lexecon inc and in menlo park calif cornerstone research drew heavily on stanfords faculty lecg in became the first to go public its financial disclosures shocked many on the berkeley campus who hadnt realized that prof teece was earning more than &# a year from his lecg work a statewide review panel ultimately decided that this off campus work neednt be banned though it called on the professors not to let research priorities be tainted to soothe any lingering concerns prof teece switched to half time status at the university a few years ago cutting his salary to about &# a year prof teece doesnt dispute estimates that his career earnings from expert consulting amount to at least &# million if one includes lecg stock sales and assets held in trust for his children he holds a stake in lecg currently valued at about &# million he earned &# million in fees and another &# in salary in the most recent year for which data are available lecg has been a fast growing company for most of its existence and has offices in countries but it stumbled last year when it earned &# million on revenue of &# million that was below wall streets expectations and some analysts believe the company pays its experts and staff too generously leaving too little for shareholders lecgs stock has fallen about in the past two years on feb lecg announced that it was appointing an interim chief executive michael jeffery and looking for a permanent one the company had lacked a ceo for several years prof teece the chairman had called most of the shots prof teece defends lecgs business model which showcases high profile experts across a wide range of topics while anonymous researchers do much of the legwork many industries have common threads prof teece asserts "its possible to provide insights without spending your whole life studying an industry " he says besides big law firms and management consultancies deploy their top talent in similar ways "i dont represent that ive read every word in every document" that might figure in a case prof teece concedes but aides help refresh his memory before trials and depositions ultimately he contends clients want his "insights into essential truths" and hes confident he has plenty he started a recent interview by waving a list of scholars in business and economics who are most cited in academic journals with his own ranking circled in blue "can i blow my own trumpet " prof teece asked without waiting for an answer he continued "im th overall i beat out two nobel laureates " judges dont always agree in a case involving a patent owned by rambus inc a semiconductor company federal district court judge robert payne of richmond va branded prof teeces estimate of the royalties owed to rambus "a wild guess" and refused to admit that section of his analysis as evidence the judge added "i have the impression from what i have read that mr teece will say just about anything " "the judge had it all wrong " rejoins prof teece "two years later i got that analysis published in a peer reviewed academic journal " he had more success in the napster inc case the music industry was trying to shut down the free digital file swapping web site alleging that this service amounted to stealing intellectual property it hired prof teece to write an experts report stanford prof robert hall did the same for napster both experts are middle aged men with conservative tastes in music even so their reports were packed with references to motley crue metallica and britney spears profs teece and hall credit aides for the heavy metal and teen pop data prof teeces side won and federal judge marilyn patel cited his report several times in her ruling legal scholars have contended for more than a century that justice would be better served if courts appointed neutral experts instead of pitting adversarial witnesses against each other but reformers ranging from legendary jurist learned hand in to current federal judge richard posner havent made much headway a major stumbling block involves doubts about judges ability to pick the right experts meanwhile many lawyers clients and economists feel well served by the status quo "this is how major litigation is fought " says dan cooperman general counsel of oracle corp when his software company faced antitrust challenges in to a proposed merger with peoplesoft he spent millions bringing prof teece and two other economists into the case "it was expensive litigation but we won " mr cooperman says "and for a &# billion merger what we spent was not very big in the grand scheme of things " antitrust cases have been a particular boon for economists traditionally trust busters focused on blatantly illegal behavior such as price fixing leaving little leeway for an economists interpretation once the facts were established observes howard university law professor andrew gavil more recent cases such as the one against microsoft corp in the late s have involved tricky calculations of how much consumers might be damaged by a companys market domination "economists are great at answering hypothetical questions with great precision " says asim varma a partner in the washington d c law firm of arnold &amp porter "but you have to find out what the assumptions are if theyre spinning the assumptions to help the client all that precision is illusory " in extreme cases judges will declare that an economic experts report is inadmissible because of bias or sloppy methodology peter nordberg a partner in the philadelphia law firm of berger &amp montague counts cases since where economic or accounting witnesses have come under scrutiny by federal appeals courts the witnesses testimony was knocked out of the time for oracles peoplesoft merger battle prof teece was hired even though he hadnt done significant work on that part of the software industry before to help him out nearly lecg staffers in california texas and virginia scurried to crunch data an lecg project manager doug kidder briefed the boss daily "other people here were technically deeper than david " mr kidder recalls "my job was to make sure that the most relevant information was distilled into him " ten weeks later oracle got a simple line of testimony from mr teece the software industry was changing so fast that static market share analysis wasnt appropriate regardless of how much peoplesoft and oracle overlapped at the time new competition was shaking things up the justice department which was suing to stop the merger with the support of peoplesofts management hired economic experts to argue the opposite view the governments challenge failed and oracle completed the deal in a trial blog at the time gary reback an outside attorney for peoplesoft gave prof teece high marks for style even if he didnt like the message "he told a good story " mr reback wrote "he was far more poised and articulate than many of oracles other witnesses " the next year mr teece offered expert testimony in a completely different field cigarette smoking the estate of deceased smoker fredric reller sued philip morris usa in california state court contending that philip morris a unit of altria group inc had concealed cigarettes health risks philip morris which had lost two similar suits in california decided to recast its defense strategy it put prof teece on the stand and asked him as an economist whether he thought tobacco companies had enjoyed monopoly power to prevent smokers from learning about health dangers "its just not feasible for philip morris to regulate the information market " prof teece declared he presented a diagram identifying sources of knowledge about smoking doctors scientific journals and the media each got a separate bubble the surgeon generals antismoking report of got prominent play even if philip morris denied the risks of smoking it would be overwhelmed by this medley of sources he suggested for much of his testimony prof teece was as plain spoken as a th grader in a social studies class any of philip morriss executives or lawyers could have said the same thing yet because the cigarette company had positioned prof teece as a prominent scholar and independent thinker lawyers for both sides say his remarks carried extra weight several days after prof teeces testimony jurors ruled in favor of philip morris "what david did on the stand was brilliantly simple " says beth wilkinson an outside lawyer for philip morris usa "we polled the jurors afterward and they were very taken by it " ms wilkinson recalls "it ratified their common sense "
