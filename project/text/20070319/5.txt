americas fly me to tijuana as president george bush and president felipe calderon were meeting on the yucatan peninsula last week to discuss the disequilibrium in the north american labor market a low cost mexican airline was celebrating its first anniversary miles north of the capital in the city of toluca the presidential confab got the press but the story of the new airline and others that have followed it in the domestic air travel industry is far more relevant to the future of mexicans a big reason the mexican economy is not growing fast enough to create the one million jobs per year it needs to satisfy its young work force and why migrants go north is a lack of competitiveness key sectors of the economy are controlled by monopolies without consumer choice prices are high service is poor the economy is inefficient and there is not much innovation the international symbol for making a killing through monopoly privilege is now a mexican telecom tycoon carlos slim mr slim who is the worlds third richest man bought telefonos de mexico telmex from the government in and was supposed to face competition in but he has famously used court injunctions and his own influence to block competitors and rake in a fortune telmex still controls of the fixed line market mr slims power play has cost the country dearly the organization for economic cooperation and development notes in a recent report that mexico has some of the highest telecom charges among oecd countries and one of the lowest rates of telephony density its broadband prices are the highest in the oecd in energy transportation and cement vital components of the infrastructure a similar non competitive environment impedes productivity growth and harms investment mexicans have been discouraged by the slow pace of competition reform but there are some glimmers of hope the north american free trade agreement brought competition to the retail sector and now the domestic airline industry is beginning to change for decades mexicans had only two choices for domestic air travel aeromexico and mexicana airlines both companies once state owned were privatized in the s failed and were reabsorbed by the government mexicana has been privatized again privatization did nothing to bring down sky high airfares flying from mexico city to tijuana ran about &# far above what most mexicans could afford taking the bus costs about &# and in bus companies carried some passengers on the hour trip last year four business partners identified those tortured bus passengers and many other mexicans who dared not venture from home on such grueling journeys as potential airline customers they teamed up to launch volaris airlines it is no small irony that mr slim is one of the four investors and another is television mogul emilio azcarraga also known for his monopoly privileges their experience in volaris shows that both are capable of competing if the regulatory environment demands it and there is money to be made former finance minister pedro aspes protego discovery fund owns another of volaris the fourth investor is roberto krietes grupo taca which owns the central american carrier taca airlines competition drives innovation and volaris proves the rule the company came up with a number of creative solutions to problems that probably would not even been considered in a protected market mr kriete told me by telephone from san salvador that the economies of scale come from the decision to purchase identical planes volaris saves money because its mechanics and pilots are qualified to handle all planes and sourcing parts is uniform mr aspe expanded on that point when i interviewed him in mexico city two weeks ago stressing the advantages of the brand new airbus a fleet which is more reliable and more fuel efficient than the industry average the company also gains competitiveness he said with labor contracts that tie of compensation to productivity another cost saver is the toluca hub passengers traveling from mexico city check in at what mr aspe calls "the virtual terminal" in the northern suburb of santa fe and then travel miles by bus courtesy of volaris to tolucas lower cost airport overhead costs are held down because of reservations are made over the internet and are made through call centers competition has put pricing pressure on traditional carriers but mr kriete doesnt expect convergence volaris is "really a different product " targeting a different demographic he says that some travelers are willing to pay more for business class and perks such as frequent flier miles but volaris is going after price sensitive flyers and people who never flew before at the time of its startup one year ago volaris had two planes and by the end of the year it had six this year it says it will invest &# million to add another eight it is also doubling the number of cities it serves and adding a route between tijuana and los cabos on the tip of the baja peninsula which has the potential to capture the southern california market the company expects to triple its sales this year the beauty of volaris is the beauty of the market both the airline and its customers are happy and business is booming last year volaris carried more than passengers on almost flights at less than half the price that the traditional carriers were charging prior to competition bus passengers bound for tijuana from mexico city who switched to volaris paid &# and shaved hours off their travel time a number of other low cost carriers such as avolar interjet and alma have also entered the field according to airport operator oma domestic air travel was up at its airports last year thanks to the low cost carrier business it is worth noting that the volaris story is not entirely a free market exercise mexico still limits foreign ownership in airlines to also volaris took a subsidized loan from the international finance corporation an arm of the world bank that is engaged in promoting development in poor countries it is highly doubtful that mr slim and his partners needed government assistance but ifc bankers are always pushing money out the door and good capitalists dont turn down such offers still the lesson holds if mr calderon wants his legacy to be about curing low mexican living standards there is no better remedy than competition write
