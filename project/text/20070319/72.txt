stem cell research embryo cloning and the exploitation of women robert george and rev thomas berg "six stem cell facts " editorial page march made some points worth considering in the debate over whether taxpayers should be forced to fund stem cell research that kills human embryos they also missed key points this research almost certainly will lead to cloning embryos and to exploiting the women who will be needed to produce the massive numbers of human eggs that cloning research requires the stem cell research enhancement act that congress is considering is a dead end street it provides federal funding for research using frozen embryos that would otherwise be "discarded" by in vitro fertilization clinics but a rand study has determined that only about such embryos have been designated by their parents for research and that at best stem cell lines could be created from them "the actual number " said rand "is likely to be much lower " for this reason researchers are already looking at cloning human embryos to create an unlimited number of genetically diverse stem cell lines the human cloning path to stem cell research runs smack into the exploitation of women because every cloned human embryo requires at least one human egg the process to retrieve these eggs which requires numerous injections and an invasive procedure carries significant health risks such as kidney failure ovarian torsion and even death last week at a briefing for congress members and staff angela hickey spoke of how complications from egg donation put the body of her year old daughter jacqueline into respiratory distress causing her death none of these problems arise with adult stem cell research which as messrs george and berg point out has already led to the development of therapies undergoing clinical trials cathy ruse senior fellow for legal studies family research council alexandria va i would add a seventh stem cell "fact" in vitro fertilization results in "extra" embryos who are ultimately fated for destruction we can keep these embryos humans in a freezer until they are nonviable all the while gamely insisting that maybe someone will adopt them someday and then quietly throw them in the trash or we can sacrifice some of them for scientific pursuits potentially for the good of mankind if their lives are to be spent in a freezer shouldnt their deaths be for some noble purpose martin johnston m d boise idaho the authors assert that "the human embryo has at least some degree of moral status " this is untenable religious dogma disguised as moral superiority the real facts on stem cell research are simple the embryos destroyed are clumps of cells about total called blastocysts they do not have brains or even neurons they are completely unable to feel pain of any sort they are not by any standards human beings the authors do not justify their conclusion that embryo destructive research cannot be morally justified jack davis carlsbad calif
