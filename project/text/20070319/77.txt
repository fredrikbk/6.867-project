the money game branching out as banks pay more attention to entrepreneurs entrepreneurs should pay more attention to banks after years of neglect more banks are rolling out the red carpet for small business owners in addition to loans banks today offer check processing services and other tools to help businesses manage their finances and many such products are less expensive than ever before "winning the business of the small business customer has become a huge initiative at most u s banks " says christine barry a small business banking consultant at aite group llc a boston based advisory and research firm the greater attention which reflects the banking industrys intensifying competitiveness and thinner profit margins means that small business owners have more to gain by doing their homework and choosing a bank wisely many dont fully appreciate whats at stake when choosing a bank a recent survey by surepayroll a glenview ill payroll services company found that most small business owners view banking as a commoditized industry where not much distinguishes one bank from the next other research suggests that business owners often choose a bank based on which branch is nearest their home or where they do their personal banking many "spend more time shopping for a &# laser printer than they will shopping for a bank " says gene fairbrother a small business consultant at the national association for the self employed a dallas based nonprofit bankers business owners and other experts say that smart choices when selecting a bank can pave the way for a more fruitful relationship that in turn can open doors not only to loans but also to other time saving and money saving possibilities what follows is a look at some things to consider when you and your small business go shopping for a new bank some of the nations largest banks say they are trying to make it faster and easier for small businesses to get loans as part of a recently launched program j p morgan chase &amp co s chase retail bank promises to approve or reject loans of less than &# within hours "were just giving a lot more loans than we used to " says kevin watters head of business banking at chase and under a pilot program under way in arizona and ohio the bank is cutting in half the number of questions it asks of small business owners who apply for loans bank of america corp meanwhile last year started offering small businesses unsecured credit lines of as much as &# for loans of less than &# the charlotte n c company wont require businesses to hand over their financial records the bank also no longer requires that businesses exist for a minimum period before being considered for loans some big banks that refuse loans to entrepreneurs offer them small business credit cards instead piling up debt on such a card is a risky strategy because of the high interest rates that most carry given a choice you should generally take a loan over a card especially if you wouldnt be able to pay the full balance on the card promptly banking experts and entrepreneurs say that small businesses often are better off turning to smaller local lenders when it comes to getting access to loans major regional and national banks often are less interested than their smaller peers in making loans of &# or less lending money in small increments isnt seen as efficient for banks that make tens of billions of dollars in loans every year many community banks by contrast consider small business lending to be their bread and butter according to entrepreneurs bankers and other experts just ask mark zoller in itching for a "lifestyle change " mr zoller wanted to quit his job and buy a whitewater rafting company along the columbia river in washington state he reckoned he would need about &# to pay for the rafting equipment and to buy and develop a acre plot of land mr zoller who lives in white salmon wash approached several banks without luck then his cousin recommended a local savings and loan riverview community bank based in vancouver wash which has branches in washington and oregon "i couldnt believe the reception " mr zoller says "they wanted it to work " before long a riverview vice president was helping mr zoller apply for a u s small business administration loan which came through in about five weeks mr zoller took bank officials on a tour of the property he wanted to buy and the bank provided him a &# line of credit to pay for rafts and other equipment today mr zollers rafting business brings in about &# a year in revenue he maintains a tight relationship with riverview meeting his bankers at least once a year and keeping them up to date on his companys finances banking experts say a key factor in selecting where to bank should be whether the branch manager has the authority to negotiate and approve loans of at least &# thats much more likely to happen at a community bank than at a larger lender "some of the big banks have a kind of cookie cutter approach to handling small businesses and theres little discretion for the relationship manager" to do more than open checking accounts says seamus mcmahon a consultant at booz allen hamilton inc and a former executive in hsbc holdings plcs north america banking business to be sure some major banks say they offer small businesses the same level of personal attention that local banks do keycorp a cleveland based lender that operates in much of the midwest says its branch employees are empowered to make speedy decisions outside experts vouch for the banks reputation lots of banks including keycorp also say they help small businesses navigate the sba loan application process but experts say that smaller banks are more likely to help with getting sba assistance federally subsidized loans protect the bank against a small businesss defaulting on a loan which makes it easier for the banks to lend money sba loans are available to businesses whose credit histories cash flows or collateral would be inadequate for them to obtain traditional bank loans another bonus for working with the sba the agency typically allows for more flexible repayment terms than banks for businesses that need heavy industrial equipment other financing options exist such as the commercial and consumer lender cit group inc new york and john deere credit inc the johnston iowa financing unit of deere &amp co some small business owners say these lenders offer better customer service and lower interest rates than many midsize and large banks jeanette howarth who runs a newaygo mich excavating business with annual revenue of around &# says she increasingly turns to such nonbank lenders as well as small community banks instead of huntington national bank where her business is a longtime customer huntington the banking unit of huntington bancshares inc based in columbus ohio recently has been growing at a rapid clip snapping up smaller banks and transforming itself into a major regional player ms howarth years old says that when seeking a credit line at huntington she has to "jump through some hoops" and has had to sign over her excavating equipment as collateral which was "pretty uncomfortable " "as a small business owner i feel that the bigger the bank is the more you get lost " she says "i see huntington getting bigger and bigger and its just so much easier to get dropped through the cracks " jeff rosen huntingtons head of business banking says that the bank prides itself on providing small business customers superior service and that the vast majority give huntington high marks "we bring to the table local service and the larger company resources to provide to our customers products and services that community banks dont have " mr rosen says businesses with annual revenue of more than &# million generally enjoy easier access to capital but the choice of where to bank is still important because of the wide array of technology based products that banks are now offering many products can help small businesses save time and money and are available at ever cheaper prices but businesses have to weigh whether the added efficiencies are worth the costs for example bank of america recently introduced an online system that makes it easier to manage payrolls including taxes and accounting mark hogan head of small business banking at bank of america says the system allows small business owners to go from spending "hours a week to minutes a week" on payroll consultants recommend such systems for businesses with more than a handful of employees the product is free for bank of america customers with fewer than employees as long as the business pays all of its employees via direct deposit into bank of america accounts otherwise theres a &# fee for each employee to a ceiling of &# a month payable by the company other banks are expected to follow suit with similar programs indeed the banking business is so competitive experts say that it rarely takes more than a year for new products and services to become commoditized across the industry that means trusting and being comfortable with a bank can sometimes be more important than a seemingly unique product "whats lacking is not products " says mr mcmahon of booz allen at many large banks "whats lacking is someone who can walk through this and take this off your plate so you can go back" to running the business among the latest innovations are systems that allow check deposits without going to a bank a potential boon to businesses that collect lots of checks the process known as remote deposit is the result of a recent law that allows banks to process digital images of checks businesses can scan checks into terminals in their office or store then securely zap the images to the bank for crediting to the businesses accounts remote deposit makes it less important to select a bank based on its location or number of branches which many big banks tout as a key selling point "its helping to level the playing field" between large and small banks says ms barry of aite group but experts caution that the systems can have high costs which banks dont always disclose transparently check scanning terminals generally cost small businesses several hundred dollars then there are monthly service charges and fees for each transaction some banks slap on an initial setup fee and may also assess "archival fees" for storing images of processed checks according to ajay nagarkatte director of research at the bank administration institute a professional organization based in chicago while trust and comfort are important experts say that all small business owners should periodically check out what different institutions have to offer interview branch employees and managers at competing lenders every few years and gauge their willingness to devote time to a single businessperson and let your banker know youre shopping around of course switching banks can be a hassle indeed part of the reason banks offer so many services sometimes free of charge is so that customers will find it burdensome to take their business elsewhere even experts can find it hard to make the jump mr fairbrother the national association for the self employed consultant runs a small consulting firm in dallas and its a longtime bank of america customer lately though hes been growing frustrated with the frequent turnover among managers at his banks neighborhood branch so why doesnt he switch banks "thats a good question " mr fairbrother says "maybe sometimes we dont practice what we preach " mr enrich is a reporter for dow jones newswires in jersey city n j he can be reached at david enrich dowjones com
