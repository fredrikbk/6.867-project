the morning brief media may shift but its all about the storytelling online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here it is an old if somewhat faulty hollywood cliche that the writer gets no respect and the kernel of truth is found in the older conflict between storytellers and their patrons over the sharing of profits from the tales they tell regardless of the medium and even in this ipod age case in point is the writers co op the latest effort to band together in search of greater financial reward and creative control over films made from their scripts the co op as variety reports is "designed to give gross profit participation to screenwriters along with a voice in how their scripts are turned into films " it initially includes top hollywood writers including the likes of ron bass "rain man" michael tolkin "the player" and the hit making duo lowell ganz and babaloo mandel "city slickers" this roster already gets respect and high salaries pulling in seven figure paychecks for assignments and six figure per week pay for rewrites and polishes variety notes but they are willing to risk their high upfront salaries for the reward mostly the province of big name actors and some directors of receiving a percentage of a movies gross profit and having a say in decision making through a films postproduction warner brothers which plays host to john wells productions which in turn will house the co op hopes to profit as well at a time when studios are burning through development budgets months ahead of schedule warner brothers likes the idea of the writers giving up of their upfront first draft and initial revision fees the writers get full fees and bonuses for films that actually get made under the deal the studio will enjoy first look privileges and over four years "will pay of what conceivably would have cost the studio tens of millions of dollars in development costs to get at least scripts " variety says attempts to wrest some control over movie earnings from studios and their banking backers arent new and another contemporary model for such endeavors can be seen in media rights capital a group put together under the wing of the endeavor talent agency backed by investors at&amp t advertising conglomerate wpp group and goldman sachs media rights has been building films around its actor and director clients including the oscar nominated "babel " as the new york times reports as the times notes it still isnt taken too seriously by "a skeptical film business that it is not just a stalking horse for endeavor and its clients " whatever the intentions and however much the co op and media rights efforts are the latest incarnations of past hollywood struggles they happen to be taking place at a time when the loosening time and spatial strictures on scripted entertainment have put traditional control over content and distribution in play as much as any time before another cliche these days is how much the ipod internet video and other media have changed the equation and the &# billion copyright infringement suit filed last week by viacom against googles youtube is very much a product of the resulting tension "as traditional media companies feel their business model being eroded by the un monetized at least not for them distribution of their content a problem is born not only for the media companies themselves but also for the distributors " ad age notes viacom like every other media company knows the value of the "free" content on youtube and is itself making every effort to grab more of the exponentially growing advertising spending online taking great pains to promote its digital assets ahead of the annual "upfronts" tv ad previews the new york times reports viacom time warners warner brothers and the other big entertainment conglomerates may seem under fire and in some ways they are but their brands and influence over where and when audiences view their products still count for a lot take the plans sony pictures entertainment executive jeff blake
