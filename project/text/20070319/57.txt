politics &amp economics in race web tactics are even more integral handicapping field is a bigger chore as goals diverge washington john edwards topped the field of democratic presidential contenders in the liberal blog dailykoss latest straw poll but barack obama has the most "friends" on myspace hillary rodham clinton meanwhile has drawn much heavier traffic to her web site than either of her biggest competitors so whos winning the "internet primary" so far that is a much harder question to answer than it was in or when the insurgent campaigns of republican john mccain and democrat howard dean respectively became the darlings of the online political community as the role of the internet expands and diversifies in the cycle all campaigns are trying to develop web strategies but often with different short term goals for mr edwards widely considered the main democratic contender behind the front running senators it is a way to tap into and show prominence among the liberal activists who have outsize clout in the partys primaries and could help him pull off an upset for mr obama it allows him to capture the wave of excitement over his campaign for mrs clinton who has perhaps the most organized political infrastructure the web gives her a more methodical vehicle for transmitting a message and organizing supporters and fund raisers but the web is about buzz as much as it is a tool an ability to convey early online success of some kind has an importance all its own with at least candidates actively in the running so far and the new hampshire primary still months away it is a way for campaigns now to show concrete momentum and garner crucial early attention "you had the money primary the endorsement primary now you have a web primary going on concurrently with the traditional money and consultant chase and stuff like that " says howard mortman a former msnbc producer blogger and now head of the public affairs practice at new media strategies an arlington va internet market research firm some analysts say such attention is overblown after all mr dean after cleaning up the informal netroots primary didnt win a single physical primary or caucus "there aint no winning or losing except on election day " says phil noble a political consultant who specializes in internet strategy still the amount of money and attention being spent by the campaigns on their sites this year is significant mr noble says greater emphasis by campaigns on the internet "is recognition that the game is radically changing its the moores law in politics every two years it all doubles or more but this year its more than doubled " republicans campaigns too are experimenting with ways to use the internet to their advantage but the notions of "netroots" and influential bloggers are most heavily concentrated among democrats while republican candidates sites are getting less attention and traffic candidates from either party cant simply put up spare one way web sites anymore they update their sites regularly if not hourly or daily candidates have introduced video laden web sites and myspace and facebook profiles and are granting interviews to influential bloggers even the campaigns of long shot candidates have hired some of the small group of internet savvy staffers who ran sites for candidates during the past two election cycles mrs clinton snagged peter daou whose salon com feature "the daou report" brought attention to less read bloggers to run her online operations mr obama is relying on several veterans of the dean campaign including joe rospars who was mr deans internet strategist noted republican internet strategist rebecca donatelli has signed up for another round as a consultant for mr mccain she also served as a consultant for his presidential campaign in previous years candidates mostly used the internet to communicate with supporters and raise money that is still a major focus but this time around they are also trying to generate more online buzz which they hope will translate into more local volunteers and votes in important states mr mccains staff for example put the senators national collegiate athletic associations mens basketball tournament bracket up online and allowed users to put their brackets up against him to win a campaign baseball cap or fleece pullover it didnt just generate free press coverage but also provided "many thousands" of new email addresses of potential supporters for mr mccains database since providing an email address and zip code was a requirement to play according to christian ferry the arizona senators internet director amid all that activity differing online strategies of the various campaigns are starting to emerge and diverge somewhat mrs clintons focus thus far has been on using the internet for fund raising and to communicate directly with supporters through online video chats and a tightly controlled blog area on her site her campaign has significant work to do if it wants to win over the most committed online activists who continue to complain about her vote for the iraq war and refusal to apologize about it in this months straw poll on the leading democratic blog dailykos for example mrs clinton received votes from about votes cast placing her in fourth below new mexico gov bill richardson supporters have contributed just &# toward her campaign on the affiliated grass roots funding site actblue compared with well over &# million for mr edwards mr obamas campaign has been the most active in helping give young supporters social networking tools with which they can get involved in the campaign but which dont require large donations sites like facebook allow users to form their own groups interact with each other and plan social events on mr obamas site a feature dubbed myobama allows supporters to form groups so they can help figure out how to help his candidacy some are bundling together small cash donations from friends or strangers for the campaign others are using it to organize local meetings for supporters "one of the challenges right now is just harnessing the energy around his candidacy right now " says jen psaki an obama spokeswoman "using it as an organizing tool hasnt been done this way in the past " corrections &amp amplifications former vermont gov howard dean won the vermont democratic caucus a
