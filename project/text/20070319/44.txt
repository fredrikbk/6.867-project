managers lose talent when they neglect to coach their staffs rather than worry so much about the war for talent in todays tight job market executives ought to focus on the waste of talent in their ranks many dont spend nearly enough time making sure the people under them learn and grow on the job companies are filled with alienated employees who feel underutilized and ignored and are either coasting or searching for new jobs elsewhere a whopping of u s employees say they feel either "not engaged" or "actively disengaged" at work according to a recent survey by the gallup organization business units with such a large number of dissatisfied employees "have more absenteeism and lower productivity as well as higher turnover rates than those with engaged employees " says james harter chief scientist for gallups international management practice a key differential between a staffer who feels like a valuable part of a company and one who is disengaged is the quality of leadership in their workplace most engaged employees work for managers who spend a big chunk of their time helping their subordinates succeed managers who focus on talent assign their employees to jobs that play to their strengths make sure they have the resources they need to perform well respect their opinions and push them to advance "the role of people managers who develop talent and create sustained profits for companies isnt as valued as it should be " says mr harter co author with rodd wagner also of gallup of " the elements of great managing " if it were he adds companies wouldnt promote to management those who succeeded at a prior job but dont have the foggiest idea about how to motivate people blame the top executives who simply grade their managers on their financial results rather than on how well they groom and retain good employees many people focused managers have innate coaching skills or worked for a boss who masterfully mentored them pete wamsteeker general manager of cargill animal nutritions west branch iowa business was only years old when he landed a job at a feed company in lethbridge alberta his boss the company founder frequently asked him "what are your plans for the future " after college mr wamsteeker joined cargill a provider of agricultural and other products and services which had acquired the feed company his first boss who helped him get the job remains a close friend and role model like him mr wamsteeker asks employees scores of questions to figure out how "to serve them " he says five years ago he was assigned to turn around cargills west branch pork business consultancy the first thing he did was figure out which employees would excel at which jobs he moved one very quiet deliberate employee to a job analyzing how pork producers world wide can improve productivity "he had technical expertise and had worked in taiwan so understood different cultures and he has flourished in this job " says mr wamsteeker who offers advice to employees and listens to their concerns as he joins them on customer calls and business trips "in some corporate cultures theres a lot of impatience so if someone doesnt exactly fit one job hes pushed aside for someone else " he adds "i look at people as half full not half empty and try to find out whats happening to them at work and in their personal lives to find learning gaps that i can help fill " several years ago after observing luke wells a young employee speaking to a customer mr wamsteeker urged him to "act more like a prizefighter " he told mr wells "i dont mind if you maybe get knocked down a few times but youve got to have the confidence that im never going to let you get knocked out " now mr wells is himself a manager and tells his employees the same thing "were putting in eight to hour days but we have fun and because of pete its a very tight knit team with an almost family feeling " he says companies headed by chief executives who rate managers on how well they develop talent usually have more committed employees to that end campbell soups ceo doug conant rewards managers who unleash talent and get high performance from their staffs one example is lisa walker business director of the wellness team at campbell usa she knew she needed an energized team to lead the companys recent launch of low sodium soups she strengthened her ranks by giving equal attention to the star performers and to those needing help "when someone is struggling its a huge drain on everyone else who must pick up the slack so its in my and the companys interests to help that struggling person " she says she feels buoyed when her coaching advice enables someone talented to advance ms walker taught one good employee who liked to just "charge ahead with projects" how to confer more with other colleagues a skill he needed to master if he wanted to move up the employee later told ms walker "its clear that you and the company really care about my success " she recalls
