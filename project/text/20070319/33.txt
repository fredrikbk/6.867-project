a slam dunk a venture that both companies promised would be "profitable from day one " but six months after it launched the upstart network has yet to turn a profit while heavily hyped shows such as chris rocks "everybody hates chris" are struggling in the ratings next season the network may have to cope with the loss of its popular long running series "gilmore girls " due to the likely departure of both lead actresses the impending cancellation of teen detective series "veronica mars" and drama "th heaven" will create even more holes on its schedule this week as tv networks gear up for their annual springtime ad selling negotiations cw president dawn ostroff plans to meet with media buyers and major marketers to discuss her plans to rev up the network ms ostroff will outline a roster of new shows in development for the fall season that are loaded with product placement and sponsorship opportunities among them "gossip girl " a buzzy drama based on the popular books of the same name and an innovative magazine style show that evolved out of a commercial for procter &amp gambles herbal essences hair products media buyers say the next season is crucial for the cw "the grace period is done " says bill mcowen director of broadcast for havass mpg "they need to show us what they have that is distinct in many ways its still a faceless entity " to be sure the network has had some success the four year old reality series "americas next top model" which originally aired on one of the cws predecessor networks upn is notching up some of its biggest ratings ever a new reality show that launched this month "pussycat dolls present the search for the next doll " has shown early momentum and the networks unique "content wraps" a new kind of ad where commercial breaks feature mini shows built around products have been a hit with marketers but the new networks audience is flat compared to the cash bleeding wb and upn networks which the cw replaced an average of people age to have watched the cw in primetime since its september launch according to nielsen media research cbs and warner bros which lend the "c" and the "w" to the new networks name say starting a new broadcast enterprise has been tough because viewers had trouble finding holdover shows from the wb and upn because of a realignment of tv stations after those networks were closed in more than of the u s fans of upn shows had to look for programs on another channel followers of former wb shows needed to switch channels in a third of the country to help guide the way cw has spent more than &# million on advertising start up costs that have weighed on the networks bottom line the cws financial status wont make or break either company but both have incentives to make the network succeed as a major supplier of tv programs warner bros a unit of time warner is counting on the cw as a long term client cbs wants to convince wall street that broadcast television is a healthy business and turning the cw into a cash machine would help the argument representatives for both companies declined to comment on finances but said executives are pleased with the new networks performance so far says cws ms ostroff "we never discuss financial matters but we are on plan " its too early to tell what programs might get a spot on the fall schedule but media buyers say ms ostroff has made strong bets on unique concepts filled with marketing hooks something that will help the cw launch new programs in september among the networks pilots are dramas about a girl witch and a year old slacker whose parents sell his soul to the devil a comedy "dash for cash " is set behind the scenes of a fictional reality show and one character leaves each week as they get voted off many series under consideration have plenty of product placement opportunities "gossip girl " for instance tells the story of privileged new york city teenagers and their high society parents through the eyes of a tell all blogger whom nobody can identify characters email gossip to the blogger via their t mobile sidekicks a tailor made product placement t mobile hasnt been involved in the creation of the show but a cw spokesman says it will likely reach out to the company if the show gets a spot on the fall schedule "cop shows have guns medical shows have scalpels this show has sidekicks " reads the pilot script which was co written by "the o c " creator josh schwartz one potential series "cw now " evolved from the cws content wraps airing in three two minute segments during commercial breaks one content wrap took the form of a mini magazine show where hosts chatted about the latest in fashion and pop culture in one segment a celebrity hair stylist created fashionable hairstyles with herbal essences products "cw now" would expand the concept into a formal half hour or even hourlong series the fast paced show would have three or four hosts and feature everything from trends in music to decorating tips for apartments "the content wraps sold out so quickly that it made sense to consider doing it as a whole show " ms ostroff says the cws offerings reflect new research the network has conducted on its target demographic of young people ms ostroff says she points to a drama tentatively titled "wild at heart " the series looks at a new york veterinarian and his family who move to a wild game reserve in africa after deciding their lives are too busy "our viewers get along with their parents and they are very socially conscious " ms ostroff says "the goal here is to tap into that "
