love &amp money home sweet home but at what price for the years weve been married my wife and i have been house hoppers buying and selling homes from one coast to the other as weve followed my job and hers as a result weve always been reluctant to spend a lot of money fixing up our homes since we know we wont be in them for long but now were in our sixth house and were pretty certain our roots are set with that stability comes a different kind of home improvement question how high should we go do we go all out knowing this is our home for a long time even if building what we really want stretches the borders of our budget homeowners everywhere face this question every time they start visualizing what their house could be if they just push out a wall here tack on a new bedroom there or replace that s era kitchen with a modern cooking arena much of the debate as with cars or vacations or any big ticket items comes down to affordability but when youre talking about your home the rules take on a different dimension this is your castle the last thing you want to do is look at your home every day and think if only we had done and thus the challenge so many of us face when remodeling your house to meet your dreams do you pursue what you want or simply settle for what you need part of this debate is financial part is emotional unlike spending money on say a car remodeling a house is an investment in a generally appreciating asset if youre lucky you will be able to recoup some or all of or even more than your costs when you resell the house yet its the emotion that drives most homeowners most of us are spending the money with an emotional not investment return in mind we want something nicer than were currently living with thats the situation my wife amy and i are now discussing on a particularly cold night two years ago amy turned on the hot water and our whirlpool tub shattered its going to cost several hundred dollars to replace but then we started thinking theres demolition work needed to remove the tub as well as some plumbing but we never really liked the triangular shaped tub to begin with and to be honest the nearby glass and brass shower isnt our style the light fixtures and vanities need to go the white floor tiles are too sterile and the mirrors are plain so do we take this opportunity to do something completely different its what one of my colleagues calls "the might as well" syndrome she and her husband remodeled their new jersey home a few years ago initially thinking of adding eight feet to the back of the house but a contractor friend said they "might as well go with feet because thats the length in which some of the wood will come in any event " she says from there it went something like this "weve got most of the house down to the studs so might as well do the front two rooms even though they didnt really need to be gutted " she says "and once you do that you might as well do new windows in those rooms " of course each "might as well" is another check youre writing and those checks add up quickly my friend christie in los angeles penciled in &# to remodel a new condo she recently bought that now has climbed above &# she says "and no doubt there will be more trickling in as i get into full swing " one of the problems as christie sees it is that "the money all seems fake anyway " youre spending cash in your head so its easy to go for that upscale fridge instead of the lower end model that somehow functions just as well without an internet connection christie isnt by nature indulgent but in what is a near universal emotion when it comes to our homes christie insists that "i do not want to live with something thats just ok i think its a waste not to get what i really want that doesnt mean spend like a crazy person but it does mean that im likely to spend more and if im going to spend the money i might as well do it all upfront so i can enjoy it for the maximum amount of time " a longtime friend on the east coast says he wishes he had that foresight years ago when he spent &# adding a second floor to his house instead of spending up to get what he wanted he says "i settled too much" for the merely adequate "now in retrospect i wish id done more " "obviously " he says "theres only so much you can do because you only have so much money but its not big things its a bunch of little decisions a thousand dollars here a thousand dollars there that add up to real improvements in the house its the bigger closet the nicer bathroom the better floor the stuff i see every day but at the time they seemed like indulgences now i cant believe i didnt do them for an extra &# " when amy and i recently decided to finally focus on our master bath i went wild spewing my vision of slate and bamboo floors an asian styled furniture piece as a vanity porcelain vessels as sinks a stone and glass shower i want to replace bland hollow core doors with solid hardwoods and get amy a designer tub made for soaking whoa she said "i just need something basic " while my vision for our bath "would be cool " amy told me "i dont want to put that much money into this " she conceded however that her initial reaction was colored by the fact that at this point shell accept a cattle trough filled with hot water because "im tired of sitting on toys in the kids tub i just want a grown up bathroom again " but the more we talked the more she realized we were both in the same camp just as i dont want to one day say "i wish wed done " she wants certain renovations including opening up a particular wall that will make her feel the room is more functional than it is now "if im spending this money " she ultimately told me "then i want it to be forever " and with that we called a contractor amy and i will do some of the work ourselves to trim costs see a future column for details on that in the meantime the demolition of the old bath starts soon when it comes to your home weve decided you dont settle within reason you dream big jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at lovemoney wsj com
