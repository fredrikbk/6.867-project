getting going finding room for the oddball investment if you want to build a great portfolio youve got to buy ugly investments most of us are happy to own blue chip stocks and short term high quality bonds these are safe investments or so we think yet if we want to make our portfolios even safer while still generating healthy long run returns we need to be more adventurous dabbling in stuff like emerging markets gold stocks and long term bonds true these can be scary investments but toss them into a portfolio and they can work wonders going wild admittedly all this is a little counterintuitive to build a portfolio youre comfortable with you probably prefer to go investment by investment picking out those stocks bonds and mutual funds that strike you as most comforting and familiar but if you can tear your gaze away from each investment and focus on your entire portfolio you will find that the best way to earn high returns with low risk is to add seemingly unsavory investments such as foreign bonds commodities and small companies from developed foreign markets the reason these oddball investments will sometimes post gains when your blue chip stocks and high quality bonds are suffering and also of course suffer when more mainstream investments are gaining the overall effect is to reduce risk by smoothing out your portfolios performance what about boosting returns investments like emerging markets real estate investment trusts and foreign small company stocks should post healthy long run returns though the short term outlook doesnt seem nearly so promising because all three sectors have fared extremely well in recent years but even investments with lower expected returns like gold stocks commodities and foreign bonds can give a surprisingly large boost to your portfolios overall performance thanks to the so called rebalancing bonus whats that the idea is to set target portfolio percentages for your various holdings allocating maybe of your money to gold stocks to foreign bonds and so on every year or so thereafter you should rebalance your portfolio to bring it back into line with your target percentages this forces you to lighten up on highflying investments that may be due for a fall while adding to those that are suffering and could be set to bounce back because gold stocks commodities and foreign bonds will likely perform quite differently from the rest of your portfolio they should offer plenty of opportunities to rebalance that in turn should enhance returns as rebalancing compels you to buy low and sell high going cheap so which oddball investments should you buy the answer is all of them provided you can get them without incurring a heap of investment costs for instance you can tap into gold stocks fairly cheaply through no load low cost mutual funds like american century global gold and fidelity select gold both have expenses below similarly there are a heap of reasonably priced real estate funds including fidelity real estate investment and vanguard reit index there is even a low cost emerging market stock fund in the form of vanguard emerging markets stock index but in other mutual fund categories the choices arent great foreign bond funds like american century international bond and t rowe price international bond have expenses of around which seems a little steep for a bond fund meanwhile a search of morningstars database didnt turn up any truly low expense foreign small cap mutual funds that are open to ordinary investors there are however a few exchange traded index funds worth considering notably wisdomtree international smallcap dividend fund one warning buying etfs will mean paying a brokerage commission and other trading costs and those costs can severely crimp returns if youre investing modest sums intrigued by commodities there are some no load low expense mutual funds that focus on the stocks of natural resource companies including offerings from fidelity investments and t rowe price group but if you want a more direct play on commodities you will likely end up paying over in annual expenses unless you purchase an exchange traded index fund like ishares gsci commodity indexed trust and powershares db commodity index mutual fund companies have introduced a slew of hedge fund type mutual funds and these too could be good diversifiers but if youre cheap like me and favor no load funds with annual expenses that are well below you wont find the funds particularly appealing going long to the list of oddball investments that are good diversifiers theres one other category worth considering long term bonds to be sure year and year bonds arent exactly popular investments in fact many financial experts avoid them arguing that you can clock comparable yields with far less volatility by purchasing short term bonds and this is true nonetheless taking a small stake in long term bonds can be a smart move if youre approaching retirement and want to hedge the cost of generating retirement income suppose that upon retirement you plan to build a laddered bond portfolio buying individual issues with an array of different maturities if interest rates fall sharply between now and when you retire you will have to sink a lot more into bonds to generate your desired retirement income but falling interest rates wont be a problem if you own some long term bonds because the drop in rates will drive up the price of your year and year bonds and thus you will have extra money to put toward your bond ladder similarly upon retirement you might be planning to invest say &# in an immediate fixed annuity that pays lifetime income the amount of income you will get for a &# annuity purchase will decline if interest rates tumble between now and when you retire but once again you can hedge that risk by buying long term bonds if interest rates fall your long bonds will leap in price and you will now have more money to sink into the immediate fixed annuity jonathan clements also writes the "getting going" column that appears wednesdays in the wall street journal write to him at jonathan clements wsj com
