marketwatch investing in foreclosures be careful the number of homes in or nearing foreclosure is growing and some investors are taking advantage of the bargains created but even with a steady stream of distressed properties coming on the market jumping into foreclosure investing is dangerous especially if you are not familiar with the process or are new to real estate investing some people are using the word "tsunami " says dave jenks co author of "the millionaire real estate investor " as in "theres going to be a tsunami of foreclosures for the people who are pros at dealing with foreclosures and have the infrastructure of information and wherewithal they will take full advantage of this " consider these recent statistics of mortgages were in the foreclosure process in the third quarter of according to the mortgage bankers association the foreclosure rate increased from in the second quarter the rate was in the third quarter of and realtytrac reported last week that the number of homes entering the foreclosure process increased by in january compared with decembers numbers compared with january the number of homes in the process is up in a total of million homes entered the foreclosure process more than in while there are opportunities to purchase homes at reduced prices in many markets theyre "cautious opportunities " says john anderson owner of twin oaks realty in crystal minn a suburb of minneapolis above all you cant assume that just because a home is heading for foreclosure means that it is automatically a good deal mr anderson says remember even for pros foreclosure investing involves some risk as does any purchase of "real estate as an investment as opposed to a home in which to live " says rick sharga vice president of marketing at realtytrac the transaction has to make sense financially figuring in the costs of getting the property back into marketable condition the value its going to have at resale and the length of time its going to take to find a buyer if you do in fact plan on reselling immediately instead of holding it to rent out or live in its also important to know if there are liens on the property adding to the complexity of the investment are the various state and county foreclosure laws and regulations "this is hard work " says daryl white a foreclosure investor in valencia calif "forget about if i can do it you can do it " lines from late night television infomercials he adds mr white subscribes to foreclosures com a foreclosure listing service and educational web site and uses a spreadsheet to figure the costs associated with investing in a particular property when his analysis is complete he can decide what to pay for the property the goal he says is to buy at below the after repaired market value half of the discount allows him to cover such expenses as holding costs and repairs while the other half earns him a profit a formula he found on foreclosures com in the "changing market" hes in near los angeles he has to factor in that houses are taking about three to five months to sell which adds to holding costs he says but even in a cooling market a home that is priced right will sell says alexis mcgee president of foreclosures com its important she says to pay careful attention to prices of comparable houses that are selling in a particular neighborhood to get an idea of what return an investment can bring in fact many who have had success in real estate investing will also recommend not depending on a strong market for a good return mr jenks the real estate author says "most of the really good investors will tell you never rely on appreciation to make a deal work " he says why the foreclosure flood there are a couple of key reasons for the uptick in foreclosures says mr sharga whose site also lists homes in the foreclosure process for one a slower housing market has stretched out the time it takes for a home to sell making it tougher for families who must sell to strike a deal in time to avoid the foreclosure process he says also at play is the rise in interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages at times squeezing "people who have overextended themselves in the first place " those looking to buy a home in the foreclosure process can do so during a few different stages some investors including mr white prefer purchasing homes prior to the actual foreclosure others make the investment later in the process at a foreclosure auction if the property is unable to be sold by the bank at a desired price an investor can deal with the institution in buying what is called a real estate owned property or reo each point has its own complications so tread slowly and do your homework first mr anderson says he recommends that beginners start out by sitting down with a real estate agent who has experience in the arena someone who has done it before dealing with a preforeclosure for example often involves negotiating with a distressed homeowner and isnt always a comfortable situation "they homeowners dont want to be bothered or may not be as reasonable as they are under normal circumstances " mr sharga says on top of that there are a number of "foreclosure rip off artists" who have taken advantage of people when theyre most vulnerable he adds mr white says hes often battling a negative image because people "dont see the white knight part of it " when in fact the sale of a preforeclosure home could help homeowners keep negative marks off their credit histories and also get at any remaining equity as a realtor working with investors mr anderson says his first thought is to try and find a way to keep the homeowner in the house if a sale must take place he recommends the sellers have fair representation before proceeding to ensure they get a fair deal amy hoak writes for marketwatch www marketwatch com email forum sunday wsj com
