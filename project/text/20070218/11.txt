your vote can count in company elections corporate elections arent just for pension funds and other big investors increasingly even small shareholders can influence corporate matters such as who sits on the board of directors so take time to wade through those dense proxy voting packets that arrive in advance of company annual meetings most often held in the spring youre asked to submit a "proxy card" if you plan to miss the meeting increasingly investors can also cast votes online until recently proxy voting was a routine affair companies ran the show and few of their recommendations were questioned by investors if a company recommended shareholders approve a board member for example it was rare for investors to do anything but now though once routine voting matters are more likely to be challenged by unhappy shareholders from hedge funds to public pensions investors are taking more aggressive stands theyre waging high profile campaigns to shake up boards protesting mergers and pushing proposals that give them more say over how the companies are operated that increased activism makes it more important for even the smallest investors to make their voices heard experts say "corporate elections have gotten a lot closer and as a result every vote is going to count " says patrick mcgurn executive vice president of institutional shareholder services a rockville md firm that advises institutions on how to vote their shares today to of individual investors vote in any given proxy season says chuck callan spokesman for automatic data processing which delivers proxy materials to investors for companies by contrast voting by institutional shareholders is "almost universal " says mr mcgurn note that if you own shares through a brokerage firm and fail to cast your ballot your brokerage firm can vote for you on certain issues like director elections heres some of what you should look for this proxy season battles for board seats one strategy unhappy investors are using to get their agendas approved is to fight for board representation its a costly tactic but as well heeled investors like hedge funds grow more active the number and frequency of contested elections for board seats are increasing last year the number of contested board elections jumped to from just battles in and the year before the figure was the highest since sharkrepellent net a web site devoted to corporate takeover defenses started tracking this data in this year there are already proxy battles in which hedge funds or other dissidents are trying to win board seats according to sharkrepellent net and the heart of proxy season hasnt even started with the heaviest mailings beginning in late february and early march if you own stock in a company thats facing a proxy battle expect to get two sets of proxy materials including separate proxy cards some closely watched contests carl c icahn nominated himself to the board of motorola and former securities and exchange commission chairman richard breedens hedge fund is aiming for seats on the board of restaurant chain applebees international withhold vote campaigns company directors are also coming under attack through "withhold vote" campaigns in which shareholders withhold their support from one or more directors to protest something specific in corporate elections shareholders can usually vote "for" a director or "withhold" their votes one of the highest profile withhold vote campaigns was waged at pharmaceutical company pfizer last year concerned that pfizers chief executive was earning too much in light of the companys performance a number of large shareholders announced plans to withhold votes for the directors in charge of setting pay in the end all the directors were re elected but dissenting shareholders still claimed victory when nine months later ceo henry a mckinnell was asked to step down its too early to tell where shareholders might strike this year but executive compensation is expected to be a lightning rod once again investors wont learn of withhold vote campaigns in the proxy materials but the shareholders leading the charge may solicit support from other shareholders this years "withhold" votes have the potential to be more potent than ever thats because companies have been rapidly adopting "majority voting" policies which require directors to be approved by a majority of votes cast otherwise a director can technically be re elected with just one "for" vote under the traditional voting system "withhold" votes dont count so withholding votes was a largely symbolic gesture but under majority voting a withhold vote campaign could actually end a directors tenure at the start of february a record of companies in the standard &amp poors stock index had adopted majority voting up from a year earlier according to a report from claudia h allen chair of the corporate governance practice with law firm neal gerber &amp eisenberg in chicago companies that have instituted some form of majority voting include washington mutual cvs morgan stanley and yahoo shareholder proposals shareholders should also be on the lookout for a number of controversial proposals that are getting onto corporate ballots perhaps the most contentious type seeks to let shareholders nominate their own directors on the companys ballot without soliciting their own proxy cards shareholders say this would improve board accountability companies argue it would result in a slew of unnecessary and costly contested elections even the securities and exchange commission is divided about how to handle the issue and has twice pushed back meetings to consider the topic as the sec ponders the situation the proposal is being pushed at a handful of companies including hewlett packard and reliant energy investors should also watch for a slew of proposals that seek to give shareholders an advisory nonbinding vote on executive compensation that concept was tested at a handful of companies last year receiving upward of of votes in some cases which is high for a newbie proposal this year at least companies have been targeted with this resolution including citigroup coca cola exxon mobil and time warner insurance company aflac announced last week that it will give investors a non binding vote starting in email forum sunday wsj com
