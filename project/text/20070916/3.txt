eyes on the road niches go nuts at auto show frankfurt illustrates trend toward more unique vehicles online edition last weeks frankfurt auto shows unofficial theme based on the concepts shown could have been "niches go nuts " look at the bmw x concept unveiled at frankfurt i sadly couldnt attend but i saw the photos and the videos and the press releases and like most ordinary citizens my first question about the x concept is what the heck is that exactly is it a crossover that is a sport utility vehicle built on the chassis of a car yes it doesnt look like a conventional suv however the roofline has a fastback arc that looks like the designers went to bed dreaming of nissan zs or old ferraris a coupe then the concept has four doors which to americans generally means sedan bmw calls it a "sports activity coupe " in keeping with the hybrid theme the concept vehicle had a gas electric hybrid powertrain bmw is developing a hybrid powertrain for real in a partnership with general motors corp and daimler ag the x which will go into production for real at bmws spartanburg s c factory within the next year illustrates just how finely auto makers are slicing and recombining their traditional product niches in the scramble for sales and consumer attention remember about years ago when the car business was simple there were sedans that came in small medium and large or rather "full size" models some cars came with just two doors some companies sold pickup trucks for farmers and tradespeople if you had a family perhaps you bought a big station wagon or one of those funky international harvester travelalls or a chevy suburban or a conversion van hippies and other nonconformists bought vw microbuses or bugs and a few folks tried out those cheap little cars that were coming from japan so simple so quaint so yesterday todays market is a kaleidoscope of segments that are splintering into niches and fracturing again along lines of price form function and technology the industry hasnt gotten to the point that every car sold is unique a segment of one but its working in that direction at least in terms of what consumers see frankfurt offered a gaggle of tiny cars jumping into the niche that bmws mini brand and the smart car had to themselves for a little while toyotas tiny iq concept had a face that might have been inspired by something from a tropical aquarium fords verve concept was a more conventional looking take on the mini car fiats cinquecento not available in the u s is the mini car as retro fashion accessory fiats web site boasts that the fiat can be had in combinations thats headed toward an individual fiat for every customer every year another trusty constant thats not looking so certain the internal combustion engine general motors used frankfurt to show off yet another variation of its "e flex" electric drive concept this time a hybrid electric drive mated to a liter diesel this was europe after all diesel hybrids are a long way from being economically viable especially in the u s where there are no significant tax incentives for diesel as there are in europe already customers can choose between several different kinds of "hybrid technology " plus engines that burn fuels blended with ethanol or reprocessed cooking oil or diesel fuel or natural gas and in very limited quantities hydrogen another sign of the times is the sudden widening of the spectrum of prices car makers think are realistic for their wares go back a decade or so cars costing over &# were exotic rarities executives at some auto companies complained that there wasnt much oxygen above &# now the worlds wealthy will have to expand their personal staffs to keep track of the price and selection available above a mere &# at frankfurt lamborghini turned heads with a model called "the reventon" that sells for million euros thats euros not downtrodden u s dollars &# million lamborghini says it has orders for the reventon represents an effort to redefine exclusivity ferrari s p a has a similar aim in a different way with its ferrari scuderia a variant of the f the scuderia also unveiled in frankfurt is a pound car with a horsepower v motor and technology ported from ferraris formula program thats one horse for every pounds of car by comparison a corvette z has one horse for pounds a toyota camry v has one horse for every pounds on the other end of the spectrum soon could be indian cars costing around &# alfred p sloans strategy for general motors in its heyday was to provide a car for every purse and purpose he probably didnt mean that literally his successors in the auto industry seem intent on making his vision come true send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
