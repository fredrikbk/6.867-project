real time readers endorse switch to apple former windows users offer tales of why they switched to a mac online edition last weeks column on pondering a new pc and the possibility of throwing over windows for apple brought in a tidal wave of forum posts and email and more evidence that the consumer pc market is turning in apples favor email after email came from people who had recently switched from windows to macs or were planning to do so once os x alias leopard comes out next month by the way why not stick with the working names for operating systems theyre always cooler and many of those emails came from people who were longtime dedicated windows users including engineering types who had resisted what they saw as apple hype another theme that emerged from my correspondence vista was the final straw for a number of windows users microsoft has a problem on its hands there i know looking through an inbox is anecdotal evidence but there was an enormous amount of it of which the letters below are a small sample yes there was a reverse wave of folks suggesting linux building my own pc or staying the course and getting a game console but it was a small ripple against the tide thanks to everybody who wrote in with their experiences by way of brief update ive put off my pc decision for a bit ive eliminated the mac mini because it doesnt seem capable of running dual monitors something ive come to rely on quite heavily this is disappointing because id liked the idea of simply plugging my existing gear into a new box and because the price of a mini is far below that of an imac im definitely considering the imac but ill wait for leopard and paying &# for a new pc at least because you know ill want the inch imac and the fastest processor and the most ram makes this a decision to be mulled over a while longer but like so many correspondents i sense an apple takeover of my computing world i havent tried vista and ive always been fairly happy with my dell machines but in last few years the world has changed and i cant think of a compelling reason to stay on the windows only side of it on to the letters as always theyve been edited well start with the switchers david maccallum writes i found myself in your exact same predicament about four months ago ever an early adopter i found that windows vista left a bitter taste in my mouth i thought "is this is the best microsoft could do in five years " it was slower and more unreliable on my p ghz pc with gb of ram i started down the path towards a new dell with vista when i came across some articles about macs and their ability to run windows and seamlessly switch back and forth nearly instantly i took the plunge in april bought a mac pro desktop and have been extremely happy some things work much much better than on a pc while some things are not as good but very close it does take a couple of weeks but once you get the hang of it there is no looking back oh and in those four months with the mac i have not had a single application or operating system crash jeremy ferguson writes with ipods doing so well i figured i would look into apple computers after jumping on one in the apple store i became hooked everything just worked it has been about nine months now and i absolutely love this machine there is nothing like it i dont regret ever using windows i am just upset about how long it took me to realize this andrew farro writes as a former windows user i can tell you wholeheartedly that you must switch to mac if you want to experience the joy of being "wowed" by a computer again i took the plunge about months ago with a inch imac after many years of thinking about a switch and how refreshing this plunge was if you can survive the first two weeks of having a mac you are set for life after seeing my mac five friends and counting have now converted as well bob pollack writes i had been a loyal pc user for almost years most recently two events occurred the first was my year old daughter purchased a mac laptop the second was the appearance of vista my daughter had a minute learning curve and was off and running not one minute of difficulty i brought vista home to what i thought would be a happy home but found myself on the verge of placing my new laptop on the target range and using any and all ammunition i could acquire to put it and me out of our collective misery my new mac laptop and i are having quite a romance with the addition of parallels using windows xp i can run any microsoft products i still need my learning curve was a bit longer than my daughters but i feel that the minutes i needed was not too bad i strongly urge you to make the switch you will live happily ever after with your mac and your pc less world zen chu writes eighteen months ago my xp system experienced a os corruption from which it never recovered thankfully i had backed up regularly but still it was an incredible pain instead of rebuilding i took the opportunity to buy one of the first macbook pros from apple it has turned out to the best tech decision ive made in a long time total cost of ownership including software has been much lower and time spent scanning for viruses has been replaced with more time with my kids i did rebuild my windows laptop just in case but very rarely need to boot it up im amazed when i occasionally look at my uptime stats often i have not rebooted the laptop for over a month i recommend macs now for power users and my mom alike demetrios tsipras writes my wife and i were "fortunate" enough to have a backpack stolen on our last vacation who knew vancouver was so sketch among other things it contained a spankin new dell laptop to be honest we were a bit relieved neither of us cared for that thing vista is a mess the laptop crashed within five minutes of turning it on the first time there was a conflict with pre installed software vista is a resource and battery drain it accesses the hard drive for every task and you know that mac ad with the secret service looking fellow "allow or deny " lets just say its distressingly accurate we replaced that laptop with a new powerbook we love it its so intuitive simple and pleasing to the eye that youll wonder why youve ever bothered with windows im ashamed to admit that ive been following the herd all these years we have two dell desktops both about five years old they both run xp and have been acting up recently were going to replace them with a top of the line imac and if youre worried about playing video games get a wii thats what i did forrest macgregor writes i have been building computers since they were made from individual ics and many most of my engineering tools are still pc based however when i am frequently asked to recommend someones next pc i unhesitatingly blurt out "apple without a doubt " anything you can possibly think you are giving up by choosing an apple is vanquished by what you are getting by switching to mac "switch enjoy gloat exalt recommend " that is evolution under a mac banner compare it with "settle puzzle tweak complain bitch upgrade patch replace " that seems to better describe the windows universe w brennan carley writes i recently found myself in a similar situation with an aging dell running windows xp with two kids and a wife who all make heavy use of computers for school and volunteer work i had to buy another computer i have been using pcs since dos started my career writing pc operating systems for ibm and some of my code wound up in os and allegedly in windows so while i havent written a line of code in about years i know more about pcs than the average consumer but i found myself wasting too much of my time being a systems administrator for my home computer the whole family has ipods and the kids are comfortable with macs from school so i decided to consider mac i wound up buying a macbook pro for my wife and an imac for the kids six months earlier i had bought a new dell for my mother in law and spent a full day setting it up installing patches to windows and rebooting uninstalling craplets and rebooting installing antivirus and rebooting installing patches to the antivirus and rebooting etc setting up the macs took minutes each done my wife and kids shifted to the macs without a hitch after that experience and with the dell behaving increasingly flaky i decided to cut the cord there are some little things that still frustrate me like the way the keyboard shortcuts work etc but i am now mac at home it works i spend much less time having to fiddle with computers everything integrates nicely and i would never contemplate buying a windows pc again a few readers had alternate ideas and some reported happy experiences with vista mike clark writes last december i too sat with my dell pondering the digital "fun time" passing me by because my machine couldnt cut it i splurged a little and ended up with a dell dimension gb ram mb graphics card gb raid hard drive dual tv tuner inch flat panel monitor and i installed vista ultimate it was surprisingly affordable and for me its an incredible upgrade for the first time ever i can play mmorpgs at high resolutions with sound keep up with the crowd and enjoy the immersive effects and thats only the beginning with vista ultimate which i like a lot i get media center my computer is now my dvr and i can burn a program to cd to enjoy on other tvs in the house or at the cottage ive got vistas speech recognition which im learning to use to relieve some of the stress on my hands and im learning a foreign language i havent tackled movie editing yet but its only time before i do im also learning how to stream my media center content to other computers in the house and to wherever i may be don frankenfeld writes i have used mostly apples since and have watched as apples once huge advantage has nearly disappeared mostly because bill gates has incorporated steve jobss innovations the apple and pc platforms have converged to the point that there is not much practical difference even pre loaded pc craplets are also pre loaded on apples including an annoying road test of microsoft office apple still leads in terms of design but their product quality is good but not great and their support is downright awful i am on my fourth round of applecare phone calls which have not cured my new imacs propensity to crash about half an hour after it has been booted a weak point for apple is the lack of specialized software a strong point is that an apple can run both platforms for me having invested thousands of dollars over the years in apple software the intel apples dual nature provides an avenue for a gradual switch in usage ironically from apple to pc since you are already on the pc platform my advice is to stick with it tom ferrell writes before getting that new pc i would do the following back up all of your documents videos digital photos and everything you want to keep put them on dvds or better yet buy a cheap small external hard drive or a network drive and copy them to it the little external hard drive will be useful in the future for backups optional max out the ram on the old pc ram is very cheap now compared to how much it cost in the hard drive and the memory will cost you a hundred bucks or so if you are diligent reformat your old hard drive reload windows do all of the windows updates reload all of your essential programs except for virus protection run msconfig and minimize what you are loading on startup move your documents back in a more organized fashion now see how that old machine runs my guess is it will seem like a new fast machine to you i was happy to see that some folks shared my fond memories of ibms ancient portable pc and its apparently indestructible blue bag i took my ibm bag to the beach two weeks ago about the th time its been overstuffed with books and clothes and miscellaneous gear of course it came through without a complaint forget outliving the machine it once contained i have no doubt this bag will outlive me marj remland writes i was in charge of budget consolidation at a major division of at&amp t and we had two of those portable ibm pcs in the mid s it did allow us to do some work at home and i used to consolidate huge financials in lotus on that machine the calculation was so slow and the spreadsheet so big it took minutes to run the consolidation it took about minutes on the desktops we had in the office definitely not the good old days wonder what happened to the two that my division had along with the inch floppies tom glaab writes gotta love that blue ibm bag i still have mine in a closet and the pc luggable is down in the garage even though it hasnt worked for a decade the computer was mandatory at the virginia tech college of engineering in and after the novelty of dragging the beast home over break wore off the blue bag continued to make the trip filled with laundry got any further thoughts on a new pc and the choice between windows and apple join me and other online journal readers in an ongoing discussion on the real time forum or write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont
