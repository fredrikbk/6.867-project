rate cut what to know where to be with interest rates likely heading lower investors need to consider how to best position their portfolios for the shifting economic landscape most economists expect federal reserve policy makers to cut short term rates at their meeting tuesday in response to the shake up in global credit markets and the risks that poses to economic growth such a move will have broad implications for all sorts of investments from stocks to commodities to currencies rate cut expectations helped buoy the stock market last week with the dow jones industrial average rising and the nasdaq composite index gaining for the year to date those benchmarks are up and respectively in past decades stocks have often performed well after the fed starts cutting rates but investors should remember that that hasnt always been the case lower rates can help accelerate the economy since they make it easier for consumers and companies to borrow and spend which is good for corporate earnings and stocks but the simple fact that the fed is forced to act means the economy is in trouble bad for stocks if the fed acts tuesday it will mark the first cut in that bodys target interest rate since the fed dropped it to in june a year after that as a weak economy reaccelerated the central bank started boosting rates by quarter percentage point increments stopping in june after increases since then policy makers have left the rate unchanged at now troubles in the subprime mortgage market have raised havoc in many corners of the financial world boosting the odds of a rate cut the fed has already acted to inject cash into financial markets by cutting the discount rate it charges for direct loans to banks but many economists expect the fed to take a more significant step by cutting its target for the fed funds rate charged on overnight loans between banks the fed has embarked on rate cutting programs times since world war ii in the six months after the first rate cut of those periods the standard &amp poors stock index gained an average better than the average calendar year increase since but the s&amp p fell in four of those times in the latest rate cutting cycle which began in january the s&amp p fell in the six months after the first move looking one year out from initial rate cuts stocks have an even better record gaining of times with an average climb the single exception was when stocks tumbled following the enron and worldcom scandals the dot com meltdown and the sept terrorist attacks a bear market lasted until october which stocks perform best after rate cuts "growth" companies with strong earnings growth such as technology companies have tended to do better than "value" stocks that appear cheap based on their price earnings valuations looking at the seven rate cutting periods since before which s&amp p doesnt have a growth vs value breakdown growth stocks in the s&amp p have gained an average in the initial six months while value stocks have gained to be sure every cycle is different this time around some analysts think financial stocks such as banks which are typically seen as value stocks may be a good bet if the fed lowers rates financials have taken their lumps lately amid worries about the impact on their earnings of the subprime mortgage meltdown and the slowdown in the corporate buyout market their fortunes could turn with lower rates which will make it easier for banks to make loans "financials are the sector that could get the most pop from rate cuts " says jeffrey kleintop chief market strategist at lpl financial services mr kleintop doesnt recommend specific stocks but he says he likes money center banks that have lots of cash on their balance sheets that can help them take advantage of buying opportunities as the economy recovers examples of giant banks are citigroup c and j p morgan chase jpm rate cuts may also cause the dollar to weaken further against other currencies since lower rates make the greenback less attractive last week the dollar hit its lowest mark on record against the euro largely due to expectations for rate cuts if the dollar continues to weaken that should boost the earnings of companies with large overseas operations since theyll get more pop from the currency translation thats one reason why marc pado a market strategist at cantor fitzgerald likes big technology stocks not only are most tech stocks growth stocks but they sell many of their wares outside the u s mr pado also thinks currency trends should help multinational corporations such as caterpillar cat and general electric ge which get roughly half their revenue outside north america what about commodities while a slowing u s economy is bad for commodities such as oil or steel as a rule since it crimps demand solid growth overseas in countries such as china and india has kept commodity prices elevated indeed last week crude oil rose to an all time high gold prices have also been marching higher a weak dollar could also push up prices of certain commodities including oil and gold that are often priced in dollar terms investors who dont want to invest directly in commodities might consider an oil company such as exxon mobil xom or a gold miner like barrick gold abx this time around one big question for investors is how long it will take before rate cuts stimulate growth some economists worry that lower rates will do little to fix the housing market and if commodity prices stay high that could put pressure on consumer spending as well as boost inflation the labor department said the economy lost jobs in august for the first time in several years the combination of high energy prices lingering housing problems and a teetering labor market could hurt the economy more than most investors expect of course the fed would likely respond to such a gloomy outcome with more rate cuts the question is whether those cuts will be enough to keep the economy from dipping into a recession in which case there will be few places to hide email forum sunday wsj com
