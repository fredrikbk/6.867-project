love &amp money so much to do not enough time sometimes something has to give in recent months my familys life has started to burst at the seams my year old son has two minute soccer practices a week multiple soccer games on weekends and a lot more homework now that hes in fifth grade my year old daughter has started dance classes my wife amy is increasingly busy at work as an administrator for a new medical center thats growing quickly ive taken on a book project im rewriting another authors book and amy and i are now doing a weekly love &amp money video im not complaining but rather offering the context to explain a decision amy and i recently made after weeks of discussion were selling our rental house weve owned the house a bit less than two years but we now find we no longer have the time to properly manage the property because changes in our daily life have made dealing with our side business all but impossible its a fate common to lots of families operating businesses alongside their primary careers you reach a point where you realize that you cant devote the necessary effort to your business you then face a choice either your business falls apart or your family life amy and i bought our rental house in january a s era two bedroom bungalow in the oldest neighborhood in our hometown of baton rouge we originally invested there because the area is gentrifying quickly we went into this affair with the expectation that wed generate some nice income on the side and slowly build some wealth over the years as the value of the property increased and it was all playing out as expected the monthly rental income exceeds our all in costs by more than earning us more than &# a month the value of the house meanwhile has climbed decently in the time weve owned it better still we found the perfect renter never late with the payments he maintained the house and yard and the only issue he ever had was locking himself out one evening requiring me to spend an hour driving there and back to let him in it was too good to last and it hasnt our renter who leased the house about three months after we bought it sent amy an email saying that his roommate was leaving the renter could not afford the rent on his own but loved the house and didnt want to leave so he offered to buy the house initially we werent inclined to sell but then we started talking about finding a new renter the last time it took three months requiring numerous trips to the house to meet prospects we barely had the time then we definitely dont have that time now our work schedules combined with soccer and dance practices and homework leave very little free time during the week our son is slated to play more than soccer games between now and mid november so our weekends are booked i also ran some numbers in case we decided to hire a property management company to handle all of this i concluded that wed actually generate greater income taking the accumulated equity from the sale and sticking it in an online savings account although wed miss out on some tax benefits and any further appreciation so the thought of replacing our renter caused us to rethink our knee jerk rejection of his purchase offer then a funny thing happened as we started to talk about the possibility of selling the rental house we realized that this was more than just a by the numbers discussion it was easy to figure out what path made the most sense financially for the long term at some point though the conversation shifted to what we want to do with our lives right now and how that fit in with the decision about the rental property specifically amy started talking about working part time she wants to be more involved in our kids school homework and extracurricular activities at a time when it would be beneficial to them as it is now she feels shes giving short shrift to everything in her life including her job weve been talking about hiring someone to pick up our kids from school we arent on the route for the school bus as well as hiring someone to help clean the house amy hates the idea of doing either even though she knows it would make our lives easier these are things shed like to do if only she had the time thats why shes thinking about cutting back her work hours and while im not keen on having relocated to louisiana for her career only to have her want to now scale it back im beginning to see that having her manage our daily obligations with the kids and house makes a lot of sense in terms of family tranquility as well as my own ability to maximize our income before embarking on that path though i told amy i want financial security while we have some emergency cash scattered about the vast bulk of our assets are in real estate and retirement plans none of which are liquid i want liquidity the knowledge that we have nonretirement account money immediately available to draw on in the event of a financial emergency such as the loss of a job i told her i want to bank an amount of money equal to one year of my salary in an account that we can easily draw on if anything ever happens to my job in particular ive done enough financial reporting in my life to know that the people who best survive the lean times are those who best prepare during the flush times the equity from the rental house leaves us flush and will put us close to my mark then well direct into this account our monthly savings putting us at or above our goal in nine months to a year giving amy the time she needs to determine how best to create the part time position she wants in her chosen career its certainly not what we expected when we bought the rental property but changing circumstances make you re evaluate your situation closing the door on the rental house opened a new door to a possibility that can improve our life in ways beyond our pocketbook jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at www lovemoney wsj com
