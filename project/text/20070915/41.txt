hot topic hispanics and the gop between and the republican share of the hispanic vote doubled to more than only to fall in last years midterm election to less than the most recent polls show hispanics breaking for democrats over republicans by to what gives to understand this remarkable erosion of latino support for republicans look no further than the most recent presidential debates while gop candidates debated the urgency of erecting a fence from california to texas along the mexican border democrats debated in spanish on univision to reverse current trends the gop need not resort to ethnic pandering which is the lefts metier but republicans would help their cause tremendously if the party at the very least adopted a welcoming stance toward latino newcomers people arent going to listen to your message unless they believe you care about them ronald reagan didnt regularly receive a third of the hispanic vote by sounding like mitt romney or fred thompson on immigration tone matters in politics and getting people to vote for you is easier when youre not likening them to islamic terrorists or implying that latino men are hard wired for gang banging unlike blacks who have hewed to democrats in large majorities for decades latinos are proven swing voters and republican energies would be better employed trying to win them over instead of trying to capitalize on ethnic polarization to win gop primaries theres precedent here in the mid s after california governor pete wilson embraced proposition which denied education and health care benefits to the children of illegal aliens latino support for republicans fell to from and gop support among asians and women declined as well some conservatives insist that its only the illegal aliens who have earned their wrath but when the target of scorn is the mother or brother or cousin of someone here lawfully that becomes a difference without much of a distinction politically moreover tom tancredo the pied piper of restrictionists in congress wants a "time out" on all legal immigration and hispanic voters are wise to the fact that its not because he thinks there are too many italians in the u s republican pols may decide to follow mr tancredo lou dobbs fox news populists and obsessive bloggers down this path but its likely to lead to political defeat hispanics are now about of the electorate but theyre projected to become by and one quarter of the total u s population by the political reality is that going forward hispanics will have to play a bigger and bigger role in keeping the gop competitive nationally its hard to see how republicans have any hope of building a permanent majority if hispanics start voting for democrats in the percentages that blacks already do colorado nevada new mexico and arizona all boast heavy latino populations and are states that a gop presidential candidate probably has to carry unless he can pick up states on the west coast or in the northeast that republicans havent won since the s president bush won nevada colorado and arizona twice al gore won new mexico in but it switched to mr bush in in part because the president did well among the states large hispanic population which brings us to a final somewhat ironic point about these political and demographic trends republican strategists led by karl rove ken mehlman and matthew dowd took note of what was happening long before their democratic counterparts as recently as democrats still viewed latinos as voters they could take for granted the assumption was that as with blacks perfunctory appeals to past discrimination would suffice to win them over john kerry ran no significant campaign in hispanic communities and rarely traveled to the southwest but it turns out that of hispanic voters are foreign born and grew up speaking spanish not nursing racial grievances thats an increase from in and most of mr bushs gains among hispanics in came from this cohort the point is that republican principles economic or cultural are not lost on hispanics who are hardly wedded to one party even if some conservatives insist this vote is lost to them and its no coincidence the democratic convention will be in colorado where hispanics are of the population president bush proved that the gop could make significant inroads with latinos and smart governors like rick perry in texas and jeb bush in florida have also shown the political wisdom of avoiding anti immigration appeals its unfortunate that other republicans including most of mr bushs would be successors seem so eager to help the democrats make up lost ground
