airbus in turnabout bets on composite frame for a in a switch that could make airbuss next jetliner more competitive with rival boeing co s new dreamliner the european plane maker plans to build the frame of its planned a model from advanced composite materials instead of metal the lighter structure similar to that of the boeing plane reduces fuel consumption increases a planes range and reduces wear on key parts such as landing gear the shift also cuts the need for costly maintenance inspections for months airbus had been telling customers that attaching skin panels made of carbon fiber composites to an aluminum alloy skeleton was superior to boeings method of making both the frame and fuselage of the dreamliner from composites but airbus a unit of franco german european aeronautic defence &amp space co began to rethink its position after encountering resistance from customers who questioned whether the a would be more difficult to maintain than the dreamliner "we thought the design we had was very good but this one is even better " said john leahy airbus chief operating officer for customers airbus officials say the switch will offer crucial weight savings an airbus spokesman played down the change as "just part of the normal refinement" that occurs when an aircraft is being developed airbus told potential customers of the plans during a recent update on the a program airbus intends to complete its designs of the a late next year it expects to deliver the first a in although boeing recently said it expects as much as a four month delay in the planned first flight of the dreamliner the chicago based aerospace company still is hoping to deliver the first dreamliner on schedule in may airbus has faced public pressure from several key customers throughout the design of the a after encountering criticism for first proposing the plane in with a more traditional all aluminum fuselage airbus said in july that it was renaming the airplane the a xwb for extra wide body those plans called for making the skeleton of aluminum and the skins of composites even though some aerospace engineers warned that such a combination could set the stage for corrosion and would require extra attention john plueger president and chief operating officer of leasing titan international lease finance corp which had criticized airbuss plans to use the aluminum frame said he believes airbus is making the right decision "this is what we were hoping for " mr plueger said "were getting more and more interest in the plane from our leasing customers so the sooner airbus can get it to market the better " j lynn lunsford contributed to this article
