weekend journal travel my extreme safari stalking leopards on foot crouching yards from a lion to win jaded travelers operators ditch the land rovers and take tourists on controversial tracking tours londolozi south africa the sun hasnt yet risen its a freezing winter night and were warming our hands on cups of coffee as we listen for the roar of lions two skilled trackers next to me hold high powered rifles to make sure we dont inadvertently end up on the dinner menu of any animal we encounter as the sun comes up the trackers find the footprints of a female leopard and her male cub a few steps away is a violet spot no bigger than a dime and some blond hairs snared on top of a heap of buffalo dung these signs lead the trackers to conclude that the leopard has killed a bushbuck which is a small antelope and dragged the carcass away were off on foot into the bush to follow her trail a conventional safari might be an exciting experience but what im doing now is positively heart stopping its a controversial tour called a tracking safari following dangerous animals on foot instead of by vehicle the way most safaris are run despite the risks tracking safaris are an increasingly popular option in south africa for those who yawn at the thought of sitting in a vehicle and twisting dials on a camera tracking safaris were relatively rare a decade ago now a growing number of the countrys game lodges offer them many more will take guests on a tamer version often called a walking safari which focuses on viewing birds and flowers and small mammals at one big operator cc africa nearly a third of guests go on walks of some kind during their safaris the safety concerns are sobering operators say they employ a variety of safeguards from extensive training for guides to lengthy briefings for guests on how to behave in the bush although there is no central record keeping authority to chart safari deaths and injuries at least people have been reported killed or injured while on foot during safaris in africa in the past decade "quite honestly i wouldnt do it " says rob little conservation director of the south african branch of wwf an international environmental group i experienced a few adrenaline fueled moments myself including a lion sighting i also learned that some aspects of these trips arent for everyone they usually require getting up before dawn and can involve walking for hours between travel costs and lodge fees some safari trips cost upward of &# and theres no guarantee youll catch a glimpse of the so called big five animals most tourists want to see rhinoceros buffalo leopard elephant and lion for me watching animals interacting with one another and with their environments was such a unique experience that it was a highlight of many years of travel tracking added a new dimension to observing wildlife in nature learning about an animal from nothing more than a few signs on the ground and watching the experienced guides and trackers practice a highly sophisticated art form that was entirely new to me "in a vehicle you dont see whats happening on the ground " says brian serrao operations director of the field guides association of southern africa "you can come across birds nesting edible plants insects reptiles or a hyena den " tracking safaris are creating a demand for skilled trackers that is reviving a dying art in rural south africa where sons have traditionally been taught the essentials by their fathers that creates badly needed jobs in otherwise deeply impoverished areas tracking tours are mainly centered at the private game reserves that dot south africa in east africas famed serengeti national park guests are barred from leaving vehicles for safety reasons says moses busyanya a serengeti park ranger the field guides association which tests and certifies both guides and trackers estimates that of its members have earned the qualification necessary to conduct walks thats double the percentage of two or three years ago trackers must pass a series of written tests and are assessed in the field they must be able to interpret wild animal behavior have first aid skills and be proficient with weapons renias mhlongo one of the trackers who led me on the leopard hunt first learned his art as a small child when his father who had a herd of cattle put him to work tracking errant cows "he said to me you dont get anything to eat until you find the lost cow " mr mhlongo recalls "i was years old " when he took me to visit his home village of dixie i saw how quickly life can change just a short drive from some of the worlds most luxurious game lodges dixie has no water because its inhabitants cant scrape together the funds to buy diesel fuel for the pump to get water the villagers have to walk or hitch a ride to a town more than a mile away mr mhlongo and the three other trackers accompanying me on the leopard hunt display such skill that it alleviates the tension i feel walking as silently as possible through the bush for my own protection i am instructed to stay between the two trackers carrying the rifles while they know from the tracks that the leopard is ahead of us theres always the possibility we could unexpectedly come across a lion or other animal sleeping in the dense underbrush if an animal charges us "the worst thing you can do is run " one of my guides warns me "stay still and be completely quiet well give you hand signals if we want you to back up " since game reserves give the local communities the economic incentive to keep the land and the animal populations pristine and since the reserves can prove more profitable than the alternatives of mining or farming environmentalists see safaris as an overall plus as for tracking "my experience in south africa has been that guides are incredibly respectful of wildlife " says levi norton director of ci sojourns the travel arm of virginia based conservation international "they keep a distance so it wont change the animals behavior " most south african safaris use specially modified land rovers with the tops removed remaining in the vehicle is considered safe says alex van den heever londolozi game reserves land manager and himself a tracker "there is no reason why an animal would want to risk itself fighting with a car " a human in the bush becomes part of the ecosystem in what is literally a dog eat dog world if we unexpectedly come across a lion or leopard with a cub or a herd of breeding elephants we wont be ignored mr little of wwf says the biggest danger comes from elephants the notoriously aggressive black rhinos and the other big five animals he says the preference of wwf would be to have walking safaris outside the big five areas where the danger would be lower "wild dogs cheetahs and giraffes are just as charismatic to see " he says brian courtenay a south african insurance broker who handles safari injury claims says an american woman was killed last year when tourists left their vehicle to take photos of a distant herd of elephants they inadvertently walked past a lone elephant hidden in the bushes and it charged them for my trip i had to sign a standard waiver acknowledging the dangers from "wild and dangerous animals " for their part lodges say they take all possible safety precautions vehicle accidents comprise the most common insurance claims stemming from safaris according to andy dougall managing director of crawford dougall insurance brokers one of south africas largest insurance brokers for game lodges the cautions taken at londolozi helped allay my fears i wasnt allowed to walk from my room to the dining hall at night without a security guard who went ahead of me shining a flashlight into the shrubbery in my two mornings of tracking i learned that the art involves far more than following footprints "some people say tracking was the first time humans were forced to use deductive reasoning " mr van den heever told me before we set out "if you see a leaf with dew on it over the track you know the track is old birds have a regular call and a call theyll make when they see a predator monkeys have different alarms for different predators giraffes and kudu a kind of antelope standing absolutely still and staring into the bush is a sure sign that something is there " before i flew to londolozi from johannesburg in one of the small planes that make the puddle jumps between south africas largest city and the game lodges dave varty the owner of londolozi gave me a briefing tracking takes "a special kind of guest " he said "they have to understand the rules you wont see the big five there are hours of boredom where you might see nothing and it could be dangerous it takes a particular kind of person who can go halfway around the world and be prepared to spend a day seeing nothing " for me walking in the bush was itself a thrill the veldt vast expanses of grassland punctuated by bushes and scattered trees is otherworldly and among the dozens of species of animals and birds that populate it something interesting was always in sight the trackers didnt allow much time for contemplation the first morning they followed the trail of a large male lion as if it were a white stripe painted down the center of a highway we walked only about minutes before we saw the lion around yards away the closest the trackers would allow me to get then we tracked some white rhinoceroses which are less dangerous than the black variety again coming upon them in short order nothing prepared me for the tracking of the leopard the second morning the signs we encountered every one of which i would have missed had i been walking alone revealed details of a dramatic story first there was the spot of blood and the hairs of the bushbuck telling of the kill by the leopard then a section of the road where the dirt was smooth with a bird track on it the smooth portion indicated the leopard dragged the bushbuck the trackers explained the bird was a francolin a type of partridge that is most active in the early morning this meant the leopard had made her kill the night before after that we left the road and walked into the bush trying to be quiet the trackers pointed into a tree i had no idea what they were looking at but they later explained it was a piece of the bushbucks stomach the leopard and her cub had climbed the tree carrying the bushbuck so they could feed on it without fear of an attack by lions or hyenas when they had eaten their fill they dragged the carcass back down leaving a piece of stomach hanging from a branch the smell of that stomach would attract predators diverting them from the rest of the carcass which the leopard had hidden in the bushes then probably only a few minutes later but what seemed much longer given the tension created by our silence a noise combining chewing and snorting the leopard was feeding on the carcass on the other side of a clump of bushes and a ravine the snorting was her attempt to blow out the hairs that got into her nose while she was feeding thats as far as were going the trackers signaled me a leopard with a cub is not to be approached on foot so we hiked back to our land rover and drove into the veldt as if they were following a highway map the trackers located the leopard in minutes we sat and watched trip planner south africa how to get there south african airways
