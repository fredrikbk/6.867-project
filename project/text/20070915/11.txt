business insight a special report expanding the hour workplace round the clock operations arent just for call centers anymore in henry ford introduced the concept of three eight hour shifts to achieve round the clock assembly in an automobile factory today we are witnessing the advent of hour knowledge factories spreading out across the globe with clusters of three or four facilities each six to eight hours apart was an idea first limited to hour call centers and support staff for global communications networks now thanks to more robust information technology and a growing acceptance of offshoring the concept is feasible for a much broader range of work in fact while offshoring today is done primarily to reduce costs the author believes that over time growth in offshoring will also be fueled by the potential to achieve drastic reductions in turnaround times for major endeavors another asset of the hour knowledge factory the ability to tap highly talented designers who would otherwise have to move to a different country or work at odd hours of the night the result is that whereas once a big time zone gap was seen as a hindrance by companies with far flung operations now it is increasingly seen as an asset software developers using the model for example have reported completing projects in far less time than when personnel were based in one site regardless of the location the main productivity boosts come from focusing more and continuous brainpower on a task as well as allowing necessary approvals and testing to take place overnight so that the developers can pick up the next morning where they left off making such a hour knowledge factory work to its full potential however still poses formidable challenges among them designing it systems that deliver reliable and close to uniform service to teams around the world organizing work so that teams in different locations and different shifts can share the same task with minimum interaction and finding ways to adapt the model for more industries and complex working environments what follows is a look at the major barriers to building a hour knowledge factory and suggestions as to how they can be overcome for knowledge to be passed efficiently between locations it has to be structured in a way that each shift can be quickly brought up to speed with advances made by the two previous shifts in other words individuals should be able to learn in minutes what took their colleagues hours to accomplish the key to this is a strong it system the information technology used to transmit the knowledge must be user friendly across cultures and job levels and be reliable across network irregularities business processes and information systems in each location must be aligned so that the work can always continue at the same level of functionality competence and transparency an online repository of information accessible to all groups can be a big help not just for the work in progress but for future use as well a prototype of just such a repository designed by the authors research team at the massachusetts institute of technology was used in a satellite design project for a u s government agency designers from a private contractor and representatives of several u s agencies at different sites used the system to make incremental changes in the plans on a daily basis agency representatives in turn used the system to evaluate the designers work and to provide feedback in a structured manner that enabled immediate utilization by the designers all without having to interact on a real time basis one representative claimed that the prototype allowed him to complete a particular task in one fiftieth of the usual time there were two main features to the systems repository an ability to capture the different stages and rationale behind the work in progress and tools to mine for useful historical data for example the system automatically read and recorded users keystrokes to capture documentation for future users helping to guide similar work for years to come also to serve current needs the prototype could recognize if a user was trying to design say a fuel tank and then automatically present related data about fuel tank designs such features can be helpful when teams at different sites are working on their own in general a successful it system for sharing knowledge among multiple sites and teams should focus on four overriding principles acquisition the system should be able to gather all knowledge necessary whether it is already online on paper or microfiche for individuals to do their work without having to contact persons who previously worked on the same task discovery have an online capability to mine not only the companys own databases but the web itself for numerical textual pictorial audio video and other types of information that can assist the work at hand management the system must be able to deal with various dissimilarities in semantics formats and other types of language and cultural differences that invariably exist when inputs have to cross over national organizational and other borders dissemination knowledge in the system must be extracted customized and directed to appropriate departments and users based on their individual needs time spent explaining something or trying to reach a consensus especially when the discussion takes place over a great distance is time taken away from the task for this reason employees must be able to do their work with a minimum of interaction among sites teams of roughly equal size to prevent one from becoming dominant should be established at each site and assigned to a single task this keeps the work flowing hours a day having multiple sets of eyes in each location also reduces the likelihood of errors which can hold up other teams when they begin work on subsequent shifts to assist in the process of breaking down and organizing the work of a hour knowledge factory researchers at the university of arizona have created an internet based prototype software program called multimind the program starts with the premise that in most disciplines large tasks can be broken down into progressively smaller subtasks until the stage of "component" is attained this implies a task that can be completed by a designated group without requiring input from a different group or department a group responsible for a component is subdivided into smaller groups in each of the three time zones that work on the shared task during their allotted shifts in a continuing experiment in which multimind is being used to confirm the efficiency of so called tri site production teams of students and faculty at polands wroclaw university of technology the university of arizona in tucson and the university of technology in sydney can all work on a single task with each shift picking up where the previous one left off their work can then be compared with results from a similar task performed by a team at only one site results so far indicate that work is more efficient and faster when it is shared among the three teams making the work proceed round the clock is one obvious advantage but the experiments researchers further suggest that the workers on each shift are motivated in part by the progress of the previous shift in another experiment conducted at international business machines corp researchers sought to compare the performance of two software development teams over a week period one working in a single location the other divided between the u s and india the two teams were virtually identical in all structural respects but the two site team resolved tasks twice as fast in some cases thanks largely to its overnight capability an unintended benefit was noted as well because the team was split between distant time zones and thus communicated in written form the rationale behind its decisions and a detailed history of its work were automatically recorded in the it database this study was carried out with assistance from ibm by the author and by satwik seshasai a doctoral student at mit for now most organizations taking advantage of the hour production model are involved in highly structured work software design for example employs very systematic procedures and thinking call centers for their part involve work that is heavily scripted leaving little room for creativity however the notion of hour productivity is slowly catching on in more sophisticated and less structured work including endeavors in medicine logistics product design finance accounting and law physicians in the u s for example dictate patient notes to a digital recording device which is then used to transfer the recordings to the internet home based trained personnel abroad then listen to and transcribe these dictations into text that is transferred back to the doctors based on the amount of notes received each day even each hour the number of transcribers working can change the global hour productivity model can work well in cases where workers are autonomous like the records transcribers or semiautonomous if workers only occasionally need to consult others with more expertise but in complex work environments where workers are heavily interdependent and decisions by one raise questions and issues for many others the hour models current business methodologies and technical tools need improving one example of a company pushing the boundaries of the knowledge factory beyond software and other highly structured industries is r r donnelley &amp sons co this chicago based company is primarily a printer and provider of printing related services but with its acquisition of india based business process outsourcer office tiger donnelley has added such services as financial analysis accounting and asset pricing research for investment and corporate banking firms most of the jobs performed by the business process unit have to be completed in less than one day often donnelleys business process clients complete part of the work and hand over the rest to donnelley analysts the companys business process unit has a physical presence in the u s india sri lanka europe and the philippines to coordinate all of its business process services donnelley uses a proprietary it system called ttrack which was developed by office tiger ttrack provides a platform that allows multiple teams in dispersed locations to work on the same processes and to hand over tasks in a graceful manner some to of the companys business process services must be accomplished in less than an hour and require close interaction between its clients and its employees typically donnelleys business process workers and the clients they support use the same files the same sets of data and the same spreadsheets the nature of this work allowing close interaction between the company and its clients at a high strategic level and at a minute to minute operational level is what mainly separates ttrack from a system like multimind while conventional factories traditionally have employed workers from very similar backgrounds and national origins globally distributed production can draw on workers from many different cultures backgrounds and perspectives such a paradigm should in theory help a company produce services and products with greater appeal in the global economy but in reality accomplishing this goal remains a major challenge for many companies the benefits of such diversity will apply not so much to the kinds of highly structured work already being performed with the hour model but in more complex operations where interaction is necessary indeed more work needs to be done on complex online work environments in which workers are heavily interdependent and make decisions that involve many other team members if you are designing the next car for example a decision on one part has ramifications on many other parts to handle the needs of a decentralized work environment new knowledge based methodologies are required the hour knowledge factory also has the potential to gather and quickly react to customer feedback from around the globe processing such feedback on a hour basis and putting it quickly into action could speed up improvements in products and services but most organizations are not geared to efficiently handle such continuous inputs action usually is deferred until the working day begins in the location dedicated to the task in question nevertheless just as the advent of machines led to hour operations and more productive manufacturing the evolving era of hour knowledge factories will lead to higher productivity in an increasing number of business and technology sectors and as the knowledge factories adapt to tasks of increasing complexity this trend will accelerate dr gupta is the thomas r brown professor of management and technology at the university of arizona he can be
