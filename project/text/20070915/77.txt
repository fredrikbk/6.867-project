web tracking outfit comscore inc regulation microsoft ruling will put eus teeth to the test by charles forelle come monday a throng of reporters and lawyers will descend on the grand duchy of luxembourg to listen to a judge at the european court of first instance read a few sentences of a ruling the proceeding will be over in minutes its echoes will last far longer the case in question is microsoft corp v commission the software giants appeal of the european unions antitrust action and fine against it it is also the most significant test in recent decades of europes tough jurisprudence when it comes to market dominant companies european law affords the european commission the nation blocs executive arm a wide berth to punish companies that abuse their dominant market positions to stifle competition but the commissions powers havent been fully tested the microsoft case presents a powerful opportunity for the court to make a sharp statement marking its turf particularly in the high technology industry where intellectual property considerations might bump up against antitrust concerns in after more than five years of investigation the commission found that microsoft had flagrantly run afoul of abuse of dominance rules by bundling its windows media player with the windows operating system and by keeping secret the communications protocols needed for competitors machines to talk to microsoft servers "what is at stake is whether microsoft can regulate the market by imposing its products and services on people or whether the market is allowed to function properly " said jonathan todd an eu spokesman the eu imposed a fine of &# million later rising to &# billion the largest ever handed down in an abuse of dominance case the eu also demanded that microsoft split the media player from the operating system its done that and it ordered the redmond wash company to disclose the protocol specifications whether its done that in full is a matter of dispute the chief questions before the court are whether microsofts actions do actually constitute abuse of dominance and whether the fines and remedies are appropriate what will likely matter most is not the fines unpleasant but hardly debilitating for a company with &# billion in cash and short term investments on its balance sheet or the remedies but what sort of guidance the court gives about future regulation of microsoft in particular and dominant companies in general if it fails before the court the eu will sustain a serious blow to its regulatory regime raising questions about exactly what should fall within its purview it if prevails it could be emboldened to keep the heat on microsoft and fellow big tech players other outstanding investigations of microsoft including one focused on its office software are percolating and the commission has also begun proceedings against chip giant intel corp one thing is nearly as certain monday wont be the end either side or both if the decision is split can appeal to the eus highest tribunal the court of justice investment banks investors await the numbers by susanne craig its going to be bad the question on every traders lips just how bad tuesday the same day wall street is hoping the federal reserve will cut rates brokerage house lehman brothers holdings inc will kick off the third quarter earnings season for the major investment banks lehman will be followed by morgan stanley bear stearns cos and goldman sachs group inc later in the week for years the big firms have been minting money thanks to a strong stock market and aggressive expansion into areas such as hedge funds leveraged buyouts and trading this quarter though is one wall street would rather forget homeowners with risky or subprime mortgages have been defaulting in droves as their interest rates have adjusted upward the ripple effects have been massive firms like lehman do everything from originate mortgages to individual consumers to package them up and then sell them out in pieces for big profit to sophisticated investors the market for these mortgage backed securities has dried up the buyout boom another cash cow for fees is unwinding internal hedge funds which powered earnings quarter after quarter are now doing the reverse as a result shares of the brokerage firms have taken a beating the dow jones wilshire u s financial services index is down this year and stocks of firms such as lehman and bear stearns which have the biggest exposure to the mortgage market are down and respectively this year in nyse composite trading one big issue to watch for the firms are holding bonds and loans that are worth less than they were a few months ago the value the brokers place on these instruments will go a long way in dictating earnings this quarter firms dont typically release a lot of information on how individual holdings are priced or repriced but analysts will no doubt grill executives on it in short some firms may mark down their holdings and take a bigger hit now other firms may wait hoping the market improves if the situation doesnt improve the firms that waited will have to spread the losses out over a few quarters investors expect bear stearns which reports thursday will be the hardest hit firm analysts polled by thomson financial are predicting the firm will earn &# a share down from &# a share in the year earlier period to say bear has had a rough quarter is an understatement two internal hedge funds that had made bad bets on the subprime market imploded leading to as much as &# billion in investor losses the debacle spurred the ouster of the firms co president who oversaw bears asset management division in addition revenue from other mortgage operations is down lehman is another firm to watch its woes arent on the scale of bears but it has been forced to scale back its mortgage operations amid the subprime turmoil and has cut mortgage related jobs in recent months one point of interest investors are wondering how lehman will fare in its leveraged financing efforts a business that skyrocketed during the buyout euphoria of recent years but is now under pressure as the cost of borrowing rises lehman has debt commitments for a number of significant deals investors recently have shied away from such deals or demanded higher interest rates and that could leave lehman and other banks to fund the deals themselves the sleepers so far are morgan stanley and goldman sachs which are scheduled to report wednesday and thursday respectively both firms have experienced some losses in recent months and investors will be watching for details on bets the firms have made with their own cash but generally the two companies are more diversified so they may not get pinched as much as bear and lehman analysts say
