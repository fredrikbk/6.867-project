weekend journal books writers block longing for mother russia collected stories of ivan bunin translated by graham hettlinger ivan r dee pages &# questions hover around the name of ivan bunin who exactly was he why did his great fame fade are his literary works so little read now in the west wine that no longer travels well or wine that has in fact gone sour the first question is the easy one bunin was born in into the russian nobility a class in decline czar alexander ii had freed the serfs in by centurys end bunins beloved way of life that of the refined country gentry was being swept away by the crude capitalism depicted in by chekhov in "the cherry orchard " then came the much cruder bolshevism that seized power in during the civil war of bunin was in ukraine editing an anti bolshevik newspaper with the bolsheviks defeat of the white army he fled to constantinople and then to western europe finally settling in grasse france he never returned to russia and never took any foreign citizenship exile was good for bunins reputation had he stayed in russia he could have written for the "desk drawer" at best and probably would have ended up in a labor camp instead his poetry and fiction gained a wide audience in the west and was lauded by other writers including d h lawrence andre gide and thomas mann in bunin was awarded the nobel prize in literature unused to riches and generous to a fault he went through the prize money in no time he died poor and forgotten in at age stalin also died that year and bunins work began to be published at home even though bunin wrote almost exclusively about russia exile seemed to feed his inspiration as we see in "collected stories of ivan bunin " some of his most famous stories and novellas were written in the early and mid s their tone is often tragic and elegiac their subject a way of life that can exist only in memory and in the artifacts of culture bunins tales are short on event and long on description amounting to an almost obsessive attempt to conjure the world as he knew it as graham hettlinger the translator of this volume nicely puts it in his introduction "bunin like proust and nabokov seeks not so much to tell a story as to recreate experience " if an author chooses not to capture your attention with the then what then what of plot he must charm the ear and delight the eye bunins prose in mr hettinglers translation does neither though the translation is graceful and essentially accurate the pleasing musicality of bunins original does not survive some of the problems are small and odd such as mr hettinglers using the phrase "i give you my honest word" when what is clearly meant is "word of honor " more important the flow of the narrative is continually interrupted by untranslated russian words that one must look up at the back of the book instead of employing the perfectly normal "indian summer " for instance the translator inserts the russian original babye leto the storys spell is broken not that bunin himself is always spell binding his visual depictions of nature and rural life in russia for example are not particularly vivid "high above the house visible in snatches through the trees a sliver of the nascent moon hung like the severe sharp blade of a scythe in the skys blue transparent void " a line or two like this goes a long way and in bunin we can get whole pages of such lyric weather reports many of his better tales are erotic dramas of fierce or casual romance that wind up in despair or suicide "mityas love" ends "he felt the cold and heavy mass of the revolver and deeply gladly sighed then opened his mouth and pulled the trigger hard pulled it with delight " a betrayed husband in the tale "caucasus" does mitya one better holding pistols to both temples and then firing but the most moving suicide is the one that doesnt happen in "the elagin affair " a soldier and his lover make a murder suicide pact but once he kills her he is so overwhelmed by grief that he cannot take his own life ironically the bunin story most likely to be remembered and anthologized outside russia "the gentleman from san francisco" has nothing to do with the authors native land a wealthy american believing that "this beautiful and evil world" exists for his pleasure takes his family on a grand tour of europe but during the luxurious sojourn he suddenly dies and as bunin writes death "even to this day astounds us more than anything " death renders the gentleman from san francisco outre his family is rousted from the hotel room where he died for fear that future guests wont rent it even his corpse is treated with disdain it is placed in a wooden case for english soda water written nearly a century ago just after the sinking of the titanic but before the russian revolution the story still resounds as a powerful memento mori the sad news is that bunin the poet of times passing did not himself pass the test of time mr lourie is a columnist for the moscow times his novel about the betrayal of anne frank "a hatred for tulips " has just been published by st martins thomas dunne
