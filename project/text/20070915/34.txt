gates cites his goals for cuts in iraq force washington defense secretary robert gates said it is his "hope" that the u s might be able to reduce the size of the u s force in iraq to about troops by the end of but he warned that predicting such reductions so far into the future is difficult "my hope is that when he does his assessment in march that gen david petraeus will be able to say that he thinks that the pace of the drawdowns can continue at the same rate in the second half of the year as in the first half of the year " mr gates told reporters friday both president bush and gen petraeus the top commander in iraq have said they want to continue troop reductions beyond next summer when u s force levels are expected to fall to about to troops from about currently both have declined to say how quickly reductions might proceed beyond that mr gatess statement which came in response to a reporters question toward the end of a pentagon news conference didnt appear to be planned but it could help shore up support among moderate republicans on capitol hill who have expressed concern that the cuts announced so far by mr bush and gen petraeus arent aggressive enough and would simply take the u s force in iraq back down to levels before this years "surge" of additional u s troops into that country if the cuts suggested by mr gates take place in late the next president would inherit a force that is significantly smaller than any since the invasion in mr gates cautioned that any drawdown would depend on improving security conditions in iraq but he suggested that u s commanders would like to be able to withdraw about five brigades of combat troops from july next year to january each brigade has about soldiers but is accompanied by combat support units that also would withdraw asked if that would leave roughly troops in iraq in january mr gates deadpanned "that would be the math " mr gates also suggested that as troop numbers in iraq shrink the u s forces would alter their mission to one that "probably" looks like the plan offered up by the bipartisan iraq study group chaired last year by former secretary of state james baker and democratic lawmaker lee hamilton under that formula u s troops would focus on counterterrorism training iraqi forces and providing security on the border mr gates didnt say how long it would take for u s troops to assume this role sen lamar alexander r tenn recently has championed legislation that would make the baker hamilton commissions report the official strategy of the u s government in iraq democratic presidential candidate sen joe biden meanwhile called the bush administration "phonies" for suggesting that a modest withdrawal of troops from iraq is the result of progress rather than a strain on the force
