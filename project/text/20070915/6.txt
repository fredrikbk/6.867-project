pitting its two founding partners against each other the dispute is playing out in delaware chancery court where founders saul fox and dexter paine are bickering over everything from each others hiring practices to the way a &# million gulfstream jet was financed business associates say the spat runs even deeper reflecting years of hidden frustrations on both sides as a lucrative partnership turns sour in an email exchange this summer the year old mr fox portrayed himself as the firms lead partner generous to a fault in providing his younger colleague with "the opportunity of several lifetimes " he accused the year old mr paine of repaying him with "deceptions unkept promises penuriousness and efforts to undermine my authority " mr paine lashed back friday in his countersuit filed in the delaware court he called mr fox "increasingly erratic and neglectful in his oversight responsibilities" at their firm he said mr fox missed the firms monday meetings for more than consecutive weeks he added that mr fox has chosen to work almost completely at home and has entered the firms foster city calif offices on only days in the month period ended july in their suits each partner accuses the other of usurping authority each asks the court to rein in the others ability to control the firm when the two men teamed up in their future looked bright mr fox had been a partner in the high powered private equity firm of kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co looking to start his own shop mr paine had been a commercial banker and private equity investor as well consultants urged them to work together telling them that institutional investors would be thrilled to back a two partner shop where the founders brought complementary skills the two men had crossed paths intermittently since when mr paine helped mr fox line up bank financing to buy motel lp a profitable deal it didnt take long for them to decide to go into business together within months fox paine had raised a &# million fund for acquisitions in the firm raised a second &# billion fund that fund has produced an internal rate of return of a year according to the oregon public employees retirement system which is a limited partner while fox paine isnt nearly as big as corporate takeover titans such as kkr it has became known for its deal making ingenuity in finding profitable approaches to situations that other private equity firms wouldnt touch its investments have included an alaskan phone company a cayman islands reinsurer an israeli oil reserve mapping company and advanta netherlands holdings bv a european seed company david buckeridge a former advanta chief executive officer says that even in fox paines early years it was clear that messrs fox and paine were "very different personalities dexter is great at details gregarious and extremely hard working " he explains "saul is demanding and intellectually very strong hes not a guy who works hours a day " mr buckeridge says that for advanta the two men supplemented each other well other ceos however say the partnership had begun to fray by the time they started dealing with fox paine liane pelletier the ceo of alaska communications systems group which was once owned by fox paine says she worked almost exclusively with mr paine when she was recruited to run the company in october she says mr fox was "a titular board member i didnt get any engagement from him about our operating statistics he just occupied a chair " mr fox left the board soon afterward in mr paine wanted to raise a new acquisition fund from institutional investors but mr fox didnt they reached an awkward compromise that let mr paine launch what became known as the fox paine iii fund without mr foxs active involvement in return for the use of his surname mr fox got a interest in the new funds general partnership which usually is the most lucrative part of such funds structure the fox paine iii arrangement fueled new tensions between the founders mr paine transferred all the firms employees to the fox paine iii payroll mr fox protested that he was being stripped of the support staff that he needed to monitor fox paines older investments mr fox attempted to hire his own chief financial officer mr paine protested that any such hiring should be done jointly soon almost any topic became fair game for dispute in a june email mr fox ripped into mr paine for having their firm borrow &# million so that the younger partner could have a gulfstream iv jet "for your exclusive use in effect mortgaging away my of the firm for your personal benefit " people familiar with that transaction say mr paine quickly rearranged it so that fox paine wasnt liable for the loan mr paine had a different set of gripes about airplanes in his court filing friday he upbraided mr fox for acquiring a costlier &# million gulfstream jet earlier this year and involving fox paine peripherally in the financing of that transaction even though lenders dont appear to have any recourse against fox paine mr paine voiced indignation that he hadnt been formally consulted on that deal in his filing mr paine portrays mr fox as semiretired mr fox has set up the saul fox national center for ancient glass in israel and has helped support other archaeology projects mr fox also has expressed interest in forming a medical expertise clearinghouse as a business of his own but mr fox in his filing says he still sees himself as ceo of fox paine and blames mr paine for undermining his role at the firm a rare point of agreement for the two men is a deep wistfulness about the erosion of their friendship in a june email mr fox said he wanted to see "if we might craft something that cements us back together before forever throwing in the towel on what was a most fabulous business association " on friday both messrs fox and paine declined to comment publicly on their dispute mr fox has hired attorney philip howard of covington &amp burling and the public relations firm dilenschneider group inc to argue his case mr paine has engaged attorney eric goldstein of paul weiss rifkind wharton &amp garrison and the pr firm rubenstein associates inc
