firms the fifth firm merrill lynch &amp co has been largely ignored since it doesnt report its third quarter results for another month that changed friday morning when merrill made a securities filing in connection with a pending acquisition that reminded investors that merrill best known for its "retail" brokerage for individual investors has significant exposure to the same areas of the mortgage markets that have been hit hardest this year merrills disclosure knocked its stock price down by as much as &# or before it recovered to finish down just cents at &# in p m new york stock exchange composite trading merrill said that credit market conditions "have continued to remain challenging in the third quarter " requiring the firm to make "requisite fair valuation adjustments " the upshot merrill may well take markdowns that will hit its bottom line on the value of its inventory of mortgage securities investors are watching to see how wall street marks its own books as a barometer of the health of both the securities firms themselves and the markets as a whole in giving this new update merrill repeated a paragraph from an earlier filing that talked of the adverse impact on "the subprime mortgage market including certain collateralized debt obligations securities backed by pools of mortgages or other assets as well as other structured credit products" and leveraged finance the filing highlighted investors concern about merrills exposure to cdos and subprime mortgages which have borne the brunt of the decline in mortgage markets and where merrill has become a player thomas lawler a housing economist in vienna va said some of his clients "have questioned whether merrill and other wall street firms had really been marking down their subprime related security holdings especially their cdo holdings to a fair market price" as of the second quarter merrills announcement also "renewed concerns among investors" about whether the other firms that report next week will also see their results affected by such hard to value positions said brad hintz an analyst at sanford bernstein &amp co merrill made the disclosure in connection with its planned &# billion cash and stock acquisition of first republic bank a private bank serving the wealthy which becomes final on sept many wall street firms have become big players in mortgage markets but merrill was late to the subprime party merrill has been the no underwriter of cdos since managing &# billion in new issues including &# billion in and &# billion this year according to dealogic which tracks new issues and in january it closed on a &# billion acquisition of first franklin a subprime mortgage business helping it gain the top spot only very recently in subprime underwriting as well although merrill has said that subprime mortgages even with first franklin account for less than of its revenue the relative lack of impact of the mortgage market downturn on merrills earnings for the quarter ended in june raised questions among analysts at the time the analysts quizzed merrills chief financial officer jeff edwards on july about merrills mortgage related exposures and even whether merrill had changed its valuation methods mr edwards replied that some of the positions were marked based on "actively observable markets " and others were marked based on valuation models and judgments the valuation question for all big wall street firms has since taken on even greater importance to the markets because of investors fears that valuation markdowns may hit their bottom lines and questions about whether the firms are "taking all their hits " as one analyst put it in fact examiners at the securities and exchange commission are checking a number of big firms including merrill to see whether methods they use to value their own holdings are consistent with those used by their lending operations to calculate collateral required of clients merrill was a lender to hedge funds operated by bear stearns cos that were shut down after their mortgage assets declined in value as of june merrill said it held "retained interests in securitized assets" of &# billion up from &# billion at the end of merrill said &# billion of that current total was in the residential mortgage area merrill has said it has hedged some of its exposures analysts already expect merrills third quarter profit to fall to &# billion from &# billion in the third quarter of not counting a year earlier one time gain those expected results would be a decline from &# billion in the second quarter according to thomson financial among firms reporting third quarter earnings in the coming week are goldman sachs group inc morgan stanley lehman brothers holdings inc and bear stearns since the start of july analysts earnings projections for third quarter profits have fallen by for bear for lehman for morgan stanley and for goldman sachs according to thomson financial which tracks wall street research in the same period estimates for merrills third quarter profit have actually risen many cdos backed by subprime mortgage bonds have dived in value in recent months with much of the decline taking place since mid june some analysts estimate that prices of mortgage related cdo bonds have declined anywhere from to since the start of the year
