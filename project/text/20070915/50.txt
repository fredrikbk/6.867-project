missouri judges its court plan a success in response to your aug editorial "show me the judges" does the wall street journal know whats best for missourians despite your allegations that something is amiss with missouris non partisan court plan it continues to be right for the people of missouri the non partisan court plan is the least political way of selecting judges it attracts high quality judges and it gives the voters the final say when each judge stands before them in retention elections missourians face an unprecedented effort to discredit our states court plan and politicize the selection of judges last year money started flowing from out of state sources into a contested circuit court judicial election in missouri now more money from unknown sources is funding negative political ads against the court plan the citizens of missouri support the plan and the judges who have been appointed under it for the nearly three quarters of a century that the plan has served our state only two nonpartisan judges have lost their retention elections it has worked during democratic and republican administrations and has been free of corruption the federalist society poll that you cited in your editorial also noted that of missourians had trust in the supreme court of missouri perhaps the absence of million dollar judicial elections and a reputation of providing fair and impartial decisions contributed to this trust you further state "trying to get politics out of politics is a fantasy exercise " but the alternative politicizing the process of selecting judges is at the least folly and at the worst an exercise in destroying public trust and confidence in the judiciary c ronald baird president the missouri bar springfield mo your editorial misses the mark in its criticisms of merit based judicial selection plans in missouri and across the country as the first organization to propose a nonpartisan alternative to judicial elections in the early th century the american judicature society has studied and supported judicial nominating commission plans nationwide the facts speak for themselves no state that has amended its constitution to provide for merit based nomination and gubernatorial appointment of judges has returned to a contested election system and for good reason judicial elections are spiraling out of control with enormous sums of money negative campaigning and partisan and interest group influences determining the outcomes of far too many races as the justice at stake campaign notes in "the new politics of judicial elections " business aligned interests outspent attorneys two to one in the latest state high court elections contrary to the myth your editorial perpetuates that judges are "beholden to the wealthy trial lawyers who are their biggest campaign donors " merit based judicial selection systems which place the focus squarely on professional qualifications and fitness for the bench provide the appropriate balance between independence of the judiciary and accountability to the rule of law and the people through periodic retention elections any movement away from these systems will only erode the standing of state judiciaries and damage public trust and confidence in the fairness and impartiality of the courts john r tunheim president american judicature society des moines iowa see related letter "letters to the editor judicial selection plans" wsj sept
