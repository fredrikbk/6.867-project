whos afraid of voter id last week a federal judge in georgia upheld a state law requiring photo identification to vote courts have upheld similar laws in indiana michigan mississippi and arizona the trend is encouraging and as u s district judge harold murphy noted in his page ruling arguments that these laws disenfranchise minorities dont hold up to scrutiny "voters who lack photo id undoubtedly exist somewhere " wrote judge murphy "but the fact that plaintiffs in spite of their efforts have failed to uncover anyone who can attest to the fact that he she will be prevented from voting provides significant support for a conclusion that the photo id requirement does not unduly burden the right to vote " the ruling is also significant because judge murphy a democrat had rejected a previous version of the law as unconstitutional likening it to a "poll tax " the version he signed off on last week provides free photo identification to anyone who requests it and voters who show up at polls without proper id are permitted to cast provisional ballots a decision upholding indianas voter id law is being appealed to the supreme court civil rights groups considering appeal in georgia might first check out a new report on voter id statutes by david muhlhausen and keri weber sikich of the heritage foundation the report is a state by state comparison of the effect of identification laws on voter turnout and it concludes that "in general respondents in photo identification and non photo identification states are just as likely to report voting compared to respondents from state that only required voters to state their name " that holds true for black white and hispanic voters photo ids are already required to cash checks and board planes among other things if such requirements can also help protect the integrity of the ballot all the better the only people harmed are voters attempting to skirt the law and the political party they tend to support
