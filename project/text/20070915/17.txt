business insight a special report think big to win market share dont try to influence what brand of product people buy change how they use the product in the first place in todays fast moving marketplace companies typically compete by improving their products in small ways they make them visually more attractive or more reliable or less costly maybe they tinker with the marketing the result is predictable competitors make a countermove and in the end market share moves slightly if at all in thinking small though companies miss out on the chance to win big instead of trying to influence what brand people buy they should be focusing on what people buy real innovation involves creating categories or subcategories with distinctly new value propositions they change the competences and strategies required to compete and at their most powerful transform markets by making competing products irrelevant the prius hybrid for example developed with new technology from japans toyota motor corp has made other cars irrelevant for some buyers and has helped toyota establish itself as a leader in industry efforts to make more environmentally friendly cars often important innovations come from smaller companies whose success with a new idea can catch much bigger competitors flat footed todays beverage arena for example has undergone dramatic change in recent years thanks largely to innovations by smaller players in the sector indeed pepsico inc and coca cola co missed out on much of the high growth in sports and health drinks through the s and s focusing instead on their long established dueling colas for much of that time among the big winners that coke and pepsi eventually were forced to acquire were gatorade bought by pepsi as part of its acquisition of quaker oats co in the odwalla line of juices and other health drinks which coca cola acquired in and sobe formerly the south beach beverage co a maker of juice blends and teas purchased by pepsi in while creating new product categories and subcategories is not always possible and can be risky research has shown it produces far greater rewards than sticking with the tried and true in two professors at the french business school insead made a study of business launches over a recent five year period some of which represented innovations that went beyond incremental improvements in an existing market space the study by w chan kim and renee mauborgne found that those produced of the revenue and of the profits for the entire group so how does a firm identify or better yet drive these real innovations without depending on technological breakthroughs here are some ways augment the offering with a feature or service that consumers will regard as essential westin hotels a

delivered consistent high quality coffee in a social and aesthetically pleasing environment the japanese beer market provides a detailed and dramatic look at the ability of real innovations to affect a market for the past decades the market has been hypercompetitive with roughly four to new product introductions each year aggressive advertising packaging innovations and sales promotions yet during this period the market share trajectory of the two major competitors kirin brewery co and asahi breweries ltd changed only four times three were due to the introduction of new subcategories while the fourth was due to a repositioning of a subcategory this is an amazing commentary on what drives market dynamics the first of the three innovations to shake up the sector was dry beer first marketed as a distinct new segment by asahi breweries in kirin which makes kirin lager was the dominant brewer in japan from to with a steady market share of about over that period the brewer was closely associated with the rich somewhat bitter taste of its flagship pasteurized beer but the introduction of asahi super dry in offered a beer with a sharper more refreshing taste and less aftertaste the new product which contained more alcohol and less sugar than lager and a special yeast appealed to a new younger generation of beer drinkers dry beer was a phenomenon in just a few years as other brewers also started marketing it dry beer captured between a quarter and a third of japanese beer sales in contrast it took years for light beer to gain of the u s market the main beneficiary was asahi breweries which was perceived as the authentic brewer of dry beer thanks to asahi super dry asahis market share in doubled to more than while kirins fell to kirin unsuccessfully tried to push back with kirin draft dry in but having sold japans leading lager for decades kirin may have lacked credibility in the dry beer space asahi also managed to force kirin and other brewers to drop similarities in their dry beer packaging and commercial messages an effort that helped asahi emphasize its position as the authentic dry beer innovator kirin says that soon after introducing draft dry it shifted its priorities to meeting other consumer needs it had identified those attempts to create a new subcategory produced a hit the following year with kirin ichiban the markets second major innovation kirin in introduced a new and expensive brewing process that uses more malt filtering at low temperature and most important only liquid from the first pressing of the malt the resulting taste was milder and smoother than kirin lager ichiban presented a distinctly new value proposition a very different taste that involved a new set of assets skills and strategies to produce the cost of the process the power of the brand and kirins distribution clout presented major obstacles to competitors indeed kirins rivals so far have not duplicated ichiban despite its success asahi for its part says thats because brewers have wanted to pursue their own strategies and because they now well know the dangers of trying to copy a rivals successful innovation as happened with the scramble over dry beer in ichiban stopped the decline of kirins overall market share from to but in the period that followed from to asahi continued to build on the success of super dry lifting its market share eight points to just over asahi by now the only dry beer maker accomplished this by repositioning the dry subcategory with marketing that emphasized freshness being the no draft beer in japan and having a global presence kirin meanwhile struggled during this period with its market share falling nine points to around perhaps irritated by asahi super drys claim to having the no draft beer kirin converted its brewing process changed the brand name of kirin lager to kirin lager draft and tried to make it more appealing to a younger clientele in the process kirins image became confused and its core customer base disaffected kirin was able to halt further market share erosion in the late s thanks to a third innovation to cause a major shift in market shares happoshu beer a subcategory introduced by suntory ltd in that contains a lot less malt than most japanese beers and thus qualifies for a significantly lower tax rate the beers popularity was quickly established based on good taste at a low price the first happoshu hops draft created by suntory in ultimately proved little more than a footnote in the segment but the subcategory got traction in when other brewers entered the fray most notably kirin and its tanrei brand tanrei helped kirin hold on to its spot as japans top brewer from to as overall sales of happoshu increased to about a fifth of the overall beer market by early that same year asahi finally entered the segment but could not dislodge kirin in this category nevertheless thanks largely to the continued success of super dry asahi in passed kirin to become japans overall no brewer with a market share among japans five major breweries that asahi put at by kirin had taken leadership in the low malt subcategory with both tanrei and a no malt beer which had an even lower price as a result for the past few years kirin and asahi have each at times laid claim to being japans no brewer by market share for a different look at how powerful real innovations can be consider a brief history of the u s auto market in which a dozen or so innovations each changed the way consumers bought and thought of cars henry fords model t which in rolled off the first moving assembly line revolutionizing mass production the enclosed car an early winner being the affordable hudson essex in gms marketing strategy of combining multiple brands in one large corporation the ability to buy cars in installments making them more affordable automatic transmissions which made cars easier to drive rental cars creating a market for short term use fords introduction of the thunderbird an affordable two seat personal luxury car the volkswagen beetle a s icon of which more than million were sold inexpensive and reliable japanese cars of the s and finally the vehicles at the heart of three key market shifts since the s the minivan for its convenience suvs for power and hybrids for their better mileage and lower emissions the innovators behind each of these developments achieved above average profits that sometimes extended for years in particular the chrysler minivan which was introduced in late sold more than cars in its first year maintained leadership in the subcategory it invented for at least a decade and was a critical contributor to the companys survival other innovations that have supported high returns for companies that were early market leaders charles schwab corp s onesource a mutual funds supermarket with no transaction fees cirque du soleil the acrobatic group whose dramatics breathed new life into the circus business southwest airlines co which specializes in point to point no frills service home depot inc which sells advice and home improvement products for the do it yourselfer cable news network which put news on television and apple inc s ipod and itunes the music player and online music store that have helped rewrite the rules for marketing music the high returns that innovations produce are sometimes the result of advantages the innovator already holds entry barriers based on technology assets and expertise the loyalty of a customer base and an image as the originator of the innovation other times innovators extend their profits because their rivals are held back by the curses of success and size competitors in an established market for example may believe that participating in a new subcategory will cannibalize their existing business when chrysler invented the minivan for example its peers decided to protect their station wagon businesses rather than invest in a new line of vehicles chrysler on the other hand with a weak position in station wagons had little to lose alternatively big companies may believe that an emerging subcategory will be too small to materially affect their business such thinking held coca cola and pepsico back while the new health and sport drink categories were blossoming innovators need to be aware that their challenge is not only to create an offering and brand but to create manage and protect the perception of the new subcategory the ideal way is to make the brand synonymous with the subcategory the assumption should be that competitors are irrelevant because they lack visibility credibility and authenticity the inevitable result will be that the innovator is also considered the most relevant brand perhaps the only relevant brand for the subcategory dr aaker is professor emeritus of marketing strategy at the haas school of business the university of california at berkeley he is also vice chairman of prophet a
