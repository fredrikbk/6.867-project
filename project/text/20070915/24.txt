cross country hoosier jump shot indianapolis when mitch daniels was elected governor of indiana in his role models were republican governors jeb bush of florida and bill owens of colorado "they were both solid conservatives who were activists and had done big things " he told me now reform minded governors mark sanford of south carolina for one regard mr daniels as a governor theyd like to emulate gov daniels has been energetic and successful but his achievements have not come easily the most daring decision leasing a major toll road that stretches across the state to a foreign company for years prompted a wave of populist anger and drove down his popularity and that wasnt his most controversial move in his campaign for governor mr daniels vowed to adopt daylight savings time for six months of the year replacing what some in indiana particularly farmers regard as "gods time " indiana was one of three states that for decades had spurned dst as governor he ordered dst to be followed statewide provoking public protest mr daniels is an unusual politician in he turned down an offer to replace dan quayle in the u s senate after mr quayle had been elected vice president gov robert orr had been eager to appoint him mr daniels says "it wouldnt have worked " instead he stayed in indianapolis as an executive with eli lilly the pharmaceutical firm then in late he got a call from andy card soon to be chief of staff in president bushs new administration and was offered the job of either congressional liaison or domestic policy adviser mr daniels said no but agreed to run the office of management and budget "that was the one job i was interested in " he said mr daniels distinguished himself by clashing with republican spenders in congress sen ted stevens of alaska an earmark king groused to the white house about his penny pinching mr daniels quit in while driving home he called republican leaders in indiana to say he was going to run for governor in in june mr daniels opened eight bids for leasing the mile indiana toll road accepting the &# billion offered by a consortium of macquarie infrastructure group of australia and cintra the giant spanish construction firm the lease he insisted was "the right thing to do " since the consortium agreed to upgrade the deteriorating road add new lanes and install e z pass computer billing to keep traffic flowing through toll booths but polls found indiana citizens disapproved by a margin now months later mr daniels has been vindicated the money from the lease will pay for a year road building program that requires no new taxes or borrowing construction has begun on projects originally planned two decades ago had the state continued to operate the tollway and rely on the gasoline tax to pay for road work indiana would have fallen further behind in making critical highway repairs "the gasoline tax doesnt come close anymore " the governor said "the need keeps growing " in one year interest on the &# billion raised by the lease brought in roughly &# million more than the state earned running the tollway for a half a century mr daniels has also privatized thousands of state jobs and numerous state functions prisons used to cook their own meals by outsourcing food preparation he said the state is saving &# million a year "and the food got better " administration of the welfare program was turned over to an ibm led consortium with savings estimated by mr daniels at &# million over years he also refused to extend an executive order that had forced state employees to pay union dues once the dues became voluntary of the state work force stopped paying still conservatives are uneasy with mr daniels because he has supported some tax hikes he calls himself "a washed in the blood supply sider " but proposed as one of his first acts as governor a surtax on incomes of more than &# for one year "i made a mistake " he said "especially springing it as a surprise " as luck would have it the legislature rejected the tax hike and balanced the budget with spending cuts mr daniels also persuaded the city of indianapolis and seven surrounding counties in to raise their restaurant tax by to finance a new football stadium for the super bowl champion indianapolis colts "it was that or nothing" no tax no stadium he said the stadium is expected to be finished in time for the season this summer the governor proposed creating a new health insurance program for poor adults who constitute the "core uninsured " because he is financing it with a cent per pack increase in the cigarette tax the proposal drew fire from grover norquist of americans for tax reform mr daniels was undeterred arguing that the program will have the added benefit of reducing smoking its now awaiting only final approval by mr daniels old bailiwick omb "i know my supply side catechism " he explained in an interview with me "a consumption tax on a product youd just as soon have less of doesnt violate the rules i learned under ronald reagan " mr daniels was political director of the reagan white house from to now as governor mr daniels has his own set of political rules that include he implies like reagan going along with a tax hike when theres no alternative mr daniels is not the perfect model of a conservative governor but hes bold hes lured japanese companies to indiana notably honda and stirred a stagnant economy and hes privatized inefficient state functions despite union opposition and minimal public support other governors can benefit from what mr daniels learned the hard way dont propose tax increases when spending cuts are possible he is running for re election next year but not with much relish "i was never obsessed with holding office " he says that may be good because some conservatives dislike mr daniels democrats think there might be an opening to defeat him one leading democrat jim schellinger an architect in indianapolis has already raised millions of dollars to run against mr daniels and others are lining up to run as well so far its mr daniels race to lose its likely hell spend four more years being envied by his fellow governors mr barnes executive editor of the weekly standard is co host of "the beltway boys on fox news channel "
