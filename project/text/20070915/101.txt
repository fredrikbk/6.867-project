weekend journal sports golf journal the mad scientist of course design pete dye shuns computers doing everything by feel heres a look at his latest project pound ridge n y when i heard that pete dye the mad genius behind some of the meanest golf courses in the world was building a new course miles from manhattan i jumped at the chance to witness the monster at work a large percentage of golfers who play his most wicked creations such as the ocean course at kiawah island s c and whistling straits in wisconsin find them so tough they fail to post a score but still they line up in droves to pay their &# and &# green fees perhaps thats because mr dye still builds his occasionally eccentric courses by the seat of his pants eschewing many of the modern computer aided design techniques that his peers typically rely on and as a former scratch player himself he knows how to mess with good players minds mr dye was an early and controversial practitioner of "penal" golf architecture which forces players to hit drives and other shots into small target zones surrounded by sandy waste areas ponds and intimidating vegetation among his other fiendish innovations were the use of railroad ties to buttress bunkers and island greens most infamously at his tpc sawgrass course in florida at the pound ridge golf club here which will open next summer as a high end "destination" daily fee course the forested hills dictate something different than the links like style for which mr dye is best known "the rock outcroppings were our biggest problem we had to blast them out in a couple of areas " says jason ekaireb the golf operations manager who gave me a tour of the opening holes before we met up with mr dye and his son perry his design collaborator at the unfinished th some of the holes were already grassed and showed every sign of being impossible to play the fifth for instance is a par four of only yards but any shot hit into the tiny cantilevered green will have to dodge half a dozen ghoulish looking bunkers granite boulders seem to be mr dyes new railroad ties reclaimed from the site they are everywhere a vast outcropping immediately behind the par three th green was left intact mr ekaireb says that roughly half the balls that hit the outcropping will bounce back onto the green and half will ricochet "somewhere else " the man responsible for all this trouble was standing on the mound of what will soon be the regular th tee debating with his entourage whether a foot tall maple about yards out posed too severe an obstacle for everyday players "anybody dumb enough to play the hole from back there " he said sweeping an arm towards the championship tee yards further back "can try to work around it if they want to " finally mr dye rendered a verdict "we can cut it down later if it gets in the way but dont cut it down now therell be some bellyaching but who cares " mr dye wearing khakis work boots a blue golf shirt and unfashionably large glasses had flown in that morning on a private jet that ken wang the owner of the course and brother of fashion designer vera wang rented for him from his home base in indianapolis with his white german shepherd sixty a midwesterner by birth and disposition mr dye was once an insurance salesman and still talks a mile a minute using plain language and corny phrases like "the man upstairs " but often so distractedly that he doesnt finish sentences he comes across a bit like your favorite dotty relative "crazy uncle on the surface but dr no behind the scenes " mr wang said with a laugh "but there is a mathematical rigor to his work that really appeals to me nothing is left to chance " the big issue on the th hole was where to cut the left edge of the elevated fairway too close to the pond on the left and it would interfere with the line of sight from the tee to the green chase it too far to the right and the fairway becomes unplayably narrow the day before perry dye and mr dyes longtime chief "shaper " mike langkau who with a bulldozer crafts the contours of the course had tentatively formed the fairway line about feet left of where mr dye now thinks it should go "the thing is youve got to get out here and see this stuff and make these decisions on your feet " mr dye said never formally trained as an architect he calls excessive dependence on computer aided design "rubbish " pointing out that all the classic courses including nearby ones like winged foot and baltusrol were built essentially by feel he says his primary goal is to create a pleasing and surprising variety of looks and challenges why are his courses so hard "you might as well ask why people who are members of perfectly good golf clubs fly to scotland and ireland to play golf in the rain for a week and never come close to breaking " he said most of his designs are for destination resorts that people will only play a handful of times a year and difficulty seems to be what they are after "i dont understand golfers one lick " he said "personally if i couldnt break on a course id probably never want to play it again " email me at golfjournal wsj com
