former model and mtv vee jay has accepted the offer of a free car service so have actress mena suvari and pop star jc chasez that may not sound important but for the public relations firm working for rosa cha a brazilian beachwear line trying to build cachet in the u s its a coup providing a car is critical to getting famous people to an event says courtney routt a publicist who specializes in booking celebrities "once theyre in the car you know where they are and you can get them to your show " the success of a new look or a rising designer depends on many factors from placement on a reality tv show to good reviews from critics one lesser known but increasingly important element is the publicity machine designers rely on to stand out at fashion shows critical to those publicity efforts is filling the front rows with famous or semifamous names whose comings and goings draw coverage by gossip magazines and blogs ms routt is part of a burgeoning army of publicists who orchestrate details large and small as they help designers stage runway shows at least a dozen public relations firms now work behind the scenes before new yorks fashion week which ended wednesday similar efforts are already under way for the shows in milan and paris in coming weeks over the past few weeks we followed ms routt and other executives at alison brod public relations in new york as they logged hundreds of hours buffing rosa chas image before the labels minute fashion show this was the agencys first time working for the label which had a lot riding on the show the label was hoping to make a splash before opening its first new york boutique early next year ms routt spent weeks courting people she considers up and coming stars with promises of clothing private car transportation makeup application and hair styling services if they would attend the show "before you could just show up and do whatever you wanted at the tents " says president alison brod who has been working on fashion shows for six years "now even socialites want to be paid to go to the shows and they want free clothes " ms brod says she typically charges designers &# to &# for her firms services in addition to perks like free clothes or discounts for certain staffers she says the shows "arent hugely profitable " but help raise her own agencys profile and attract beauty companies liquor brands and restaurants among others as clients this past fashion week there are two a year the firm also worked on shows for high end designers jill stuart and pamella roland and a presentation for the alice + olivia label she says she limits the number of shows her firm handles to avoid stretching her staff of women too thinly larger firms handle half a dozen shows or more for the rosa cha show the guest list was scrutinized invitations mailed and rsvps recorded seats were assigned or standing room spots allotted to journalists retailers stylists and socialites with shifts continuing until moments before the show nearly beach bags were stuffed with press releases and beauty products another giveaway an unwieldy throw pillow had to be carefully positioned on the seats with the bags to avoid blocking the seat numbers even the invitations glossy lime colored envelopes that were selected by the designer required the publicists attention "this green was very present in my inspiration for this collection " says amir slama the brazilian designer behind the rosa cha label "isnt it beautiful " pam morris the year old account supervisor overseeing logistics at the rosa cha show agreed but just days before the color had presented her with a dilemma the size and weight of the invitation required postage of cents but the &# stamp had beige and maroon tones that clashed with the envelope she thought three cent stamps with brightly colored flowers would look better but chose the &# stamps because she couldnt justify the added cost the envelopes also were responsible for a delay in the mailing their glossy sheen resisted the glue of the mailing labels new labels had to be made this season getting celebrities to attend was harder than usual the mtv video music awards were scheduled for the next day in las vegas and the emmy awards in los angeles this weekend to manage expectations ms routt sent her colleagues a warning email in late july listing every nominee and presenter at both ceremonies they succeeded in convincing a castmember from "gossip girl " a new show beginning this fall on the cw network to attend but they were turned down by a model who didnt like the outfit the designer had sent her to wear to the show a lot of people turn down fashion show invitations ms morris figures only of invitees typically accept so for the rosa cha show she mailed out invitations even though she would have just seats two days before the show ms morris began assigning seats following a time worn industry hierarchy editors from important publications are seated in the front two rows those from regional magazines and newspapers usually sit farther back buyers from the same retailer are positioned near each other but far from the competition care is taken not to give junior executives better seats than their bosses around the firms airy offices decorated with framed pucci scarves ms brod requires employees to maintain a polished look she suggests that fingernails be manicured hair coiffed and makeup applied high heels should be worn especially to meetings tank tops and exposed lingerie are forbidden bronzer lipstick and hair products are available in the ladies room the mens room doubles as a supply closet "our clients are paying for an image " ms brod says even pony tails get a second glance "i have told my people to take the rubber band out of their hair and put on some lip gloss ive even given specific shade recommendations " not everyone makes the cut "a lot of people think that if they read us weekly and wear a cute dress every day they can do this job but fashion week weeds them out " says ms brod "you can never tell who has it in them the meekest girl ive seen shine as she manages photographers screaming at her " the night before the rosa cha show however the publicists scrapped the dress code by p m after ordering pizza they sprawled out on the hardwood floors in sweatpants flip flops and pony tails and began assembling the all important lists of invited guests seat assignments and backstage access into binders and clipboards "never let them see your clipboard " randi peck a fashion week veteran warned the uninitiated uninvited guests she explained often pretend to be someone whose name theyve just read off the list if someone tries to grab the clipboard "step back while putting your hand up to their face " she continues "tell them please respect my personal space and then ask for their name again " she recommends using a calm voice "if you yell they yell back " the day of the show ms morris dressed like her colleagues in a short black cocktail dress heels and a head set had her hands full with last minute emergencies when they learned an hour before the show that the labels taped to the back of the chairs listing seat numbers had an outdated rosa cha logo the alison brod team began frantically cutting off the logos there were also problems with seat assignments moetley crue bassist nikki sixx arrived unexpectedly and needed a front row seat ivana trumps guest needed to sit next to her rather than behind her estee lauder executive john demsey also needed a front row spot luckily for ms morris nicky hilton and her boyfriend who had been assigned choice front row seats wouldnt be attending leaving two key vacancies still she had to move fast in the days following the event the alison brod team has been collecting clippings and so far is pleased with the attention the label has gotten including mentions in the new york post womens wear daily and elle com "the clips just keep coming " says ms morris the alison brod firm also worked with producers from "the tyra banks show" on a behind the scenes look at the model castings the fittings and the backstage hoopla of the rosa
