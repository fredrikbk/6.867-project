weekend journal food &amp drink eating out a hard shell red lobster aims upscale with a new look and menu but hows the food red lobster is molting the venerable "casual dining" seafood chain is shedding or trying to shed its image as a down market kitschy outfit with long lines and unambitious food its new tv ad campaign is saturated with images of new england coastal authenticity and a message in which "fresh" is the theme this pitch is supposed to attract health conscious customers with fatter wallets who are able to withstand the higher price of driving to dinner red lobster started rolling out its new look sleeker stores with healthier menus in late july other national chains are also pushing a "gourmet" format with initial investment support from mcdonalds the "fresh mex " "fast casual" chipotle mexican grill chain expanded to over restaurants which feature an assembly line service system where the public choose ingredients and toppings as they and their surprisingly delicious tacos and burritos move toward the point of sale quiznos is promoting its steakhouse beef dip sandwich with "au jus on the side" in a new tv ad featuring the camera ready "chef zach " it goes on to show a clueless youth behind a competitors counter apparently at a subway store looking up au jus in a french dictionary perhaps the lad will discover that au jus is not a sauce at all but just menuspeak for pan juices to try the new refreshed red lobster for ourselves we headed to the pioneering red lobster rehab in a mall in inglewood calif just a short drive from the los angeles international airport this was our maiden voyage to the chain at the entrance we took it as a good sign that there were no lines but we took it as a bad sign that the prominently placed lobster tank was empty no lobsters the menu with a lighthouse an old fishing boat and a rockbound coast on its cover did list "a fresh steamed pound lobster" for &# or &# per pound this works out to almost exactly what we would have paid per pound &# for a pound live maine lobster at the much more ambitious ocean avenue seafood restaurant in truly upscale santa monica right on the pacific so we saved money and ate some of the other specialties the gumbo with peppy cajun andouille sausage and the generous all crab crabcake were serious grub on the other hand the tilapia cooked in a bag was certainly fresh but a bit dull in the flavor department ditto for the shrimp linguine alfredo a gluey version of a stunt pasta noodles tossed tableside with parmesan and heavy cream made famous by a roman restaurateur named alfredo in the previous century but otherwise unknown by that name in italy alfredo himself used to toss fettuccine with a golden fork in inglewood his signature dish had devolved into a tired ghost several weeks after our red lobster foray in inglewood we did score a lobster at a red lobster the very urban seat branch in manhattans times square here too the lobster tank was empty but at the bar we ate a passably tender pound lobster for &# the kitchen we were told by the harried man in sole charge of the seat bar area had run out of the smaller ones while we waited we ordered some "hand shucked" oysters they were by far the worst oysters we have ever eaten tasteless and with a strange cushiony al dente texture red lobster proclaims in its menu that it serves oysters treated in a sequence of hot and cold water baths to eliminate bacteria rife in the warm waters of the gulf of mexico this copyrighted ameripure process is the brainchild of ameripure co of franklin la which asserts on its web site that its gulf oysters are "raw" even after ameripurification but i will bet any amount of money that i can distinguish their dreadful product from untreated raw oysters in a blind tasting with accuracy of course i wouldnt be risking a liability suit as red lobster would if i got sick eating an unameripurified oyster at one of its branches ameripure indemnifies its customers against "bona fide customer claims of illness" caused by their oysters id just get sick but im willing to take that risk at upscale or downscale independent seafood restaurants that somehow manage to serve untreated oysters every day such places also almost always have the lobsters they advertise email me at eatingout wsj com
