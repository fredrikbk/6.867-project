the buzz marketwatch weekend investor gps device maker garmin shows how hard it is to spot growth stocks the trick for growth companies is trying to figure out when the growth is about to end that little exercise is more of an art than a science and has stung more than its share of investors who have either held on too long only to watch the stock price fall or made a prematurely bearish bet against a companys rising fortunes there is no better example of this than garmin ltd best known for its global positioning systems and portable navigation devices for more than a year the company has confounded critics who thought it was vulnerable to competition and falling prices which it is or should be but so far in the face of rapidly falling prices and mushrooming competition garmins performance has continued to set its own course with its stock more than doubling in the past year the company is doing so well that six weeks ago in reporting its last quarter management boosted earnings and revenue forecasts for this year "our products are consistently better easier to use and have better functionality that is pretty much the secret sauce " says investor relations director polly schwerdt so why in the face of this would anybody gamble that reality is catching up with garmin well for one thing while sales and earnings are forecast to be higher than original expectations the guidance for operating margin an important measure of how much money a company really makes was unchanged and by years end margins are expected to fall in the fast growing auto mobile sector which last quarter generated of garmins revenue that should be no surprise garmin hasnt been shy about telling investors on its earnings conference calls that prices for personal navigation devices part of the auto mobile sector are falling and will continue to do so according to market research firm idc this years average selling price is lower than last years and below s prices are falling so rapidly that morgan stanley analyst aaron husock believes that with component prices expected to rise second half earnings per share will miss analyst estimates but that is only part of the story the other part which is arguably more compelling has to do with competition and not just any competition but the stealth like growth of navigation software on cellular telephones an business that didnt exist several years ago it was spawned after the government required all cellphones to come equipped with some form of location determination equipment that led chip makers such as qualcomm inc to include global navigation technology in their chips while most u s cellphone services offer gps none is promoting it more actively than verizon wireless which offers monthly and day use rates while not disclosing the number of users lee daniels vice president for consumer product development says "we wouldnt be putting money into advertising if we werent getting a return on our investment " one hint of how well cellphone navigation is doing comes from closely held networks in motion inc which provides navigation software to verizon and others this year it forecasts million paid users of cellphone navigation software from all suppliers including itself that is roughly half the projected sales for all portable navigation devices an increase from one million users and a share in the bigger question is whether cellphone navigation devices are taking share from portable devices or boosting the entire market depends on the type of user says h p jin chief executive of telenav inc which competes with networks in motion "low usage people will prefer the cellphone " he says but both he and doug antone ceo of networks in motion stop short of saying cellphones will steal significant share from the likes of garmin "there will certainly be some of that " mr antone says "but the market is so robust so dynamic " that for now he believes both sides of the industry will continue to expand as for garmin ms schwerdt says her company believes cellphone navigation is "complimentary and in most cases not a replacement" for portable navigation devices at least not yet the trick for growth investors will be to figure out when if ever it will be herb greenberg is senior columnist for marketwatch he doesnt own stocks except those of his employer and doesnt sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of dow jones which publishes the wall street journal email hgreenberg marketwatch com
