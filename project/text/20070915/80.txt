the weekend interview with michael o leary my stupid business dublin theres a bit of p t barnum in michael oleary the chief executive of irish low fare air carrier ryanair hes pulled such stunts as driving a tank to a competitors headquarters to declare a price war and dressing up as the pope to promote new routes to rome most recently when britains advertising standards authority said ryanair was incorrectly claiming that its flights were faster and cheaper than the eurostar train for traveling between london and brussels he sent the frowning officials a copy of "mathematics for dummies " along the way hes built ryanair into europes largest airline by passenger volume and along with such rivals as easyjet transformed travel on the continent from london or dublin one can fly not just to nice but to nantes not only to rome but to riga and often for less than the price of a cab ride across town a generation of europeans has come of age expecting gbp flights to overlooked tourist gems hundreds of miles away a phenomenon that arguably has done as much to aid european integration as the eu itself though it says a great deal about the myopia in brussels that mr olearys efforts have often drawn regulatory scorn speaking of eurocrats mr oleary also seems to adhere to the belief famously misattributed to the master showman theres a sucker born every minute regulators "useless " environmentalists who complain about airlines co emissions "eco nutters " most of ryanairs rivals "doomed " mr oleary has plenty more to say about all of these people and more but the difference between him and other airline executives is as good a place to start as any "generally the problem with the airline industry is its so populated with people who grew up in the s or s who got their excitement looking at airplanes flying overhead " mr oleary explains in his spartan office at dublin airport dressed not in fatigues or papal robes but his usual blue jeans and open collar shirt "they wanted to be close to airplanes you know i wasnt mercifully i was a child of the s and a trained accountant so aircraft dont do anything for me "look this is a stupid business with the exception of southwest and ryanair well easyjet to a lesser extent nobody makes a lot of money at it " ah southwest airlines while everyone else in the business might land on mr olearys naughty list he holds americas low fare pioneer and its founder herb kelleher in high esteem when mr oleary was hired in the early s to turn around tony ryans struggling airline it was southwest that he studied "all weve done is copy herb kellehers successful model " mr oleary concedes "in fact were maybe the only people to copy it successfully and maybe take it beyond where southwest has gone with it but other than that its still southwests model " for once mr oleary whose ego is reputedly as large as ryanair is profitable may be selling himself short while ryanair mimics southwest in avoiding the largest hub airports and not selling assigned seats the irish carriers efforts to reduce overhead go much further if you want to check a bag you pay extra if you want a soft drink or pretzels on the flight you pay extra if you want an air sickness bag too bad ryanair has removed those along with the back of the seat pockets where they might have been stored on all its aircraft if theres a cost to be cut its been cut oh and one more thing the fares are cheaper too on average below the next lowest competitor according to mr oleary passengers have flocked to the cheap prices from four million travelers in mr oleary estimates ryanair will serve more than million this year the contest to dominate short haul flying "is over in europe " he says as matter of factly as such a claim can be made "gradually we will expand across europe as we already are aggressively now and because our unit prices and unit costs are so much lower nobody else can compete with us theyre all screwed " if mr oleary is dismissive of ryanairs competitors he doesnt mince words about rival airline executives either when i suggest that the industry continues to attract entrepreneurial talent such as richard branson of the virgin empire mr oleary waves the notion away "if you look at the low fares industry kelleher is still heads and shoulders above everybody else and you can count the rest of the successes on the fingers of one hand branson whos clearly a genius at making money got burned in the low fares industry virgin express was a dog it sold out to sn brussels and hes done clearly very well with his other businesses hes a multibillionaire "theres a lot of big egos in the industry that might be a better title for them including myself rather than entrepreneurs " mr olearys low opinion of his own industry though is nothing compared to his outright disdain for those who regulate air travel particularly when its done in the name of the environment mention airlines and carbon dioxide in the same sentence and he begins peppering his language with four letter words earlier this year before becoming britains prime minister gordon brown raised taxes on air travel to and from the u k the then treasury chiefs stated purpose was fighting climate change mr oleary whose airline serves more than a dozen british airports demurs "he just raised taxes on airlines it has bleep all to do with climate change weve written several letters to the treasury asking what the moneys going to be spent on we still havent gotten a reply "this is the problem with all this environmental claptrap its a convenient excuse for politicians to just start taxing people some of these guilt laden middle class liberals think its somehow good oh thats my contribution to the environment its not youre just being robbed its just highway bleeping robbery " airlines have become an enormous target for global warming doomsayers last month campaigners staged a nine day protest outside londons heathrow airport hoping to discourage summer vacationers from flying mr oleary points out that air transport accounts for only of carbon dioxide emissions world wide "its less than marine transport and yet i dont see anyone saying you know lets tax the bleep out of the ferries " mr oleary assigns further blame to "the chattering bloody classes or what i call the liberal guardian newspaper readers theyre all buying suvs to drive around the streets of london and theres this huge disconnect between their stated passion for or care for the environment and what they actually do they all want to buy kiwis and kumquats in the supermarket on saturday theyre flown in from new zealand for chrissakes theyre the equivalent of you know environmental nuclear bombs but nobody says lets ban the kiwi fruits " also coming in for an oleary lambasting is the european commission which in the past has declared ryanair the recipient of illegal subsidies from the airports it uses and more recently blocked its attempted but so far unsuccessful takeover of former irish state carrier aer lingus "the whole purpose of regulators " he argues is to be "a convenient political cover for the lack of political will to allow competition and so what the politicians say is well this is a natural monopoly therefore were going to impose a regulator and hes going to protect the consumer interest and what happens from the second after the regulators imposed is the regulated monopoly starts gaming him " the regulators in brussels arent the only ones to draw his ire mr oleary offers as an example dublin airport which to his great fury has raised its per passenger charges for takeoffs and landings but his illustration could just as easily apply to any other closely regulated industry including in many countries electricity and natural gas providers "dublin airport is looking for an increase in the passenger fees from euros to the regulator has come back and said no well only give you so dublin airport will come up to him and say were very unhappy with this you know but they still got a price increase " when you make your living by eliminating the cost of barf bags thats a lot of money so lets recap briefly the people who get mr olearys dander up include fellow airlines and their executives except of course for saint herb environmental activists politicians regulators the "fat cats " as he describes the group most broadly with this roster of antagonists and ryanairs dedication to cut rate pricing is mr olearys airline a sort of anti elitist outfit "no " he argues "because our most frequent fliers would be what youd call upper class the very rich our most frequent fliers during the summer are people who have large holiday homes in malaga marbella south of france italy you name it sending the kids nannies gardeners wives girlfriends mistresses up and down on our flights "i think we certainly have democratized flight in that theres no curtains anymore theres no business class anymore youre not made to feel you know two inches tall like here you go down with the poor people at the back everybodys the same on ryanair were in this to make money and provide a service the more service we provide the more money we make " the gradual extinction of business class service on short haul flights is one of mr olearys key themes to the ryanair boss its a matter of natural selection in short haul flying he says "you want safe reliable on time punctual show up shut up and get there this idea that you get on board maybe a seven oclock flight from brussels to frankfurt you get some inedible breakfast and two screw top bottles of bleepy champagne that you cant drink anyway its over " intercontinental flights he notes are a different animal "there is a significant proportion of the market that will pay for the luxury the seats the business lounge at the airport the whisk through immigration all that kind of stuff " but he says in panning the chances of success for the new business class only airlines like eos and maxjet "theres not enough of them business class passengers to fill a plane or to give you the frequency thats why in the long haul market you will continue to have the business class and the first class cross subsidize the rest of the aircraft "if you look at the eoss and the maxjets theyre fine for little niche plays little two aircraft operations but they dont have the connectivity at the hub airports that you need to be a big long haul premium carrier " rumors have been well flying that ryanair would branch out beyond its highly successful short haul model to offer low fare trans atlantic flights but mr oleary grounds the idea that ryanair is coming to america getting away from that model is "the great danger to us " mr oleary says along with getting "fat and dumb and happy for a couple of years " its the only threat to ryanair that he acknowledges and yet he says "i do see an opportunity in four or five years time in the next downturn for long haul for a fleet of or aircraft but it specifically wont be ryanair it may be some kind of sister company similar investors similar shareholders something like that but if youre going to run a long haul airline with a business class first class product i dont think you can have me marketing it because im too attached certainly in european minds to being cheap and cheerful " he doesnt admit to any alternative plans for his future "running ryanair is sort of an all consuming activity " he maintains "i dont have a lot of time for walking around looking at other business opportunities " but if airplanes werent his bag as a child surely something else was "oh yeah like most kids football " he says referring to the spherical sort rather than the american pigskin owning a soccer club though doesnt jibe with the accountant he grew up to be "completely insane " he says of owning sports teams "i confine my insanities to horse racing which at least is relatively cheap cheap in the context of football teams " and if anyone knows cheap its mr obarnum mr wingfield edits the business europe column for the wall street journal europe
