"sustained and substantial" amount of time but in the current music scene some of the most sought after bands are ones that didnt exist two years ago and have risen rapidly thanks to exposure on the internet these bands with huge fan followings but short track records are finding themselves trying to prove to immigration officials that they are famous for the english band klaxons that meant submitting clips of magazine reviews as part of their visa application package last year the band which last week won the u k s prestigious nationwide mercury prize is known for a driving mix of dance

its scheduled trip to the u s the band pulled the plug on the tour the group waited another seven months to enter the u s u s citizenship and immigration services a division of the department of homeland security says that the internet has changed the kind of evidence that bands present posts from blogs and online magazines now appear in application packages but the agency says it will only consider these sources if the band can prove that they are well read and influential the burden of proof falls on the band "were not simon cowell were the people who have to know why this group qualifies " says robert dejulius an adjudications supervisor at one of the two service centers that processes p visas mr dejulius adds that his center has in fact processed the petition of mr cowell

"its going to slow momentum down " says ms allens manager neale easterby "we just want to get back out there " in ms allens case it wasnt lack of recognition that caused her visa problems according to her manager ms allen had a one year visa that was valid until sept but it was taken away on aug when she landed in los angeles her manager says he thinks the visa might have been revoked because ms allen had been arrested in london in june after an altercation with photographers uscis says it does not comment on individual cases ms allen declined to comment all this comes as some foreign
