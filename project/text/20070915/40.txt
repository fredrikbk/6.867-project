of hispanics but only one republican sen john mccain agreed to participate in a similar forum for republicans originally scheduled for sunday prompting the network to postpone the debate indefinitely most republican candidates have taken a strong stand against immigration overhaul efforts and risked facing a hostile audience the decision not to attend the debate could be seen by the hispanic community as a snub and underscores the feeling that republicans are turning away from hispanics that sentiment threatens to unravel the gains made by president bush who has aggressively courted hispanic votes since his days as texas governor increasing his share among hispanic voters to about in the election from in both parties are already courting hispanics democratic hopeful barack obama

hispanic how could the hispanic vote reshape the electoral map winning the hispanic vote could be important for either party because of the growing numbers of hispanics in such swing states as florida
