weekend journal leisure &amp arts sightings no critics allowed are press free theatrical previews out of date when is an opening night not an opening night when it happens on broadway take mel brookss musical version of "young frankenstein " it opens on oct but the official opening night is nov and the reviews wont run until the next morning should you care to fork over &# for an orchestra seat prior to then youll do so without benefit of critical counsel since the preceding months performances are "previews" to which reviewers will not be invited until a few days before the show opens officially thats business as usual but should it be the question is no longer academic for the drama critics of two chicago newspapers the sun times and tribune have kicked up a fuss by suggesting that the time honored tradition that lets producers restrict press access to shows early in their runs has gotten out of hand why have previews in the first place because you cant tell what a show is really like until you perform it in front of a paying audience and see how the viewers respond for many years big ticket broadway shows were tried out in other eastern cities then revised before coming to new york in "act one " moss hart tells how "once in a lifetime " the first play he wrote with george s kaufman was rewritten twice once after a pair of disastrous tryouts in atlantic city and brooklyn and again after an iffy preview in philadelphia but as budgets soared out of town previews grew prohibitively expensive and now most shows are "previewed" on broadway for three or four weeks prior to their official opening nights some musicals like "young frankenstein " are also tried out in other cities prior to their broadway previews the difference is that in the old days out of town tryouts were reviewed by out of town critics sometimes scathingly whereas todays broadway previews are mostly off limits to the press the latest wrinkle is for producers to mount "developmental" productions of shows that are not yet ready for prime time such productions are becoming more common both in new york and elsewhere in the u s twice in the past year i made plans to review interesting sounding plays in california aaron sorkins "the farnsworth invention " which opens on broadway in november and washington d c moises kaufmans " variations" only to be told that they were workshop productions to which critics would not be admitted that brings us to chicago last year hedy weiss of the sun times reviewed a festival presentation of a group of new musicals that the producers had declared "developmental " apparently without warning her in may chris jones of the tribune was told that he couldnt review steppenwolfs first look repertory of new work festival then learned that one of the three plays on view would be opening in new york a mere month after it closed in chicago "im not doing my job if i allow the new york critics to weigh in on a play by this iconic chicago theater and somehow weve ignored it " he told a reporter for the chicago reader result steppenwolf backed down as for me its my practice not to review out of town productions that i expect to transfer to broadway yes some shows are news and the fact that the seattle tryout of "young frankenstein" got mixed reviews in the local papers has not gone unnoticed or unreported in new york still my feeling is that the creators of a show should be given plenty of time to polish it before i pass judgment on the results thats why i didnt go to seattles intiman theatre to see "the light in the piazza " or to cincinnati playhouse in the park to see john doyles revival of "company" both of which i praised when they finally made it to broadway still im of two minds about the existing workshop and preview system i dont blame producers or performers for wanting to perfect a show before the critics see it at the same time though i question whether a producer who sells tickets to a public performance of a new play has a right to expect local critics to behave as if it isnt taking place as mr jones rightly says "when its a professional theater with equity actors in full productions charging money for tickets we have an obligation to tell our readers what those shows are like " in any case old fashioned print media critics like mr jones and me no longer have a monopoly on drama criticism not only are theater oriented blogs message boards and chat rooms thriving but the web sites of a growing number of newspapers now permit readers to post their own reviews a la amazon com and to do so while the shows in question are still in previews with playgoers "publishing" their opinions of new shows whenever they please is there any reason for producers to keep on holding critics at bay until the last minute perhaps for now but my guess is that the institution of the theatrical preview will soon come to be seen as pointless as any number of red faced pols can tell you there are no secrets in the age of the new media least of all the news that a musical set to open next thursday is giving off the pungent odor of roast turkey today mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings"
