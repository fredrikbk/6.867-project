bringing the market to health care presidential candidate mitt romneys recent health care reform proposals which rely on free market principles and federalism will go a long way to fixing our health care systems woes the centerpiece of mr romneys plan is to attack the tax codes discrimination against cost effective private insurance he proposes to allow individuals to deduct out of pocket health care expenditures from their taxable income allow individuals who purchase health insurance premiums on their own rather than through their employer to deduct health insurance premiums and to expand health savings accounts hsas by eliminating the requirement that a qualifying health plan contain a high deductible virtually all observers have argued that the u s tax preference for employer provided health insurance encourages overconsumption of health services first it creates a large financial incentive for workers to purchase as much medical care as they can through their employers insurance plan in practice workers do so by enrolling in health plans with high premiums but low deductibles and coinsurance payments such plans by making the purchase of health care services appear to be less costly than they really are create a "moral hazard" that leads to overconsumption of health care services second the tax preference makes health care look cheaper compared to all other goods and services the tax preferences impact has been profound it is the principal reason why nine out of every private health care plans in the u s are purchased through an employer it is the principal reason why six out of every seven dollars of health care spending is made by someone other than the person receiving the care and it is a key reason for the u s health care systems excessive cost and waste many economists including us have emphasized the large benefits to health care of revoking the tax preference yet elected officials have repeatedly failed to enact the change because of strong political opposition over the past years congress has instead opted for a second best policy on a piecemeal basis congress has gradually leveled the "tax playing field" between employer insurance and out of pocket expenses by expanding the tax preference to out of pocket expenses rather than by eliminating the preference for employer provided insurance in congress created flexible spending accounts fsas to allow health expenditures to be nontaxable to the employee in congress created medical savings accounts to allow a limited number of employees of small businesses to set aside funds tax free for their out of pocket expenses in treasury regulations established health reimbursement accounts to allow employees to use pre tax dollars for medical expenses without the annual use it or lose it provision of fsas and in congress replaced medical savings accounts with far more attractive health savings accounts hsas allow employers and individuals with high deductible health plans to set aside money tax free to pay their current or future out of pocket expenses mr romneys proposal to allow individuals to deduct out of pocket medical expenses is a significant advance in this year progression to a level tax playing field between out of pocket expenses and insurance and a more level tax playing field would encourage individuals to choose health plans with lower premiums and higher copayments for their routine health care purchases with more "skin in the game " individuals would exert more control over their choice of health care services the health care savings would be large we estimate that a proposal such as romneys would reduce private health care spending by some critics have argued that allowing out of pocket expenses to be tax deductible will raise not lower health care spending because the policy will make the price of direct medical care purchases cheaper relative to all other goods and services as our empirical analysis with daniel kessler demonstrates the critics are wrong the cost reducing impact on health care expenditures of individuals shifting into health plans with higher copayments swamps by a large margin the cost increasing impact of making out of pocket purchases cheaper the benefits dont stop with reducing the growth in health costs as employer premiums decline the savings will accrue to workers in the form of higher money wages in competitive labor markets workers not employers and not insurance companies bear the burden of paying for employer provided health insurance premiums although employers might write the check for premiums workers ultimately pay by foregoing money wages we estimate that making out of pocket expenses tax deductible combined with mr romneys other proposals will reduce the average premium of employer provided family health plans by around &# per year workers wages will rise by this amount on average to be sure higher out of pocket expenses will offset part of this increase &# of it but workers will still experience a net increase of &# in taxable income mainly because of this economic effect we estimate that the u s treasurys revenue loss will be modest about &# billion per year mr romneys proposal also allows persons who purchase health insurance on their own to deduct their premium payments this tax deduction will make insurance significantly less costly for unemployed persons and workers in firms that dont offer insurance coverage because both out of pocket spending and individually purchased health insurance would be deductible a person in a tax bracket who purchases a &# health insurance plan and who has an additional &# in out of pocket expenses would realize a tax savings of &# a reduction in the effective cost of the insurance plan the lower cost provides significant incentive for currently uninsured individuals to buy at least catastrophic insurance some health policy experts have questioned why mr romney would seek tax changes beyond those embodied in health savings accounts indeed hsas are one of the most important health care policy innovations in decades if they are to achieve their potential they must be made more attractive to a broader segment of the population a key deterrent to choosing an hsa has been the requirement that an individual must be enrolled in a high deductible health care plan the requirement &# for individuals and &# for families is simply too high for many consumers it is also unnecessary mr romneys proposal to eliminate the "high deductible" requirement will allow individuals to establish an hsa regardless of their health plans deductible eliminating the high deductible requirement will maintain the cost reducing benefits of hsas evidence from the rand experiment indicates that most of the expenditure reducing effects of health plan deductibles occur at low levels of deductibles the key to reducing the u s health care systems excessive cost without damaging its ability to innovate is to allow competitive market forces to operate these forces have worked in every other market to keep costs low and improve quality there is no reason why they wont work in health care attacking the tax codes bias against efficient and cost effective health insurance is fundamental to creating an economically sound health care system mr cogan a senior fellow at the hoover institution was deputy director of the office of management and budget under president reagan mr hubbard dean of columbia business school was chairman of the council of economic advisers under
