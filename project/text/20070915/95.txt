weekend journal leisure &amp arts masterpiece seeing is believing whistlers elaborate peacock room defies easy description anatomy of a classic james mcneill whistlers elaborate interior "harmony in blue and gold " better known as the peacock room in the smithsonians freer gallery of art is impossible to describe believe me ive tried in a six pound monograph college courses public lectures magazine articles television documentaries and a childrens book but not even the artist himself could do it the broadside whistler composed in for the benefit of the press delineating the endless variation of color scheme surface pattern and decorative motif makes the peacock room sound labored and monotonous when it is anything but that sometimes i can convey a sense of an isolated element of the peacock room such as the central painting of a chinese princess in an imagined land of porcelain the brightly gilded lattice of intricately carved shelving the modulating scheme of blue green copper and gold the japanese style peacocks gracefully arrayed on floor to ceiling shutters the blue designs on a gold ground alternating with gold on blue the peacock feather patterns radiating from pendant lamps the porcelain pots gleaming on shallow shelves set against a tapestry like copper green background the tableau of fighting peacocks executed almost entirely in gold with certain telling details touched with silver but when it comes to the encompassing effect words fail me this presumably is what the artist intended an expatriate american in victorian london the most literate society the world had ever known whistler struggled to defeat the british habit of making pictures dependent upon words as illustrations to stories or morality tales in paint his creed was that art should be independent of "claptrap " as he put it in his own exquisite lifestyle whistler demonstrated his belief in art for arts sake and the dream of every aesthete was to dwell in the spirit of art whistlers peacock room a domestic interior after all is the perfect expression of that ideal to even begin to understand this however you have to be there to see the room in person and experience every dimension ive watched visitors to the freer gallery enter the room from the sunlit corridors and blink to adjust their eyes to the dark before walking out moments later apparently unable or unwilling to absorb the extravagantly gorgeous chamber ive witnessed people sit down to rest there for a minute or two then hurry out the door in evident distress overcome by claustrophobia ive heard of clairvoyants sensing the presence of some departed soul usually whistler or frederick leyland his unhappy patron but sometimes charles freer the artists devoted friend and museum founder and of art lovers so overwhelmed by emotion that they decided to propose marriage then and there ive met appreciative admirers who make regular pilgrimages to the freer just to take in the spectacle of the peacock room and absorb its rarefied atmosphere perhaps the impossibility of putting the aesthetic effect into words accounts for the tendency originating with whistler himself to embellish the story of its creation with fanciful detail originally the dining room of an opulent london townhouse the peacock room was meant to display whistlers painting of the chinese princess surrounded by leylands collection of chinese blue and white porcelain the interior architect thomas jeckyll had conceived of the room as a garden pavilion in the chinoiserie style with th century dutch gilt leather hanging on the walls when jeckyll became ill and abandoned the project whistler offered to complete it tradition has it that the artists creativity took flight from his first sight of the unfinished room but research confirms that he was at first considerate of his friends design and made only minor changes in hopes of bringing disparate decorative devices into harmony eventually though whistler became more deeply involved perhaps obsessed with the dining room he remained in the house for months on end while the owner stayed away in liverpool launching the leyland line into the atlantic shipping trade whistler was so grateful to the leyland family for its affection and support that he regarded his herculean efforts as a labor of love but on the fateful day that frederick leyland returned to town unexpectedly to see how whistler was coming along he was stunned to find gold paint and gold leaf glaring from every wall shelf and shutter of the room moreover he was astonished at the liberties whistler had taken with his money and his home leylands failure of appreciation as whistler interpreted his shock and disapproval incited a quarrel over the artists fee in the end whistler agreed to a lesser payment than he felt he deserved on the condition that he be left to finish the work to his own satisfaction it was only then bent on retaliation that whistler painted over the expensive gilt leather with a coat of peacock blue this opened up new fields for his peacock theme particularly the broad blank wall above the sideboard which cried out for decoration there he composed a magnificent mural he called "lart et largent or the story of the room " knowing that leyland would be compelled to consider it every time he took his place at the head of his dining room table an elegant pair of birds stands in dramatic confrontation one with ruffled feathers encrusted with gold sovereigns and silver shillings the other dispassionate crowned with a silver crest feather recalling the white lock of hair that rose artfully above whistlers forehead as a longtime curator of the peacock room i can recount that story in my sleep the facts however did not fall into place until the room underwent a transforming restoration working inch by inch a team of conservators gradually revealed elements of design that had long been hidden beneath layers of discolored varnish and the obscuring paint applied decades earlier by restorers who regarded whistlers work more as a construction of walls to be retouched than as an aesthetic treasure to be respected and preserved it was my good fortune to observe the recovery of the varying textures complex patterns and brilliant color scheme of the peacock room still after a dozen years at the freer many of them lived so it seemed in that room alone i felt a need to get away to stop thinking and talking and writing about whistlers exceptional creation i moved south and found many distractions but nine years later i can still summon to my minds eye every corner of whistlers "harmony in blue and gold " the peacock room is indescribable but it is also unforgettable and isnt that the mark of a masterpiece ms merrill author of "the peacock room a cultural biography " is now an independent scholar living in atlanta
