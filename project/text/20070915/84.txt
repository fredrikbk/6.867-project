weekend journal books contested authority a philosophical history of the shifting power of religion in politics the stillborn god by mark lilla knopf pages &# it wasnt supposed to be this way evangelical christianity was not supposed to rise in the s as a political force in the u s militant islam was not supposed to rear its ugly head in the s developing into a global threat to america and the west nor was there supposed to be a world wide religious awakening in south america africa and asia among other places involving major religious groups not only christian and muslim but also hindu and buddhist at least none of these developments rooted in different social structures and cultures was supposed to happen from the perspective of enlightened and progressive opinion instead democracy and modernization gaining strength in the second half of the th century were supposed to finish a job that began in the th and th centuries sweeping away ancient superstition dissolving inherited prejudice installing reason as authoritative in moral and political life and making man at last thoroughly at home in the world by totally secularizing it "the stillborn god" mark lillas sophisticated and compelling study of religion and politics in the modern west helps to explain where this supposition came from and why it has proved to be misguided the book was not written in response to the political challenges of the moment but it could not be timelier like the best histories of philosophy "the stillborn god" illuminates the promises and perils of the present by bringing into focus the intellectual origins of our current opinions and by reminding us of their forgotten alternatives however much american citizens may disagree about religion we generally agree that political questions what is the proper extent of governmental power under what circumstances do we go to war whom shall we choose to lead us should not be decided by appealing to gods will scriptural interpretation or prophetic pronouncement religious arguments about political questions are not outlawed we live in a free society after all but for the most part even when our political judgments are informed by religious faith we recognize the imperative of making our case to fellow citizens without the aid of divine revelation or theological speculation this understanding mr lilla stresses represents a relatively recent innovation the alternative political theology guided men for millennia in the west and still does in many parts of the world its great mission was to ground politics publicly and definitively in religious teaching political theology arises out of the effort to understand a mysterious cosmos that nevertheless seems to behave in many ways in a regular law like fashion in such a world it is natural to want to settle weighty disputes about who should exercise authority and how it should be exercised by appealing to the highest authority of all according to mr lilla the decisive figure in the revolt against political theology in the west that meant christian political theology was thomas hobbes with the so called wars of religion vividly in mind they dominated parts of europe in the second half of the th century and the first half of the th hobbes sought to separate politics from religion hobbes effected this "great separation " mr lilla emphasizes not only by making human nature itself the highest political authority but also by introducing a new understanding of man nature and the cosmos in hobbess view nature was mechanistic god was not the creator and redeemer but at most an ultimate cause human nature was governed by amoral appetites and passions and reason was an instrument for satisfying them religious belief as the ancient epicureans had taught arose out of fear and ignorance the best political order achieved peace self preservation is the precondition for the satisfaction of individual desires by concentrating power in the sovereign above all because differences over religion were the principal source of strife and war between nations religion in hobbess judgment had to be radically demoted later thinkers challenged hobbess demotion of religion but did not disturb the "great separation " locke taught that peace and the protection of the individual could be better achieved through religious toleration and the separation of powers rousseau and kant argued that men had religious needs that demanded respect but could not be fully satisfied by conventional religion and hegel sought to show that religious faith provided an indispensable vehicle for expressing crucial truths about the ethical life political theology enjoyed a rebirth of sorts in th century germany as mr lilla shows championed by protestant theologians the new political theology or "liberal theology " as it came to be known found in the moral and political achievement of the modern german nation state gods presence in history liberal theologians were sharply criticized in the th century by the german protestant theologian karl barth and by the german jewish philosopher franz rosenzweig for losing sight of the reality of biblical revelation and the promise of divine redemption and then the guns and concentrations camps of world war ii silenced the debate in europe where does that leave us now mr lilla concludes that "there is no effacing the intellectual distinction between political theology which appeals at some point to divine revelation and a political philosophy that tries to understand and attain the political good without such appeals " even as he explains why other civilizations may well make different choices he urges us to "keep our politics unilluminated by the light of revelation " but isnt that too stark especially for a country whose declaration of independence grounds our unalienable rights in god as well as nature the great undertaking of the liberal west is to make a place for religion in public as well as private life without sacrificing individual freedom and political order to be sure this is no easy task as mr lilla shows for religious belief has a way of making exclusive and often political claims mr lilla elegantly reconstructs so much intellectual history that one cant help wishing that he had taken his narrative even nearer to the present tracking the efforts of recent thinkers to understand the philosophical foundations of religion and politics it would be instructive to learn for example how mr lilla distinguishes his own understanding from that of leo strauss who contended that western civilization draws strength from the unresolved contest between reason and revelation and it would be interesting to know what mr lilla would make of charles taylor the winner of the templeton prize in religion who has long argued that many of modernitys greatest achievements draw subterranean sustenance from premodern religious sources another important question is whether the european tradition around which mr lillas argument revolves leaves out a crucial alternative one embodied in the american experiment in liberal democracy that alternative championed by the founders provides religious reasons for separating church and state and political reasons for cherishing religion this suggests that the challenge lies not in choosing between putting your trust in god or putting your trust in man but in choosing to give to each its due mr berkowitz is a senior fellow at the hoover institution and a professor at the george mason university school of law
