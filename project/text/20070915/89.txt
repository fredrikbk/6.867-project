countrys biggest mortgage lenders northern rock plc sought to reassure customers unnerved by news it had turned to the bank of england for help keeping its business afloat investors dumped united kingdom bank stocks friday as northern rock confirmed that the bank of england would provide it with short term funding for the bank to alleviate a "severe liquidity squeeze " it was the first such action since the british central bank became independent in northern rocks shares fell in a day both parties portrayed the bailout the size of which is unclear as a temporary measure to support a good business that hasnt been involved in unduly risky lending nonetheless depositors lined up outside branches throughout england to inquire about the safety of their accounts and in many cases withdraw money analysts saw the rescue of northern rock the u k s fifth largest mortgage lender by volume of outstanding loans as a reminder of how much the credit crunch is affecting banks particularly in britain where central bankers have been reluctant to ease the pain by pumping money into the system on a large scale "its quite odd in this day and age to see people lining up outside of banks " said mike lenhoff chief strategist and head of research at u k brokers brewin dolphin "the bank of england has quite a problem its called confidence " stock markets declined in europe and the british pound weakened against the dollar as news of northern rocks troubles rekindled worries about banks northern rock shares fell pence &# to pence friday in london the drop knocked gbp million off northern rocks market value at one northern rock branch on a busy thoroughfare at the heart of londons financial district a crowd of about people tried to get into the bank pushing up against the tinted glass to look inside at another branch nearby customer andrew cumming said he had been unable to withdraw money online because the banks web site had been overwhelmed with activity the situation is "bloody hopeless " said mr cumming years old who lives in suffolk a bank spokesman said no one was being stopped from making withdrawals over the past three decades northern rock based in a suburb of the northeastern city of newcastle has grown from a small regional player into a nationwide publicly traded lender with gbp billion in customer deposits and gbp billion in residential mortgage loans outstanding from northern rock nearly doubled its share of the u k mortgage market to of total mortgage balances outstanding at year end unlike many of its counterparts in the u s where lax lending practices have engendered a sharp rise in defaults and foreclosures northern rock has lent mainly to borrowers with good credit the companys business model however has made it particularly vulnerable to the current credit crunch for one thing it has relied more than other u k lenders on its ability to package and sell its mortgage loans to investors who have shied away from mortgage backed securities ever since concerns over risky u s subprime loans began to spread earlier this year it also depends heavily on short term loans from other banks rather than its deposits to fund its mortgages according to research firm redburn partners northern rocks borrowings from other banks exceed customer deposits by more than three times that compares with about times for bradford &amp bingley plc and about times for alliance &amp leicester two other u k lenders that analysts have suggested could face difficulty borrowing enough money to fund their operations both issued statements saying they were maintaining a healthy supply of funding in a conference call friday morning with analysts northern rock chief executive officer adam applegarth said the companys borrowing troubles began aug the day french bank bnp paribas sa suspended withdrawals from three investment funds saying it couldnt properly value the assets in the funds since then banks have become increasingly wary of lending to one another uncertain about which of their counterparts might be in trouble northern rock initiated talks with the bank of england in early september once it had become clear that funding wasnt improving "there are no funds available " said mr applegarth in a conference call with analysts friday morning "its an astonishing thing to see " at the same time he said depositors had no reason to worry now that the company had secured a deal with the bank of england "im a depositor with northern rock " he said "you dont get better than being banked by the bank of england " in a three way statement with the u k treasury and the financial services authority the bank of england said that northern rocks problem wasnt a matter of the longer term viability of the business "northern rock is solvent exceeds its regulatory capital requirement and has a good quality loan book " the statement said the statement offered no details on the size or terms of the emergency funding for which northern rock will provide largely mortgages as collateral alex potter an analyst at investment firm collins stewart in london estimated that the funding could be as much as gbp billion available for three to six months the british central banks move to rescue northern rock comes at a time when the banks governor mervyn king has publicly criticized the tactic of pumping money into interbank lending markets on a large scale saying it would encourage irresponsible risk taking both the federal reserve and the european central bank have provided billions in emergency funding to the banking sector in recent weeks while mr king a longtime advocate of letting investors bear the consequences of their own decisions has chosen to stay on the sidelines fridays three way statement suggested that the northern rock bailout didnt conflict with mr kings philosophy noting that he has said the bank would be willing to be a lender of last resort for an individual bank in certain emergency situations but against good collateral and at a penalty rate neither the money nor the reassurances from the bank of england however were enough for some depositors "they say not to panic but the more im hearing the more im panicking " said lynn fenn a homemaker and longtime northern rock depositor in whitley bay a coastal town near the companys headquarters in northeast england squeezed the news northern rock one of the u k s largest mortgage lenders turns to the countrys central bank for an emergency funding arrangement street scene customers line up at the banks branches to withdraw money despite efforts by northern rock ceo adam applegarth to reassure them bottom line the global liquidity crunch which has caught financial firms in the u s and europe is showing minimal signs of improving
