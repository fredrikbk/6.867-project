with gates cones and rubber ducks that cant be touched sitting behind a curtain waiting her turn ms courtney listened to the cheers and the sounds of diesel engines accelerating in low gear in the arena "i had butterflies " ms courtney recalled later "im lucky i didnt stop and jump out of the truck " in the year history of the contest no woman had advanced further than carol craig a viking freight system driver who placed third in the straight truck division in trucking remains a predominantly male business and the seven women at this years championships stood out among the men

at night or linger at truck stops "ive always tried to make it so there was no reason for me to have problems " she said several of the other women said they still get occasional harassment from male drivers and say that truck stops could do more to accommodate their needs for showers separate restrooms and laundry facilities but a big priority is just proving that ordinary women can be truckers
