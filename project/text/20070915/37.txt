greenspan book criticizes bush and republicans they deserved to lose former fed chief defends pre bubble rate cuts in a withering critique of his fellow republicans former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan says in his memoir that the party to which he has belonged all his life deserved to lose power last year for forsaking its small government principles in "the age of turbulence adventures in a new world " published by penguin press mr greenspan criticizes both congressional republicans and president george w bush for abandoning fiscal discipline the book is scheduled for public release monday the wall street journal bought a copy at a bookstore in the new york area mr greenspan who calls himself a "lifelong libertarian republican " writes that he advised the white house to veto some bills to curb "out of control" spending while the republicans controlled congress he says president bushs failure to do so "was a major mistake " republicans in congress he writes "swapped principle for power they ended up with neither they deserved to lose " many economists say the fed by cutting short term interest rates to in mid and keeping them there for a year helped foster a housing bubble that is now bursting in his book which was largely written before much of the recent turmoil in credit markets mr greenspan defends the policy "we wanted to shut down the possibility of corrosive deflation " he writes "we were willing to chance that by cutting rates we might foster a bubble an inflationary boom of some sort which we would subsequently have to address it was a decision done right " he attributes the housing boom to the end of communism which he says unleashed hundreds of millions of workers on global markets putting downward pressure on wages and prices and thus on long term interest rates mr greenspan retired in early after years as chairman of the federal reserve he had served under six presidents as either fed chairman or adviser he now runs a private consulting company his only formal public role is adviser to british prime minister gordon brown penguin paid an advance of more than &# million last year for mr greenspans book according to people familiar with the matter promotion for the book includes appearances by mr greenspan on cbss " minutes " nbcs "today" and cnbc interviews with foreign and u s media book signings and speaking engagements the books official release comes a day before the most watched fed meeting of the year on tuesday mr greenspans successor ben bernanke must decide whether to cut interest rates to cushion the economy from the reversal of the housing boom that began under mr greenspans watch his book is half memoir and half treatise on the state of the world and its future while much of the ground has been covered either in his own previous public remarks or in other books mr greenspan sheds new light on many policy decisions offers often trenchant observations of the presidents he has known and makes some surprising economic forecasts unmuffled by the often opaque and complex phraseology he used as fed chairman critics however may seize on his continued defense of decisions they say led to first a stock bubble and then a housing bubble and on some assertions that differ from the historical record mr greenspan writes that when president bush chose dick cheney as vice president and paul oneill as treasury secretary both colleagues from the gerald ford administration during which mr greenspan was chairman of the council of economic advisers he "indulged in a bit of fantasy" that this would be the government that would have resulted if mr ford hadnt lost to jimmy carter in but mr greenspan discovered that in the bush white house the "political operation was far more dominant" than in mr fords "little value was placed on rigorous economic policy debate or the weighing of long term consequences " he writes from serving under so many presidents mr greenspan concludes that theres something abnormal about anyone willing to do what it takes to get the job mr ford he writes "was as close to normal as you get in a president but he was never elected " the watergate tapes he says show richard nixon as "an extremely smart man who is sadly paranoid misanthropic and cynical " he recalls telling someone who had accused nixon of anti semitism that he "wasnt exclusively anti semitic he was anti semitic anti italian anti greek anti slovak i dont know anybody he was pro " ronald reagans ability to instantly tap one liners and anecdotes in support of a particular policy represented an "odd form of intelligence " he describes bill clinton as "a fellow information hound" with "a consistent disciplined focus on long term economic growth" whose relationship with monica lewinsky "made me feel disappointed and sad " mr greenspan makes no mention of his successor as fed chairman mr bernanke other than in a caption accompanying a picture "i was very comfortable leaving the post in the hands of such an experienced successor " it reads he devotes chapters to each of the major economic challenges facing the u s and the world on energy he recommends more use of nuclear power and he predicts efforts to reduce global warming with carbon caps or taxes will fail rising income inequality could undo "the cultural ties that bind our society" and even lead to "large scale violence " the remedy he says is not higher taxes on the rich but improved education which can be helped by paying math teachers more mr greenspan returns repeatedly to the far reaching importance of communisms collapse he says it discredited central planning throughout the world and inspired china and later india to throw off socialist policies he recalls meeting a former manager of a produce distribution center in china who says he once had to labor to allocate produce according to government edict now the allocations are made by auction "now i dont have to get up at four a m " he quotes the manager as saying "i can sleep in and let the market do my job for me " mr greenspan recalls his amazement when an adviser to russian president vladimir putin asks him to discuss ayn rand the libertarian philosopher with whom mr greenspan had been friends in coming years as the globalization process winds down he predicts inflation will become harder to contain recent increases in the price of imports from china and a rise in long term interest rates suggest "the turn may be upon us sooner rather than later " left alone he said the feds policy making body the federal open market committee can keep inflation between and but that could require forcing interest rates to double digits a level "not seen since the days of paul volcker " his predecessor as fed chairman "i fear that my successors on the fomc as they strive to maintain price stability in the coming quarter century will run into populist resistance from congress if not from the white house " he writes if the fed succumbs to that pressure inflation could rise from a little over at present to an average of to by the year he writes ten year treasury yields now below will rise to "at least " with the potential to go "significantly higher for brief periods " this he says will lead to stagnant returns on stocks and bonds and much smaller gains in housing prices mr greenspan won plaudits for achieving low inflation and unemployment with just two mild recessions during his tenure at the fed but more recently his record has taken some knocks some critics fault him for not doing more to restrain the stock bubble of the s and for responding to its eventual bursting with such low interest rates that housing prices subsequently soared mr greenspan writes that in early he told his colleagues the fed should raise interest rates as a "preemptive" move against a stock market bubble but transcripts of fed meetings from that period do not support his books version of events they show mr greenspan argued for a rate increase principally because of inflation
