i think clean not green forgive my cynicism but i have encountered the card you illustrate and cite in your article "hotel chains grapple with meaning of green" marketplace sept the card is used by hotels to urge patrons to think green and reuse their towels and sheets to help save the world i have always interpreted such requests as more likely a method by which the hotel hopes to cut its laundry costs am i a bad person because at &# a night i feel i am entitled to clean sheets prof william j parente department of political science university of scranton scranton pa
