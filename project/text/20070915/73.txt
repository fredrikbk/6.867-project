the fed should hold firm less than years ago the federal reserve ended the great inflation that plagued the s and early s harvards martin feldstein on this page and other economists are now urging the fed to repeat past mistakes because they believe a loose monetary policy is necessary to head off an economic downturn they see coming our way beginning in and throughout the s the fed responded to rising unemployment with rapid monetary expansion the public workers bond holders and others quickly recognized that it was more determined to prevent unemployment from rising than to reduce inflation so markets expected and got higher inflation chairman arthur burns offered many irrelevant reasons unions monopolies the welfare state for inflation the public learned his sequence anti inflation policy soon brought rising unemployment the fed abandoned its anti inflation policy and brought on the next inflation why plan that lower inflation would become permanent when it never did the federal reserve staff also produced inflation forecasts that systematically underestimated inflation year after year economists forecasts may be better than others but they are not very good two of the changes that paul volcker introduced in were to increase the feds emphasis on fighting inflation and diminish its concern about the unemployment rate and to pay little or no attention to forecasts transcripts of meetings show mr volcker repeatedly praising the fed staff but neglecting its forecasts his successor alan greenspan did the same they ran the most successful high growth and low inflation policies in modern times mr feldstein and others offer a scenario for the unfolding of recent credit and housing problems that ends in a deep recession he calls for a one percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate to partly overcome the disaster he foresees much of his analysis depends on forecasts or guesses about declines in house prices and failures of credit markets that are outside the range of past experience but it is not difficult to find an alternative forecast that is far less gloomy many economists including many at the fed foresee a more benign outcome a slow growth rate for a few quarters but no recession only time will tell which is correct at present markets seem to accept the more favorable outcome with annual inflation at or more and unit labor costs rising at a rate loose fed policy risks reviving the latent fears that it is willing to permit higher inflation now to respond to a forecast that unemployment may rise that returns to the policy that made the great inflation costly and durable the better policy is to wait until the very mixed data of the moment forms a pattern high frequency data is often revised it often has transitory aberrations that do not persist unfortunately after a major change in underlying conditions we know even less than usual about the future good monetary policy makers should be watchful but would wait for better indications of the future leave the federal funds rate alone for the present but show concern and give equal weight to avoiding higher inflation and recession dont be afraid to disappoint the market there are more immediate problems and as usual congress is looking for scapegoats two issues call for attention first more financial regulation is not the answer to the subprime mess because regulation just induces innovation to circumvent it regulated and monitored banks found ways to shift the risk from their balance sheets to other unregulated investors the shifted risks are no longer within supervised banks much of the risk has been shifted out of banks to hedge funds pension funds and foreigners no one knows where it all is we find out when the holders fail or ask for help nor will more regulation of hedge funds solve the problem money will move elsewhere the better solution is market discipline imprudent lenders lose they fail and others learn from the failures this will not eliminate future mistakes but neither has regulation second we should recognize that all recent crises and disruptions began with a remarkable degree of herd like behavior in the housing debacle sophisticated investors bought claims based on no money down no credit record no relevant data what were they thinking were they thinking herd like behavior arises because the managers put their personal interest far ahead of the interests of the investors in their funds in and the managers reported great earnings and received magnificent bonuses straying from the herd by refusing to participate is likely to cost not just the bonus but the job so the incentives are wrong we could have learned that from the international debt problems of the late s or the dot com collapse now we can learn it again the incentives for managers invite instability they gain but we lose the only way to teach institutions to change the incentive structure is to let the ones that made too many bad decisions fail mr meltzer is a professor of political economy at carnegie mellon and a visiting scholar at the american enterprise institute
