ask encore focus on retirement choosing the right trust can cut tax payouts my wife and i both have trusts set up to pass our estate to our grandchildren i have a rather large ira and at the advice of the attorney who set up our will and trusts i changed the beneficiary of my ira to the trust friends tell us that by doing this the eventual withdrawals will be taxed at a higher rate im sure there are other implications as well may i have your comments bert metzger west bloomfield mich the tax your trusts eventually would incur depends on the type of trusts you set up if you use a trust that holds onto the withdrawals that would be required from a traditional individual retirement account upon your death with the trustee doling out the money to your grandchildren at his or her discretion then the ira distributions remaining in the trust would be subject to trust tax rates as you note those rates are effectively much higher than personal income tax rates a trust would hit the tax bracket this year if it collected more than &# in income in contrast the income threshold for the rate for ordinary income tax is &# but if you successfully set up whats called a "conduit " or "pass through" trust with the ira distributions passing directly to your grandchildren they would pay ordinary income tax at their personal rates setting up a trust to meet the internal revenue services requirements takes some care if you spell out a lot of conditions that your heirs have to meet or name a charity as an alternative beneficiary the trust may not qualify still "the issue with a trust may be control " says ed slott an ira consultant in rockville centre n y "if youre leaving your assets to a minor or someone who is disabled or vulnerable to people taking advantage of them the taxes may not be the most important issue " and a discretionary trust offers more control along with potentially higher taxes your heirs wouldnt have to worry about taxes at all he notes if you convert your traditional ira into a roth ira annual withdrawals from inherited roth iras are required but they are generally tax free and in the tax law lifts the income limits for roth conversions you probably already know that your heirs can split an ira that they inherit outright and then use their individual ages to stretch withdrawals across their life expectancies you couldnt do that with a trust instead you would have to use the oldest heirs life expectancy to allow each heir to stretch withdrawals across his or her own life expectancy you would have to split your ira so the grandchildren would have their own accounts create a separate trust as beneficiary of each ira and leave the trusts to separate heirs alternatively you could structure your main trust to have subtrusts and name the subtrusts on your ira beneficiary form instead of the master trust one other potential tax issue you can leave your grandchildren combined assets of as much as &# million without incurring whats called the generation skipping transfer tax after that your estate would get hit with an additional inheritance tax at a rate send your question to encore wsj com ask encore focus on retirement is a weekly column answering readers questions about retirement and personal finance from annuities and bonds to trusts and inheritance issues please include your full name and city and state
