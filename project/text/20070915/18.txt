business insight a special report together we innovate how can companies come up with new ideas by getting employees working with one another when it comes to innovation the myth of the lone genius dies hard most companies continue to assume that innovation comes from that individual genius or at best small sequestered teams that vanish from sight and then return with big ideas but the truth is most innovations are created through networks groups of people working in concert the misperception has never been more damaging as companies pour more money into generating ideas and then end up frustrated as innovations simply dont develop to lay the groundwork for innovation organizations must make it easy for their employees to build networks talk to their peers share ideas and collaborate after studying networks in more than organizations weve found three problems that stifle innovation they share a couple of common themes the failure to effectively leverage the expertise of employees or their peers in partner organizations and the failure to react effectively when new ideas do arise but weve also found five steps companies can take to clear those barriers and start producing big ideas heres a look at the network problems and how to solve them the problems  no communication in any organization there are many people who could almost certainly team up to produce new ideas but often the structure of the company keeps them apart the problem could be simple logistics the workers may be in different departments or physical locations for instance or company bureaucracy could keep them from knowing theyre working in parallel on the same task or their bosses may dislike each other making collaboration tricky these problems can afflict even relatively small groups within a company consider the plight of a partner in a well known accounting firm who was leading a group of experts to develop new services after a year the group had produced few new offerings and the ones they did produce were often rejected by the firm what happened the partner had divided the experts into three groups that didnt work together effectively the researchers would come up with ideas then hand them off to technical specialists for vetting then the specialists would pass them along to marketers who would commercialize the concepts having each group take an individual isolated look at the ideas slowed things down considerably it also prevented the technical specialists and marketers from introducing new ideas themselves or getting an early say in the process so for instance ideas that just wouldnt work commercially often made it all the way to the marketers for vetting instead of getting shot down at the start  bad gatekeepers a second problem arises when a handful of experts dominate a companys information and decision making networks simply put these are people to whom employees must turn to find the information they need to do their job properly or to get approval for projects very often these gatekeepers hold their esteemed position for good reason they have technical expertise or other skills that have served the company well but they may not be the best judges of new ideas and their expertise in one area may in fact blind them to innovations in other areas we saw this in the research and development operation of a well known consumer products company where a group of microbiologists had become unofficial gatekeepers for new food product ideas of course microbiology is a crucial job in a food company since mistakes can result in substantial consumer health problems but the scientists experience led them to reject somewhat risky ideas out of hand never allowing them to reach formal review for instance some people at the company wanted to research low glycemic foods ones with slow to digest carbohydrates that make you feel fuller for longer periods the science behind these foods had led to successful products in canada and australia but the ideas were still new and controversial in the u s rather than take the risk the companys scientists squashed the idea and then saw competitors eventually enter this market with successful products  insularity to reduce development time and costs many companies are outsourcing innovation efforts major pharmaceutical companies for instance outsource of research and of development activities but many times these deals end in frustration because no one pays attention to how the partner companies communicate there are no formal lines of contact between the partners just informal connections between key employees consider a pharmaceutical company that wanted to make wider use of data gathered in tests for instance the company wanted to use results of experimental models to develop both cardiovascular and asthma drugs but that meant extensive collaboration between various groups in the company and its outside partners academic institutions research centers and other companies and the companys ties to those outside groups were concentrated in just a few people eighty percent of the interactions between the company and academia were one on one there was no system in place for backup people to take over if the regular contacts werent available so when some key scientists left the company big parts of the network simply collapsed nobody at the company knew the contact people at some partner organizations so the company had to spend lots of time and energy seeking out new people just as bad the scientists who left had lots of connections inside the company itself who helped them get things done another set of networks that had to be rebuilt the solutions  get the right people talking theres a crucial first step companies can take to improve innovation figure out what everyone inside the company knows and make sure they talk to people with complementary talents consider the r&amp d group from the consumer products organization we mentioned earlier its employees had the right range of skills to produce new ideas but they still werent innovating the company by the way never directly addressed the microbiologist stranglehold but it did make changes to ensure that worthy fringe ideas werent rejected out of hand we looked at the r&amp d employees skills and tried to match up people who would best complement each other to accomplish the companys goals as part of the effort management held an offsite conference in many cases people use these events to reconnect with others they already know but in this case everything was designed to get strangers talking for instance everyone was given an electronic name tag as they headed off for dinner and drinks at the end of the first day these badges which contained a host of information about the employees contacts and skills helped broker introductions when people approached someone they didnt know who had complementary skills the badge would light up and flash a welcome for instance "hi bob we should be talking about biochemistry " management looked at who made connections during the conference and let these new acquaintances work together on projects the effort paid off with some big advances for instance the company came up with customized packaging and designs for candy that commanded much higher prices than the companys traditional offerings  rapidly test and refine ideas with the rapid pace of change in many industries companies must clear up the decision making process to make it easier to push ideas through to the test stage if its not clear who has final say over a new idea or if too many people have a say it can lead to bottlenecks and sap the energy of those with big ideas leading them to avoid risky proposals clearing up those processes can help fight fear of failure and promote creativity one small pharmaceutical company found itself ensnared in a decision making trap brought on by extraordinary success in the market it hired experienced researchers to support a rapidly expanding product line but each new hire seemed to have a different model of how drug development ought to proceed some were accustomed to having considerable autonomy in decision making not making a business case until late in the cycle others made a point of evaluating the cost implications of each alternative before proceeding the process slowed to a crawl until senior management stepped in to resolve the situation they instituted a general process for decision making and established a few key rules to help researchers understand when to bring a choice to higher management companies must also clear up the building and testing process for new products that means having resources inside the organization that can be mobilized around a new opportunity such as a model shop devoted to turning ideas quickly into prototypes in some cases companies can improve their testing speed by turning to outside partners a company might tap a trusted supplier to quickly provide new and promising materials for instance or it might ask retail partners to make shelf space available for a brief test of a new product  think twice about leadership the people who usually get chosen to come up with new ideas are top performers in individual areas but they may not have connections within the company that are vital for getting the job done for instance a star engineer might be tapped to lead a big project but a lower level engineer who has worked in more divisions of the company might be a better choice since he or she could draw on broader knowledge and connections inside the organization take the case of a big industrial company with several different divisions these divisions worked in very different fields and prided themselves on having independent leadership made up of experts in their respective areas but the company faced a challenge when it wanted to come up with innovations that overlapped the divisions areas of expertise the different parts of the company were so autonomous that they didnt work well together to pool knowledge and develop new ideas to get around the problem executives at the parent company held brainstorming sessions with top technical talent from each of the divisions the results were dramatic among other things engineers from across the company came up with a big advance in a core technology that made it to market just three years later  make collaboration easy very often companies undermine their efforts by keeping workers sequestered in their groups we have seen collaboration between r&amp d groups stall when it took longer to get approval to "transfer" people from one project to another than to actually get the work done while executives will not be able to entirely overhaul organizations they can at least make sure that they arent impeding innovation one company for example established formal "dual citizenship" roles so that employees could work with more than one department at a time so for instance someone in r&amp d could collaborate with others in the business units without requiring juggling of budgets or formal reassignments  consider "energy" emotion plays a substantial role in networks if you feel positively about a co worker youre more likely to turn to him or her for help and advice and youre more likely to generate interesting ideas with that person than with someone who leaves you feeling drained or irritated so companies should map the energy and enthusiasm in their networks in other words ask people to say who leaves them feeling positively or negatively we helped a blue chip strategy organization along these lines for example it was clear that newcomers and low level employees werent energized by the organization and had a very high turnover rate part of the problem many senior partners were extremely tough to work with and robbed energy from the new staffers so the company strengthened a "start group" of recent employees where newcomers could go to discuss problems it also revised a mentoring program so that newcomers werent being trained by high level partners but rather by lower level and more energizing people who had lots of connections throughout the
