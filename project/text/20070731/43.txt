for parents of children with special needs public school offers no relief as the father of a mildly autistic first grade boy i would like to say thanks for your series of articles that have brought the challenges of special education to light when i tell family or friends the things we have had to endure they think i am exaggerating your articles and this one in particular "staying the course schools beat back demands for special ed services " page one july make me want to plead and beg all the more for real school choice and vouchers the public school system in this country is broken union thugs and overpaid fat cat administrators dont want things to change or improve because they are making vast sums of money on the backs of our children they dont seem to care if that includes children with special needs hired chiselers like paul kelly the new york state review officer for special education cases and kathleen surgalla an assistant counsel for the state education department set such a good example for the children by living together it takes real ethics to stick it to handicapped children william h cole saint charles mo your article makes reference to the supreme court ruling giving parents not school districts the burden of persuasion in special education hearings awarding decisions to districts in the rare case of a tie new york states implementation of the decision often forces parents to present the entire case cross examine witnesses and adhere to complex procedural requirements many parents are required to produce a complete record from documents held by school districts not by them this is a task for lawyers armed with subpoenas and the parents who can afford to hire them it is a task that poor parents including many who speak english as a second language do not have the resources to undertake the bill referenced in your article would fix the worst of the supreme court decisions and return the burden of proof to school districts marc brandt executive director nysarc inc delmar n y i can only heave a sigh of relief that our two children are out of school our daughter who is and has autism works in a sheltered workshop that allows her to be productive and to participate in the economy at large our son who is and is learning disabled has an excellent full time job and is able to live independently had the new york city public schools had their way neither success story would have happened my wife and i fought pitched battles with the school system for years before our demands were met in our sons case we won a placement in a private school a year and a half later he had gone from a mid first grade reading level to an eighth grade reading level he has a full academic high school diploma has taken some college level courses and now writes in his spare time school districts are always looking for ways to cut back on special education spending if they succeed they will create a generation of adults who will be less productive and more dependent which means that taxpayers will have to spend more to meet their basic needs edward j leahy jamaica n y as the white parent of an adopted african american child with a host of mental and physical issues i read your article with a great deal of interest our family lives in rural minnesota and our son attends our small k public school despite all these supposed strikes against his receiving a solid education i can honestly say that we have never encountered the difficulties described by the subjects of your article not once have we been forced to an administrative hearing or ever been at odds with the school but our sons issues are true physical and mental disabilities it would appear that the subjects of your article are primarily encountering resistance to unlimited special education services due to "social disabilities " not true "learning disabilities " as one subject of your article put it "kids dont kill themselves because they cant pass algebra they kill themselves because they dont have friends " this emphasis on social problems is exactly what causes the disconnect between some special education families and their districts while parents want their schools to be all things to all kids the simple fact is that schools arent equipped nor should they be to handle every imaginable issue that comes their way a public school isnt a therapists office it isnt equipped to teach a child with problems in social settings to deal with these issues paul kelly the new york state review officer for special education cases and kathleen surgalla an assistant counsel for the state education department set such a good example for the children by living together it takes real ethics to stick it to handicapped children michael j corbin medford minn
