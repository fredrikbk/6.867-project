politics &amp economics behind the wheel for auto makers mccurdy steers industry through fight over fuel economy rules former democratic rep dave mccurdy has faced uphill battles before he ran for a senate seat in at a time when voters were rejecting democrats en masse and he lost to a republican when he later took over the reins of a washington based business association republican lawmakers yanked legislation important to his group today mr mccurdy faces perhaps his stiffest test yet heading the alliance of automobile manufacturers a trade group representing detroits big three auto makers japans toyota motor corp and five other major car companies he is the industrys man in washington as concerns over global warming foreign oil dependence and high gasoline prices have created a daunting political atmosphere the most immediate challenge mr mccurdy confronts is a campaign by many in congress to impose significantly higher fuel efficiency requirements on auto makers meanwhile he must ensure that the squabbling competitors in his coalition maintain a unified approach on the issue for now that approach is to support a weaker fuel economy proposal or better yet to delay any potential legislative action until the fall "it was said of the duke of wellington that his strategy was to always march toward the sound of gunfire " said r james woolsey a former director of the central intelligence agency who has worked with mr mccurdy in several capacities since the s referring to the british general who defeated napoleon at waterloo "thats dave " besides the political skills and ties he forged during years serving in congress and nearly years lobbying it mr mccurdy possesses several other attributes that can help him in his job he is known as a consensus builder and has credibility working across party lines what mr mccurdy calls his "currency " the forces opposing mr mccurdy years old and the auto industry became clear last month when the senate voted to raise minimum requirements for vehicle fuel efficiency known as corporate average fuel economy or cafe by between and the senate bill would eliminate a crucial distinction between cars and trucks and mandate that auto makers fleets average miles a gallon by compared with the current miles a gallon the house may vote on similar legislation this week and president bush has signaled his support for toughening standards industry officials warn that the senate measure could cripple domestic auto makers by forcing them to accelerate a move toward producing fewer sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in favor of smaller less profitable models detroits big three are already struggling with enormous losses in the u s daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group about to be sold to a private equity firm amid its poor performance has said the senates requirements would bankrupt it mr mccurdy recognized a battle over mileage standards was coming when he agreed in december to lead the alliance after eight years heading the electronic industries alliance where he lobbied for copyright protections and free trade on behalf of high tech firms at the time the auto industry was reconsidering its longstanding opposition to fuel economy increases that strategy had worked well under a republican congress but mr mccurdy knew the industry would have to change its approach to engage the newly democratic congress many democratic lawmakers link detroits reliance on gas guzzling vehicles with the u s s dependence on foreign oil a former air force reservist with three older brothers mr mccurdy has a reputation in washington as a centrist democrat with strong national security credentials during his stint in congress he served on the house armed services committee and chaired the intelligence committee he briefly considered a presidential run in and later turned down president clintons offer to run the cia but save for a stint pumping gasoline as a teenager along route in yukon okla mr mccurdy had little auto related experience he read books on henry ford and other industry titans while boning up on the potential consequences of regulatory changes he assigned reading to his staff including "seven measures of success what remarkable associations do that others dont " he also brought in republican shane karr formerly an assistant secretary of transportation to spearhead the groups lobbying efforts one of mr mccurdys toughest tasks convincing the rival car makers in his coalition to agree on a unified fuel economy policy in the senate debate the groups inability to reach consensus became a major handicap it ran ads attacking the stringent mileage requirements under consideration and warned that smaller cars would make people less safe on roads only as bipartisan support grew for robust mileage increases did the group warm to a softer alternative offered by sen carl levin a michigan democrat and industry ally the support came too late and the tougher measure passed in june even after the defeat the auto makers didnt agree on a public response until the afternoon after the senate vote "it was a lesson learned which were certainly not repeating in the house " mr mccurdy said since then mr mccurdy has put his consensus building skills into action if he has any preconceived notions he closely guards them instead he likes to argue both sides of issues and solicit input from members to reach consensus with the house debate heating up the alliance is actively supporting a bipartisan measure backed by democratic rep baron hill of indiana and republican rep lee terry of nevada the measure would give auto makers two additional years to reach mileage targets beyond what the senate bill mandates and keep passenger cars and light duty trucks in separate categories the alliance has also teamed up with a broader coalition to lobby its case from suppliers and dealers to the united auto workers union and the national association of manufacturers and it has begun rolling out a series of ads with softer rhetoric "we dont have all the answers to questions about fuel economy standards " one print ad says "no one does but we are committed to helping find them " meanwhile mr mccurdy is putting his hard earned credibility with house members to the test his most vital ally is rep john dingell a michigan democrat who chairs the house energy and commerce committee mr dingell hopes to delay any cafe overhaul until the fall and then take it up as part of a broader climate change package mr mccurdy contributed &# to mr dingell earlier this year and mr dingell described mr mccurdy as "a good friend" in a recent interview if his foes push for a house vote soon mr mccurdy is confident the alliance and its allies can win more modest cafe changes "youre either at the table or youre on the menu " mr mccurdy said in the senate "we were on the menu " detroits man in washington born march in canadian texas service air force
