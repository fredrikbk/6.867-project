business technology talking tech tame email beast by giving it a rest who doesnt like complaining about email its the computer technology that we cant live without but which also seems to be doing a good job of ruining peoples lives aol which helped popularize email in the first place has done yearly studies of email usage studies that confirm the technology has for many people become an addiction for example a growing number of office workers plan their vacations around whether they will have access to email regina lewis who is aols "online consumer advisor " has some ideas about taming the beast q vacation used to be about unplugging from everything now many people take email with them wouldnt it be a better world if people went back to the old way a it takes guts and leverage and some confidence in your career to be able to unplug from email hats off to someone who does that but you have to know the field youre in and the state of your career than youre in on the flip side of the question before email there were probably people who didnt take vacations or who left one day later or were back at work one day sooner because they were tied to their office q how have devices like the blackberry changed email a it depends on your personality type on the one hand it makes you less reliant on your pc but sometimes people feel compelled to check email as it comes in they are having an almost knee jerk reaction to the blackberry vibrating you have to have a strategy for this since something that was designed to make you more productive is being disruptive one strategy is to put it in sleep mode which a lot of people dont even know you can do q what about in the office a one school of thought says "dont check it first thing in the morning " if i check it first thing in the morning at home the next thing i know is that the kids are late for school and im late for whatever meeting i am supposed to be at all because i was trying to get ahead but if you wait from a m until a m its amazing the things that get resolved in those two hours some people say they dont have that luxury but think about it do you not have that luxury or do you not take that luxury look at your inbox how much of that do you really need to see q what other features are people not using enough a the away message it buys you time you get the hall pass so the friend who wrote about the high school reunion isnt sending five or six more but using an away message doesnt mean you cant also log on for minutes a day while youre on vacation especially if youre the kind of person who will be thinking about it while youre sitting on the beach q anything else youve learned a i am a fan of the rule of three if it takes more than three e mails with the same person on the same topic maybe you should pick up the phone or walk over there also dont over reply there was a time when you replied to every email you got over replying is that one extra "ok " or "good" or "thanks " now that people have more and more email there is less expectation about hearing back from someone on every email instead of saying dont reply " it might be more tactful to say "no need to reply "
