betting on mergers can pay despite widening spreads investors always need a cast iron stomach to play merger mania but an added layer of teflon now might be required in recent days the so called spreads on pending deals have widened drastically over concerns that tighter financing could put the transactions in jeopardy the spreads which represent the difference between a sellers stock price and the price that a buyer has agreed to pay are particularly wide on deals where the buyers are private equity firms that are being financed in debt markets or funded by short term bank loans although the development has created nervousness among professional takeover speculators who profit when the spread narrows the widening gap could still prove to be an attractive play for investors willing to bet the deals get completed as planned in a report issued friday goldman sachs group inc recommended that investors bet on a basket of pending leveraged buyout transactions david kostin managing director for portfolio strategy calculated a average annualized return for the group based on current spreads and an assumption the deals will be completed under existing terms at a date estimated by goldman among the deals included in mr kostins basket are a proposed &# billion lbo of slm corp by a group led by j c flowers &amp co slms stock was trading at a nearly discount to the &# takeover price the spread widened considerably this month after the buyers notified the student lender known as sallie mae that pending legislation in congress could give them the right to walk away from the deal goldmans basket also includes a &# billion lbo of ceridian corp by private equity firm thomas h lee partners lp and fidelity national financial inc which is expected to close this year ceridians stock was trading at a discount of more than blackstone groups &# billion buyout of hilton hotels corp and its planned &# billion acquisition of alliance data systems corp are also part of the basket in recent weeks skittish investors have balked at a number of debt offerings that are tied to big deals because they offer few financial protections or carry yields that dont reflect potential risk as a result some of those debt offerings have been delayed or restructured in other cases the debt deals have been scrapped and the buyers have turned to their banks to provide short term "bridge" loans for the transactions although some of those deals havent been financed as originally planned they are still making it to the finish line the leveraged buyouts of dollar general corp and servicemaster co both ran into financing bumps that left banks holding the bag on the loans but both deals were completed this month yesterday a buyout group that is acquiring alliance atlantis communications inc delayed the deals completion by one week because it replaced a high yield or junk rated debt offering with bridge financing arranged by its banking syndicate peter schoenfeld who runs a fund that invests in takeover deals said investors should be cautious about the big lbo transactions because some of the financing details are kept under wraps "the expectation is that most deals will get consummated but there isnt perfect clarity as to what these bridge commitments look like so there is risk out there " he says indeed despite the widening spreads there havent been any clear signs that other pending deals are unraveling unlike many deals of the past most of the big lbo deals that are pending arent contingent on financing according to factset mergermetrics lbo deals with financing conditions fell to a single digit percentage rate this year from last year and in and buyers also havent triggered a mechanism that allows them to walk away from the deals if the buyers pay a fee to the target company typically of the transactions value furthermore analysts and takeover traders point to the recent steep decline in bank share prices as a further indication that pending deals are likely to get completed the bank stocks have been punished on views that the financial institutions will be left holding the bag on loans that cant be sold to other investors if that is the case it still means that the deals will get completed they say "it is impossible even for a wizard like harry potter to reconcile two facts stocks cannot both melt down because the market fears financial institutions will have to fund and hold leveraged loan commitments while at the same time shares of target companies sell off on the belief the same transactions will not close " mr kostin wrote investors may want to demonstrate some restraint however on betting on the next likely deal in a report issued last week that addressed the european deal market ubs ltd warned that some stocks viewed as potential buyout targets may now be at risk of losing their takeover premium among them adidas ag deutsche post ag experian group plc reed elsevier plc smith &amp nephew plc and tnt nv "we estimate mega cap lbos of plus billion euros &# plus billion are off the table until the existing pipeline of loans can be repriced and placed and leveraged credit markets stabilized " wrote ubs analyst daniel stillit in the u s takeover traders cited real estate stocks such as starwood hotels &amp resorts worldwide inc and post properties inc as among those that recently have fallen after rising on speculation they would be lbo bait dana cimilluca contributed to this article
