snowman video in youtube debate chills some politicos brothers who created it are all the rage but gop doesnt entirely get it minneapolis just a week ago nathan and greg hamel didnt know whether their talking snowman would be picked to ask a question during the cnn youtube democratic presidential debate now their second video which asked candidates about their environmental policies has turned "billiam the snowman" into a cold wet symbol of all thats good and bad about efforts by voters and politicians to use the internet to reach one another "snowman wins " declared the chicago sun times after the debate msnbc personality tucker carlson wrinkling his nose at "these homemade videos " nonetheless declared "this is the future " the unemployed hamel brothers who live with their parents in a suburb of minneapolis have done interviews with local television snagged a spot on the wisconsin public radio game show "whadya know " and are working on a line of "billiam the snowman" t shirts theyve also launched a "billiam the snowman" presidential exploratory committee online "we figured if he won the debate he might as well run for president " nathan says meanwhile the snowman has cast a chill over some republicans who were scheduled to get the youtube treatment in september and arent quite sure what to make of it the hamel brothers couldnt be happier about the attention at last count the question has been watched times on youtube "it means our minutes of fame may stretch to " says nathan years old who created the snowman with his year old brother greg who does the voice greg graduated from college last year and is now applying to law school nathan recently returned home from japan where he taught english for two years before billiam the brothers youtube videos borrowed heavily from hong kong action movies the "lord of the rings" trilogy and their favorite videogames their titles include "sandwich of rage" which is about a killer sandwich "i learned to fight from videogames" and "lawn chair jousting " billiam made his first appearance in february when he starred in a hamel video about a snowman with a squeaky voice who gets decapitated in slow motion by a sword wielding warrior at the time the snow in the family backyard had begun to melt and the tangerines used for the snowmans eyes kept popping out the brothers named their creation billiam because of gregs longtime annoyance with people who shorten the name william to bill "why wouldnt it be will " he asks as greg studied for his law school admissions test the brothers took a break from making videos then in june time warner inc s cnn and youtube announced a contest to pose videoed questions to presidential candidates the brothers began tossing ideas back and forth they decided to recycle some billiam footage and re edited the baby carrots they had used as his mouth to change his facial expression greg wrote a script on a yellow legal pad and recorded the question on the microphone of a sony camera he chose the bathroom as a set because of its excellent acoustics then the pair retreated to their third floor lair which is strewn with videogames and hunched over their mac powerbook they put the second video together in about two hours they say "we wanted the question to be totally serious " nathan says the brothers didnt think cnn would use a funny question about global warming so billiam asked "as president what will you do to ensure that my son will live a full and happy life " gesturing to a mini snowman at his feet cnn didnt contact the brothers to let them know their question would be used but the hamels had a hunch it might they discovered via a fan site devoted to anchor anderson cooper who moderated the cnn youtube debate that he had run the clip on his cnn show one night the brothers figured it might make the debate if only in a montage of "loser clips " so they invited friends and their parents to a debate watching party over pepperoni pizza in the familys den billiams appearance drew a cheer from the hamel household titters from the audience and scorn from some others "it was a presidential debate for cryin out loud and cnns decision to give airtime to a stack of frozen water lowered it to the level of an internet chat room " wrote a blogger for national journal a washington politics magazine "i dont know that it makes sense to have people running for president answering questions posed by snowmen " said former massachusetts gov mitt romney on c span a few days after telling a new hampshire reporter he found the debate undignified mr romney later admitted he hadnt watched it mr romney announced hell miss the debate because of scheduling issues former new york mayor rudy giuliani also cited scheduling conflicts for skipping the sept debate which cnn now says it may reschedule republican internet consultants are sputtering with disbelief "with all of the challenges were facing next year the last thing we need to do is snub a medium that millions are embracing " says patrick ruffini a blogger and former internet consultant for mr giuliani the top three democratic presidential candidates collectively outraised the top three republican candidates in online donations by about &# million in the first half of the year according to campaign finance reports other than internet favorite ron paul a texas congressman republican candidates continue to befriend fewer people on facebook and myspace than democrats receive fewer visitors to their official web sites and sign up fewer supporters to fund raising email lists david bohrman a cnn senior vice president says there were plenty of crazy questions among the nearly submitted cnn tried to pick those that illuminated differences between the candidates while also providing moments of levity he says he rejects complaints about the snowman video it "wasnt disrespectful in any way " he says "you need to know if a president has a sense of humor " the hamel brothers for their part say they arent particularly political both voted for massachusetts sen john kerry in but they dont feel comfortable being called democrats "i guess id say im an independent its more about the candidate for me " says nathan as greg nods in agreement the young men say billiam will indeed be submitting a question for the republican debate but they dont know what it will be cnns mr bohrman says he isnt inclined to use another question from the snowman but wont rule it out but global warming aside the republican debate may be the end for billiam "we think his voice is pretty annoying " says greg who does the voice
