lilly bucks trend in biotech pursuit as competitors buy way in signs point to payoff from in house program like almost every other old line drug maker eli lilly &amp co wants to get deeper into the lucrative game of selling expensive biotechnology medicines but unlike its competitors lilly isnt buying its way into biotechnology with large acquisitions instead it has been trying to build a biotech drug pipeline from within the take it slow in house approach shows signs of paying off but the company has yet to prove to many investors and others in the industry that it has become a major presence in biotech this year half of lillys drugs entering human testing will be biotech drugs up from less than in the company said though it wont disclose specifics by lilly has promised wall street that it will bring to market one new biotech product each year an ambitious target for a company that has invented only a handful of such products in its year history lilly says it has invested &# billion in its biotech drive in the past three years venturing deeper into biotechnology carries risks biotech drugs large molecules made from living cells are more complicated to make than drugs made from traditional chemical compounds known as small molecule drugs as a result they can cost several hundred million dollars more to bring to market and require dedicated manufacturing lines that is also why they are so lucrative their complexity has so far shielded them from generic competition and lets manufacturers charge higher prices though that could change as congress debates whether to create a way for the food and drug administration to approve cheaper copies of biotech drugs one plus is that their potential to hit disease targets more precisely often allows them to make it through labs more quickly and with fewer side effects lilly based in indianapolis made insulin out of pig tissue starting in and licensed the technology to make the first biotech drug human insulin from genentech in but lilly fell behind that biotech pioneer and until earlier this decade its forays into biotechnology were haphazard five years ago after the loss of marketing exclusivity on its best selling antidepressant prozac sent its stock tumbling it deepened its commitment to the field in its only major acquisition in it bought applied molecular evolution inc a company that makes technology to improve protein design for &# million by contrast astrazeneca plc of london just paid &# billion for biotech company medimmune inc so far the biotech push hasnt reversed lillys stock market fortunes of the major drug companies its share price declined the most last year falling by the company has been beset by lawsuits that have tarnished the reputation of its best selling schizophrenia drug zyprexa and pipeline hopefuls have stumbled zyprexa loses patent protection in and shortly thereafter lilly stands to lose exclusivity on many other top drugs lillys second quarter profit released last week dropped to &# million from &# million in the year earlier period largely because of acquisition related charges revenue rose to &# billion from &# billion lilly spent an analyst meeting in december trying to get investors to buy into its biotech transformation most attendees though focused on its main blockbuster hopeful in late stage human testing a chemical compound to prevent blood clots called prasugrel "lilly is the no biotech company by sales but it doesnt show up on peoples lists " says john lechleiter lillys president and chief operating officer barbara ryan an analyst who covers lilly at deutsche bank ag says "theres no magic wand that gets waved when a company is admitted to the biotech club if more of lillys revenues were from biologics then the market would view their earnings persistency as greater " aside from its large financial investment part of which went to pay for a &# million new biotech complex in indianapolis lilly has had to meld two different scientific cultures chemistry and biology biologists and chemists tend to take different approaches to developing products some old line drug companies making the shift to biotechnology through acquisitions have kept their biologists separate from their chemists for fear of stifling the formers creativity and entrepreneurial spirit lilly wanted the two sides to work together thinking they could benefit from a joint approach to scientific challenges "to differentiate ourselves we need to integrate " says sidney taurel lillys chief executive william chin vice president of discovery research who runs lillys scientists on a day to day basis says tensions can arise between the two groups over turf "were talking about biology and chemistry two disciplines with their own history and world so theres a natural pride and envy a yankees and red sox sort of thing " he says several senior scientists probably wished the new biotech team would "go away " to get the two groups to cooperate lilly created clusters of senior scientists with small and large molecule backgrounds called "drug hunting" teams and made them work together based on disease specialties lilly also changed its rewards system to praise scientists for cooperating giving cash awards to groups that effectively "synergized " says dr chin it recently honored one group for working together on a new protein for diabetes by letting it present at an internal lilly meeting called the "grand rounds " one early skeptic of the strategy was steven paul lillys chief of research and development a psychiatrist by training dr paul admits he wasnt very interested in biotech drugs at first because the large complex molecules cant usually pass through the blood brain barrier as a small molecule researcher his bias was toward drugs like prozac which helped define lilly as a premier neuroscience center in the s "three or four years ago i was getting depressed " says dr paul adding that he asked himself "do we have enough science to come up with the next generation" of neurological drugs but dr pauls own lab surprisingly came up with a biotech drug for alzheimers that is thought to work by attaching to and clearing out disease causing plaque it is now one lillys of most advanced biotech projects in the second of three phases of human testing and has helped make dr paul one of the biggest proponents of the companys biotech strategy
