business technology mashups sew data together software tools can cut costs time for linking information sources as hurricane katrina approached the gulf coast in august storm trackers at schumacher group a lafayette la company that manages physicians for emergency rooms consulted a variety of information sources tv weather reports a map studded with pins representing homes of nearby doctors and a computerized phone book to make sure hospitals would be fully staffed almost one month later by the time hurricane rita hit the storm trackers had new software that let them see weather conditions along with location and contact information for area physicians overlaid on a map all on one screen douglas menefee schumacher groups chief information officer says the hurricane tracking software took one developer less than two days to build thanks to a new technology called "mashups " more and more companies including audi ag the ingolstadt germany unit of volkswagen ag and accuweather inc of state college pa are adopting the same technology mashups essentially are a way to take data trapped in separate software applications and combine them into new hybrid applications at most companies data typically have been stored in silos customer information is in a customer management system for example and information about order status is in an inventory management system while the concept of stitching together these different systems isnt new it traditionally has been one of the most costly and complicated projects an information technology department can undertake mashups however are cheap and easy to build international business machines corp and microsoft corp among others recently released easy to use mashup building tools ibm in february launched qedwiki which provides developers with a portal where they can choose which applications to include in a mashup and define how they want these applications to work together microsofts mashup tool popfly works with its sharepoint collaboration software google inc has let developers make mashups with its popular mapping software since developers simply use the mashup building software to combine existing applications into a new one creating software designed specifically for the way small groups or individual employees work which would be prohibitively expensive using traditional integration methods and mashup development tools are so intuitive to use that ultimately non information technology workers should be able to make their own mashups says oliver young an analyst at forrester research inc a mashup "combines data from disparate sources into something that is more valuable than the sum of its parts " says mr young he estimates about of companies use mashups in one form or another developers at audi recently built a mashup that helps product managers for the companys a series line of autos perform competitive analyses the mashup draws data from different sources ranging from audis inventory system to demographic figures on german web site spiegel online audis product managers used to check each of the sources individually and copy the results into spreadsheets while the task was time consuming and inconvenient audis information technology department didnt want to pay as much as &# to combine all of the data into one application using traditional software integration techniques says anton hermann kramm a member of audis it management team but using a mashup tool from kapow technologies inc one developer was able to build the new application in just four days for a fraction of that cost mr kramm says developers at audi have built about mashups using data from nearly sources mashups dont work across the board only software that can be accessed with a web browser can be included in a mashup that means applications that are accessed through software installed directly on a workers computer including many business systems from sap ag and oracle corp cant be included in a mashup without some complex work data that reside on mainframe computers are also hard to use in a mashup mashups arent immune to the challenges of linking disparate tech systems says mirko minnich vice president and chief architect at thomson scientific a unit of thomson corp a mashup that combines various sources of data is useful only if all systems identify the information in the same way for instance and as usual issues like security and standards must be considered
