lonely voice venezuelan cable station faces chavez showdown after loss of license feisty rctv returned a second crisis looms caracas venezuela a samba band snaked through the studios of radio caracas television on july to celebrate the broadcasters return as a cable station just seven weeks after president hugo chavez refused to renew the stations broadcast license knocking it off the air the new cable version of rctv called rctv international was just as feisty as the broadcast version had been popular anchorman miguel angel rodriguez started his show with a chavez critic who blasted the arrest of four university students for handing out political leaflets during a soccer game next a catholic bishop warned that venezuela was sliding toward totalitarianism "im so happy to be back " beamed rctv co anchor luisiana rios but the celebration turned out to be premature the chavez government last week announced legal requirements that may force rctv international off cable outlets tomorrow possibly silencing the opposition broadcaster for good essentially the chavez government is requiring rctv international a miami based company which gets much of its programming from caracas based rctv and transmits to latin america to register as a venezuelan content producer the registration requirements which include airing mr chavezs marathon speeches would make the cable venture economically "unfeasible " says marcel granier rctvs chief executive officer rctv internationals managers are considering their options so are venezuelas cable and satellite tv operators who worry that if they continue to carry rctv international programs the chavez government will hit them with heavy fines says mario seijas the president of the pay tv association of venezuela whose members include both satellite and cable operators rctvs travails show how difficult it has become to remain politically independent during the tenure of mr chavez who has said he needs to exert a "new hegemony" over most aspects of venezuelan life to create "st century socialism " in recent years mr chavez has moved to squelch political opposition and to extend his brand of left wing politics to neighboring countries his efforts to control the domestic media threaten to silence a key mass outlet for opposing views since winning a landslide re election in december he has nationalized the countrys leading telecommunications and energy companies and taken majority control of major oil projects from foreign oil companies hes tightened his grip as well on the countrys armed forces who now salute superiors with a slogan popularized decades ago by cuban dictator fidel castro "socialism fatherland or death " in the weeks ahead mr chavez plans to unveil a draft of a new constitution that is expected to include an end to presidential term limits mr chavez has had a turbulent relationship with venezuelas media since he was first elected in as disenchantment grew over mr chavezs radicalization and over his close relationship with mr castro the four major private broadcasters together with the nations unions and business association moved to fill the power vacuum caused by the collapse of venezuelas established political parties mr chavez dubbed the broadcasters the "four horsemen of the apocalypse " during three turbulent days in april when mr chavez lost power in a coup attempt and then regained it private broadcasters lined up with the opposition and didnt broadcast pro chavez protests that together with the broadcasters support later that year for a two month general strike against the chavez government earned the broadcasters mr chavezs enmity the broadcasters deny having anything to do with the coup and say they couldnt report events because it was too dangerous for their reporters to do so mr chavez has denounced broadcasters as tools of the rich and has used their need to renew government broadcast licenses as a pressure point billionaire gustavo cisneros who with his brother ricardo owns rctvs main rival corporacion venezolana de television ca known as venevision met with mr chavez at a caracas army base in afterward venevision softened its news coverage and canceled a show by napoleon bravo an acerbic political commentator "we stopped putting salt and pepper on the news " says mr cisneros "it was a matter of survival " rctv however kept hammering at the chavez government its newscasts focused on a growing crime wave in caracas and provided a voice both to chavez foes and to supporters who complained about the governments inability to provide housing and other services "facing a totalitarian regime you can either adapt to it thinking you will survive or you can confront it " says mr granier rctvs chief executive who owns a large stake in the station rctvs management figured that the stations popularity would protect it from attack by the chavez government which already was being criticized internationally but in december shortly after mr chavez was re elected he announced that the government wouldnt renew rctvs broadcasting license this may he cited the stations alleged links to the failed coup when the government closed the station it seized rctvs transmitters and equipment worth &# million to use for a new government station that is now using rctvs broadcast frequencies mr granier says the shuttering of rctv sparked international criticism and a nationwide student movement to defend civil liberties but mr chavez refused to budge now globovision an all news channel that reaches about of venezuelan households is the only remaining broadcaster that sharply criticizes mr chavez it too has been threatened with closure by the government another broadcaster televen has made compromises taking a program that regularly disparaged the government off the air although it still broadcasts some news that is critical meanwhile over the past five years the number of government channels has gone from one to six venezuelas congress and other chavez controlled government entities such as the municipality of caracas have started tv stations that take the government line and criticize mr chavezs enemies the loss of rctvs broadcast license crippled the station which had revenue of about &# million a year says mr granier rctv and venevision have been perennial rivals for the top spot in venezuelas ratings race rctvs broadcasts had reached of venezuelas more than million households venezuelas cable and satellite tv channels by comparison reach just half of the nations households if it remade itself as a cable station rctv figured it might lose of its advertising revenue it was unsure how many of its employees it could retain even so rctv thought it could survive it could count on the goodwill of many venezuelans in some public opinion polls eight out of venezuelans many of them supporters of mr chavez opposed the presidents move to close rctv during the seven weeks rctv was off the air globovision provided an hour of broadcast time for rctv to air its news show which quickly won top ratings rctv executives also figured that the companys international visibility would enable it to line up new cable customers elsewhere in latin america and among u s hispanics new technology also held promise even though the chavez government had banned rctv reporters from many government offices including those of the president and vice president the station kept reporting news events the reports were carried on the stations web site and on cable by caracol tv a colombian broadcasting ally when rctvs web site crashed due to heavy traffic the station posted segments on youtube the stations on air personalities tried to keep the station alive in the minds of viewers stars taped future episodes of soaps rctv presented top rated shows such as "radio rochela " a long running satire and "who wants to be a millionaire " a quiz show live in two town squares in caracass suburbs drawing large crowds "none of us knew how important we were to our public " says juliet lima the young star of camaleona one of rctvs top soaps rctv began laying plans to transform itself into a cable channel that would use miami based rctv international a related company that shares some stockholders with rctv to transmit its programming to cable subscribers in venezuela and other countries it already had experience in that field it long had sold programming to rctv international which was already marketing rctv shows and programming from other nations around the world by sending programming through rctv international rctv figured it wouldnt be required to follow venezuelan domestic broadcast regulations including having to air mr chavezs hours long speeches and news conferences last week for instance venezuelas domestic stations had to broadcast hours of mr chavezs ruminations about the health of his friend mr castro and the high quality of cuban cows among other things on july rctv relaunched as a cable station in its new incarnation it increased the amount of time devoted to news and opinion to six hours a day from hours the first two weeks looked promising with the station drawing high ratings caracas newspapers ran front page stories describing how poor venezuelans in shantytowns ringing the capital in order to get rctv international were pooling resources to buy satellite dishes and subscriptions to cable television a photograph in el universal a leading newspaper showed a barrio family of eight watching the predawn inaugural broadcast on its newly purchased satellite service rctvs executives cautioned that the cable company would face immense financial challenges "we wont make money for many years " said julian isaac rctvs vice president in charge of marketing "we are not even talking about breaking even " some major advertisers remained supportive such as empresas polar a beer and food maker that is the largest private company left in venezuela others canceled their ads says pablo mendoza rctvs vice president of market studies last week the chavez government further increased the pressure writing to cable tv carriers telecommunications minister jesse chacon told them that miami based rctv international must register as a domestic content producer subject to venezuelan domestic regulation if rctv international doesnt comply cable and satellite tv operators will be required drop the channel by tomorrow or pay heavy fines mr chacon told reporters he saw no difference between rctv and rctv international because "they generate all their information in venezuela and their production is aimed at venezuelan society " rctv international he said was just a "mechanism" to try and avoid venezuelan regulations "we dont have a choice" about dropping the channel says mr seijas the president of the pay tv association one association member that carries the rctv signal is directtv owned by news corp which is negotiating to buy dow jones &amp co the publisher of the wall street journal mr seijas says that directtvs position is the same as the associations rctvs mr granier contends that "the government is trying to intimidate the cable operators " and that the requirement is illegal as an international cable operator he says rctv international is comparable to the disney channel and cnn and shouldnt have to register as a domestic firm although most of rctvs programming is still produced in venezuela the company says its channel includes content from other international providers such as televisa and tv azteca of mexico and time warner inc s warner brothers entertainment unit in the u s rctv internationals signal also is carried by cable operators in aruba curacao and trinidad and tobago mr granier says he plans to appeal the governments decision and hopes to persuade satellite tv stations to continue to carry rctv international he also is planning to beef up what he calls "strategic alliances" with other broadcasters and cable operators in the region to carry rctv programming some of those stations like colombias caracol tv are seen on venezuelan cable tv a fallback position is for rctv to continue producing soaps and other programming mr granier is not sure hell be able to continue the aggressive news coverage and political satire that has so irked mr chavez "we will have to re evaluate things " he says ms lima the soap opera star is disheartened two weeks ago she felt her stations own drama would turn out to be a defeat for mr chavez "like all soap operas there is a villain who makes life impossible for everybody but then in the last chapter the villain gets his just deserts " she says smiling now she says shes not so sure "i feel we are starting out from zero again " she says
