claude monets impressions on paper not in paint the unknown monet sterling and francine clark art institute through sept williamstown mass a line may take us hours maybe but if it does not seem a moments thought our stitching and unstitching has been naught " so said william butler yeats in "adams curse " yeats was thinking of poetry but his insight bears equally on the craft of painters especially those like the impressionists who pretend to give the sense of having dashed off something en plein air in the heat of the inspiring moment art is never so easy of course poets and painters must strive hard to achieve apparent spontaneity just when you thought that another impressionism show would be an impossibility the sterling and francine clark art institute has mounted "the unknown monet pastels and drawings" through sept formerly at londons royal academy of arts there are always reasons to visit the berkshires especially during the summer months and the clark remains a perennial tourist favorite the title if not the substance of this show is something of a stretch marketing hyperbole that nevertheless does not detract from the works including pastels three dozen drawings four sketchbooks as well as prints and paintings on display it is the first exhibit to focus on monets works on paper on the one hand monet himself was responsible for his image as an "impressionist " painting directly from nature on the other it has long been known that he valued draftsmanship in he said "ive never liked to separate drawing from color " and right from the start as a teenager he worked with pencil chalk and crayon on paper already making accomplished landscape sketches and honing his line his catalogue raisonne lists items on paper within a work oeuvre early caricatures indicate that he might have become another daumier using his skills as a realistic even satiric portraitist theres also a stunning red chalk portrait of a beautiful woman at the first impressionist exhibition he showed seven pastels along with his oils so "unknown" is hardly the right word and although we can see how easily pencil or crayon demands attention to the fact and idea of the "line " pastel like watercolor tends to blur lines so by the time we are looking at late pastels and paintings of londons waterloo and charing cross bridges there is really little sense of a bounding defining line only shapes suggested by fields of color one exciting part of the show is the inclusion of monets notebooks both pages under glass and a computer generated show that allows visitors to leaf through hundreds of pages on a virtual tour of his career the musee marmottan monet owns eight of these pocket sized things which contain almost years of work some of the sketches are so rudimentary even primitive especially the late pencil preparations for the great "water lilies" that its tempting to say "but my child could do this " and indeed they look like scribbles that proud parents post on refrigerators monet was always moving back and forth between media the show begins with black and white pencil drawings proceeds to pastels and then colored lithographs and some gouaches interspersed with paintings based on or at least paralleled by adjacent works on paper landscape always predominated in monets eyes but as a young man he was at least as interested in portraiture as nature always entrepreneurial he also took advantage of lithography to market his work and the exhibition contains selections from an edition of prints that monet helped william thornley produce of his paintings the project was something of an economic failure for understanding both differences among the media and also monets distinctive accomplishments the most instructive groupings are those of an oil painting alongside two or three pastel or crayon renderings of the same scene several of these stand out an oil of two fishermen uses thick soupy green brushstrokes to create water and shore grass the following year monet reproduced the painting in black crayon and scratchwork on special gillot paper later re reproduced in an art journal calligraphic precision black scratched lines and gouged out white ones have replaced his characteristic broad and daring brushwork the painting sings out the drawing hums sotto voce the exhibits last room offers similar examples we see quick pencil sketches nothing but horizontal lines really and "water lilies" in oil without color without paints thickness we would have no final flowering of monets genius the pencil sketches would have no importance without the paintings such is not the case with the two other pairings in this room two oils of charing cross bridge and waterloo bridge and five pastels of the same views at this point we are struck not by the distinctions between but the overlapping of finished oils and deeply atmospheric pastels different means of achieving similar ends streaks and spirals and a varied palette all give us londons hazy presence this show offers plenty of pleasure a visual picnic on a summers day if the eye is still hungry however you should stop downstairs for dessert in june the clark announced a bequest from the manton foundation created by the late sir edwin a g manton no longer will the yale center for british art be the symbolic western wing of londons tate gallery the
