bad company american and indian diplomats have now completed negotiations for the u s india civil nuclear accord also known as a agreement after a section of the u s atomic energy act that governs such deals the agreement which bridges the gap between what congress approved late last year and the conditions demanded by indias government would allow india to purchase u s nuclear technology and fuel ostensibly for civilian purposes only whether new delhi abides by that commitment is another matter india first tested a nuclear device in using plutonium it had illicitly diverted from a canadian built reactor a point apparently forgotten by undersecretary of state nick burns who noted in a press conference friday that "unlike iran india has not violated its nuclear obligations " but never mind prime minister manmohan singh is not the noxious indira gandhi is not and there are defensible reasons to support a deal cementing a strategic relationship between two great democracies foremost among them but that doesnt mean any deal under any circumstances nor does it mean that mr burns is entitled to shade what some of those circumstances entail especially as they relate to indias curiously solid ties to iran take the following statement by mr burns "i would disagree that somehow theres a burgeoning military relationship between india and iran " now take an item from the march issue of defensenews under the headline "india iran form joint group to deepen defense ties " according to the report the agreement "which follows the broader strategic partnership accord the two countries signed in emerged from high level talks held here during the march visit of rear adm sajjad kouchaki badlani commander of irans navy " or consider this burnsian nugget "weve made the argument that india has not proliferated its nuclear technology that india in effect outside the nuclear nonproliferation treaty system has played by the rules " yet in september the u s sanctioned chaudhary surendar and y s r prasad both former chairmen of indias state run nuclear power corporation "for allegedly passing nuclear secrets to tehran " according to a march report in this newspaper though state later dropped the sanctions on dr surendar they remain in force against dr prasad who is believed to have passed on "the technology needed to extract tritium from heavy water nuclear reactors " iran is currently building such a reactor in arak tritium can be used to boost the yields of atomic bombs dr prasad denies the charges that is not all last year state slapped sanctions on two indian companies for selling iran precursor chemicals for rocket fuel and chemical weapons in april the department of justice released a count indictment against two indian individuals "on charges of supplying the indian government with controlled technology " including "electrical components that could have applications in missile guidance and firing systems " in an eye opening article in the current issue of the washington quarterly christine fair notes that "india has developed intelligence outposts in iran including the indian consulate in zahedan and a relatively new consulate in bandar abbas which provides india significant power projection advantages in any future conflict with pakistan " ms fair a research associate at the united states institute of peace also notes that "in the past india helped iran develop submarine batteries that were more effective in the warm weather persian gulf waters than its russian manufactured batteries and is planning to sell iran the konkurs antitank missile " advocates of the u s nuclear deal with india recognize these facts but they argue that they are largely driven by indias need for energy which explains the mile gas pipeline being built between india and iran thus says mr burns "the agreement also gives india greater control and security over its energy supplies making it less reliant on imports from countries like iran " would that this were even half true indias relationship with iran is driven as much by the desire to encircle pakistan and gain access to afghanistan as it is by energy concerns then too nuclear power which can only provide base load electrical demand cannot by itself supplant the need for hydrocarbons "any time you increase the base load generating capacity of a country you generally must increase the amount of peak load capacity to match it " says nonproliferation expert henry sokolski "and the most efficient peak load generators are natural gas fired " put simply its hard to see how building nuclear power will reduce indias interest in iranian natural gas none of this has gone unnoticed in congress in may seven members of the house committee on foreign affairs sent a letter to prime minister singh raising concerns about the indo iranian relationship mr singh received a similar letter from eight u s senators including republican jon kyl and democrat barbara boxer the letters were never answered "you can take a sledgehammer to the heads of the indians about this issue and they still wont get it " complains a congressional staffer actually the indians are starting to get it "we are aware of our responsibilities and we know the danger of an iran with nuclear weapons " says raminder singh jassal indias deputy chief of mission in washington he dismisses the naval visits as "ceremonial" and insists "we know how to calibrate our relationship with iran without compromising on essentials " maybe thats true or maybe the u s and india have different notions of what a "calibrated" relationship means but if congress is going to punch a hole in the npt to accommodate india with all the moral hazard that entails for the nonproliferation regime it should get something in return getting india to drop and drop completely its presumptively ceremonial military ties to iran isnt asking a lot see related letters "letters to the editor geographic economic and political
