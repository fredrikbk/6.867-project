davis bacon on the farm the overstuffed farm bill now waddling through congress toward a possible veto by president bush has attracted so much waste that everyone with a genuine interest in agriculture is feeling disheartened yet the bill has earned unlikely support from the labor union lobby hmmm could this be at all related to a new and unprecedented davis bacon requirement for ethanol construction davis bacon is the depression era holdover that forces federal construction contracts to pay a "prevailing union wage" determined by the department of labor rather than a market wage this anachronism was attached to the bill last week by house democrats a staffer tells us hes never before seen davis bacon in a farm bill the bill is flush with subsidies to produce ethanol the corn based alternative fuel that still cant compete on a free market basis more ethanol requires more biorefineries democrats plan to mandate davis bacon wages for workers building those refineries with nonunion builders unable to compete on price each new refinery could cost as much as more in many rural areas with little or no union activity this artificially high labor cost could even make the prospect of building an ethanol plant a net loss because ethanol production would be significantly more expensive under davis bacon and because the government requires ethanol in gasoline ordinary americans would foot the bill for this union handout in the form of higher prices at the gas pump that veto is looking more attractive by the moment
