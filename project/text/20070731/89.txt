politics &amp economics setback for japans ruling party clouds agenda legislature may resist efforts by abes bloc as election boosts foes tokyo sundays election setback for japans ruling party could put on hold the era of bold shake ups that boosted its economy over the past five years in an election determining half the seats in the upper house prime minister shinzo abes ruling coalition won seats compared with for the main opposition the democratic party of japan the defeat doesnt mean an end to the current administration the lower house where the coalition has a large majority chooses the prime minister the upper house has limited powers largely confined to approving legislation mr abe said yesterday he would push forward with policies aimed at generating stronger economic growth but his administration will find it harder to pass laws without upper house support something that could slow his plans to shrink the government and improve inefficient sectors of the economy for example parliament this month passed a law to revise a system in which former bureaucrats take cushy jobs at firms they once supervised something long viewed as a source of corruption but his other plans might now take longer mr abe wants to forge more free trade agreements and improve the environment for financial services in order to attract more international business to tokyo a reduction in such moves would matter because japans past five years of economic recovery were linked to former prime minister junichiro koizumis aggressive moves to fix big structural problems that were holding back growth mr koizumi cut public spending cleaned up the countrys banking mess and weakened the power of japans bureaucrats he also passed laws to privatize the postal service where the savings and insurance arms funnel money into government spending projects that are widely seen as wasteful under mr koizumi the stock market got a boost from a wide overhaul of corporate laws designed to improve corporate governance and make takeovers easier for example parliament approved legislation that allows foreign companies to use their own shares to pay for acquisitions a change that makes mergers and acquisitions easier regulators also pushed to make companies more transparent a year ago japans accounting oversight body requested disciplinary action against the countrys four biggest accountancies citing concerns over auditing standards the tokyo stock exchange also cracked down on corporate scofflaws stripping prestigious companies including cosmetics maker kanebo corp of their listings for manipulating their books some analysts say mr koizumis dynamism emboldened investors to challenge companies asking for higher dividends stronger returns and more share buybacks over the past five years the total amount of dividends paid over the same period also doubled "koizumi talked the reformist language and that helped set the tone " says jonathan allum japan strategist at kbc financial products "abe is much more conventional " tokyos stock market the worlds second largest by market capitalization is now above a two decade low of reached april that compares with a rise of in the dow jones industrial average over the same period yesterday the nikkei stock average of companies inched up points or to close at as investors snapped up shares that appeared to have fallen too far in last weeks plunge one danger after sundays result is a return to the pre koizumi era of big public spending on roads and bridges mr abes liberal democratic party lost a lot of support among country voters who felt abandoned and liked the dpj pledges of income subsidies to farmers any ldp move to spend its way back to popularity would hamper efforts to reduce japans huge government debt but economists say the government is determined to reduce the debt "we do not think the ldp will expand fiscally a lot " says takuji aida chief economist in tokyo for barclays capital instead he says "they will change the content of spending to safety nets for local economies and child care they will try to cut in other areas such as on central government employees " in the longer term voters in japans wealthy cities like tokyo and nagoya appear to want more of the small government changes started under mr koizumi a large reason they rejected mr abe is that they were unconvinced of his ability to lead such moves to make japans economy more competitive that essentially means they want another prime minister like mr koizumi and will vote for one if he or she comes along
