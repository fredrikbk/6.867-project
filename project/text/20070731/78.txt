politics &amp economics australia pushes clean coal fears of a backlash against top export drive effort sydney australia australias efforts to protect one of its most vital industries in an age when "coal" is a dirty word place the country at the forefront of global efforts to burn the fuel more cleanly australia is the worlds biggest coal exporter and coal is the countrys no export generating more than billion australian dollars or more than us&# billion in revenue each year local politicians and mining executives worry that a backlash against coal fuel believed to be a main contributor to global warming could imperil the industry and erode australias economic competitiveness now australians are trying to position themselves as cutting edge innovators in so called clean coal technology such technologies aim to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere when power plants burn coal to generate electricity in many cases the projects plan to bury co a gas linked to global warming by capturing and injecting it into the ground in may anglo australian miner rio tinto ltd and bp plc of the u k unveiled plans to build a a&# billion coal fired power plant known as kwinana in western australia that would bury most of its co in an offshore underground reservoir another major project zerogen developed in part by a government controlled company in the australian state of queensland would perform a similar feat if it is built these large projects could easily fall through although some clean coal technologies have been tested around the world it isnt clear yet if the plants will work on a large scale and it could take a decade or more to find out many australians are skeptical of the efforts the coal industrys emphasis on clean coal plants "is like the tobacco industry saying were doing all kinds of research on low tar cigarettes " says bob brown an australian senator from the greens party which focuses heavily on environmental issues "its a very frightening distraction" from more meaningful steps to combat climate change he says but there likely isnt sufficient political opposition to slow down the countrys powerful coal industry australias coal industry is pressing forward partly with an eye on getting a leg up on other countries that are investing in their own clean coal technologies meanwhile u s power companies are withdrawing proposals to build coal fired plants deterred by the cost of clean coal and the potential pollution from conventional facilities president bush is promoting a major research project dubbed futuregen that involves a consortium of international mining companies including anglo swiss miner xstrata plc anglo american plc of the united kingdom peabody energy corp of the u s and anglo australian companies bhp billiton ltd and rio tinto that project involves building a facility similar to kwinana or zerogen that separates co and buries it underground presumably forever but the u s project remains years away from completion and the expected price tag has swelled to an estimated &# billion or more from earlier estimates of about &# billion officials are still trying to decide where to locate the facility most likely in illinois or texas with a hoped for start up date of or so australia with a population of about million people is among the worlds worst polluters on a per capita basis about of its electrical power is generated from coal compared with about in the u s like the u s australia has refused to ratify the kyoto protocol designed to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions australia is also poised to become a bigger supplier of coal for china which is expected to soon overtake the u s to become the worlds biggest source of greenhouse gases perhaps as early as this year australia hopes that by perfecting technologies to burn coal more cleanly it could defuse some of the criticism that might pose a threat to the industry and make it easier for importers to justify sticking with coal the country has an estimated or more years of coal reserves left at current production levels according to the australian coal association australia is also eager to maintain coal in its own energy mix because using low cost coal helps keep the country competitive with other nations that have other advantages such as lower labor costs to speed up the effort the mining companies of the australian coal association have volunteered to pay a tax the group says will raise a&# billion in the next decade the australian government has also kicked in more than a&# million for a fund to help finance projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions among the projects supported by the fund is an "oxy fuel" facility to be developed by cs energy a power company owned by queensland that project aims to alter the way coal is burned so power plants can more easily separate the co and then store it clean coal advocates are watching the oxyfuel project because they believe its technology could be used to help power companies adapt existing facilities rather than build new plants the zerogen project is led by stanwell corp an electric power company owned by the queensland government with technologies from royal dutch shell plc and general electric co of the u s zerogen would include a so called integrated combined cycle power plant that converts coal into a synthetic gas the gas would be burned to generate electricity while leftover co would be buried some australian politicians and industry experts question whether sufficient funding will be raised to make the plan happen with so many projects kicking around and so many companies asking for handouts it is becoming difficult for political leaders to decide which ones to help finance a spokesman for zerogen acknowledges that the project could still fall through and that final financing hasnt been settled but says zerogen is still ahead of its competitors at kwinana meanwhile rio tinto and bp are conducting seismic research offshore to better understand the rock where they intend to sequester their co the project would be as much as five times the size of zerogen alex zapantis manager of energy and sustainable development at rio tinto declines to say how much public money the project will need to get up and running though he says it is "quite significant " either way he says governments around the world have little choice but to step up their support "wishing for a future in which coal goes away is unhelpful and unproductive " he says "to maintain coal as a sustainable product this is the work that has to be done "
