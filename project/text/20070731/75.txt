panel ties avandia to heart risk committee advises to keep glaxo drug on market discusses warning label a food and drug administration advisory committee found that glaxosmithkline plcs diabetes drug avandia is tied to a risk of heart attacks but it stopped short of voting to pull the medication off the market several panel members said the drug should get a new heart risk warning in its label which would be a blow to the company but far less serious than a recommendation to end sales of avandia last year it was the companys second biggest selling drug with global sales of &# billion and it has been used by more than seven million patients world wide the heart risk warning is likely to accelerate the reshuffling of the growing market for diabetes drugs boosting sales of older medications and takeda pharmaceutical co s actos the only marketed rival that works the same way as avandia so far actos hasnt been linked to a heart attack risk the fda doesnt have to follow the advice of its expert panels but it typically does an agency official said after the meeting that the fda would aim to reach a decision quickly the agencys next step may be difficult to predict because of differing views within the fda at the meeting officials of the fda publicly clashed over what the evidence said about avandia before the votes two drug safety officials david graham and gerald dal pan who oversees the safety office said evidence signaling avandias risk outweighed its apparent benefits but robert meyer director of the fda office that reviews diabetes drugs before they are approved said he hadnt yet made up his mind and acknowledged a "fundamental disagreement" among fda staff the open discord was unusual for an agency that has traditionally sought to project a unified front that effort has become increasingly difficult to sustain under intense congressional scrutiny and pressure on the agency to allow all of its internal viewpoints a public say it is a dynamic that may increasingly challenge drug companies seeking clear cut signals from the fda particularly about medications that are already on the market when a safety concern surfaces in a vote the panel agreed that avandia was tied to increased ischemic risk meaning a risk of events such as heart attacks in which blood is choked off from the heart but in a vote the group said the drug should remain on the u s market members also offered several different ideas for label warnings some suggested a strong "black box" version that would focus on certain groups of patients who appeared to be at higher risk such as people taking insulin along with avandia a black box warning so named because of the black border that surrounds the text is used for the most serious side effects other panel members didnt specify what kind of warning label the fda should support glaxo had defended its drug saying it hadnt been tied to a higher risk than rival treatments and arguing it should remain on the market after the votes chris viehbacher president of u s pharmaceuticals for the company said it "welcomed" the panels strong vote in favor of avandia staying on the market glaxo will suggest that the information about ischemic risk go into the label "in terms of information but not necessarily as a warning or precaution " he said mehmood khan president of takeda global research and development for the u s and europe said actos has "no evidence of a signal" for heart attack risk and thus the committee hadnt focused on it at the core of the committees decision was the need to balance different types of evidence about avandias potential link to heart attacks committee members struggled to pull a clear message out of the data and complained about the lack of definitive information still "virtually everybody felt that there was risk " said panel chairman clifford rosen a doctor at st joseph hospital in bangor maine
