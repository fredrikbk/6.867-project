the middle seat why its easier to get a first class seat airlines expand upgrades and ease access to discounted fares putting the squeeze on elite level frequent fliers it is getting easier for domestic fliers to snare seats at the front of the plane without paying first class prices or having elite frequent flier status airlines have expanded their offers of upgrades at check in kiosks priced anywhere from &# to &# they are also making it easier to find coach tickets that come with instant upgrades known as y up fares in industry jargon on their web sites amr corp s american airlines launched a feature on aa com a few weeks ago that lets users see y up fares with one click hit "search by price &amp schedule " even low fare airlines are up selling starting next month san

that almost fully reclines discount carriers such as airtran airways are offering upgrades to their front cabin seating for about &# to &# more than full fare coach airtran sells it as "business class" since its not full blown first class service airlines have long had difficulty selling first class seats on domestic flights instead they give most of the seats as a perk to their best customers elite level frequent fliers but under intense financial pressure during the past five years theyve looked for new ways to boost revenue and found selling upgrades to be lucrative customers have latched on as flights have gotten more crowded with nary an empty middle seat and as the hassles of air travel have increased a first class boarding pass that may get you in a priority security screening lane and give you room to work or sleep once youre on the plane is worth a lot to travelers these days but there is a huge risk to airlines selling more first class seats the practice can anger airlines elite level frequent fliers by making it harder for them to land free upgrades still first class seats on the cheap appeal to fliers like jay atkinson mr atkinson a vice president of a cash logistics company in baltimore tries hard to hold down his business travel costs rarely buying a first class ticket but recently when american airlines offered him first class for just a bit more than coach he quickly upgraded himself "it used to be impossible to do if you were not elite or werent willing to pay a very high price " he said while reclining in his first class seat during a flight from dallas to baltimore mr atkinsons secretary used a new search function on aa com that offers a matrix of choices from the cheapest coach seats to full priced unrestricted first class tickets she saw one of the choices offered was an "instant upgrade" ticket at &# round trip about the same as a regular coach ticket for the business trip and far more affordable than the &# regular first class fare american says it incorporated y up fares into its new online function before y up fares also known as q up and m up in airline coding nomenclature were almost impossible to find on americans web site they dont show up under first class tickets or unrestricted coach but the fares sold with coach class ticket coding so they dont violate corporate travel policies if they prohibit domestic first class tickets have grown in popularity hunted by smart travel agents road warriors and savvy vacationers in particular farecompare com a ticket searching site has a search option specifically for y up and q up fares "we havent had a way to merchandize them before " said david cush americans senior vice president of global sales now able to better display choices like y up fares to shoppers on americans web site "we have a lot of ability to up sell people " mr cush says american is just starting to test price points how much will people pay to get an instant upgrade when shopping on a web site the y up fares are offered in all domestic markets at varying prices but availability is limited us airways group inc has also introduced non refundable discounted first class fares priced lower than y up fares which us airways also offers because y up fares are refundable some of the discounted first class fares have a seven day advance purchase requirement and some are offered at higher prices with no advance purchase restrictions on a new york los angeles trip for example us airways offers a full price first class one way fare of &# but theres also a nonrefundable fare of &# one way for a first class seat with no advance purchase requirements and a &# one way nonrefundable first class fare that must be bought at least seven days before departure

airlines inc all display both the lowest coach and lowest first class fare in their basic search functions when you ask for the cheapest coach ticket airlines are also selling more first class seats at the airport via check in kiosks us airways was the first to sell upgrades at check in a few years ago and the option has now been copied by most major airlines for us airways upgrades now generate "multiple millions" in revenue every month says tom trenga vice president of revenue management us airways sells the upgrades for &# &# or &# per flight depending on the length of the trip the upgrades are offered to any customer not just frequent fliers or high fare patrons when the program started the airline discovered that ticket counter staffers who do get a &# bonus for selling an upgrade offered upgrades more often to business travelers in suits assuming leisure customers wouldnt buy them but kiosk sales showed leisure customers do frequently purchase the upgrades too "they splurge on that bit of extra comfort for the vacation " said mr trenga airlines are trying to balance their wish to sell more of their first class seats with the need to keep their most lucrative frequent fliers who are used to getting free upgrades happy by offering upgrades at check in kiosks and counters airlines believe they are limiting road warrior disappointment because elite level frequent fliers typically can get free upgrades confirmed at least hours in advance the y up fares and discounted first class tickets likely do impinge on the supply of free upgrades but financially strapped carriers have to do what they can to maximize revenue and selling the first class cabin is better than giving it away they figure "today the percent of first class seats sold is higher but we still give away the majority of our seats " said mr trenga of us airways "obviously fewer free upgrades are available but the success rate for upgrades for our elites is still pretty good " getting an
