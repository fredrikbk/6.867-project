nissan pairs with beijing on system to avoid jams tokyo as part of efforts to reduce traffic congestion during the olympic games the city of beijing is forming an unusual technology partnership with nissan motor co to install a city wide navigation system tokyo based nissan a latecomer to china that is trying furiously to catch up with rivals toyota motor corp and honda motor co in car sales approached beijing city officials last year with a new technology dubbed "star wings " using an existing beijing system for collecting traffic data the nissan technology will transmit real time information to drivers via a wireless network to monitors in cars so theyll know the quickest route to take and which streets to avoid "the infrastructure was already there we just needed to give them a way to develop it and transmit it " says minoru shinohara the senior vice president at nissan who oversaw the development of the system beijing officials declined to comment nissan is expected to announce the project in beijing today along with city officials the car maker will pay for the technology and installation while the city is paying for the infrastructure to monitor and transmit the information nissan wouldnt disclose how much it is spending on the project which starts next year however the scope of the system that will be in place in time for the olympics in august remains to be seen nissans goal is to put its technology into a fifth of beijings million cars by that time this would according to nissans preliminary tests cut down on the citys traffic congestion by up to by dispersing traffic more evenly throughout the city but with only around of the chinese market nissan cant reach that goal if the technology is limited to its own cars the company says it hopes to find partners such as rental car companies taxi fleets or other car makers who agree to put its system into vehicles it adds that much depends on the beijing government and how it intends to use the technology cities such as singapore and stockholm have similar systems to the one planned for beijing designed by various companies toyota has been particularly advanced in developing intelligent transportation systems that involve navigation devices of the million cars with built in navigation devices in japan million are able to get real time information on traffic jams and the quickest routes to take "the government would like to spread car navigation but users need to decide how much theyre willing to pay for it " says hiroshi fukushima an official in japans transportation ministry beijings size and rate of growth make it a model for other mega cities looking to use similar systems in the city of over million residents more than new vehicles are registered daily city officials say there are currently million vehicles in beijing up from only million five years ago according to the national bureau of statistics ahead of the first olympics held in the worlds most populous country beijing is spending more than &# billion on projects aimed at handling the crowds including roads subways sports stadiums and an airport terminal "intelligent transportation system technology is a big part of the governments strategy " says huiming gong who oversees transportation projects for the china sustainable energy program a beijing based nongovernmental organization that consults with the chinese government the beijing transportation information center had already been experimenting with technology to cut down on congestion the city installed devices in around of its some taxis to collect traffic information that is sent to btic headquarters information on accidents and congestion is published on the centers web site to help drivers plan their trips the city also uses sensors to monitor buses if theres a bottleneck beijing officials can tell bus drivers to take a different route meanwhile nissan has been trying out technology similar to star wings in yokohama japans second largest and most congested city in the small scale test traffic information is gathered through wireless transmissions from cars traffic lights and pedestrians the data is routed to a central hub for processing and then transmitted to cars on navigation monitors similar to gps screens nissan believes having star wings technology in its own cars in beijing will be a feature it can tout to try to draw customers away from the competition nissan entered china in the last among japans big auto makers and is making a push to increase the number of nissan dealerships to by the end of this year from last year it sold vehicles in china in compared with hondas sales of last year toyota meanwhile is on track to meet its target to sell over vehicles in china this year nissan says it is in discussions with city officials in shanghai and guangzhou to install the star wings system there as well some transportation experts say this type of technology is a short term solution michael walsh an independent consultant who works on motor vehicle issues in china says the nissan system has one major drawback it doesnt reduce the number of cars on the road "i put it in the same category as building more highways " he says beijing has closely studied londons strategy of charging a fee to drivers who enter the city during rush hour introduced in drivers can pay the fee via text message or over the internet the city uses hundreds of cameras to photograph license plates and determine who has paid londons strategy cut down the number of cars in the city by in three years and similar efforts are being considered by u s cities such as dallas miami and new york the beijing government said earlier this month that it will test a program next month that will ban one million cars from the city for up to two weeks to encourage people to take public transportation it recently lowered the price of a bus ride to rmb about six cents from one rmb the city has some limits on trucks entering from the suburbs and has considered imposing fees and stricter restrictions these strategies might not be as high tech as nissans but they will be more effective in the long term says tang dagang director of the vehicle emission control center of the state environmental protection administration "economic strategies might be the only way to improve congestion " mr dagang says clear the roads "and more cars come " kersten zhang and yang zhou in beijing contributed to this article
