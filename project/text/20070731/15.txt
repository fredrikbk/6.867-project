business technology fcc auction rules could redraw map of wireless sector washington the federal communications commission is poised to adopt rules for a major sale of radio spectrum a move that could alter the cellular phone industry the auction estimated to raise &# billion for the government and likely to be held early next year involves the sale of megahertz of spectrum to the commercial wireless industry most of the spectrum is being vacated as television broadcasters switch to digital television signals from the current analog format freeing up a particularly choice swath of the airwaves "this is akin to being the last beach front open lot where someone can build a house " said carol mattey a consultant with deloitte &amp touches washington based regulatory practice "it will be the last opportunity to buy a significant chunk of spectrum and have the potential to build out a nationwide footprint " google inc verizon communications inc at&amp t inc and many others are watching how the fcc will divvy up the licenses and spell out requirements for building the networks under the fccs tentative proposal companies purchasing one large part of the airwaves would have to provide service to all hand held devices to be attached to the networks they eventually construct this could dramatically change the competition in the u s cellphone industry fcc chairman kevin martin has wrestled with how to balance the competing interests of potential newcomers to the wireless broadband market like google against those of incumbent service providers like verizon and at&amp t in the end mr martin proposed a compromise between the open access conditions championed by google and the sale of spectrum with few conditions backed by existing wireless providers such as verizon most analysts said such a middle ground will enable mr martin to secure a majority of the five member fcc much of the debate has been focused on the upper band of megahertz of spectrum if last minute adjustments to the plan arent made fcc staff and analysts expect it will be broken into three pieces two megahertz chunks with large regional licenses will be sold to one bidder thereby creating a national footprint mr martin has proposed attaching two open access conditions to this spectrum the owner of this slice of the airwaves would have to accommodate any hand held device and allow any type of application to be downloaded over it the final megahertz will go to a commercial operator that will have to agree to work with the public safety community to offer the nations fire police and emergency services workers wireless broadband access that operator would then be able to sell off spare capacity to commercial users mr martins proposal would break up the lower band of megahertz of spectrum into several dozen small local licenses spread across the country rural and smaller cellular carriers are likely to purchase this slice as well as smaller companies like dallas based metropcs communications inc and alltel corp of little rock ark both of which are keen to expand
