com to find new clients estimate job costs and inspect properties saving time they would have spent driving around those services provide access to aerial images of buildings taken by airplanes and satellites and in some cases let users extract measurements and other useful data as well businesses in the past could buy aerial photos but the cost and time required to find the images or commission someone to take specific shots put them out of the reach of most mom and pop companies microsofts live search maps and zillow com a real estate site with extensive aerial imagery are web based google
