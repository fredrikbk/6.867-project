gm design chief talks competition and the merits of american design online edition once criticized for blurring the lines between its brands general motors corp has been busily trying to differentiate the vehicles it sells which range from distinctively american hummers and chevrolets to european flavored saabs by focusing on design since ed welburn the companys vice president for global design has been charged with developing concept and production cars to do just that design driven turnarounds at cadillac and saturn have boosted sales and earned gm coveted trophies like the north american car and truck of the year awards the wall street journal onlines matt vella recently spoke with mr welburn in new york wall street journal you were involved with designing the hummer and cadillac escalade suvs vehicles that struck psychological gold with american consumers in the s how do you tap into a mood or trend on a level like that and how much is luck edward welburn jr you really do need to have an understanding of your customer of the community of the culture in general certainly theres some early market research as well as more inspirational research that helps our designers get an understanding of our customers not asking them what shape they want the grill or tail lamp but getting an understanding of what theyre looking for and a bit about their lifestyle i think having design centers that are close to the community is another real advantage we have of these studios around the world to understand what customers want and what offends them is just as important wsj in what ways are american consumers design tastes different from those of foreign markets which you also oversee mr welburn american tastes are a bit different traditional american design has more appeal here but it also has some in other locations around the world the world really does like the best of american design there is a lot of american design that they dont like but the best of it really connects corvette is loved i mean today probably more than at any other time that vehicle is loved around the world the very best of american design that has a kind of purity that is uninhibited and moves to the next frontier is appreciated around the world the car companies from japan and korea are essentially doing their execution of european design and aesthetic wsj can you give me an example of americanized european styling are we just talking about chrome mr welburn the whole chrome thing really began here adding more bright work to the vehicle but it spread the most recent paris auto show the most recent frankfurt show we saw a lot more chrome it was handled a bit different look at the latest offerings from audi and vw theres a lot more chrome on the front of the car that was a trend that really began in the states wsj your colleague vice chairman bob lutz recently explained why gm most likely wont produce the cadillac sixteen and buick velite two concepts that generated a lot of enthusiasm in the industry in and respectively thanks to elegant looks whats it like to see such potentially popular vehicles red lighted mr welburn for the velite i said early on this car may never go in production but it will have a very healthy influence on future buicks and it has look at the buick enclave every bit of that design was influenced by the velite the front end the grill shape the headlamp shape the body side surfacing even a hint of a boat tail it all comes from the velite the whole mood was established with the velite and for other buicks under development the velite is the vehicle we turn to sixteen is the same thing wsj when you took over in one of the key elements of your design philosophy was that each brand needed to be well defined and identifiable where do you think that has worked and what still needs work mr welburn you know the market is very impatient you cant do one at a time you have to do them all looking back developing a family of vehicles for saturn we were on a real mission there the work done on cadillac has become the model for developing a very identified brand going forward chevrolet is something i get very excited about weve been selling chevys for years in some markets they may have been buicks with a chevy bow tie on them in other locations they were opels and in some cases the bow tie was a bit different they took the opel circle and put a bow tie on top now weve had a real initiative to develop a common face a common look and feel for chevrolet globally the benefit is that you can move these vehicles around the planet much easier and its not bland its not just that weve dumbed it down to a common denominator its still very strong wsj youve had design teams compete with one another to develop certain high profile projects like the cadillac cts and chevrolet camaro whats the role of competition within gm design and how does this affect the creative process mr welburn competition just raises the bar of execution ill start with cts although the home base was in warren michigan i also gave it to the design team in california as well as the advanced design team we have in europe out of that five themes evolved each one was somewhat different but they were all under the umbrella of what we believe a cadillac should look like with the camaro it was purely a concept not production at first we had an advance team working on it and it looked good it looked quite good but it didnt have that spark i was looking for it wasnt as fresh as i was looking for so i told them i was establishing a second team same brief same baseline instantly the first teams design got better i probably could have just told them there was a second team and that would have done the trick the competition is really healthy it works it brings diverse ideas and opinions to the assignment it works because the overall team is one that shares information that can learn from each other we all realize that the enemy is not other gm design teams its other car companies wsj earlier this spring you expressed interest in possibly opening a new york design studio what would be the benefits of doing that and whats the likelihood mr welburn theres so much that happens in new york that i think we could learn from the fashion industry interior design product design culture art music theres just a lot that we could learn from if we establish something here there probably wont be some big announcement some ribbon cutting youll just look up and well have had that here for three or four years write to matt vella at matt vella wsj
