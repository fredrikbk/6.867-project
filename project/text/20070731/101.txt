the best economy ever the volatility of world stock markets last week should not distract attention from the fact that the world economy is currently experiencing a level of growth unsurpassed in human history world growth has been running at close to for over three years the highest level since the late s but the current situation is profoundly different from that era in the s over two thirds of the worlds people were excluded from the global economy because of their political regimes during the past years china india the former soviet union eastern europe and africa have rejoined the global economy their re entry has unleashed a tremendous burst of entrepreneurial energy and set the stage for extraordinary economic growth china has been growing at double digit rates since indias growth rate has risen to from only years ago high oil prices have boosted russias growth rate to the african economy will achieve a growth rate of over this year the growth rates of nearly countries will exceed this year there are only four economies in the world likely to experience negative output growth during north korea zimbabwe somalia and fiji all are in decline because of oppressive political regimes coups or civil war there are three major factors that help to explain the current buoyancy of the world economy first the globalization process resulting from the end of the cold war has encouraged a tremendous growth of world trade between and global imports more than tripled rising to over &# trillion from &# trillion the expansion of world trade has helped to increase competition and reduce inflation after having practically no foreign trade years ago china will soon displace the u s and germany to become the worlds leading export nation chinas industrial boom has boosted commodity prices but china uses its commodity imports to produce low cost manufactured goods which help to restrain inflation everywhere wal mart is chinas largest single customer and has used chinese imports to produce cost savings worth hundreds of billions of dollars for american consumers during alan greenspans tenure as federal reserve chairman imports quadrupled it was americas engagement with the global economy that helped to reduce inflation and lower interest rates during mr greenspans final years as fed chairman secondly in many countries the globalization process has encouraged a large increase in the profit share of gdp as a result of the competitive pressures in the world economy corporations in north america europe and japan have been striving to maximize productivity while restraining wages the large rise in profits has encouraged major stock market rallies everywhere since high profits help to bolster investment and improve productivity growth governments have also responded to the new competitive pressures by reducing tax rates on capital small countries in eastern europe such as estonia started the process during the s but in recent years traditionally high tax societies such as germany have been slashing tax rates on corporate income france will soon follow under its new president nicolas sarkozy in the u s congress reduced the tax rates on capital income during to the lowest levels since the first world war the third factor making possible the current world prosperity is the increased mobility of capital practically all countries had capital controls years ago most of those controls are now gone while there has been a revolution in communications technology which has vastly reduced the cost of transferring money across national borders financial markets have therefore blossomed in dozens of countries the stock market capitalization of developing countries has expanded from only a few trillion dollars years ago to &# trillion today or of the global total the gross value of global capital flows is now equal to of world gdp compared to during the mid s the great surprise of the past decade has been the direction of capital flows in the early s many developing countries in east asia and latin america ran current account deficits and imported capital there were a series of financial crises during the late s which impeded the ability of developing countries to import capital and made them far more conservative at the current time developing countries are running large current account surpluses while the u s has emerged as a huge capital importer the developing countries ran a current account surplus equal to of global gdp during compared to a deficit equal to of world gdp during the mid s china will have a current account surplus of nearly &# billion this year the middle eastern oil exporters will have a surplus of over &# billion russia has a surplus of &# billion the developing countries of east asia now have over &# trillion of foreign exchange reserves the u s by contrast has a current account deficit of over &# billion high savings rates in east asia and other developing countries have helped to finance a great consumption and housing boom in the u s since many economists have argued that the u s current account deficit is unsustainable in reality the world has an abundance of surplus savings that needs to find a home global investors have been happy to purchase dollar assets because they perceive that the u s offers both safety and competitive returns the great threat to the boom is that the u s will lose confidence in the free market ideology which allowed the global economy to take off during the s all the democratic presidential candidates are proposing protectionist trade policies congressional democrats and republicans are threatening china with trade sanctions if it does not revalue its currency more quickly other democrats want to block the proposed free trade agreement with south korea if the u s moves in a protectionist direction it will jeopardize both the import of low cost manufactured goods which restrains u s inflation and the large flows of capital compensating for americas budget deficit and low household savings rate such shocks would threaten both americas prosperity and the new global economic equilibrium now sustaining high growth in the developing countries the u s trade account will improve naturally when global prosperity creates more demand for u s exports and the end of americas housing boom dampens domestic consumer spending any attempt by washington to accelerate the process will simply set the stage for political conflict and a crisis of confidence in the financial markets congress should not worry about the current account deficit so long as the global financial markets are prepared to finance it if the markets lose confidence in the dollar the trade account will improve quickly but at the cost of sharply higher interest rates and a recession mr hale is chairman of hale advisers a chicago based economic consultancy
