tax hike scorecard with a new democratic majority the agenda on capitol hill has shifted abruptly this year and no more so than on taxes for a decade the focus in congress was which taxes to cut now everywhere you look someone running the congress or running for president is proposing to raise taxes on some industry or group of americans the proposals are coming so frequently that its hard to keep track without a scorecard so as a reader service and with a tip of the hat to ed hymans isi group for some of the details heres a list of the most notable proposals so far a senate finance committee plan to raise the federal tobacco tax by cents to a total of &# a pack to finance the schip health care expansion the senate figures this will raise &# billion in revenue over five years if you choose to believe this tax increase wont produce even more tax free cigarette sales from indian reservations the so called "blackstone tax" on private equity partnerships that go public raising their rate to the regular corporate tax rate of this bipartisan senate proposal hasnt been scored yet for revenues but may well pass congress a tax increase on the "carried interest" of hedge funds and private equity to from this has been introduced in the house and endorsed by ways and means chairman charles rangel and the major democratic presidential candidates new york senator chuck schumer tells the new york times that hell oppose this unless the tax increase also applies to real estate and other partnerships that also now pay the carried interest tax rate to put it another way mr schumer is saying hell only support the higher tax rate if it applies to more people meanwhile by playing this "good cop" role mr schumer is raising millions of dollars in campaign contributions from hedge funds and private equity for democratic senate candidates running in brilliant higher withholding taxes on the u s subsidiaries of foreign companies in essence a tax increase on foreign investment in america this &# billion tax proposal from texas democrat lloyd doggett came out of nowhere last week to appear in the house farm bill to pay for more agriculture subsidies it passed raise the capital gains rate to from the current this would repeal not only the capital gains tax cut of but also the tax cut to from that bill clinton signed into law in presidential candidate john edwards proposed this increase in the capital gains tax last week and hes been echoed in recent days by such democratic tax sachems as alan blinder and leonard burman mr blinder thinks capital gains should be taxed no differently than regular income which means the tax rate would rise to if the tax cuts expire in the last time the u s had a capital gains rate that high was the jimmy carter era deny the domestic manufacturing deduction to oil producers this is part of the senate finance committees energy bill and is estimated to raise &# billion over years how this will increase domestic oil production amid &# a barrel oil and widespread clamor for "energy independence" is one of those mysteries that congress prefers not to explain a levy on oil and gas produced from deep water leases in the gulf of mexico this tax on domestic energy production is also part of the subsidy fest known as the house farm bill and would allegedly raise &# billion a tax surcharge of percentage points on income of more than &# which would take the top marginal rate to a leading tax writer on ways and means massachusetts democrat richard neal promoted this idea in june as a way to prevent this years increase in the alternative minimum tax mr neal told the washington post that his plan had broad support from democratic leaders and that "everybodys on board " other democrats balked after that story appeared and mr rangel told us not to believe it but somethings clearly in the air because democratic tax guru mr burman is also pushing a four percentage point income tax surcharge to pay for amt relief were probably overlooking some other tax increase proposals and some of the above will be blocked this year by president bushs veto pen but this kind of manic congressional grasping at any and every revenue idea hasnt been seen since the first days of the clinton presidency its all the more remarkable given that federal tax revenues as a share of gdp are currently above their modern historical level the latest budget estimate is that fiscal revenues will reach of gdp compared to the year historical average of tax revenues this year are rising by nearly following increases of in and in the budget deficit is down to of gdp and falling but apparently democrats still think americans are undertaxed see related letters "letters to the editor taxes readers keep score" wsj aug
