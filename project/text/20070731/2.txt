advice on landing a job after moving to new area q i recently relocated from a high cost area to a low cost one im landing job interviews but no offers im told the reasons for not hiring me range from my lack of confidence to not wanting to pay me a low salary how can i overcome these roadblocks a hiring managers may not be telling you the real reason why youre being passed over says debra feldman an executive job search consultant in greenwich conn the fact that youre getting interviews means they think youre probably qualified for the openings but companies may be hiring internal candidates or applicants who have an inside track through networking and giving you other excuses she says try to determine the real story but if youre repeatedly given the same reasons for being passed over its likely these are problems you need to correct ms feldman says "if you keep hearing the same thing it may be time for self examination " ask friends and former colleagues for feedback about whether you seem confident if this is the issue you may be able to gain self assurance by reviewing your past successes and understanding how you made a difference to employers says carole martin an interview coach based in san francisco during interviews be able to relay those accomplishments to hiring managers convince them that your goal is to work for them and make a contribution at their companies "you need to know what you want to do and then go into the interview look the person in the eye and say this is where i have set my goal " says ms martin above all dont seem desperate to land a job she advises a good interview tactic is to view yourself as a consultant trying to help the employer with a problem listen to the explanation of the companys concerns and then explain how you can solve them ms martin says "any time you can say youve saved money raised money saved manpower improved efficiency or built solid relationships employers will be interested " she says targeting jobs that are too junior may be why employers are telling you their potential salary is too low for you be sure to aim for jobs at the right level for your ability and experience and try to defer pay discussions until you get an offer if an employer says it cant pay you what youre worth respond by saying that you know that salaries vary by company size and location and you have moved from a higher to a lower cost area say you expect to be paid fairly for employees in your position at that size company says ms feldman its difficult to find work when you lack networking contacts in the local community who can provide referrals she adds if you havent already done so join groups and start attending events where you can meet new people find out if theres a local chapter of your college alumni group or call your main alumni office to get names of graduates in your area whom you can contact for information and referrals ms feldman suggests also join local chapters of professional associations community and interest groups are also good places to make contacts job seekers often cant diagnose their own stumbling blocks so consider asking a career counselor or interview coach for help perhaps you can overcome your interview hurdles by simply rephrasing your answers to a few questions or changing your body language ms feldman says "there could be just one question thats basically slaughtering you " she says
