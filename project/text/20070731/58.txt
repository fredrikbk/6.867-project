intel in euro land computer chips are getting faster and smaller and prices are dropping amid fierce competition so naturally the european commission thinks this is the ideal time to lodge another antitrust suit against another american technology titan last friday eu regulators accused intel corp of offering computer makers brace yourself rebates designed to harm rival advanced micro devices or amd in the chip market in brussels jargon thats an "abuse of a dominant position" and could lead to a fine of as much as of intels annual global turnover or perhaps billion euros as with its continuing case against microsoft the commission isnt responding to gripes from customers or consumers the investigations were prompted by amd which has launched legal proceedings around the world against its archrival this regulatory forum shopping includes a pending lawsuit in a federal court in delaware filed two years ago in europe a firms size and success are the determining factors of its alleged violations the same commercial practices would be entirely legal if the company in question were not considered "dominant " this leaves companies in the absurd position of being free to compete as hard as possible until they reach a certain market share at which point their hitherto legal behavior becomes unlawful this is the kind of reasoning that has damaged the commissions credibility as europes highest courts overturn one major antitrust decision after another in intels case brussels claims to be acting for consumers "the rebates offered by intel were of such a quantity of such an amount that an efficient competitor would be forced to price below cost and we think that would be very bad for competition and bad for consumers who would be buying computers " says a commission spokesman if intel fails to persuade the commission to drop its charges it will be forced to stop its "anti competitive" behavior that is it will have to discontinue the rebates and raise prices presumably the harm to consumers is that the rivals potentially superior products are muscled out of the market in a worst case the rebates may even force the competitor to give up altogether allowing the remaining player to establish a monopoly but such a scenario runs counter to the history and very essence of the it business which remains competitive dynamic and unpredictable with of current market share intels dominance is indisputable but with about of the &# billion market for microprocessors amd is hardly a push over the companys ups and downs it gained share in and most of before suffering a downturn late last year seem to contradict its allegations of intels anti competitive behavior a reasonable conclusion is that amds fortunes correspond more closely to its own innovation rate than to any rebate scheme by a rival similarly intels recent comeback was due to its competitive products chips that increase performance but lower energy consumption the case against intel is the latest in a series of eu assaults on successful u s technology companies brussels apparently is determined that if europe cant be a global leader in information technology it can at least become that industrys world wide regulator if it succeeds the world is bound to be a less competitive and innovative place like well europe
