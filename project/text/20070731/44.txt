friedmans legacy today in cities across america events are being held to celebrate the ideas vision and influence of the late great economist and nobel prize winner milton friedman this would have been his th birthday the occasion gives us a chance to look back on many of the questions friedman contemplated during the course of his productive career in particular why do people in some countries prosper while those in other countries live in poverty is it luck is it something that their governments do or perhaps its something that their governments dont do friedman knew that the answers depended on the extent to which governments supported personal freedom political freedom and economic freedom and thanks to his advocacy many countries around the world have come to see the connection between freedom and prosperity friedmans views on freedom could be summed up by the aphorism "theres no such thing as a free lunch" a saying which he popularized but did not invent friedman knew that nothing in life is truly free but he argued vigorously that free markets and private property rights are as close to a "free lunch" as we might get in the real economic world as he saw it some countries prosper while others flounder and stagnate because the successful ones have economies of largely free and open markets this kind of "free lunch" is guaranteed by institutions that promote and respect personal political and economic freedoms friedman advanced his views on freedom through bold ideas on a wide range of public policy issues economic growth school choice taxes and the role of government an all volunteer military exchange rates money and inflation trade and globalization just to name a few through these disparate issues he revived the economics of liberty by consistently advocating the virtues of freedom and opportunity friedman reminded us of the economic principles first outlined by adam smith take smiths concept of the "invisible hand " by which individuals who may intend to pursue only their own interests ultimately promote the public welfare in other words a society composed of individuals acting in their own interests creates a freer more stable and prosperous economy than one planned by the state friedmans ideas also derived from those of thomas jefferson in particular his principle that every person is free to pursue his own life in accordance with his own values put another way people should be allowed to make their own choices because they know whats better for themselves than any outsider can know thanks to his unwavering support for free enterprise and open markets friedmans ideas have elevated standards of living for a rising share of the worlds population more and more people are free to choose their path in the economy acting in their own self interest by engaging in mutually beneficial exchange under the rule of law more and more central banks have followed friedmans advice and taken control of money growth indeed inflation has fallen around the world in developed economies emerging markets and even among most less developed nations and more and more nations are engaged in trade with each other seeing new markets as a source of greater opportunities and additional resources friedman taught that economic growth comes from innovation and entrepreneurship by individuals whose minds are open to ideas and by firms engaged in competitive markets open to trade friedman saw cooperation in this competition he saw opportunity in free markets and globalization and he saw education and the free exchange of ideas as prerequisites to advancing this freedom for the next generation indeed friedman once said "freedom is not the natural state of mankind it is a rare and wonderful achievement it will take an understanding of what freedom is of where the dangers to freedom come from it will take the courage to act on that understanding if we are not only to preserve the freedoms that we have but to realize the full potential of a truly free society " so as we celebrate milton friedmans birthday and achievements we must continue his legacy and keep making the case for freedom mr siems is a senior economist and policy advisor at the federal reserve bank of dallas see related letters "letters to the editor a call to activism do more than just commemorate milton friedmans ideas" wsj aug
