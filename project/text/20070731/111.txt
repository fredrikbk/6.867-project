turkish troubles turkeys ruling justice and development party the akp emerged victorious in the july parliamentary elections with a solid of the vote prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in office since will also head the next government while rooted in turkeys islamist opposition the akp declared itself a liberal movement when it came to power five years ago so as the party gets ready for another five years in office is the akp really a liberal party lets have a look at its record so far under the akp there have been two dramatic changes in turkey first the country has become a choice market for foreign investment until turkey attracted a measly &# billion a year in foreign direct investment by contrast in turkey received over &# billion the akp has privatized state owned enterprises thanks to its pro business policies the akp has rightfully received much praise as an economically liberal party however capitalism alone does not make a country liberal it also needs a sense of common destiny with the western world a sense sorely missing in the akps turkey in addition to the fdi boom a second and decidedly illiberal shift has taken place in turkey under the akp before the party took office turkey ranked first in pro american sentiment among muslim majority countries according to polls once staunchly pro western turkey has now become the most anti american country in the world a pew center poll puts turkey at the bottom of the list around of turks today say they like the united states and i think i know all of them part of the decline in turkish pro american attitudes can be attributed to the lack of u s action in response to terror attacks by the kurdistan workers party the pkk from its safe haven in northern iraq yet the drop in pro american sentiment in turkey is sharper than in the broader middle east today the percentage of turks who hate the u s is higher than among palestinians and the slump in pro american sentiments in turkey is four times greater than that in jordan anti westernism comes through clearly in the akps rhetoric acts and bureaucratic appointments the ruling party has for years lambasted the u s for its actions in iraq for instance the akp head of the human rights commission in the turkish parliament claimed in november that the u s troops were committing massacres in iraq in february the akp speaker of the parliament praised the notorious film "valley of the wolves " which depicts the iraq war as an organ harvesting operation run by greedy jews and american fundamentalist christians after this positive endorsement a record breaking million turks went to see the film recently the akp has muted its anti u s rhetoric and boosted cooperation with washington on important issues including iraq three fourths of all cargo going to iraq and afghanistan for example flies through turkey but while the akp benefits from good ties with washington the government fails to explain such ties to the turkish public not long ago i chatted with three year old turks in a lower middle class suburb of istanbul the staunchly secular men had come of age during the war and had only horrible things to say about the u s when i asked for proof of their claims that the u s was committing war crimes in iraq they cited repeated akp statements on the issue that an overwhelming majority of turks do not read english or other foreign languages means that they form impressions of the u s through local papers and the daily rhetoric of their countrys leaders after years of anti u s rhetoric a negative view of america is now so pervasive that secular turks and their parties are also on board the akp has distanced itself from the west with specific policies as well before the akp turkey had a thriving military relationship with israel joint defense projects totaling over &# billion between and formed an important pillar of growing bilateral ties whats more these contracts provided turkey with sensitive high tech weaponry that proved useful in its struggle against the pkk this is not the case today as a bureaucrat from the turkish defense ministry told me during a recent visit to ankara since companies doing business with israel have been methodically excluded from defense contracts defense projects with israel have totaled only &# million in the past four years true turkey hands out fewer defense contracts today than in the s and even then for some reason the contracts the israelis get move into a slow motion world for instance the largest akp era israeli turkish deal an unmanned aerial vehicle drone project is at a standstill the israeli company thats due to deliver the drones to turkey by next year has been granted only one meeting with the akp run bureaucracy finally the akps appointments are driving illiberalism i was recently in midyat in southeastern turkey to see the monasteries of the syriac church many syriac christians were driven out of their homes by the pkk in the s a community leader told me that before the akp government authorities were helpful in facilitating their return but the new akp appointed officials have a negative attitude toward christians when community leaders paid the newly arrived provincial governor a courtesy visit the governors first words were "i am a muslim " hardly the words befitting a liberal secular state and the return of christians to midyat has now been encumbered in one of their villages elbegendi the christians have built new homes with the hope of returning but the akp governor has refused to pave their roads so elbegendi is a kafkaesque site with brand new villas mud on the streets and no public services in sight from midyat to the suburbs of istanbul a new turkey is taking shape away from the attention of western financial markets the glitter of istanbuls moneyed class and the fancy drinking holes on the bosporus the new akp government can prove its liberal credentials in its second turn in power by desisting from political illiberalism and anti westernism this is a chance turkey cannot afford to miss mr cagaptay a senior fellow at the washington institute for near east policy is the author of
