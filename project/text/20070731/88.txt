politics &amp economics lawmakers weigh democrats push for ethics lobbying rules changes washington congress looking for political redemption after the scandals that overshadowed the elections hopes to enact tough lobbying and ethics rules this week but lawmakers cant decide which breeds more corruption money from lobbyists or spending "earmarks" for special interest projects doled out by lawmakers democrats unveiled an ambitious package that would require unprecedented disclosure of lobbying activities and how campaign funds are bundled for lawmakers conservative senate republicans warned the new majority had missed the real lesson of recent scandals and risks falling into the same earmark tar pit that helped swallow republicans in the last congress "the culture of earmarks is what drives the culture of corruption " said sen jim demint r s c "and if we dont fix the earmark rules in this bill we will continue to have business as usual in washington " by contrast fred wertheimer a public interest advocate for lobbying overhaul argued the core bill represents "a sea change for citizens in the information" it will make available "there is absolutely no basis for a representative or senator to vote against this legislation on process or on substantive grounds " after a caucus last night house democrats predicted expedited approval this morning of the lobbying and ethics package but mr demint and allies such as sen tom coburn r okla are likely to insist that the senate first adopt a cloture motion to cut off debate that requires votes but is more a protest than real obstacle democrats are united behind the bill and republican senators running for re election next year dont want to be against a bill with the title "honest leadership and open government act " senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky has signaled as much and while he has worked behind the scenes to try to block some campaign finance portions of the bill he is a veteran "earmarker" in his own right and along with majority leader harry reid d nev he has close ties to the senate appropriations committee where spending bills are drafted since coming to power last winter democrats have taken steps to reduce the number of spending earmarks from the record levels under republican rule house and senate appropriations reports that accompany spending bills list projects by their dollar value and sponsors name the committees argue they must retain some flexibility if they are to move bills forward in the face of what have become long nights of debate over often very small items thus in the bill mr reid will be allowed to certify if disclosure requirements are met rather than having the senate parliamentarians office be the judge the course preferred by sens demint and coburn the bill allows more procedural challenges to earmarks but these can be waived with votes not as proposed by conservatives and all on a single motion "it is ludicrous to give the majority leader or either party not the objective senate parliamentarian new unilateral powers to police earmarks " mr coburn said "in the last election the american people said they wanted the earmark favor factory to be shut down not turned over to new management " on the lobbying side of the ledger new restrictions seek to ban gift and junkets arranged by lobbyists and rein in the use of corporate jets for the first time the bill would require the disclosure by lobbyists who maximize their influence by "bundling" contributions to a single lawmaker presidential campaigns eager to raise money celebrate their "bundlers " but within congress it can be a source of immense unseen leverage the new rules require semiannual reports on the bundling of campaign contributions exceeding &# made by registered lobbyists lobbying firms and political committees controlled by lobbyists
