how a patent ruling is changing court cases three months after the supreme court handed down what many called a landmark patent decision judges have begun to rule in favor of companies defending themselves against infringement lawsuits in one case dismissing a suit and in another ordering a review last week a federal judge in san francisco who previously had allowed a patent infringement lawsuit to proceed against realnetworks inc changed course and dismissed the case citing the supreme courts april ruling in ksr v teleflex the case is believed to be the first in which a trial court judge has reversed his position and dismissed a case in the defendants favor citing the ksr decision realnetworks was sued in by friskit inc a patent licensing company based in san francisco over technology for organizing and playing video and audio files the judge ruled that friskits patent claims were nothing more than obvious combinations of elements publicly available including realnetworks own internet products judge william schwarzer concluded that "the idea of integrating these different components was not novel " "the supreme court has made it clear what it thinks " the judge said at a hearing in the case "patents are being issued on obvious inventions and it tightened the reins " a lawyer for friskit says the company is reviewing its options for appeal and was confident it could prevail the ksr decision turned on the notion of "obviousness " one of the bedrock doctrines of patent law the supreme court laid out the obviousness doctrine in saying that a patent requires more "skill and ingenuity" than that of "an ordinary mechanic acquainted with the business " since virtually every litigated patent case includes an assertion of obviousness and since the u s patent office examines patent applications for obviousness many legal commentators have called ksr the most important patent case in decades "patentees have long had the upper hand in patent litigation but the ksr case has shifted that balance of power back to defendants " said dennis crouch a law professor at the university of missouri in ksr the supreme court rejected a "rigid" application of existing tests for obviousness in favor of a more "expansive and flexible approach" that would give judges more discretion if a person of ordinary skill in the relevant subject area would "be able to fit the teaching of multiple patents together like pieces of a puzzle" then the patent is obvious the supreme court ruled some experts in law and economics think affording judges discretion in analyzing an obviousness defense is not a good thing "flexibility has an achilles heel which is that people with the biggest lobbying and litigation budgets and the best public relations win " said scott kieff a law professor at washington university in st louis who has argued for predictable rules in the patent system "flexibility really means that the company that can fight the hardest and shout the loudest wins the attention of the person with the flexibility to use his own discretion " technology and financial services companies were particularly hopeful after the supreme court ruling these companies in recent years have faced a flood of costly patent infringement lawsuits often brought by patent licensing and holding companies often derisively called "patent trolls" that buy up patents with the aim of obtaining royalties from alleged infringers these companies and other patent holders argue that courts should vigorously protect ownership rights or companies will be unwilling to take the risks necessary for innovation more decisions like the realnetworks case could give companies leverage against patent holding firms and pressure those firms to settle disputes rather than risk a court ruling invalidating their patents outright though only one case at the trial court level it was handed down in the san francisco bay area where many patent infringement disputes are heard because of the heavy concentration of technology companies the court is known as being more defendant friendly in these cases as opposed to say the eastern district of texas which has become famous for big plaintiff friendly jury verdicts the ksr ruling has also affected the u s patent and trademark office whose examiners review every patent application for obviousness after ksr the patent office issued a short memorandum to its examiners suggesting that the decision wouldnt have a major impact on the examination process still an appeals panel at the patent office has cited ksr in at least three recent rulings upholding an examiners rejection of a patent on the grounds of obviousness meanwhile companies defending patent lawsuits are invoking ksr with mixed results and its still too early to tell whether the realnetworks case will be a forerunner to similar decisions vonage holdings corp asked a federal appeals court to send its patent case against verizon communications inc back to a lower court arguing that ksr calls into question the validity of some verizon patents at issue in the case in april a jury ruled vonage had infringed on several key verizon patents related to internet calling the u s court of appeals for the federal circuit a specialized court in washington for patent appeals hasnt yet ruled on vonages request a panel of judges from the international trade commission an independent agency that serves as another forum for adjudicating patent disputes last month agreed in the wake of ksr to review a finding that companies violated patents for ink cartridges manufactured by seiko epson corp a federal judge in manhattan ruled earlier this month that a patent at issue held by mcneil ppc inc was invalid based on obviousness and discussed ksr extensively the court though said even without the ksr decision it would have ruled the same way in june a federal judge in san diego relied on ksr in dismissing one of several patent infringement claims on obviousness grounds in a case involving single chip systems corp a technology company in san diego but the judge allowed the case to proceed on three other claims found to be not obvious under ksr cellphone chip maker qualcomm inc tried to use the ksr decision to its advantage in an escalating battle at the international trade commission with broadcom corp a smaller chip maker that says it holds key patents related to advanced "g" cellphones qualcomm argued that the itc should have to follow the precedent set by the supreme courts ruling and dismiss broadcoms inventions as obvious but the agency ultimately sided with broadcom banning the importation of qualcomm chips and cellphones that include them the federal circuit upheld the itc decision earlier this month qualcomm is now hoping for a presidential veto of the itc ruling by aug amol sharma contributed to this article corrections &amp amplifications the federal circuit court of appeals said it would not review an international trade commission decision that bars the importation of cellphones with qualcomm inc s chips while the bush administration considers a veto of the agencys decision a marketplace article yesterday about how a patent ruling is changing court cases incorrectly said the federal circuit had upheld the itc decision in the qualcomm case wsj aug
