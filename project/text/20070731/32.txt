dow jones deal gets closer as talks turn to fees fund would cover some family costs to gain key votes news corp and dow jones &amp co edged closer to a final agreement on the sale of the publisher to the media giant late yesterday as dow jones negotiated on an unusual deal for the company to cover advisory fees for its majority owners the bancrofts in exchange for some holdout family members supporting the deal the talks capped a tense day in which some family advisers and dow jones board members scrambled to line up enough votes to ensure the sale a p m deadline set by the family came and went amid apparent brinksmanship in both camps the late night proposal under discussion was for the dow jones board to create a fund to cover payments to firms advising bancroft family members including merrill lynch and the law firms hemenway &amp barnes and wachtell lipton rosen &amp katz news corp would assume these liabilities if it bought dow jones the fees could total at least &# million according to people familiar with the situation dow jones is expected to argue that the bancrofts deserve help with their advisory fees because their trusts are so complicated common shareholders dont face many of these fees the money would be paid only if at least one of two key holdout shareholders agreed to the deal christopher bancroft and a group of trusts managed by denver law firm holme roberts &amp owen with at least one of these shareholders in agreement more likely the denver trusts news corp would have enough support from the bancroft family to seal the deal late yesterday however neither of the shareholders had agreed the bancroft family which controls of dow joness shareholder votes through numerous trusts has been deeply divided over the offer some family members have been outspoken for and against a deal and in recent days important trustees have refused to sign voting agreements to sell the company saying they believe news corp and its chairman rupert murdoch should pay more "everyone is sticking to their guns in the hope that murdoch will come up with more money " said one person involved in the process resistance from some family trustees prompted a news corp spokesman to say yesterday morning that the company was "highly unlikely" to proceed with its offer for dow jones if the proposal didnt get more support from the bancroft family mr murdoch has declared his impatience with the family several times hinting he might pull his bid but so far he hasnt done so it would be a disappointment for him to lose an asset he has long coveted still the comment yesterday sent dow jones shares down &# or to &# in p m new york stock exchange composite trading although the stock was up cents to &# in after hours trading a news corp board of directors meeting is set for p m today and a decision by the company on whether to proceed and seek a full dow jones shareholder vote to approve a deal is expected to come then if not sooner dow joness board was planning to meet today at p m as of late last night family members holding about of dow joness overall voting power appeared to have committed to support the deal though it wasnt clear where all of the votes came from most of the votes were in the form of written voting agreements which cant be revoked except in the event of a higher bid that might be enough to deliver the company to news corp when added to the of overall voting power that is held by nonfamily shareholders a vast majority of whom are expected to vote for the deal the ottaway family which has come out against the deal controls roughly of the companys shareholder vote but this would leave mr murdoch with very little margin for error while awaiting a shareholder meeting in september or october if more than half of the bancroft familys voting power or about of the total voted for the deal that would be a public relations coup for news corp and also provide a comfortable majority when added to the nonfamily shares however handicapping these nonfamily shares with any certainty is difficult many are assumed to be in the hands of arbitragers who snapped up the shares after the stock price surged may when news of the offer surfaced but it cant be predicted how many no shows there will be and how many retail investors remain in the stock votes that arent cast in favor of the deal wouldnt be counted and would make it more difficult for news corp to get a majority vote news corp is understood to want a cushion the company could be posturing about how many votes it needs to go forward because once news corp says it believes it has enough votes its bargaining leverage with the holdout shareholders goes away meanwhile the trustees of some bancroft shares held in denver by holme roberts &amp owen representing about of the overall voting power were holding out for an offer of at least &# per share news corp s original offer three months ago was &# a sizable premium over the mid &# s range where dow jones had been trading and news corp has said since then that it wont budge from that offer the trusts in denver had been seeking a "price differential " that is paying the bancrofts more money for their class b supervoting shares than other holders would get two attorneys at the bancrofts main law firm boston based hemenway &amp barnes also are pursuing this strategy and withholding votes for the deal the two partners michael puzo and timothy fidgeon sit as trustees on some of the familys largest trusts and have said they want news corp to pay more the two sides are in touch with each other say people familiar with the situation although they arent completely on the same page the two boston lawyers unlike some of their partners at hemenway &amp barnes are said to have doubts about the deal on principle which could make it less likely they would change their position the dow jones board opposes a two tiered price as well and news corp has said it wont entertain the idea a move by dow jones to pay the familys banking and legal fees would be a way to give the family some extra money without offering a two tiered price but the two sides need to proceed carefully to avoid the appearance that the payment is in exchange for votes and doesnt expose them to legal liability still another wrinkle involves a bloc of stock called the "" trust whose trustees were jane cox macelree and two hemenway &amp barnes partners michael b elefante and kurt somerville ms macelree who is against the sale but whose children are divided resigned as a trustee from certain of her trusts sunday because of fear of legal liability from some of her relatives who are beneficiaries of those trusts her abdication allowed some trusts to vote "yes " but the jessie b cox trust which represents about of dow jones overall shareholder votes may cut the other way after ms macelree resigned the two attorneys chose to resign too though they still remain as trustees of other trusts it isnt known how this trust will vote but it isnt included currently in mr elefantes calculation of behind the trustee resignations is a fear that the divisive battle could spill over into the courts "if a single beneficiary thinks a trustee is wasting the assets of the trust he or she can sue " says william zabel a new york trust and estates attorney it would then be up to a judge to determine whether the trustee has violated his duty to the trust and its beneficiaries but bancroft trustees wouldnt likely be personally liable for any such litigation according to trust specialists that is because the standard for such litigation typically is based on personal negligence and the bar is gross negligence or fraud mr elefante hasnt joined his colleagues in pushing for more money because he feels as a director he has to support a deal that treats all shareholders equally in his capacity as a board member of dow jones mr elefante is supposed to serve the interests of all shareholders and giving preferential treatment to class b holders might violate that mission according to people familiar with the matter christopher bancroft a trustee and a dow jones director who has veto power over shares representing about of the companys votes was on a plane yesterday from boston to dallas after meeting with hemenway &amp barnes and was unreachable during the hours before the familys deadline according to people familiar with the matter laurie p cohen and dana cimilluca contributed to this article
