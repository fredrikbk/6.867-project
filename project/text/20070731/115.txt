voyage to the bottom of the sea the treasure of san jose by carla rahn phillips johns hopkins university press pages &# it sounds like the title of a boys own adventure tale or an erroll flynn movie and rightly so "the treasure of the san jose" has a swashbuckling spirit and contains all the elements for an old fashioned romance sea battles suave adventurers and sunken treasure but it also displays the kind of detail and precision that comes from shrewdly plundered archives carla rahn phillips is clearly an assiduous historian with an eye for an extraordinary story this one is set in the bloody days of the war of the spanish succession for most of us an obscure conflict dwarfed by napoleons wars years later but the war of the spanish succession was no less momentous for the fate of europe and france was at the center of it too the ascent of philip duc danjou to the throne of spain in enraged many of the major european powers for philip was louis xivs grandson and france under the sun king was already a threatening bellicose state the prospect of france and spain joined dynastically was not a happy one for years the hapsburgs the english and the dutch among others warred with louis over the fate of spain not least in the atlantic ocean where military vessels merchant ships and pirate fleets set upon each other with fitful ferocity part of the atlantic traffic offering up a kind of floating prey consisted of ships carrying merchandise and officials from spain to its new world possessions and returning across the atlantic loaded with wealth from the mines of mexico and peru here is where the san jose comes in in a large armada the san jose serving as its gun flagship sailed from cadiz spain to cartagena of the indies on the caribbean coast of what is now colombia and then on to the fabled portobelo near the present day panama canal one of the armadas galleons bore the magnificent marquis of castelldosrius sailing to the new world to assume his duties as the viceroy of peru with him was an entourage of lackeys musicians and pastry chefs it was castelldosrius who had famously greeted philip the frenchman newly crowned the king of spain with the phrase "what joy there are no more pyreneess and we are but one " that is precisely what the rest of europe was worried about the marquis arrived safely at his destination the armada too taking on its immense riches at portobelo but soon after disaster struck an english squadron of ships attacked the armada on its voyage back from portobelo to cartagena "when the enemy fired the first shot " an eyewitness later reported "the response came with such alacrity that the cannon shots practically met in midair " after a fierce battle the san jose was sunk and another spanish ship was captured the rest of the armada including the san joses sister ship the san joaquin escaped to cartagena finding haven under the guns of the citys fortress "the treasure of the san jose" chronicles the armadas fate in all its splendor and tragedy often by tracking the actions of its principal figures not only castelldosrius but also the count of casa alegre the fleets commander and don miguel augustin de villanueva its second in command at the center of the tale naturally is the san jose it carried close to men all but of whom perished when it exploded and sank more important for legend the san jose took with it to the watery depths a hoard of silver gold pearls and emeralds the event was famous enough to be immortalized by henry popple a cartographer whose vast "map of the british empire in america" includes an illustration of the battle four doughty english vessels appear off the south american coast bearing down on casa alegres convoy of ships in the middle of the spanish line a tremendous cloud bursts from the sea the bodies of tiny sailors can be seen hurtling through the sky toward oblivion both john adams and benjamin franklin owned copies of popples map so it seems safe to say that the fate of the san jose was well known in the th century certainly it was never forgotten in cartagena in his novel "love in the time of cholera " gabriel garcia marquez refers to the san joses treasure "lying in its bed of coral and the corpse of the commander floating sideways on the bridge evoked by historians as an emblem of the city drowned in memories " the story doesnt end there the remnants of the spanish armada headed now by de villaneuva on the san joaquin finally put to sea for a homeward journey in again an english squadron attacked this time de villaneuva instead of running away as he was accused of doing the first time around headed for the thick of the fight after a fierce engagement the english captured the san joaquin assuming that it bore the remainder of the portobelo treasure not lost with the san jose de villanueva mortally wounded died knowing that in fact the remaining new world wealth was being carried on another ship which as it turned out made it safely back to spain ms phillips notes that the "dramatic story of the san jose remains peculiar in the annals of maritime history because popular memory preserved it while serious history largely forgot about it " thanks to her explorations in dusty archives she has remembered the armada in a serious way among much else she found documents from the survivors of the san jose requesting their wages from the king as well as pleas from the heirs of those who ended up in davy jones locker she unearthed a drawing of what may well be the stern of the san jose showing a depiction of st joseph the ships namesake and the christ child and she read the papers from the court martial in jamaica of the two english captains who let the san joaquin escape from the first ambush finally she consulted the inventories of portobelo to determine exactly what riches might have been on the san jose when it went down thus "the treasure of the san jose" will be welcomed by schemers as well as scholars for the treasure of the san jose is still out there somewhere mr ferguson is a writer in highlands n c
