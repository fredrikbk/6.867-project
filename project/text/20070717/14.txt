business technology talking tech making a difference one laptop a child the nonprofit group one laptop per child has as self explanatory a title as can be imagined it was founded in and is closely associated with nicholas negroponte the former director of the mit media lab the association has designed a low cost laptop computer for use by children in the developing world last week intel corp which had previously criticized the computer design as being insufficiently powerful said it would be joining forces with the association we used the announcement to catch up with walter bender the associations president and chief operating officer q what are the goals of your group a there are about a billion children in the developing world who dont have the opportunities they should or could have and we want to figure out a way to reach them we think that building an affordable connected laptop is the way to do it so weve been developing something known as the "hundred dollar laptop " which is our target price for a few years hence its designed for to year olds and has a number of unique features including a very high resolution sunlight readable display it runs on two watts of electricity so it can be powered by solar or by human energy for kids who live off the grid q what are the machines specs a it has built in mesh networking capability so that all the laptops in a community automatically talk to each other at high bandwidth they also can share any internet connectivity it doesnt have any internal moving parts and there is no fan and no hard disk to crash it has a gigabyte of flash ram and three usb slots q what processor does it use a its an amd that would be considered an older chip like where we were five years ago but we dont have a lot of spinning glowing flashing windows we stripped out a lot of nonsense a lot of fat so we get a lot more mileage out of the chip q what happens when kids get a machine like this a we know this is going to have a very positive impact on literacy and on numeracy and the kids will be very expressive with the knowledge they are exploring they will not just watch movies but also make movies in one of our pilots in uruguay within a week the kids who had never used a computer were posting their multimedia presentations onto youtube q how many are in use right now a we have about machines out in the field now our goal is one billion in the developing world its going to take a decade q what is the effect of intel joining a the immediate impact is that we will have a big boost on the software end of things we are going to work with intel to broaden the software base intel has been very active in linux community q is microsoft a member a microsoft is not a member in the context of the problem we are trying to solve open source is important but microsoft is working on getting a windows version running on our hardware and thats great intel used to say that the best thing for the developing world would be to use regular laptops that have gotten cheaper the problem is that if you dont have any place to plug in what good is it going to do you q couldnt you do a machine fully compatible with our laptops but just at lower power levels a by the time you go through all that trouble youve got our machine q some people say that some of your innovations may end up being used for products in developed countries a there are already a lot of things that we are doing that have attracted attention from mainstream industry for example there is a lot of interest in a laptop that can run or hours between charges and there is a lot of interest in our user interface because we have eliminated a lot of the complexity and bloat
