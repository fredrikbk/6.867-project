in europe bustling east props up the west continents economic heartland powers ahead as exports to new eu members surge swiebodzin poland a long column of trucks winding east along a rutted road in the polish countryside testifies to a little noticed shift in the global economy soaring exports to europes postcommunist east are propping up economic growth in western europe most economists expected the recent recovery in the nation euro zone dominated by germany france and italy to falter this year as slowing u s growth high oil prices the euros surge against the dollar and rising interest rates took their toll instead europes economic heartland is powering ahead and companies in the region are busy investing and hiring in europe as in asia the dynamic growth of countries that have recently joined the capitalist global economy is creating new sources of demand that is making economic growth in many of the worlds developed countries less dependent on u s consumer appetite for spending from the czech republic to russia europes emerging markets are scooping up old europes products as they race to industrialize although these countries have relatively small economies russias total economic output last year was about &# trillion compared with the euro zones &# trillion they are disproportionately important as growth markets for western european companies the mostly central and eastern european countries that joined the european union in in particular are becoming major trading partners for europes established economies polands economy the largest among them generated total output of &# billion last year in this years first quarter the euro zone sold billion euros &# billion of goods to the eus newest members up more than from a year earlier they have overtaken the u s as an export market for the euro zone in the same period the u s bought billion euros of euro zone goods among the reasons in the past year the euro has risen against the dollar making euro zone exports more costly in the u s by contrast the euro has weakened in the same period against polands zloty russias economic boom fueled by oil and gas but spreading to other sectors is another important source of demand it is becoming a crucial export market for germany europes most powerful exporter euro zone exports to russia were billion euros in the first quarter up about from a year earlier asia as a whole remains the euro zones biggest export market importing billion euros of goods in the first quarter of but russia and the new eu members are close behind at billion euros moreover exports to the new europe are rising at about twice the pace of exports to asia the surge in eu exports behind the former iron curtain helps explain why western europe hasnt suffered from the u s economic slowdown to the surprise of economists who are used to seeing europe catch an economic cold when the u s sneezes it also is contributing to the rebalancing of demand in the world economy after many years when the world was overly dependent on the american consumers appetite for goods ranging from automobiles to electronic gadgets to major appliances u s households are retrenching that means faster growth in europe and elsewhere is needed to keep global growth from slowing "were seeing much slower growth in exports to the u s " said julian callow chief european economist at barclays capital in london "if that werent offset by growth elsewhere then conditions would be much worse in the euro area " sales of capital goods such as machines for factories and farms are at the heart of the boom in exports to central and eastern europe that means german industry which specializes in such equipment is benefiting more than the more consumer oriented industries of france and italy for german machinery maker krones ag which makes bottle filling machines for the drinks industry business in the new eu countries has grown steadily russia however has emerged as a major market only in the past year kroness sales in russia tripled last year said alois tax country manager for the bavarian company krones recently won a million euros order for bottling equipment from russian beverage maker aqua vision it will supply hygienic technology that mr tax describes as "the mercedes of bottling " multinational companies such as coca cola inc and pepsico inc are buying kroness machinery for their russian plants underlying the boom said mr tax is a new demand for luxury goods which in russia includes bottled water "people no longer want their water from a well " he said consumer spending is rising in the new europe too but not as sharply as investment by businesses including the many multinational companies that have set up factories in europes relatively low cost east even luxury goods are heading east like never before four years ago winemaker giancarlo moretti polegato from treviso italy had no sales at all in central and eastern europe last year his two wine companies villa sandi and la gioiosa sold two million bottles there on the back of spreading affluence that makes the region his fastest source of growth "russians are coming to rome florence and venice as tourists and theyre getting to know italian food and wine " said mr moretti polegato "now you can find prosecco on the wine list in top restaurants in st petersburg " he also is selling increasing amounts of wine in balkan countries such as bulgaria and albania "countries where we would never have thought of selling wine until a few years ago " he said europes trade boom is causing some strains however many industries are operating at full tilt giving rise to shortages of skilled workers and raw materials "our greatest problem is a lack of experienced truck drivers " said jan alblas owner of dutch logistics company alblas "everybody in europe has this problem at the moment " he said alblass business in poland the czech republic and slovakia is growing at an annual rate of allowing the company to expand beyond its base in holland belgium and germany this year alblas began operating in romania which joined the eu in january to exploit the potential growth of trade across the black sea "in the future romania will be an important port for container transport coming to europe from turkey and the far east " said mr alblas roads in the regions emerging economies are often nowhere near western european standards "infrastructure takes a long time to develop that costs us time and delays " said mr alblas that problem is all too visible on the clogged road through rural poland that leads from germany to poznan warsaw and beyond to the former soviet union trucks with license plates from all over europe follow a broad sweeping highway up to the german polish border on the oder river from there they funnel onto a polish road with just enough space for lines of trucks to head east and west daring cars to squeeze down the middle "i always feel queasy when i drive along this road you need luck " said robert czarnecki a local resident who says he often sees the aftermath of pile ups polands politicians he said are too busy pursuing political vendettas from the communist past to worry about improving the roads others worry the trade boom with europes east may not be sustainable some of europes emerging economies such as latvia are growing at a breakneck pace while others such as hungary have developed heavy trade deficits fueled by low interest rates and deficit spending some economists have compared the new europe with asia in the mid s before a wave of financial crises hit the region hungary and others are making strides to correct their economic imbalances said reinhard cluse an economist with ubs ag in london growth in the region will continue provided these countries can maintain high rates of export growth to western europe he said so many auto plants are springing up in slovakia for example that it is set to become the worlds biggest car maker per capita mr cluse said poland and russia apart europes emerging economies have relatively small domestic markets and ultimately their economic growth will depend on selling autos and other fruits of their rapid industrialization back to western europe falling unemployment in the euro zone bodes well for consumer demand and makes most observers optimistic about the outlook for two way trade
