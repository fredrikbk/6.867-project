talking b school how to raise female m b a enrollment boosting female enrollment in m b a programs has proved to be one of the most stubborn challenges facing business schools the percentage of women has held fairly steady for many years in the to range at most schools that "glass ceiling" troubles elissa ellis sangster executive director of the forte foundation in austin texas an organization of companies and schools dedicated to increasing the number of women in m b a programs and the business world earlier this month she talked with m b a track columnist ron alsop about obstacles schools face in attracting more women and some strategies to try to overcome them wsj are there any signs of progress in increasing female enrollment ms ellis sangster for a long time wed see a half percentage or full percentage point increase but then it would often fall back the next year last year however we saw a little more uptick at some top rated m b a programs among schools that belong to the forte foundation for example there was a gain in female enrollment of nearly two percentage points this year i would expect another increase but its too early to know how much q why dont more women enroll in m b a programs a timing has been one of the big reasons that its so difficult to move the needle when schools raised the work experience level to five years or more it became a big issue for women who wanted to go back for their m b a soon after college before they started thinking about having a family recently more schools have started to pay attention to that timing problem taking women with only two or three years of experience and even allowing a few top notch undergraduates to go straight from college into an m b a program q but dont most corporate recruiters demand quite a bit of previous work experience a its a catch because you dont want women graduating with no experience and being considered unqualified for m b a level jobs banks and consulting firms have told me that job candidates really need at least two to three years of experience but for many companies there doesnt seem to be a huge difference between two to three years and four to six years q do young women not realize the business opportunities that could be available to them a it isnt as clear what you do with a business degree as it is with a degree in law or medicine many women have feelings of trepidation and like to see things clearly laid out before them if they dont have a parent or close friend in business they tend to explore careers that are more familiar to them law school is one of our biggest competitors liberal arts women who are good at speaking and writing are often advised to go to law school when they think about business school they worry about the quantitative challenges q how can women learn more about different industries and jobs in business a they can do research online through some of the major career sites and at forte we offer career lab events at undergraduate colleges that provide an introduction to financial services consumer packaged goods and other industries women hear stories from other women about how they got where they are the classes they took clubs they belonged to and how they found internships were doing the career labs at about schools and hope to expand the number q at how young an age should schools and companies promote business careers to women a theres definitely a need to plant the seed earlier in high school if possible but its a bear to figure out how best to reach high school students for now were focusing on college age women were building an online program that well roll out over the next year to months including podcasts and videos of women speaking about their careers we also want to create an online game thats interactive and takes women through different life choices and were trying to get women to take the graduate management admission test before they leave college so they already have it in their pockets compared with men theres a higher chance that women wont take the test later in life q which strategies do you believe work best in attracting women to business schools a personal targeted approaches are best by their junior and senior year of college we need to go beyond online outreach and get women to attend events have internships and talk one on one with a counselor women want to have personal access to other women who have already done it and can inspire them at our forte forums for women to years old theres a lot of discussion about work life balance they ask the businesswomen there how spouses support them and what kind of treatment they get in the workplace women want to feel valued and fulfilled q can schools be more accommodating to the needs of women particularly those who have families to care for a there are things schools could do to be more progressive day care lactation rooms and the like could ease the day to day burdens of mothers in m b a programs but those things are pretty resource intensive for schools the flexibility of the curriculum might be a bigger issue for women rearing children who would like to switch to a part time schedule for a period of time but ultimately i dont think pleasantries make or break a womans plan to go back to business school q should schools reach out more to parents who tend to be so heavily involved in the lives of their children these days even after they leave home a reaching out to parents is certainly a hot topic at our forte board meetings because the millennial generation is so connected with their parents i never get calls from mothers but i do get calls from fathers often asking whether their daughter should get an m b a right after college i think dads can be a big influence if they have a business career just exposing their daughters to what they do is very important they also can tell their daughters about the network of contacts you can build through an m b a q how do european schools compare with u s schools in terms of female m b a enrollment a they struggle even more and are definitely behind u s schools its probably reflective of their cultures most european countries are five to years behind the u s in terms of putting value and importance on diverse leadership my sense is that asian and latin americas schools are even further behind the u s in bringing women into m b a programs
