the middle seat why fliers find summer travel growing tougher number of cancellations more than doubles amid storms gridlock june was one of the worst months in u s history for flight delays according to a preliminary count by the federal aviation administration and it may end up having been the worst of all time canceled flights last month more than doubled flights never got off the ground according to flight tracking service flightstats com compared with from the same month last year more than of all flights scheduled to land in the u s for the largest airlines arrived late in june with an average delay of minutes hundreds of thousands of travelers were left waiting for hours even days why more storms and too many jets a recipe for cancellations and long delays add an occasional problem with canadian airspace crucial to northeast traffic airline cutbacks a bit of finger pointing between the faa and airlines plus a labor dispute or two and you have a summer travel nightmare "the airspace is on the verge of tilting most any busy day it doesnt take much to tip it over " says david seymour vice president of operations control and planning at us airways group inc "the volume is just killing all the air traffic " airlines say the faa isnt handling enough traffic to satisfy the countrys growing travel demand while the agency contends airlines have created trouble for themselves by flooding key airports with more flights the airlines tracked by flightstats scheduled more flights in june than in the same month last year and that doesnt take into account increased flying by corporate jets and cargo haulers most of the airline increase came from fast growing regional airlines that fly small jets and turboprops feeding airline hubs and replacing big plane flights with multiple trips by smaller cheaper airplanes flightstats a unit of conducive technology corp of portland ore compiles data from airlines the faa and airports and distributes flight information to consumers and the aviation industry much of the added flying has been pushed into already congested facilities such as new yorks kennedy international airport the faa says for example that last thursday it handled more flights at kennedy than on the same day last year on average jfk is getting more than more flights a day another trouble spot dallas fort worth international airport a major traffic hub hammered by frequent june thunderstorms the faa which operates the nations air traffic control system but doesnt regulate flight scheduling says it is doing the best it can with antiquated air traffic control equipment desperately in need of modernization "when you couple the bad weather with the increase in traffic its a snowball effect " says mike sammartino the faas director of system operations delays increase exponentially when thunderstorms block either flight paths or airports he says its like a freeway traffic jam block one lane of a two lane highway and it may take four times as long to get through because everything slows down and backs up trying to squeeze through a funnel some airlines say the faa has been overly conservative this year the national command center has been quick to have airlines thin out flight schedules with delays and cancellations when storms are forecast they say and controllers sometimes are spacing planes as far as miles apart to avoid any chance of operational errors when five miles would be acceptable under federal rules airlines have been pressing for greater use of kennedy airports four runways much of the time only two are used at the same time this year the faa began using three runways simultaneously for takeoffs and landings but that has been sporadic airlines say often regional air traffic control centers down the line such as the one in washington d c refuse to take more planes coming from new york making it difficult to boost traffic flow at jfk "this is archaic we have the ability to increase capacity in the airspace and we arent doing it " says joe kolshak chief of operations at delta air lines which is one of the carriers expanding its business at kennedy with existing equipment he says "we can increase the capacity above what we are doing today " the faa says it has to be careful to keep air travel safe when airlines are swamping the skies with aircraft despite the large increases in the number of delayed flights the number of on time flights is also up from last year controllers are pushing the traffic through "look at the amount of operations that have occurred i think its amazing and astonishing " mr sammartino says several severe weather days were worsened for travelers in june because canadas air traffic officials didnt permit as many flights into that nations airspace as they usually do citing staffing issues and storms of their own the faa says airlines pay extra to use canadian routes but they are popular escapes into and out of the northeast when storms hit the u s canadas air traffic control system called navcanada says it took u s flights on days in june "we rarely refuse to open these routes when requested by the faa " spokesman john morris says carriers switch to smaller planes was part of a massive restructuring of the financially crippled industry since as airlines hustled to compete with low cost start ups survive the terrorism driven downturn and return to profitability despite rapidly escalating fuel bills carriers today have reduced airport staffing cut back on extra planes and pilots and scheduled gates with few breaks during the day the greater efficiency has kept them marginally profitable this year despite oil prices topping &# a barrel but it has meant more stress borne by travelers when weather hits airlines have more trouble recovering the major airline hit hardest in june was the biggest american airlines only of its arrivals in the u s were on time in june meaning they reached the gate within minutes of schedule according to flightstats and of the delayed flights were more than minutes late flight cancellations were four times as high as the june number american says thunderstorms which airplanes avoid because of the potential for hail lightning and violent winds affected its dallas fort worth hub which handles of americans domestic flights on days in june compared with only four days last year in the same month its other hubs in chicago and miami were hard hit by weather as well "this has really been an incredible summer from a weather perspective " says bob reding americans senior vice president for technical operations one byproduct of better safety technology is that new tools may also slow traffic more when storms hit better radar to detect wind shear and thunderstorms may leave more planes grounded while potentially saving lives experts say airport lightning detectors better protect workers from injury and death but lead to more shutdowns of ramp areas leaving airplanes waiting to load or unload for travelers much of the pain of the summer of has resulted from airlines inability to rebook customers from delayed or canceled flights leaving scores sleeping in airports or hotels after storms and sometimes waiting days for a seat to their destination jody dyerfox a sales representative for a major technology firm who travels frequently left dallas on the evening of monday june for meetings with clients in california after her flight was delayed more than three hours she reached her hotel at a m and had three hours of sleep before heading off to meetings on wednesday she planned a quick trip home to see the police in concert her husband had two tickets rows from the stage worth &# when she arrived at san francisco international airport she learned her a m flight on american to dallas had been canceled she called american and got rebooked on a us airways flight to las vegas where she could connect to another american flight to dallas scheduled to arrive at p m in time to get to the concert but nothing went as planned the us airways flight was late as was the american flight she made the connection then found herself on a flight circling over west texas because of storms in dallas the boeing flew closer to dallas only to begin circling again along the texas oklahoma border trying to get landing clearance in dallas it diverted to oklahoma city to refuel shortly after p m still leaving ms dyerfox with hopes of at least seeing the second half of the show if the fuel stop was quick "my husband was waiting at the airport and they kept telling him another hour itll just be another hour " then a passenger began having medical issues and emergency crews were called to take her off the plane adding to the delay by the time the plane made it to dallas the concert was lost and ms dyerfox didnt get home until after midnight then it was up at a m for an early us airways flight back to california for business that flight was canceled too adding five hours to the trip back to california "ive traveled for years and ive never had a week like that " she says
