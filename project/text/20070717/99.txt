schwarzenegger fights to save health plan governor would levy fees to cover all in state rival democratic bill chico calif when gov arnold schwarzenegger unveiled his &# billion universal health coverage plan earlier this year he cast himself as the rescuer of a broken system "i feel strongly that the people of california have sent me to sacramento to tackle those big problems " the republican governor told voters at an elementary school here recently "they have seen me on the screen to be the big action hero so they know that i can be the big action hero also in sacramento " mr schwarzenegger would force all californians to buy insurance while compelling insurers to accept all customers even those with medical problems businesses that dont offer coverage to employees would pay of their payroll costs into a state fund to help subsidize those who cant afford insurance unfortunately for the former movie star the state legislature has its own would be action heroes democrats who control both houses recently finalized their own plan that includes higher fees for businesses and other significant differences from the governors plan republican lawmakers reject both proposals saying the levies on business amount to a big new tax some groups say the schwarzenegger plan will hit lower middle class families who would be forced to buy coverage but wouldnt get enough help doing so doctors and hospitals would also have to pay new fees and they arent happy about it the states largest insurer the wellpoint inc unit blue cross of california is warning that "ill considered reforms" could damage the states health care market it recently ran radio and print ads reminiscent of the "harry and louise" campaign that helped upend hillary clintons national health care plan in despite the wrangling theres still a decent chance that the democrats and mr schwarzenegger will agree on a major overhaul legislators are preparing for a ballot measure next year that would allow them to keep their jobs longer and they would like to show voters an achievement the governor has put his prestige on the line by promising a comprehensive solution by the end of the year which effectively means mid september because the legislative session ends then incremental change wouldnt be enough he says in an interview "thats someone elses style not mine everything is this year " backers of a schwarzenegger style plan include aarp the washington based seniors group which has long pushed for universal health coverage "if we can get comprehensive reform in california it could be the dynamite that breaks the national logjam " says william novelli chief executive of aarp california wouldnt be the first state to enact a plan aimed at ensuring coverage for all of its citizens massachusetts did that last year but the golden state has the largest number of uninsured residents of any state about million people more than the entire population of massachusetts so overhauling its &# billion health care industry would be a milestone massachusetts had an easier time with a universal coverage plan partly because it could draw on a sizable pool of funds previously used to compensate for care of the uninsured unlike the california proposals massachusetts puts only a modest burden on employers those that dont offer health insurance pay a &# annual fee per employee california has a long history of failed efforts a state law enacted by democrats to expand health coverage was struck down by voters in a referendum mr schwarzenegger opposed that law saying it would be too costly for employers but last year the governor announced his own intention to overhaul the system and began hiring an odd bedfellows group of health care experts he brought on two democrats who worked for the previous governor others included an analyst who had worked for kaiser permanente the giant california health maintenance organization and a republican john ramey who had helped in the repeal of the democrats law the group has been working out of a cramped capitol office in sacramento lined with movie posters including one for mr schwarzeneggers final film in the terminator series it is affixed with the slogan "judgment day is inevitable so is health care reform " among their early debates was whether all of the states uninsured should be covered mr schwarzenegger never one to shy away from a bold pronouncement in front of a big audience answered the question on nbcs "meet the press " "weve got to insure everybody " he said that was news to some on his staff the governors spokesman quickly backpedaled telling the san francisco chronicle that the "goal is to expand coverage to as many people as possible " but eventually the governors directive took hold "it became clear that he really meant that " says mr ramey the republican staffer by january of this year mr schwarzenegger was ready for a theatrical unveiling in sacramento featuring a stage full of insurance executives union leaders and other groups with a stake in health care the governor sidelined by a skiing injury delivered his remarks via a video hookup from los angeles the plan itself was plenty dramatic mr schwarzenegger aimed to cover every california resident including undocumented immigrants a touchy decision for a republican businesses except those with fewer than employees would be required to either provide insurance to workers or pay of their payroll value into a state fund a mandate known as "pay or play " every californian would have to get health insurance which would draw young healthy people into the system though he was proposing billions in new fees mr schwarzenegger pitched his plan as business friendly he said universal coverage would spare companies and taxpayers the "hidden tax" of subsidizing emergency care for the uninsured finally the governor said california would be able to get more federal matching funds by expanding medicaid coverage for the poor that would bring higher payments to doctors and hospitals he said though he proposed taking some of the money back by imposing fees on them "everyone has to chip in but in the end the way it works is that everyone is left with a better deal " mr schwarzenegger said as he introduced his plan fabian nunez the democratic speaker of the state assembly says he wasnt expecting such a comprehensive proposal "i think the governor in some ways was further to the left" than democratic leaders says mr nunez their plans werent aiming for universal coverage jetting around the state mr schwarzenegger promoted his ideas and won support from some large companies that already provided health coverage but behind the scenes conflicts began to emerge in a series of private meetings held in the governors suite of capitol offices known as the "horseshoe " labor unions and consumer groups opposed the requirement that all individuals buy insurance saying they were worried working class people couldnt afford it a scheme to impose financial penalties on those who refused to buy coverage sparked protests in an april session according to a confidential email summary prepared by a participating lobbyist for the california association of health plans a representative of the teamsters "stated that they dont like these gestapo tactics " the email said in another skirmish during an april meeting a representative of the california medical association grilled the governors team about the proposed fee on doctors which would amount to of their revenue then she offered a proposal on how to make things more equitable impose fees on hmos drug companies and others the california association of health plans representative responded that his members were making sacrifices and "there is plenty of sharing in the governors proposal " according to the email small business interests objected to the "pay or play" mandate in may blue cross of california started running a series of tough print and radio ads designed by the same firm that crafted the famous "harry and louise" commercials the ads warned of "unintended consequences" from health care legislation mr schwarzeneggers plan with its new requirements for individuals and employers is similar in some respects to the one put forward by bill and hillary clinton in although the clinton plan relied more heavily on regulation of the insurance market blue cross says if its forced to offer coverage to all comers that might lead to higher premiums for people who can now buy reasonably priced coverage the company dominates californias big market for health insurance bought by individuals and it has built up expertise in figuring out which customers are a good risk expertise that would be less valuable if insurers are required to cover everyone one blue cross ad cautioned that efforts to fix californias health care system could make it worse not better similar to what happened when the states disastrous energy deregulation of the late s brought soaring power prices and some outages "lets not go there again " it said mr schwarzenegger never had his plan submitted as a bill in the state legislature a spokesman for the governor says his objective was to build consensus around a plan as a result the action in the state assembly and senate centered on legislation proposed by the democratic leaders of each house in early june the two houses passed similar bills they required employers to spend at least of their payroll on health care a much bigger burden than the schwarzenegger plan the bills heeding union concerns didnt require all individuals to buy insurance and they didnt impose new fees on doctors or hospitals on june the democrats merged the two bills into a single piece of legislation in the interview mr schwarzenegger said any law that forces insurers to cover everyone should also include the requirement that individuals buy insurance also known as an "individual mandate " he defended the fees on doctors and hospitals saying the burden shouldnt fall overwhelmingly on employers "its not fair to just ask one group to bear the responsibility " he said meanwhile both mr schwarzenegger and the democrats are trying to evade a possible legal tangle last month during the debate over the democrats bills a republican legislator unveiled an opinion from the legislatures legal office that said mr schwarzeneggers fees on doctors hospitals and employers were probably taxes in california taxes require a two thirds vote of the legislature to pass and thus need votes from at least a few republicans a spokesman for mr schwarzenegger says the ruling was preliminary because the legal office didnt review a full bill nonetheless its now less likely that any final legislation will include fees on doctors and hospitals the democrats have designed their bill to prevent the levy from being ruled a tax if that can be settled the individual mandate is the crucial sticking point "its irresponsible to require people to purchase health care insurance when you cant guarantee that theres an affordable health care product for them to purchase " says mr nunez the assembly speaker he recently reached for a little hollywood glamour of his own by hosting a sacramento screening of filmmaker michael moores documentary "sicko " still both the speaker and the governor express a willingness to compromise "im not closed minded to anything " says mr nunez mr schwarzenegger says he is flexible about the details and doesnt dwell on the obstacles to his plan "if i deal with the ifs i would have no time to run this state " there is a precedent for a deal last year the governor over opposition from many republicans signed a law passed by the democrats that imposed americas first statewide cap on greenhouse gases don perata the top democrat in the senate argues that for the governor "the biggest problem i think politically will be that the expectation has been built up so high " adds mr perata "if something lands on his desk how do you explain not signing it " business groups are already exploring possible legal challenges if the legislation doesnt win a two thirds vote a suit could argue that it contains new taxes and must be struck down in addition a suit could challenge the law under a federal law that limits states ability to impose health coverage requirements on multistate employers with self funded plans finally a law could be derailed by a ballot initiative the california restaurant association which opposes new fees on employers and helped defeat the earlier legislation in would like to see an acceptable deal this year says president jot condie but he adds his group is "actively engaged in fund raising reaching out to members putting them on notice we may need their help again" for a ballot campaign
