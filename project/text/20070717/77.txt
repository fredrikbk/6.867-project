politics &amp economics bush pins peace hopes on fatah plan to boost west bank economy could further alienate some palestinians jerusalem president bush believes he finally may have a solid foundation upon which to try to build a lasting peace between israelis and palestinians developments on the ground suggest his optimism as laid out yesterday in a white house speech may prove fleeting in his first major address on middle east peace since the islamist group hamas seized control of the gaza strip in a bloody sweep last month mr bush pledged to restart the moribund peace process by pouring aid and diplomatic attention on the new government established by palestinian president mahmoud abbas after losing power in gaza mr abbas leader of the largely secular fatah movement the main political rival to hamas still nominally controls the west bank mr bush said hamass takeover of gaza has created "a moment of clarity for all palestinians " who must now choose between a path toward "chaos and suffering" or toward "security and a better life " the president said he was organizing an international conference for the fall to promote palestinian reforms and to move toward the creation of a palestinian state to work mr bushs plan will require mr abbas to rapidly accomplish extraordinary economic and political goals at a time when fatah isnt only decimated in gaza but is fractured weak and adrift in its west bank stronghold the u s plan assumes mr abbas and his nominally independent palestinian authority prime minister salam fayad will be able to reclaim lost palestinian hearts and minds with u s and world financial backing to quickly create dramatic economic prosperity in the west bank mr bush said that the u s contribution would include &# million in humanitarian aid and &# million to help build up mr abbass security forces all of this money has already been appropriated the envisioned economic upturn is supposed to woo west bank palestinians to fatah while serving as a shining example for gaza residents at a time when their enclave will be further squeezed by a global boycott the bush administration believes palestinians will then abandon hamas which defeated fatah at the ballot box last january before routing its forces in an armed sweep of gaza last month the policy envisions mr abbas will be able to turn the west bank around secure a broader political base there and regain power in gaza without sharing control of the palestinian authority the quasigovernment of the palestinian territories with the politically dominant islamists some palestinian analysts said mr abbas or any other palestinian leader getting a warm embrace from the bush administration will be further frozen out by palestinians because the white house is deeply unpopular and distrusted in the west bank and gaza "the u s strategy right now will not boost salam fayyad or mahmoud abbas it will only weaken them and maybe even end them " said hani masri a palestinian political analyst in ramallah mr masri was interviewed before mr bushs formal announcement but the outlines of the u s plan have been known for weeks underlying this skepticism is fatahs desperate political condition and hamass deeply rooted popularity among palestinians many of whom rely on its social programs even if they dont support its islamist politics senior advisers to mr abbas have been jumping ship including one who saw his house stormed and burned after he leveled criticisms in an arab satellite interview at the fatah movement he helped found with the late yasser arafat the fatah security establishment also is in turmoil as commanders are replaced or engulfed in infighting over the loss of gaza in addition attempts by mr abbas to end chaos in the west bank are meeting with resistance while hamas has brought at least a temporary calm to gaza despite mr bushs portrayal of lawlessness there a decree from mr abbas to the west banks armed militias to disarm was ignored still some militants began willingly turning in their guns during the weekend after israel promised to end efforts to kill or capture almost of them in exchange for their pledges to stop attacking the jewish state meanwhile a heavy handed approach toward hamas supporters in the west bank is jeopardizing goodwill that any new prosperity from fatah may yield fatah security forces under mr abbass control are quietly carrying out scores of political arrests of hamas supporters across the territory a campaign that is angering west bank residents of all stripes and is widely condemned by human rights groups "i told them it is your campaign of arrests that will help transfer the events of gaza to the west bank not me " said yazeed khader a hamas political leader in the west bank who was arrested june and held for two days and two nights mr khader said "these are the same kinds of practices that have led fatah to fail in the past and will lead to greater failure again " among other signs of danger for mr abbas forces loyal to him have shuttered hamas affiliated media organs while his new minister of religious affairs ordered muslim clerics to avoid discussing politics in their friday sermons anecdotal signs of the islamist movements rising support in west bank are clear even in areas where fatah is strongest a new hamas affiliated summer camp for girls just outside of ramallah has attracted more than students greater than the chairs organizers said they expected to fill the four week program is fully subsidized as are similarly crowded camps for boys "we feel stronger there is real power on the ground and there is a motivation to raise our heads up now " said hashim ibrahim a year old hamas supporter and shopkeeper in ramallah walid ladedweh a pollster and researcher for the palestinian center for policy &amp survey research said the vast majority of palestinians in both the west bank and gaza believe a power sharing arrangement between the factions which has been opposed by the bush administration is the only answer anything that is seen as driving the factions further apart is destined to fail mr ladedweh said was the majority view even some of mr abbass most important allies agree "the right scenario to end this conflict is dialogue " said jabril rajoub who was mr abbass national security adviser until earlier this year and remains a senior adviser neil king jr in washington contributed to this article
