oil industry reality check there are two american oil industries one exists only in the minds of its critics many of whom are politicians when prices and profits rise as happens in a cyclical business the critics demand new antitrust and other legislation when prices and profits inevitably fall silence the other american oil industry exists in the real world its intensely competitive innovative and subject to more scrutiny and tougher antitrust enforcement than any other segment of the economy and its adept at meeting the diverse and dynamic needs of american consumers weve spent years at the federal trade commission enforcing the antitrust laws in this industry and even more time studying oil markets we have come to this conclusion when legislators dont completely understand the industry even their best efforts can harm consumers consider one driver of harmful regulation the belief that a handful of large oil companies control the industry in fact the industry is not highly concentrated the four largest firms collectively hold a smaller share than the top four firms in many other industries and these firms face a lot of competition valero is the largest u s refiner and non oil companies like wal mart sheetz and wawa sell a significant portion of retail gasoline most gas stations are owned and operated independently the oil industrys long term earnings are also typically in line with other industries recently the oil industry has earned above average profits cents for each dollar in sales in compared to cents for manufacturers but u s oil took a hit in the s as earnings fell well below those of other industries and as economic learning and antitrust enforcement have evolved weve seen that "big" and profitable are not necessarily bad in recent decades the real oil industry has greatly improved its efficiency through a series of mergers which have improved resource management increased innovation and technology diffusion and moved assets to firms with the ability and expertise to expand capacity extensive ftc studies have confirmed that the industry is highly competitive that concentration and mergers have not increased prices and that market forces most notably the price of crude oil and supply shocks cause price increases the petroleum industry receives closer antitrust scrutiny than any other industry and the ftc applies tougher standards to oil mergers than to mergers elsewhere to protect consumers the ftc has required record divestitures before mergers could proceed while still preserving the mergers efficiencies put simply there is no basis for abandoning as some propose the antitrust agencies fact intensive approach in favor of even tougher standards for oil mergers some argue that oil companies have conspired to restrain their capacity although numerous obstacles have prevented the construction of new refineries for decades capacity at existing refineries has expanded greatly u s refiners have spent tens of billions of dollars in recent decades increasing refining capacity and also improving output and satisfying environmental requirements its strong u s and worldwide demand that has pushed prices up gas prices also spike occasionally left alone the market will alleviate these spikes as it did in the aftermath of hurricane katrina higher prices led to greater supply which then lowered prices what we need are policies that let the market operate to spur investment in exploration capacity expansion operating efficiencies and technology advances instead congress is proposing to exacerbate americas energy problems some want to make price gouging a vague term with no clear legal meaning a crime such legislation would discourage the industry from responding rapidly to product shortages as bad as high prices are no gas at all or a return to gas lines is much worse moreover price gouging laws will harm consumers by reducing investment in new refineries it would be better if lawmakers passed useful measures such as reducing the number of fuel mandates that make it harder for refiners to respond to supply shocks congress could make it easier for oil companies to rush supply to consumers in a pinch by expediting the process required to waive regulations when prices spike and congress could streamline the refinery permitting process to allow more capacity expansion states could help out too by repealing laws that mandate how much gas stations must charge above the price they paid for gasoline as well as laws that prevent refiners from owning gas stations and that ban self service stations reality not political fiction should guide the energy debate americans deserve and can afford no less mr muris was chairman of the ftc from under president george w bush mr parker was director and senior deputy director of the ftcs bureau of competition from under president clinton messrs muris and parker are cochairman of the antitrust practice group at omelveny &amp myers llp in washington
