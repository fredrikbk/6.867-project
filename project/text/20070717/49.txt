global economy french tax proposal tests appetite for overhaul sarkozy promised paris a growing debate here over a possible sales tax increase on consumer goods highlights a challenge facing many european economies how to preserve their social welfare systems while competing with nations that have lower labor and benefits costs from universal health care to child care and pensions france offers its citizens among the broadest social benefits in europe french companies and their workers bear the brunt of the cost through uniform job contracts applied across industries now nicolas sarkozy frances recently elected conservative president is trying to change the system to make french businesses more nimble and to create more jobs the governments latest proposal is to reduce the amount companies contribute to the state run health care and pension systems which is based on the size of their work forces to make up for the lost income it would raise frances value added tax a levy similar to sales taxes in the u s which is currently as high as but the proposal provisionally dubbed "social vat " has run into big trouble french consumers have balked at an increase in the tax saying it would significantly dent their purchasing power economists are split on the plans merits some warn it could fuel inflation resistance to the proposal is raising questions about whether the french are ready for the sweeping overhaul promised by their new president voters ostensibly elected mr sarkozy because they wanted change but two months later that change may already be too much for many of them "it would be unfair to shift the entire burden of social welfare reform onto consumers " says francois carlier a director at ufc que choisir frances largest consumer lobby the debate also highlights potential frictions within europe after world war ii most european countries introduced collective welfare systems which have become a pillar of their societies today with globalization pitting european companies against lower cost competitors in asia and elsewhere the entire continent is grappling with how to sustain those expensive social benefits some countries have attempted to find their own solutions since the decade started german industry has lowered labor costs by leaning on workers to forgo pay increases and to work more hours while that approach has helped germany become a powerful exporter it may have simply redistributed some of the pain many french government officials for example believe germanys increased competitiveness has come at frances expense french critics argue that by keeping a lid on wages german firms have been able to price their goods more competitively winning market share from european rivals moreover they say stagnant wages have hurt consumer demand in germany a vital export market for other european economies this year germany raised its vat to from partly to cut its budget deficit and to adhere to european union rules on budget discipline but it also used some of the additional revenue to reduce the charges companies pay for unemployment insurance further increasing their competitiveness italy is due to cut payroll taxes for permanent employees by two percentage points this year in order to help its companies reduce labor costs as europe races to cut such costs france is afraid of losing out jean arthuis a centrist senator who served as french finance minister in the mid s says he is concerned that the eus members are trying to steal a march on one another "this is why i dont want france to be the last country to implement social vat " he says apart from small surpluses between and frances welfare system has been in the red since the s a combination of soft economic growth high unemployment and a gradual aging of the population has driven up welfare spending while contributions from companies stagnated the bulk of the deficit comes from the state run health care insurance system which recorded a shortfall of billion euros &# billion last year raising payroll taxes further to finance the system isnt a viable option according to data from of the developed nations that belong to the organization for economic cooperation and development france is second only to the czech republic in the contributions it requires its companies to make to finance social programs french companies already complain these large sums dissuade them from hiring payroll taxes on employees are by far the biggest source of financing for frances health care system which covers not just workers and pensioners but the countrys entire population that is why past attempts to squeeze more out of payroll taxes have failed to shrink the deficit although mr sarkozys "social vat" plan is still vague the idea would be to slash payroll taxes and make up for the lost revenue by increasing the standard vat rate on goods and services to mr arthuis the french senator says that would act as a powerful tool to protect french jobs which are increasingly being relocated to lower cost countries french companies would enjoy lower labor costs while imported products which would share the higher vat tax burden would help finance frances welfare system many economists however are skeptical that social vat can work the way mr arthuis describes they fear that it will fuel inflation a risk that would be aggravated if companies took advantage of the lower payroll taxes to fatten their margins instead of cutting prices to reflect the tax reduction in that case employees would be likely to seek higher pay to restore their spending power offsetting the benefits of a higher vat and draining french companies competitive edge corrections &amp amplifications the organization for economic cooperation &amp development
