report which parses out dangers from the terrorist network as well as hezbollah and non muslim extremists that pose a "persistent and evolving threat" to the u s in the next three years says "al qaeda will probably seek to leverage the contacts and capabilities of al qaeda in iraq aqi its most visible and capable affiliate and the only one known to have expressed a desire to attack the homeland " the report also concludes that al qaedas association with its indigenous iraqi wing helps the group raise funds and recruit operatives while efforts to clamp down on the group since the sept attacks has limited al qaedas ability to stage an attack on the u s the report says analysts fear that the level "of international cooperation may wane as becomes a more distant memory and perceptions of the threat diverge " the report was skeptical that a home grown threat from american muslims might arise as in the u k "the arrest and prosecution by u s law enforcement of a small number of violent islamic extremists inside the united states points to the possibility that others may become sufficiently radicalized that they will view the use of violence here as legitimate " the estimate said "we assess that this internal muslim terrorist threat is not likely " meanwhile the state department said that the u s is ready to hold direct talks with iran on iraqi security "they need to stop supporting sectarian militias that are exacerbating sectarian tensions they need to stop supporting explosives networks that pose a threat to our troops " said department spokesman sean mccormack "it
