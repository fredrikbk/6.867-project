letting your family in on your therapy approach enlists loved ones to participate in treatments overcoming the privacy issue when tony fama worries about recurring sadness or has questions about antidepressants he calls a psychiatrist his wifes mr famas wife helen kraljic suffers from bipolar disorder and he calls her doctor frequently if she seems to be manic or having side effects from her medication often mr fama sits in on his wifes therapy sessions offering his opinions sometimes he talks to the doctor about his own struggles as caregiver "the fact that i have an input with her doctors makes it easier to keep her disorder under control " says mr fama a year old supermarket manager in manhattan ms kraljics doctor isnt breaching her confidentiality by talking to her husband rather he is practicing an increasingly popular psychiatric treatment called "family based" or "family focused" therapy instead of excluding family members out of concern for patient privacy the family based approach seeks to expressly include spouses parents or siblings in therapy the practice goes beyond traditional family therapy which typically focuses on families dysfunction and forges new territory on privacy and doctor patient confidentiality issues frustrated by often ineffective treatment plans that keep loved ones in the dark and blame families for problems a growing number of therapists are turning to such methods family based counselors meet regularly with the patient and family members certain loved ones most often a spouse or parents but sometimes siblings as well are designated as caregivers each member of the family including the patient agrees to the open nature of the treatment sometimes signing a waiver outlining what information the therapist can share with relatives this can include details about symptoms and medication family members are free to talk to the therapist about their loved ones behavior symptoms and progress they also talk about how their relatives illness affects them the aim is to give each family member support and a role in the treatment "the focus is helping to mobilize the strengths in the family " says joan r asarnow a psychologist and professor at uclas semel institute for neuroscience &amp human behavior who uses the family based approach to treat depressed and suicidal children and adolescents critics of family based therapy say that the lack of boundaries can be dangerous patients may be leery of sharing intimate information with a therapist because they know there is a lower bar on confidentiality and family members may resist talking about their problems but proponents believe that the benefits far outweigh potential drawbacks they point out that this approach can save money rather than going on indefinitely the therapy is prescribed for a limited time typically nine months to a year with the idea that families will gain skills to continue on their own advocates also note that spouses parents and siblings often know the patient better than anyone else does indeed research has shown that the family based approach can reduce hospitalization and relapse rates and help patients take their medications more regularly "what has happened in the past is mental health professionals and the public would blame families and criticize them " says susan gingerich a social worker in philadelphia who uses family based therapy to treat people with schizophrenia "in fact they can be an important source of treatment " in september beth israel medical center in new york will open the bipolar family treatment center an outgrowth of the hospitals zirinsky mood disorders center the centers director psychiatrist igor galynker created an approach he calls "family inclusive treatment " at the bipolar center therapists explain to patients how their families can be an early warning system for crises and how the patient and family can work together to improve behavior the patient receives medication and psychotherapy and both the patient and caregivers are evaluated on a quarterly basis in addition children of the patient are evaluated by a therapist patients and family members sign consent forms that acknowledge that the doctor can share information with the family "but we dont disclose private issues that were discussed in therapy such as dreams or fantasies " says dr galynker who gives his cellphone number to all patients and their families dr galynker says his approach is similar to the work of david miklowitz a psychologist and professor at the university of colorado who pioneered a family focused approach for bipolar patients in and dr miklowitz published the results of his first randomized trials "what those studies showed is that if you combine family focused treatment with medications then you get a better outcome over two years than if you just give medication or medication and equally intensive individual therapy " says dr miklowitz who has written a manual for clinicians detailing his approach as well as a guide for families the family based approach may be having one of its biggest impacts in the area of eating disorders traditionally eating disorders have been treated by isolating the patient from his or her family in an in patient facility where feeding is controlled and the patient is given psychotherapy with the goal of encouraging autonomy from the family instead the family based treatment for eating disorders called the maudsley approach after the hospital in london where it was developed puts parents in charge of feeding and caring for the patient parents and siblings enter into therapy with the patient in addition they prepare all of the patients food and eat all meals with him or her "it stands traditional therapy for anorexia on its head " says james lock a child psychiatrist and professor at stanford university who helped bring the maudsley approach to the u s and developed a treatment manual with daniel le grange a psychologist at the university of chicago the treatment has been spreading rapidly in the u s maudsley parents a web site that disseminates information about the family based approach listed four therapists when it was launched in today it lists almost in a study published in in a psychiatry journal dr lock reported that of anorexic subjects treated with the maudsley approach about returned to a normal weight range by months and about returned to normal weight and had normal psychological parameters lydia spottswood credits the maudsley approach with helping her daughter erin finally beat anorexia for years the year old college student battled her eating disorder with individual psychotherapy family therapy and two extended stays in residential treatment centers as her health declined at one point she weighed about pounds and was hospitalized on a cardiac ward her parents tried to talk to her therapist but citing ethical guidelines and privacy laws the counselor refused to share information "even if they saw her deteriorating or we saw her deteriorating we couldnt communicate " says mrs spottswood a retired nurse who lives in kenosha wis last year the spottswoods asked their daughter to try the maudsley approach through a program at the university of chicago she moved back home and her parents took control of her feeding she and her parents attended weekly therapy sessions although miss spottswood says it wasnt easy she gained pounds in the first two weeks now for the first time in nearly five years she is at a healthy weight and is planning for the future "its a completely different thing knowing my parents were taking care of me " says miss spottswood "if a counselor or nurse helps you its their job but when my mom and dad did it its because they truly love and care about me "
