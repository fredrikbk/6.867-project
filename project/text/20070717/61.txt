kpmg ruling marks setback for prosecutors the government suffered an embarrassing blow with the collapse of its prosecution of former kpmg llp executives accused of selling fraudulent tax shelters but also may have gained a last ditch shot at salvaging a case gone wrong yesterday u s district judge lewis a kaplan dismissed indictments against of former kpmg executives charged nearly two years ago in the case which the government had billed as the biggest criminal tax prosecution in u s history the judge said he was left with no alternative but to toss out the criminal indictments after he found last year that prosecutors violated the former executives rights to counsel by putting undue pressure on kpmg not to pay their defense costs judge kaplan said he did so after "pursuing every alternative short of dismissal and only with the greatest reluctance " in may an appellate court rejected a bid by judge kaplan to hold a separate proceeding to determine whether the accounting firm was obligated to pay the legal fees judge kaplans decision is extraordinary and marks a potentially crippling blow to a yearslong investigation by the government into the sale and marketing of allegedly illegal tax shelters that allowed wealthy individuals to avoid paying billions of dollars in tax by creating sham investments that generated paper losses to offset capital gains now though in an attempt to save their case prosecutors are expected to appeal judge kaplans dismissal hoping the second circuit court of appeals will reverse the finding of constitutional violations that could lead to the reinstatement of charges against the kpmg defendants and help to repair significant damage to the reputation of federal prosecutors in manhattan one of the most high profile offices within the justice department or the appellate panel could side with judge kaplan reinforcing his findings on a national level and cementing the curbs he has already imposed on the government in a statement michael j garcia the u s attorney for the southern district of new york which is overseeing the case said that his office "respectfully disagrees with judge kaplan as to whether there was any constitutional violation in this case " the statement added that the government which has already appealed one part of that decision "will continue to pursue appellate review " attorneys for the former kpmg executives praised the judges moves "i think this decision will be one of those things in society that turns the tide and has a profound impact on our justice system " said stanley arkin an attorney at arkin kaplan rice llp who is representing jeffrey eischeid a former kpmg partner in the firms atlanta office who headed a group that designed and marketed tax shelter products for individual clients the government "forgot that their first job is to be fair and their second job is to prosecute " prosecutors have maintained throughout the proceedings that they played no role in kpmgs decision to cut off payment of the defendants legal fees judge kaplan however concluded last year that kpmg refused to pay "because the government held the proverbial gun to its head" and that prosecutors were "economical with the truth" in responses regarding the pressure placed on kpmg but until now the government was hamstrung in fighting judge kaplans earlier opinion because it hadnt resulted in any action that could be appealed instead the justice department was forced to retreat late last year the government repudiated a policy document known as the thompson memorandum that laid out conditions that companies under investigation must meet if they are to avoid indictment cutting off legal fees for suspect employees was one of those conditions veteran criminal defense attorney robert morvillo said judge kaplans ruling last year tipped the scales back toward white collar defendants in dealing with prosecutors after a long period marked by scandals such as enron corp and worldcom inc when companies were forced to cooperate to stave off indictment "the government has retreated in terms of pressing corporations to refrain from paying legal fees and is leaving it back to the corporations to decide " he said judge kaplans dismissal of the indictment is a stinging rebuke for prosecutors because the case against the former kpmg executives is the centerpiece of the governments crackdown on tax shelters which is continuing in regard to other accounting firms banks law firms and individuals connected with them while judge kaplan dismissed indictments against former kpmg executives he let charges stand against five other indicted individuals a kpmg executive who waived any right to claim legal fees two former executives who left the firm before the allegedly illegal conduct took place an outside lawyer and an outside investment adviser as the firm itself tried to avoid indictment kpmg agreed to stop paying fees for its executives following meetings with prosecutors who spelled out the kinds of cooperation they expected in august kpmg agreed to pay a &# million penalty as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the government shortly after individuals were indicted in connection with the shelter sales one has since pleaded guilty in june judge kaplan issued his ruling finding constitutional violations he then allowed the defendants to file a civil suit against kpmg seeking that the firm pay their fees but kpmg fought this move and won on appeal in late june prosecutors argued that the judge should go ahead and dismiss the charges an unusual move designed to set the stage for an appeal "if you get the second circuit to say that we agree with judge kaplans findings and we agree with his legal conclusions then it is even worse for the government going forward " said michael mcgovern a former assistant u s attorney who is now a defense attorney at ropes &amp gray llp "but i do think that as a practical matter the government feels that it cant get any worse than it already is " regardless of yesterdays dismissal five defendants will stand trial
