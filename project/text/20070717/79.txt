politics &amp economics eu clears way for biotech potato move on crop used in paper making signals concession brussels a european union move to let its farmers grow a genetically modified potato developed by basf ag suggests the eu is starting to make concessions to the farm biotech industry although not enough to satisfy companies the decision to allow cultivation of the crop which is to be used to make a paper coating would mark the first time the eu has approved a genetically modified organism for growing since it endorsed a type of monsanto co corn in eu agriculture ministers reached a stalemate over whether to allow farmers to grow the plant shifting the decision to the european commission the nation blocs executive arm "we will approve the potato " said barbara helfferich a commission spokeswoman "it has been analyzed and it is safe " the eu clamped down on approvals of genetically modified crops in the late s after a series of unrelated food scares including mad cow disease which had undermined public trust in government and corporate assurances on food safety although the use of the basf potato is expected to be relatively scarce and the crop isnt designed for food the step highlights growing pressure on the eu to relax its tight restrictions on genetically modified crops supporters of the use of genetically modified organisms or gmo say the crops pose no proven health risks opponents say the technology hasnt been in use long enough to trust that the crops are safe after the eu approved nine genetically modified crops for import but under pressure from public opinion and environmental groups the bloc has refused to approve any further such crops for cultivation in europe the eu also passed a law requiring food with more than of genetically modified ingredients to be labeled as such the eus tough strategy pleased many europeans who believe their food is healthier than the rest of the worlds as a result but europes industrial food and chemical producers and increasingly farmers complain they face higher costs than foreign competitors because they have to use conventional crops which have lower yields and higher vulnerability to disease other governments meanwhile see the eus biotech policies as simple trade barriers u s regulators have been kinder to the introduction of gmos which can cut costs on such items as irrigation and pesticides in the u s of soybeans of cotton and of corn are genetically modified the american farm bureau says after the u s and others complained about the eus restrictive policies the world trade organization last year ruled that the eu was unfairly blocking gmos from entering its markets germanys basf developed the potato now set for approval by injecting it with a gene that produces only a high quality low cost kind of starch used to make the glossy coating applied to magazines the remaining pulp can be used for livestock feed in europe the starch industry gets of its raw material from potatoes while in the u s it depends almost entirely on wheat and corn basf estimates it will take in million euros to million euros &# million to &# million a year in europe in licensing fees for the new potato says susanne brenner a spokeswoman for the company environmentalists say the potato is dangerous scientists included a starch gene in the basf potato but also an antibiotic gene thats used in a process to weed out potato plants that dont take the starch gene marco contiero a greenpeace analyst said he worries this could lead to bacteria used in the process becoming resistant to antibiotics leading biotech companies were guarded in their optimism after yesterdays eu move "its a step in the right direction " said julian little chairman of the u k agriculture biotechnology council a london based lobbying group "but its difficult to say its a huge step " the industry complained that the commission has delayed approval of other gmo varieties pioneer hi bred international a subsidiary of dupont co and syngenta ag have developed competitors to monsantos genetically modified worm killing corn which remains the only genetically modified plant approved for growing in europe european farmers are planting more than acres of the corn this year and all paying license fees to monsanto agriculture ministers usually split their vote on gmos which critics say allows both sides to put the blame for decisions on the european commission the ministers lack of direction has contributed to the commissions own inertia about applications for gmos for import or growing have been filed since and are pending approval
