the folly of negotiating with terrorists in iraq your july editorial "republican retreat" hit home for me because i was a longtime supporter of sen richard lugar he is the only politician i have ever worked for in an election campaign im also the stepfather of a young marine who joined the corps because of the threat made real to us after our marine is a three time veteran of iraq with a medal for valor in combat sen lugar is a nice man but a weak kneed politician unfortunately he has been in the senate too long he wants "negotiation " presumably the terrorists both sunni and shia will stop their killing and "negotiate" a peaceful settlement yeah right why would anyone negotiate when sen lugar and his fellow politicians will merely hand them a victory by backing a strategic redeployment the senator measures the domestic political climate real leaders try to affect the domestic political climate a self imposed defeat in iraq will only serve to embolden the world wide jihadist movement if the iranian backed factions prevail as seems likely in the bloodbath that will follow the lugar backed retreat whom will they kill next sen lugar blames the bush administration with some justification for its failure to anticipate the depth of the insurgency in iraq following the fall of saddam but he fails to understand the depth of the threat to us regardless of which terrorist faction prevails in iraq this is why both radical sunni and radical shia factions must be defeated like most politicians the senator wants to be remembered as a peace maker what america really needs is another harry truman to seek only to defeat a ruthless evil enemy not namby pamby politicians who pathetically seek the nobel peace prize as a "crowning achievement" to list on a tombstone john l sorg mccordsville ind
