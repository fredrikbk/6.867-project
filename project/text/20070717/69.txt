live at apollo management plan to cash in limit scrutiny apollo management lp joining the frenzy by private equity firms to capitalize on their successful track records is preparing a double barreled move to cash in and at the same time retain the advantages of being private the private equity firm founded by leon black plans to list its shares on a new goldman sachs group inc exchange available only to institutional and other sophisticated investors that promises to limit members exposure to the heavy scrutiny that comes with public markets this listing would come after apollo sells a stake in itself to the investment arm of the abu dhabi government and most likely another stake to the california public employees retirement system a playbook of sorts is beginning to emerge in the private equity arena as each recent deal has built on previous transactions the apollo deal which seeks to avoid the pitfalls of a public listing while profiting from the advantages of raising permanent capital and giving the founders a way to cash out if they so choose clearly blends elements of earlier transactions involving fortress investment group llc blackstone group lp and oaktree capital management llc fortress for example established the template by selling a slice of itself to nomura securities before it went public in february and like fortress by selling stakes before its listing apollo is ensuring that there is a floor under its offering price also by listing on goldmans new exchange dubbed "gs tradable unregistered equity otc market " or gstrue apollo wont exactly go public as blackstone and fortress have done that is because the exchange is private and barred to retail or individual investors and therefore enables apollo to avoid most of the regulatory requirements of a traditional share offering such private share placements for instance dont require a company to register with the securities and exchange commission and limit the financial details that must be disclosed to the public new york based apollos sale of a stake of just less than to the abu dhabi investment authority closely resembles blackstone groups sale of less than of its management company to the investment arm of the chinese government the abu dhabi investment authoritys stake is expected to involve no voting rights or active involvement to avoid any possible backlash both calpers the california pension fund and the abu dhabi arm known as adia have been investing in private equity firms for some time calpers which has been known to venture into alternative investments holds a stake in carlyle group lp and is among a number of limited partners considering a stake in tpg formerly known as texas pacific group last year when a big piece of apollos listed ap alternative assets lp was on the books of the banks calpers took a large chunk at a decent discount according to people familiar with the matter adia meanwhile has been close to apollo for years it took up almost half of apollos ap alternative assets last year in addition it has between and of ares management llc an alternative asset management firm based in los angeles that was spun off by apollo and is run by mr blacks brother in law tony ressler adia apollo and calpers all declined to comment at a recent conference mr black who has been coy for months about whether he would list apollo described the recent environment as one that is "great for raising money and selling companies " but he disparaged life as a public company as "being in a fishbowl and having any small shareholder sue you " apollo would be the second alternative asset firm to list on the goldman market following oaktree which listed in may in capturing two well known names in the alternative investment world goldman is again showing its clout on wall street oaktree listed at only a slight discount to the valuation it could have received in the public markets analysts say in getting apollo to join its exchange as well goldman is posing a challenge both to traditional exchanges and to regulators adia which is believed to have between &# billion and &# trillion in its coffers has a very low profile and a huge footprint it also has a reputation as a disciplined investor with a sharp focus on returns bankers close to adia say the firm has maintained a level of returns for many years and will rarely consider deals for less than &# million indeed talks between apollo and adia almost broke off at one point due to adias concern with valuation levels calpers staffers share that concern according to people familiar with the matter "is this really the right time everyone worries that this is the top of the market " says one consultant to pension funds and other private equity investors "if thats the case the worst thing you can do is invest in a management company " still apollo is likely more immune than some of its rivals to such concerns because it has prospered by investing in distressed securities and in troubled companies it isnt just the beneficiary of economic good times mr black still owns about of the firm which has returned an average of a year to investors
