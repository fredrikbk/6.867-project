business technology soa stirs a computing buzz modular software lets services be used across businesss parts andres carvallo chief information officer of austin energy was looking for a way to test the utilitys new software system for handling customer service calls he got his wish when a storm hit the states capital in may the night of the storm roughly customers lost power according to the companys records over the next three days the austin texas utility whose software was upgraded to handle calls an hour up from previously coped with heavy call volume "the phone system never went down never had a hiccup it was flawless " says mr carvallo chalk up a success for a software development scheme called service oriented architecture or soa that has become one of the most ballyhooed buzz phrases in corporate computing its a loosely defined concept overlapping with other web based advancements and programming trends that have been discussed for more than a decade in essence soa allows business processes like verifying a customers address or checking credit ratings to be built using modular chunks of software called "services" that can communicate with each other and be used across different parts of a business the services are often centrally stored in a repository and can be called up by other programs as needed the approach can save companies time and money because the software modules can be reused and reconfigured in new ways so companies can avoid starting from scratch when they want to build new software applications or add new capabilities to existing ones vladimir mitevski vice president of product management core services for thomson financial says it once took six weeks and roughly people to build deploy and maintain service offerings for thomson one a software platform for the financial industry after adopting a service oriented architecture in part using software from hewlett packard co mr mitevski says a single programmer working with various businesses quality testing and support groups within the company can deploy new and updated offerings in as little as minutes he cites "speed to market" as his no reason for adopting the methodology h p isnt alone many big technology vendors including international business machines corp microsoft corp sap ag and others are offering software that can be used to create soa based business applications as well as services to help companies analyze their operations to decide how to deploy soa austin energy for example relied on ibm software to construct a system that helps with chores like verifying customer information or figuring out which specialized crew members to send to fix outages reducing the time it takes over the phone to dispatch a crew to fix outages to two minutes from seven mr carvallo says soa has been around in its current form since the early s analysts say but its momentum has been building forrester research estimates that by the end of some of north american and european companies expect to adopt a service oriented architecture in some fashion "i dont believe we can ignore soa " says evelyn hubbert an analyst with the market research firm "it will be how we manage applications in the future " one satisfied user is ameriprise financial services inc s tracy legrand its chief architect and vice president of technology strategy and architecture who says that the technology allowed the company to release dream plan track a financial planning approach that the company launched last year within a year after the company was spun off from american express co ameriprise was able to tap into a repository of already defined services such as address changes for customers "instead of having to buy or build something new we can reuse it " says mr legrand still analysts and companies that sell soa related software and services warn that the leap to the new technology isnt easy for one thing companies need to set up a system to help keep track of the services they deploy where they should be used and who is allowed to use them rather than ripping and replacing major parts of a companys information technology infrastructure a costly process that can cause business disruptions analysts advise a more incremental strategy randy heffner who is also with forrester suggests that users apply soa to one business problem at a time that is guided by a higher level overall business strategy minnesotas anoka hennepin school district had a number of problems they included heavy call volume long lines of parents waiting for transportation services and limited ways to get information such as spelling lists or grade information to parents says patrick plant the districts director of technology and information services the school district also used cards that needed to be filled out with emergency notification information each year in with the help of microsoft software and services from h p the district began developing an soa based system that links services that span curriculum security health and human resources now parents can do much of their business with the district online including checking grades attendance and student lunch account balances the new system is a big time saver mr plant says "until we could start linking those systems together with a service oriented architecture the best we could do was create paper based proofing sheets "
