the common denominator of terrorist producing states princetons alan krueger is right in claiming that poverty isnt the main motivating factor behind terrorism but he is wrong in stating that a lack of civil liberties and political rights is the real culprit "capital princeton economist says lack of civil liberties not poverty breeds terrorism " july mr krueger looks at the list of major terrorist producing states and sees a lack of freedom and democracy as the common denominator however there are too many authoritarian states that dont produce terrorists for his hypothesis to be true neither north koreans nor cubans are busy blowing themselves up in cafes the common denominator among all major terrorist producing states is islam as politically incorrect as it may be to say it is this narrow and unbending theocratic civilization which often provides education only in the form of uncompromising religious indoctrination that actually supplies most of the fuel for world terror however it is the caustic sense of humiliation among many muslims over western ascendancy that actually lights the fuse muslims are raised on the belief that islam the perfect faith is superior to all other religions and that the only reason that islam is not ascendant is that the west is undermining it many muslims simply find it impossible to attribute their current situation to their own civilizations failures until self criticism and a recognition of western scientific superiority resulting from the triumph of science over orthodoxy is embraced by islamic civilization from north africa to the indian ocean we need look no further for an explanation when self criticism and an ability to understand the true roots of western success take hold in the abode of islam levels of terror will no longer warrant this discussion peter altman deputy director bluestarpr org san francisco mr krueger has taken a simple set of statistics on income and said that we should reject "material deprivation or inadequate education as an important cause of support for terrorism " this unfortunately ignores what economists know to be group vs individual effects and has the unfortunate side effect of being interpreted in the political realm as suggesting that there is no relationship between fighting poverty and terrorism of course mr kruegers basic data are correct terrorists are often from the middle class but they also use the humiliation of poverty as a powerful recruiting tool there are two reasons to fight poverty as a response to terrorism first it offers an alternative vision of how to work for a better society and how to unite those who are divided second terrorists depend upon the emotional support of their communities and these communities are much less likely to exhibit hatred toward those who are actively engaging with them to construct better lives i work with a group of families who have lost loved ones to terrorism and are trying to make a difference by devoting their own resources to activities like building schools or clinics in poor areas of the world often those communities most affected by terrorists our work complements not competes with the sacrifices of those who serve as police or firefighters or military we work with a lot of charities pick your own mr krueger and become one of our stories run some empirical tests later on how well terrorists are recruited from the families of those whom you served vs other families in any case dont sit on the sideline show that your comments werent meant to encourage other people or our government to sit on that sideline because until you act or say otherwise that is how you are being interpreted gene steuerle co founder our voices together washington president bushs rhetoric of proclaiming political liberty as the solution to their rage must be combined with intellectual liberty for muslims to discuss question and doubt their own faith as is the practice in most other religions only muslims can drive a religious reformation charles r smith san jose calif
