a cultural conversation with daniel radcliffe portrait of the wizard as a young artist new york am i talking too fast " its a kindness in daniel radcliffe to ask and the answer is no except in the sense that its hard to keep up with him if youre scribbling your notes without benefit of a magic quill but if the celluloid harry potters brain is racing he has every excuse "harry potter and the order of the phoenix " fifth in the series of screen adaptations of j k rowlings seven novel portrait of the artist as a young wizard opened at midnight on a tuesday hours later the promotional juggernaut has him chugging nonstop from slightly past dawn till after dusk at what might be an awkward age he turns next monday mr radcliffe is anything but luckily for the "potter" franchise his build is slight and he hasnt shot up tall still the face is more angular than it used to be the jaw in particular looks squarer more determined early in the new film before harry returns to hogwarts mr radcliffes aura is almost unnervingly grown up even suave "my ethic is to wrong foot people " the young prince of players says recalling a recent interview with a reporter who must have expected someone not too bright to wrong foot people to catch them off guard "yes " he nods "absolutely people talk to me about all the child actors who went off the rails why dont they talk about christian bale or tobey maguire or elijah wood or christina ricci or jodie foster who grew up and just keep doing fantastic work " in august mr radcliffe heads off to ireland for the television film "my boy jack " in which he plays rudyard kiplings year old son gone missing in the great war it airs in november in september hell be back on the big screen in "december boys " a tale of four orphans set in australia it wrapped in january these projects may bring some surprises but last winter mr radcliffe wrong footed the world in what was for all intents and purposes his debut as a stage actor the play was peter shaffers "equus " an international hit from the s in its first london revival mr radcliffe played alan strang a shy adolescent who one night runs amok and blinds six horses richard griffiths lately on broadway in "the history boys " played the psychiatrist martin dysart who unravels the traumatic back story promising to heal the boy even as he envies him the pagan ecstasy of his inner life "our generous tabloids " mr radcliffe says one of the headlines greeting the announcement of the project read "crash the sound of a career coming to a grinding halt " "the papers always make things up but the thing i cant stand is lazy journalism theyd heard that i would be naked that i would smoke and swear but they made a pretty fast u turn once the play opened " he smoked and swore he stripped he conquered a new york transfer of the production is under discussion transparent deep emotions chased across his features without a trace of false histrionics the repertoire of hurt glowering resentful looks seemed inexhaustible and there was reckless joy too his line readings jittery guileless furious hostile mirrored unerringly alans state of mind in the mouth of the actress playing alans mother a biblical description of a horse in battle "he saith among the trumpets ha ha" was an embarrassment its the english of the king james version in mr radcliffes it gave you shivers the stage is a good place for mr radcliffe while waiting for him to grow into hamlet a producer might think of offering him sheridans jack absolute in "the rivals " or nicholas nickleby in the royal shakespeare companys eight hour adaptation of the dickens novel staying power should be no problem in "equus " apart from a few minutes at the top of the first act mr radcliffe was onstage throughout for over two hours rather than exit he would go and sit on one of several blocks strewn about a set metaphorically designed as an operating theater a place for dissecting souls though momentarily absent from the action mr radcliffes alan was never not there "thea sharrock the director wanted that as a gentle reminder that the play is about dysart and alan we discussed how alan loves his sessions with dysart even if theyre unfulfilling and make him angry theres nothing else in his life having him sit there shows the monotony he just waits that gives the viewer time to go into alans world and as alan i have time to analyze what ive just done the way you do when you feel youve screwed up " two straight hours of scrutiny by a theater full of strangers is a trial by fire no screen actor has to endure "if i can do that i can certainly stay in the moment for a take " mr radcliffe says "what i learn from one project i take to the next one " each of the directors of the "harry potter" series has contributed to mr radcliffes growing mastery "chris columbus who did sorcerers stone and chamber of secrets was amazing he got three kids and never to lose their enthusiasm he had us raring to go every day and that was on a long shoot months alfonso cuaron who did prisoner of azkaban was more i hesitate to use the word spiritual but he took me deeper beyond the story line mike newell in goblet of fire took that process further david yates who did order of the phoenix produced the biggest progress in my acting hed never settle he was always pushing for more thats not real hed say you can do better but at the same time he backs his actors he has confidence and he gives you confidence " in "order of the phoenix " mr radcliffe displays much of the coiled guarded charisma he went on to show the london audience in "equus " palpably seething without the crude signifiers of a knitted brow or a clenched jaw "ive worked hard on reining in emotion " mr radcliffe remarks "ive always aimed for showing things more subtly " he prizes the wisdom handed down to him by mr griffiths at the actors hangout joe allen one night after "equus " "richard said im going to tell you something lee marvin told me which spencer tracy told him never let the camera find you not thinking if the thoughts are there and theyre genuine and truthful the camera will find them " in "order of the phoenix " hogwarts students paying attention to the black magic imperiling a world in denial secretly band together as dumbledores army and harry instructs them in forbidden spells the good guys will need for their survival perhaps the most moving moment in the film and one of the happiest is harrys graduation speech which mr radcliffe can still quote verbatim working hard is important but theres one thing that matters even more believing in yourself think of it this way every great wizard in history has started out as no more than we are now students if they can do it why not us at the risk of alienating his fan base mr radcliffe has long been going out of his way to assert his identity as distinct from harry potters yet this speech delivered at this moment in his career with the particular sparkle in his eyes feels like the actors personal pledge never to stop striving to perfect his craft already as harry potter he has had to hold his own against some of britains canniest wizards of stage and screen a special favorite is gary oldman who plays harrys maligned godfather sirius black "gary oldman can do anything " mr radcliffe says "im quietly ambitious to develop that kind of range " mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on culture and the arts
