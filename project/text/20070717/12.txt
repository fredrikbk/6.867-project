brooks brothers tries a hip line will it suit venerable retailer links up with cutting edge designer aiming to draw new crowd can brooks brothers appeal to a younger hipper customer next month the privately held haberdashery will launch the biggest print ad campaign in its year history to introduce black fleece a high end collection by avant garde designer thom browne its part of the retailers broader effort to signal that its keeping up with the times and to draw in new customers featuring clothes by mr browne known for ankle baring gray flannel suits and cropped jackets is a departure for the venerable brooks brothers mr brownes suits developed a cult following as the slender foot budding designer sported them around new yorks meatpacking district where he began his own business in his apartment in the ads for mr brownes black fleece collection which will appear in the big september fashion issues of magazines like gq and vogue are also a contrast to the usual brooks brothers style rather than catalogue like color images of models in traditional poses the new ads feature moody black and white shots to produce them brooks brothers for the first time used an outside agency the new york based ar known for work for fashion clients such as dolce &amp gabbana and gap inc s banana republic the campaign estimated to cost &# million is packaged in six to page spreads that begin with traditional brooks brothers clothes such as ready to wear suits ranging up to &# and end with two facing pages featuring models in &# suits designed by mr browne with his signature fitted style the tagline on those pages "style for a new generation " is a play on the stores longtime slogan "generations of style " brooks brothers chief executive claudio del vecchio says the collaboration with the year old mr browne is aimed both at better servicing the clothiers existing customers the retailer says their average age is and bringing in new traffic from customers who might have a vision that the store is still "the brooks brothers of five or years ago not the brooks brothers of today " black fleece a takeoff on the traditional brooks brothers "golden fleece" logo of a sheep encircled with a ribbon marks the second time in recent years that the clothier has attempted to launch a sub brand in it introduced its "country club" label in its stores the collection of resort sportswear did so well that brooks brothers opened standalone country club stores earlier this year in sandestin fla and newport r i it plans to roll out four more this year in the six years brooks brothers has been owned by the holding company run by mr del vecchio it also has been courting new customers with innovations such as no iron shirts introduced in they now make up of the retailers dress shirt business and stain resistant ties as well as a high tech custom fitting system the brooks brothers collaboration with mr browne is the latest effort to reach new customers with a strategy now widely used in fashion and retail just as the brand louis vuitton became hip again under designer marc jacobs and target corp upped its stores cool factor with isaac mizrahi fashion marketers today "cant operate without having a cutting edge designer name " says david wolfe creative director of doneger group retail consultants "thom browne allows brooks to layer in a designer name that has nothing to do with its core business but enhances the image and cachet that helps them move the regular merchandise " before mr browne began making custom suits in he was briefly creative director at polo ralph lauren corp s club monaco mr brownes own line quickly gained attention and by bergdorf goodman began carrying his collection barneys new york and the jeffrey boutique in new york now sell it as well brooks brothers signed a two year deal with mr browne after vogue editor anna wintour introduced him to mr del vecchio who says he was impressed with mr brownes knowledge of and affection for brooks brothers mr browne has said his father and grandfather were brooks brothers fans and he wore the clothes in his youth it remains to be seen how mr brownes collection at brooks brothers will go over with customers mr brownes fans wont see his name on the label which features the brooks brothers fleece logo in black rather than gold though not as extreme as his own label which will continue to sell at other stores the clothes have a decidedly close to the body fit mens sizes go up to only a chest jacket all the pants in the collection however come with unfinished bottoms that can be hemmed the way the customer wants and dont have to be as short as mr browne wears them on brooks brothers chief merchandising officer lou amendola who has been working closely with mr browne a gray flannel style that he was test driving looked like a snugger version of a brooks brothers suit he says black fleece is aimed at an "attractive plus young professional who needs to dress up but wants a little bit more of a style to conservative clothing " another big question is how women who make up a third of brooks brothers shoppers will react to mr brownes first womens line with sizes running from an equivalent of to the standard sixty percent of the black fleece collection is womenswear including &# herringbone lined khaki trenchcoats &# strapless gray flannel dresses with voile overlays and one showpiece item a &# astrakhan fur cape prices overall will be about or higher than for traditional brooks brothers merchandise other items in the collection which consists of pieces made in italy and at brooks brothers factories in the u s include &# wool suits &# cashmere sweaters &# wingtip shoes and &# cotton button down shirts which mr browne prefers with the collar buttons undone brooks brothers says it expects the black fleece line to add no more than &# million initially to its &# million in annual sales starting in september it will initially sell the black fleece collection in only of its brooks brothers stores around the world though its new york flagship will devote a full floor to it and other stores will display it prominently the collection will also be available on the brooks brothers web site brooks brothers plans displays of black fleece items on tables with jackets opened so customers can study the handwork that went into the garments while mr brownes aesthetic is far from mainstream his line is starting to appeal to more than just the fashion forward crowd jay bell senior buyer mens designer collections at barneys says he was surprised by how enthusiastically some bankers have responded after trying on thom browne suits and finding them not as snug as they might have guessed at first barneys offered the collection only in its flagship store on new yorks madison avenue but it now carries it at stores in other cities the retailer increased its orders of mr brownes collection by for fall more than the typical increase for a designer collection that is selling well ward kelvin a year old designer of tableware and jewelry in new york bought his first thom browne suit at bergdorf goodman three years ago and has been a fan ever since he says he doesnt wear the "whole hog thom browne thing " choosing a "modified version" of the designers high water pants for example though mr kelvin says the line takes some "confidence and wherewithal" to wear he adds its not as extreme as mr browne presents it "in his shows its very theatrical but when youre in the store trying it on its nothing like that " mr browne who will make appearances at several brooks brothers stores including one near his hometown of allentown pa acknowledges that his styles could take some getting used to but he says that once men put on the jackets theyll discover that they can move their arms despite the snugger fit "people dont realize fitted clothes make you look thinner " he says
