review &amp outlook editorial borlaugs revolution in when norman borlaug arrived in mexico the nation was in the grip of crop failure cereals like wheat are dietary staples but in mexico an airborne fungus was causing an epidemic of "stem rust " and acreage once flush with golden wheat and maize yielded little more than sunbaked sallow weeds coupled with a population surge famine seemed in the offing dr borlaug left mexico in with a harvest six times what it was when he arrived from acres of arable land sprung a hyperactive strain of wheat engineered by the scientist in his laboratory fertilized and nurtured according to his methods and irrigated by systems he helped to design mexicos peasantry was not only fed it was selling wheat on the international market the reversal of the mexican crop disaster was an early tiding of the green revolution over the next years dr borlaug devoted himself to the undeveloped world undoing crop failure in india and pakistan and rescuing rice in the philippines indonesia and china he has arguably saved more lives than anyone in history maybe one billion dr borlaug was awarded the nobel peace prize in yet his name remains largely unknown today at age he receives the congressional gold medal perhaps it will secure the fame he merits but never pursued then again perhaps not while dr borlaug was expanding human possibility his critics who held humanity to be profligate and the earths resources finite were receiving all the attention they still are the most famous may be paul ehrlich a biologist who declared in the s that "the battle to feed all of humanity" was lost "in the s and s " he claimed "hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now " in lester brown founder of the earth policy institute and still widely quoted today said the demand for food had "outrun the productive capacity of the worlds farmers " the only solution "were going to have to restructure the global economy " of course greenpeace and other pessimists were scandalized at dr borlaugs green revolution it disproved their admonitions and worst of all led to industrial development they even convinced the rockefeller and ford foundations to stop funding dr borlaugs efforts we see these battle lines today in the energy wars history has its share of tragedy but dr borlaugs life demonstrates that environmental doomsayers are almost always wrong because they overlook one variable human ingenuity the late economist julian simon was in the habit of claiming that natural resources are basically infinite his refrain "a higher price represents an opportunity that leads inventors and businesspeople to seek new ways to satisfy the shortages some fail at cost to themselves a few succeed and the final result is that we end up better off than if the original shortage problems had never arisen " as anti development environmentalists preach the gospel of limits and state coercion here is a question worth asking how many millions of people might have perished had norman borlaug heeded their teachings see related letters "letters to the editor our green giants bring hope and save lives" wsj aug
