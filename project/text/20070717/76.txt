politics &amp economics fed feels pressure to protect consumers tighter scrutiny of lenders seen likely as congress blasts regulator over subprime failures washington the federal reserve under fire on capitol hill for not protecting consumers more aggressively from dubious banking practices will likely become more assertive toward the lending and marketing practices of the nations more than banks credit unions finance companies and mortgage brokers in the wake of a meltdown in the market for subprime mortgages and increasing congressional scrutiny of practices in the credit card industry democratic leaders have blasted the feds regulatory performance the form that any changes in the feds regulatory approach might take isnt clear but they could affect anything from credit card payments to mortgage penalties the central bank has broad authority to prohibit banking practices it deems unfair and deceptive an important role that receives far less attention than the setting of monetary policy this years political assault on the feds consumer protection record may reach a crescendo this week with fed chairman ben bernanke set to face lawmakers during two days of congressional testimony starting tomorrow mr bernanke entering his second year at the feds helm is still trying to cement his stature with lawmakers the way he did quickly with wall street "they had a job to do and they didnt do it " said senate banking committee chairman christopher dodd d conn of the feds performance "a lot of people are hurt and im angry about it " added mr dodd who is seeking the democratic presidential nomination the pressure on the fed represents one of the most significant challenges to its authority in decades house financial services committee chairman barney frank d mass has threatened to give some of the feds jurisdiction to other regulators if the central bank doesnt begin making changes by the fall moreover three nominees to the feds seven member board are awaiting confirmation by mr dodds senate committee "there is a deep level of anxiety and frustration in every congressional office everyplace we go on this issue " alfred a dellibovi president of the federal home loan bank of new york told fed governor randall kroszner during a recent meeting "it seems to me that either the fed is going to have to act on this or its powers will be moved somewhere else " it remains unclear whether the feds regulatory woes will hurt mr bernankes monetary policy goals but mr frank dismissed the idea "are we resisting bernankes monetary policy because of this thats ludicrous " under former chairman alan greenspan who stepped down last year the fed successfully accumulated broader regulatory jurisdiction over banking and consumer protection in part because of its reputation for independence the central bank now is the only government body that can write rules banning any practice it deems unfair and deceptive at the nations more than banks it is also the only agency that can prohibit any mortgage practice across the entire lending industry instead of aggressively using these tools the fed has tried to take a market based approach encouraging fair disclosures and trying to root out bad actors quietly rather than wielding a heavy hand that might deter innovation this has allowed the financial services industry to develop novel and flexible types of credit such as interest only mortgages but critics allege that this approach has also allowed questionable practices to entrench themselves with little scrutiny three of the five current fed governors mr bernanke kevin warsh and mr kroszner have been economic policy advisors to the white house which has a similar market based philosophy with regard to financial services regulation other federal agencies have moved faster to head off congressional criticism comptroller of the currency john dugan started a web site last week to help consumers resolve issues with their banks federal deposit insurance corp chairman sheila bair has pressed banks to move borrowers with expensive adjustable rate mortgages into more affordable fixed rate products and the office of thrift supervision has begun working on its own proposal to ban unfair and deceptive practices at more than federally insured thrifts faced with the possibility that some of its power might be scaled back the fed is changing its rhetoric in may mr bernanke said the central bank had the authority to prohibit certain mortgage practices mr dodd objected saying the fed was playing down its role a month later mr bernanke shifted saying the central bank "has the responsibility to prohibit mortgage lending practices that it finds to be unfair and deceptive " the fed held a daylong public hearing last month to discuss different ways it could use its authority and senior officials have begun speaking much more bluntly about the types of actions it could eventually take "we have not taken anything off the table " said sandra f braunstein director of the feds division of consumer and community affairs "we are willing to use any of the tools available to us that includes rule writing or banning practices or anything else we feel is necessary " as criticism of the fed intensified last month mr bernanke held a closed door meeting with roughly members from the association of community organizations for reform now a consumer group that has asked for a moratorium on all foreclosures stemming from problems in the subprime mortgage market it is unclear what types of practices the fed might try to abolish but that hasnt stopped consumer groups and democrats from making suggestions one of the most frequently criticized is a credit card practice known as double cycle billing which allows companies to charge customers interest on almost all their credit card balance even if the borrower pays off almost all of it by the due date another prepayment penalties on mortgages particularly those that penalize a borrower for trying to pay off an adjustable rate mortgage before it resets into a much higher monthly payment last month the fed and other regulators warned banks away from such mortgage penalties but it didnt use its rule writing authority to ban the practice across the industry
