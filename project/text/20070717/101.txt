the daily fix after a brilliant career ballesteros says goodbye online edition severiano "seve" ballesteros the winner of five golf majors and european titles and a successful ryder cup player and captain retired at age yesterday on the eve of the british open at carnoustie he hadnt won a tournament since missed the cut and finished over par through two rounds at this years masters and has been plagued by trouble with his back and heart mr ballesteross decline was painful for independent columnist james lawton to behold "yesterday it was as though ballesteros was saying that a man can take only so many defeats " mr lawton writes "he can travel only so far along a road that bristles with discouragement no one could argue with his decision indeed for some there could only be a degree of amazement that he had travelled so far so painfully with so little incentive however the odds are that they did not see the young ballesteros they did not see the force of a talent that was as brilliant as it was profligate " in the times of london simon barnes celebrates the young mr ballesteros "his naked intensity blazed through the reticence of his sport " mr barnes writes "his anguish and his joy were not the sort of thing you are supposed to see on a golf course but he had nothing to do with the safe world he was from spain from outside the golfing pale and the sports anglo saxon or wasp traditions meant nothing at all to him " the guardians john huggan recounts some of mr ballesteross greatest shots and writes "a hero to at least two generations he has been no question the most historically significant and charismatic european player of the past years there were so many memories so many thrilling moments to savour in the career of the kid from the fishing village of pedrena on spains northern coast the kid who played not with the plodding artisanship of a nick faldo or a colin montgomerie but with the dashing aplomb of the supreme artist " ken griffey jr hit career home run no last night passing frank robinson to move into sixth place all time that places him homers behind barry bonds who has and is four shy of hank aarons all time mark but griffey has missed about games due to injury since he arrived in cincinnati in an alternate reality in which he stayed healthy might he be in a race with bonds for no this season john beamer crunches the numbers on hardball times and finds that under one scenario griffey would have broken the record earlier this season ah what might have been bonds is the reality however unpleasant and possibly tainted by steroids the san francisco chronicles gwen knapp examines the backlash against the backlash against bonds "this is what weve come to bonds loudest supporters talk about his critics more than about him " ms knapp writes "they fight his detractors more avidly than they cheer his accomplishments they enjoy being the enemies of his enemies " bonds has his defenders in san francisco which is why the giants want their beleaguered slugger to break aarons mark at home that could combine with bondss stated desire to return to baseball next year to create a scenario in which this ugly chase for a record drags into next season ted robinson writes on msnbc about the giants mr robinson writes "they deserve no sympathy for they willingly chose this path but their season has been destroyed and instead of having any ability to look ahead they are stuck in their pairing with bonds there can be no integrity in their games " as the ugly wait goes on daniel brown of the san jose mercury news checks in with some of the less well known pitchers who are among the to yield a long ball to bonds the slugger was the only strikeout victim of eddie priests two start major league career in his next at bat bonds took mr priest deep priest now lives in albertville ala where he works for a tractor business and conducts baseball clinics for kids " mr brown writes "he plans on trying to track down footage of his showdown with the impending home run record holder my son is in the first grade and hes going to start hearing the name of barry bonds from his buddies priest said pretty soon im going to be telling him my story " john ferguson a former hockey enforcer general manager coach and scout died saturday at age in his eight seasons with the montreal canadiens they won the stanley cup five times "there was nothing complicated about his game " red fisher writes in the montreal gazette "it was hit first ask no questions later he played to inflict pain to intimidate no exceptions opposing players were fair game if he happened to be a goaltender tough bam " that playing style was borne out of necessity kent gilchrist writes in the vancouver province "john ferguson may very well have been the nhls original goon but it was an act partly anyway " mr gilchrist writes "he was really a sweet guy but he knew that with his skating limitations the only way he was going to be a player in the nhl was by first nailing a guy with those piercing black eyes and then demonstrating to his victim that he was right to be nervous because he was the toughest sob in the league " one wonders what fergy would have made of derek and aaron boogaard fighting camp the creation of minnesota wild enforcer derek boogaard the camps logo includes a garish blood stain "at a time when another round of salary wars seems destined to threaten the nhls delicate economics a guy employed to beat up people which by the way still lands you in the penalty box is calling out the customers who would rather see skating and scoring " rachel blount writes in the minneapolis star tribune "worse hes taking that bully act to the youth level under the guise of helping young players aaahh yes its all about the kids at least its all about the &# the younguns pay to get a t shirt splashed with fake blood and watch a videotape of boogaards most ferocious beatdowns the big guy seems to have a gift for entrepreneurship but hes going to have to work on his debate skills to sell this dubious venture to a sporting public weary of unchecked violence in its games " when the all american football league makes its debut one of the men trying to make the cut will be todd delamielleure hes a firefighter from charleston s c where nine firemen died in a building collapse last month a tragedy that todds father believes has lent urgency to his sons aafl tryout "theres no guarantee the league will take off " wright thompson writes on espn com "theres no guarantee todd will make the team or if he does that it will lead to anything else thats ok hes not thinking about trying to get another shot in the nfl hes thinking about that first game and the pain of the first hit and the sweat stinging his eyes hes thinking about righting an old wrong about the importance of having a dream and maybe someday hell understand that his story has everything to do with those nine firefighters and that now is the perfect time to tell it when he does this thing he loves he honors brave men named mike and melven named billy brad and brandon brave men like himself named mark michael and earl he honors his friend louis who left behind a wife named lauren " tip of the fix cap to reader philip schwaeber found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com
