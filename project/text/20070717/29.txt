detroit shrinks to survive asset sales could help fund uaw health care trust the big three u s auto makers are hanging for sale signs on more prime assets as they hunt for cash to finance a deal with the united auto workers to ease the burden of retiree health care liabilities general motors corp and ford motor co have moved in recent months to pare assets and build up cash as they seek answers for their loss plagued north american auto operations potentially adding to the moves people familiar with the matter said over the weekend that ford is considering selling its volvo car unit a profitable business expected to receive considerable interest from other car companies and financial buyers such as private equity firms gm meanwhile agreed to sell its allison transmission unit for &# billion after nearly years of ownership it has also raised more than &# billion in recent months in credit markets all of which was won by pledging assets essential to running its automotive business a key part of gms plan according to people familiar with the matter is to amass a cash hoard big enough to offload tens of billions of dollars of current health care liabilities for blue collar retirees to a new union run fund outside the company known as a veba for voluntary employees beneficiary association industry observers say fords move also fits that goal "a volvo sale certainly can help because you definitely are going to be funding a significant obligation and its all going to come down to how you finance the veba " said jones day attorney andy kramer one of the principle architects of recent veba agreements between goodyear tire &amp rubber co and dana corp and their unions "the bottom line is youre going to need some significant amount of cash" going into negotiations he said a ford spokesman declined to comment on speculation related to the companys plans for its volvo unit in negotiations with the uaw set to begin friday detroits auto makers hope to establish a union managed veba trust the auto makers would no longer be obligated to pay those liabilities freeing up money needed to restructure in north america in the case of ford such a deal would lift its roughly &# billion in liabilities related to retiree obligations to its blue collar workers from its balance sheet ford dished out &# billion for blue collar health care in about doubling what it was spending when it bought volvo at the beginning of the decade the prospect of reaching such a deal has boosted share prices for gm and ford and encouraged greater interest in chrysler group in which private equity firm cerberus capital management has agreed to purchase a majority stake but the three would have to make substantial up front investment such as a mix of cash equity and debt to help the fund meet retiree obligations the funding arrangement will be crucial in getting cooperation from the uaw which has acknowledged that further retiree health care changes may be needed to keep the big three out of bankruptcy ford has relied increasingly on volvo to develop vehicles in its global lineup but the dearborn mich companys need for synergies is overshadowed by its need for cash chief executive alan mulally has been fund raising since he took fords helm in october he presented fords plans to bankers in december to try to bolster fords available liquidity and he exceeded the companys expectations by raising &# billion via secured loans and other funding in four days still fords available liquidity could sink below &# billion by the end of because of enormous restructuring expenses related to bailing out north american operations under a plan that will cost &# billion through mr mulally faces immense pressure to return the company to profitability by standard &amp poors equity analyst efriam levy said yesterday that fords liquidity should be adequate to fund the companys restructuring but if there was a deal with the uaw related to health care obligations "ford would have to come up with cash " he said the company would likely have to issue more debt as well if a health care deal was sealed if it sells volvo ford would have to use at least a chunk of the proceeds to pay down debt that volvo had been pledged to secure in december such a move would free up fords balance sheet so it could take on more debt to fund a veba ford last month hired advisers to help shop its jaguar and land rover brands in a move expected to reap as much as &# billion according to citigroup volvo is estimated to be valued at as much as &# billion to &# billion while people at ford familiar with the sale say volvo isnt actively being shopped the company is willing to consider attractive offers selling the trio soon to eager bidders could help achieve several initiatives considered mr mulallys top priorities the former boeing co executive has enjoyed a brief honeymoon since his hiring but he is under pressure from the ford family whose fortune is tied up in ford stock to deliver results ford is expected to post deep second quarter losses next week which will add fuel to fords sense of urgency walking into labor talks wall street is intensifying pressure on mr mulally as analysts and traders are increasingly betting on a health care deal momentum for fords stock is trading at the higher end of a two year range and momentum is being supported by optimism related to fords attempt to win labor cost cuts and forge a veba deal during negotiations gm spent the last two years shedding a portfolio of noncore assets in order to bolster a liquidity position largely composed of high cost loans many of which are secured by assets from the automotive business gm last year sold a controlling stake in its finance arm to buyout group cerberus for &# billion
