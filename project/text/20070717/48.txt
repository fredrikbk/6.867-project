fund firms lower bar for younger investors wall street unveils slew of products with something slant my whatever plan cuts minimums but limits choices mutual fund firms have a new message for young investors stop whining and give us your money in an attempt to attract the next generation of customers wall street is rolling out a host of new offerings designed to squelch the excuses that keep many and somethings from investing outside of their k plans cant afford the hefty four and five figure minimums required by many mutual funds theyll slash the minimum investment below the cost of an ipod not sure which funds to buy and in what amounts theyre launching all in one products that take much of that work off your hands dont know how to save for a car a house and that far off mirage called retirement theyll deluge you with online tools and easy to enroll individual retirement accounts charles schwab corp this year cut the minimum investment on its schwab funds to &# from a typical range of &# to &# and created a streamlined ira with low investment minimums aimed at younger people late last year american century investments rolled out an investment program for younger clients that includes &# minimums on certain funds while fidelity investments launched an online tool that helps new investors develop a simple financial plan based on their answers to five questions meanwhile fund companies like vanguard group and t rowe price group inc have recently launched new all in one "target date" retirement funds designed for people retiring in and beyond such funds automatically shift to a more conservative mix of stocks and bonds as their target date approaches but the new products can have pitfalls target date funds offer convenience but can also be expensive and too conservative for many younger investors some of the firms trying to lure beginner investors tack on extra fees to accounts with lower balances and clients may need to give up certain services like paper statements in order to qualify for low minimum investment programs the new offerings represent a significant shift for financial services firms which in recent years have focused largely on the massive and profitable pool of baby boomer clients but as boomers age the firms need to attract new customers and they say they can help address the myriad financial challenges confronting younger investors such as paying off credit card debt and student loans and saving for a house their kids college education and retirement all at the same time "in many ways its a lost generation from a financial services standpoint " says jonathan craig a vice president at schwab investor services who is leading the companys new younger investor initiative he says that many younger people need help because they cant count on social security and defined benefit pension plans and they face rising mortgage and education costs oliver benn a year old attorney in san francisco joined a law firm last year but had to wait a number of months to become eligible for his employers k plan so last year he started saving for the long term by contributing after tax dollars to a roth ira account in which withdrawals in retirement are generally tax free and where he holds more aggressive investments like small company stocks hes also saving for shorter term goals such as paying off student loans in a taxable account where he holds a more conservative portfolio consisting mainly of u s and foreign stock mutual funds while mr benn aims to save about of his salary hes waging "a constant battle" to balance saving and investing with paying off debts he says the best way for younger investors to get started say advisers is to contribute enough to their employer k plan to get the full company matching contribution which represents a guaranteed return on your investment after that its often a good idea to stash some savings in a taxable account where money may be more accessible for a near term goal such as buying a car or paying for a wedding young investors also need to put aside an "emergency fund" of at least six months worth of living expenses which may be invested in a money market fund the most important thing though is simply to start early an investor who starts saving at age and contributes &# a month to a tax deferred account will have about &# at assuming an annual return according to t rowe price but an investor who starts saving at and contributes &# a month for years and then stops saving will have more than &# by choosing the right vehicle some of the new offerings try to steer young people into tax deferred accounts such as iras schwabs new minute ira for example is specifically designed to appeal to time strapped young investors offering a simple application that helps clients open an account and select investments in a single step fidelity meanwhile offers a simplestart ira that helps young investors start saving with as little as &# a month but many advisers say young investors should spread savings among a variety of vehicles partly for the sake of what edward jones chief market strategist alan skrainka calls "tax diversification " tax rates and rules governing various vehicles can easily change by the time todays somethings tap into their savings the tax free withdrawal from roth iras current individual income tax rates and the maximum tax rate on most long term capital gains and dividends for example are all factors in choosing investment vehicles but they may not last forever "investments have tax advantages only because congress says so and congress only lasts months " says ric edelman a financial planner in fairfax va while stashing savings in an ira has some advantages including a broad investment selection and lower minimums at many fund firms it isnt always the best non k vehicle for young investors advisers say investors should save for a home purchase for example in a taxable account because "youre robbing yourself of that tax deferred growth" if you pull money out of a k or ira for a down payment says sophie beckmann personal finance strategist at a g edwards inc selecting investments some new youth focused offerings steer investors toward all in one funds in american centurys new my whatever plan investors who agree to invest &# a month can get lower &# fund minimums but only on the companys livestrong target date or one choice "target risk" funds target risk funds like target date funds are designed to be one stop diversified portfolios but they maintain a set level of risk over time the application for schwabs minute ira meanwhile highlights the companys target date retirement funds target date or target risk funds are appropriate for young investors because "even with a &# investment they can get a fully diversified portfolio " says donna byers senior vice president for direct sales and service at american century but investors should examine the funds mix of stocks and bonds closely while many advisers believe young people saving for retirement should invest in stocks many target date funds designed for this age group are much less aggressive though the mix of stocks and bonds varies substantially from fund to fund the american century livestrong fund for example has a target stock allocation of compared with about for the t rowe price retirement fund for young investors saving for near term goals like a home purchase such funds may be far too aggressive says mr edelman the financial planner young investors saving in a taxable account for a purchase one to three years down the road should stash savings in more sedate investments like certificates of deposit advisers say those with a three to five year time horizon might consider balanced funds which often have a relatively conservative mix of roughly stocks and bonds some target date and target risk funds add an extra layer of fees on top of the expenses of the underlying funds and target date offerings designed for younger people are often more expensive than those for older investors because they have a higher allocation to higher priced stock funds avoiding high minimums despite the recent move by some companies to lower their minimums the fraction of fund share classes requiring a minimum investment of &# or less has steadily declined over the past decade according to morningstar inc making it tough to assemble a diversified smaller portfolio young investors may be tempted by funds that levy an upfront sales charge which often have lower minimums or exchange traded funds which trade on an exchange like stocks and dont require a substantial investment roughly three quarters of the mutual fund share classes requiring a minimum investment of &# or less charge a load but load funds and etfs are often a bad idea for young people who are making small regular investments because sales charges or commissions take a bite out of each investment says christine benz director of mutual fund analysis at morningstar a better way around high minimums an automatic investment plan many fund companies require low minimums for investors who commit to making regular monthly investments but maintaining a low balance with a fund firm sometimes means more fees and less service though american centurys my whatever plan encourages young people to start saving with just &# the firm charges a &# fee every six months to investors with balances under &# investors in the plan also give up paper statements
