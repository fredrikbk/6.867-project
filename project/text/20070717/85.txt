reply all the good the bad and the web online edition the explosion of blogs social networks and video sharing sites has allowed any internet user to become a journalist or filmmaker or music star but is this democratization of information often called web the future of the internet or a looming disaster the wall street journals jamin brophy warren invited the authors of two recent high profile books on the subject to debate andrew keen who wrote "the cult of the amateur " argues the web has become overwhelmed with useless noise david weinberger author of "everything is miscellaneous " argues that web tools let users filter out irrelevant or inaccurate information a condensed version of their discussion carried out over email is below you can read the full text here mr keen begins so what exactly is web it is the radical democratization of media which is enabling anyone to publish anything on the internet mainstream medias traditional audience has become web s empowered author web transforms all of us from year old grandmothers to eight year old third graders into digital writers music artists movie makers and journalists web is youtube the blogosphere wikipedia myspace or facebook web is you time magazines person of the year for is web a dream or a nightmare is it a remix of disneys "cinderella" or of kafkas "metamorphosis" have we as empowered conversationalists in the global citizen media community woken up with the golden slipper of our ugly sister aka mainstream media on our dainty little foot or have we as authors formerly know as the audience woken up as giant cockroaches doomed to eternally stare at our hideous selves in the mirror of web silicon valley of course interprets web as disney rather than kafka after all as the sales and marketing architects of this great democratization argue what could be wrong with a radically flattened media isnt it dreamy that we can all now publish ourselves that we each possess digital versions of johannes gutenbergs printing press that we are now able to easily create distribute and sell our content on the internet yes the people have finally spoken and spoken and spoken now they wont shut up the problem is that you have forgotten how to listen how to read how to watch weve lost truth and interest in the objectivity of mainstream media because of our self infatuation with the subjectivity of our own messages its what in "cult of the amateur " i call digital narcissism a flattened media is a personalized chaotic media without that essential epistemological anchor of truth the impartiality of the authoritative accountable expert is replaced by murkiness of the anonymous amateur when everyone claims to be an author there can be no art no reliable information no audience everything becomes miscellaneous and miscellany is a euphemism for anarchy its easy to see just go online and look at youtube the blogosphere wikipedia myspace or facebook mr weinberger responds your wildly unflattering picture of life on the web could also be painted of life before the web people chatter endlessly they believe the most appalling things they express prejudices that would peel the paint off a park bench so andrew you join a long list of those who predict the decline of civilization and pin the blame on the latest popular medium except this time its not comic books tv or shock jock radio its the web this time of course you might be right especially since you and i seem to agree that the web isnt yet another medium something important and different is going on we also agree that the web is a problem the problem endemic to the web even before anyone gave the web version numbers and the problem that leads to your issue with "cockroaches" is that because anyone can contribute and because there are no centralized gatekeepers theres too much stuff and too many voices most of which any one person has no interest in but the web is also the continuing struggle to deal with that problem from the most basic tools of the early internet starting with usenet discussion threads through wikipedia and sites that enable users to tag online resources the web invents ways to pull together ideas and information finding the connections and relationships that keep the "miscellaneous" from staying that way but why should we trust the way "monkeys" as you refer to web users in your book connect the pieces we shouldnt trust them blindly open up the britannica at random and youre far more likely to find reliable knowledge than if you were to open up the web at random thats why we dont open up the web at random instead we rely upon a wide range of trust mechanisms appropriate to their domain to guide us amazon gives you ways of checking to see if a particular reviewer is trustworthy but the mechanisms are not particularly rigorous because not all that much is at stake when considering the st review of a harry potter book compare that to the previous generation of media the traditional media are not cinderella to the webs cockroach and not just because the traditional media have their own cockroaches the web is far better understood as providing more of everything more slander more honor more porn more love more ideas more distractions more lies more truth more experts more professionals the web is abundance while the old media are premised in their model of knowledge as well as in their economics on scarcity so andrew a question for you you bemoan the loss of "the essential epistemological anchor of truth" and the "impartiality of the authoritative accountable expert " its easy to agree with that when it comes to facts the sort of stuff we consult almanacs for but when it comes to the more important and harder issues where we want to understand our world science politics the arts are you quite as comfortable with the notion that there are identifiable epistemological anchors or is your epistemology in fact rooted in the scarcity that has silently shaped the traditional media mr keen i agree that the web is us its a mirror rather than a medium when we go online we are watching ourselves so the question is do we want to be looking at ourselves as our best cinderella or our worst the giant cockroach my point is that what appears to the web crowd to be a disney production is actually a kafka remix you are right that people have always chattered endlessly about the silliest things but the self publishing internet is the greatest of great seduction web tells us that we all have something interesting to say and that we should broadcast it to the world as i argue in my book web transforms us into monkeys thats the new abundancy the long tail if you like infinite primates with infinite messages on infinite channels yes the web does represent an abundancy of everything "more porn more love more ideas more distractions " this is fascinating to a philosopher of knowledge like yourself but for mere mortals who rely on their media to "understand the world" new digital abundance will lead to intellectual poverty the more we know the less we will know you see to use this chaotic media efficaciously we need to invent our own taxonomies which isnt realistic for the majority of ordinary people seeking to understand the world who think a "taxonomy" is something that drives us to the airport meanwhile traditional scarcity is getting scarcer weve always had a scarcity of seriousness of talent of the artist intellectual able to monetize their expertise traditional media has done a good job in discovering polishing and distributing that talent but once everything is flattened when books are digitalized when libraries become adjuncts of google when writers are transformed into sales and marketing reps of their own brands then what which brings me to back to your question about epistemological anchors my concern is that this scarcity the scarcity of the intellectual authority able to help people understand the world is indeed endangered particularly if the physical book goes the way of the physical cd and the physical newspaper so let me end with a question to your question are you convinced that web is of benefit to traditional intellectuals like yourself mr weinberger you and i agree that genuine talent is scarce and needs nurturing but your picture of talent is formed by the binary view the traditional media have forced on us because its been so expensive to produce market and distribute cultural products books records films the lucky few who get published get access to a mass audience and the rest trail off the map so traditional distribution makes it look like talent is a you got it or you dont proposition youre an artist or youre a monkey that doesnt reflect the scarcity of talent so much as the scarcity of distribution a result of the high cost of delivering the first copy of a mass produced item in fact we have every reason to believe that talent is distributed in a far smoother but still steep curve my friend joe is an amazing guitarist but hes not the best guitarist around neither is my sister in law maria the best singer in the world but shes good and you would spend an enjoyable and sometimes moving night listening to her in the local chorus talent is not either or recording contracts are with the web we can still listen to the worlds greatest but we can find others who touch us even though their technique isnt perfect note the "we can find " we couldnt if finding required creating our own taxonomies as you say instead we rely on taxonomies created by experts newspapers that categorize their stories stores that categorize their offerings computer assisted ways of locating whats relevant search engines and recommendations made by people we trust were getting better at all of these you say "the intellectual authority able to help people understand the world is indeed endangered " then you ask if im convinced that the web benefits intellectuals yes i am and thats because while some talent is indeed solitary many types of talent prosper in connection with others that is especially true for the development of ideas knowledge is generally not a game for one it is and always has been a collaborative process now a question for academics scientists and serious intellectuals do you think the web is nothing but a disaster in fact since businesses learned long ago that knowledge is social do you seriously maintain that the work of business im not here thinking of ecommerce can only be degraded by being done on the web mr keen i agree wholeheartedly with your comments about the online academic community any medium which brings experts and professional authorities together is healthy i am thrilled that youve discovered such a rich intellectual community online if this is web then i love web the problem however with web is that most of the conversation seems to be taking place anonymously conducted in a manner of speaking by people who are more interested in vulgar insult than respectful intellectual intercourse the comments sections of most major website are littered with this trash as is the blogosphere so yes the internet is great for experts to discover one another and conduct responsible conversation its the monkey chorus on the democratized web that bother me the issue of talent is the heart of the matter how do we traditionally constitute nurture sell talent and how is web altering this my biggest concern with web is the critique of mainstream media that implicitly or otherwise drives its agenda its the idea that mainstream media is a racket run by gatekeepers protecting the interests of a small privileged group of people thus by flattening media by doing away with the gatekeepers web is righting cultural injustice and offering people like your friends joe and maria an opportunity to monetize their talent but the problem is that gatekeepers the agents editors recording engineers these are the very engineers of talent these professional intermediaries are the arbiters of good taste and critical judgment it we flatten media and allow it be determined exclusively by the market then your friends joe and marie have even less chance of being rewarded for their talent not only will they be expected to produce high quality music but in the web long tail economy theyll be responsible for the distribution of their content no if joe and marie want to be professional musicians paid for their work they need a label to make an either or call about their talent thats the binary logic that informs any market decision from music to any other consumer product either they can produce music which has commercial value or they cant if they cant they should keep their day jobs i respect your attempt to escape from the either or realities of market economics but im afraid this is the binary logic of life the culture business is ugly it rewards talent and punishes those who dont have it the democratization of talent is a contradiction in terms even part time cockroaches like me know that mr weinberger yes lets talk about talent the people who make my life on the web so positive intellectually include a brilliant but crazy college drop out a practicing medical doctor who is interested in information theory on the side a struggling working mom who has a keen eye for bulls a theologian at a tiny seminary id never heard of and a guy i know nothing about but who on a mailing list for five years has explained in detail the implications of fcc rulings most of these people would not could not or did not make it through the traditional credentialing and publishing systems in the areas theyre writing about the mainstream medias business model does not aim at nurturing talent it aims at moving units it therefore does exactly what you complain the web does it panders to the market if you want to see the "democratization" of talent you fear just look at a top chart the question therefore is not whether the traditional medias taste is better or worse than the webs the web doesnt have taste good or bad the web is not an institution a business or even a market any more than the real world is its us we have lots of different tastes but thats not the whole story when i say the web is us i dont mean that its an aggregation of individuals a herd of screeching monkeys or a scurry of voiceless cockroaches running from the light were connected primarily through talk in which we show one another what we find interesting in the world thats essential to the web the web is only a web because were building links that say "heres something worth your time and heres why " its a little act of selflessness in which a person who has our attention directs it elsewhere thats why your polemical use of the term "monkey" is not only intentionally obnoxious but essentially false and misleading there is therefore hope here that in the midst of the ever present low culture we will together educate our tastes seeing more of the world than the traditional media could ever show us and learn to appreciate it we will also have more terrible "artworks " so what we should ignore them just as we skip over most channels on tv except were far more sophisticated in how we travel the web than we are when using the sequential clicking of a tv remote on the web well continue to invent ways to find what matters to us of course we will because "mattering" is the real driver of the web mr keen so i did what you suggested i took a look at the new york times best seller book list the top six non fiction hardback books for the week of june were  "the assault on reason" by al gore  "the reagan diaries" by ronald reagan  "einstein" by walter isaacson  "god is not great" by christopher hitchens  "presidential courage" by michael bechloss  "a long way gone" by ishmael beah none of these books seem to be "engineered" hits and even if these hits are "engineered" by big media so what indeed i applaud the engineering of books about critically important subjects in politics history and theology i want my kids reading the awful truth about life in africa i want them to get mugged by hitchens on the question of gods non existence i want them to attempt to digest a page biography about einstein then i went to technorati to look at the six most popular blogs for the same week this to borrow your language is what "matters" in the world of web  engadget  boing boing a directory of wonderful things  techcrunch  gizmodo  the huffington post  lifehacker the productivity and software guide david you say we have "lots of different tastes" but it seems like the hits on blogosphere are much less intellectually diverse than the hits on the new york times book list engadget and gizmodo are blogs about new technology gear ipods blackberries iphones etc techcrunch and lifehacker are geeky technological blogs for technology geeks the huffington post is i admit a valuable read although it seems to me to becoming more like a traditionally authoritative newspaper than an unedited blog meanwhile boing boing is a surreal and supremely inane compendium of miscellaneous knowledge listing stories about kidney donor hoaxes a pedagogical tract on "how to kiss" and a game theory piece entitled "an economic analysis of leaving the toilet seat down " i respect your faith in the miscellany of knowledge but i worry that its you in fact who have sipped the kool aid i want my kids reading reagan and gore rather than how to articles about kissing i fear that the overall consequence of the democratized blogosphere is akin to leaving the toilet seat down but this isnt a game and it isnt theory sites like boing boing are flushing away valuable culture rather than a directory of wonderful things web is a miasma of trivia and irrelevance it doesnt matter mr weinberger concludes actually id suggested you take a look at the top songs of course youre within your rights to cite the new york times bestsellers list instead but thats indicative of the problem with your method are you seriously maintaining that pop culture offline is represented by six good books on the new york times hardcover non fiction list we could argue over the value of the six top blogs versus their analogues in the traditional media i could point out that those blogs are not the work of amateurs but are profitable businesses run by experts but all that would miss the real point the web is not mass culture so we cant just look at the most popular sites to see whats going on most of the action is in the long tail of users sites with just a handful of links going to them so pointing to the "short head" of highly popular sites not only tells us little it views the web through a distorting lens as if sites were read only publications rather than part of a web of conversations andrew the mud you throw obscures the issues you raise porn sites silly posts monkeys cockroaches toilet seats this rhetoric isnt helpful in fact in your attempt to be controversial youre playing into the hands of political and economic forces that would like the internet to be nothing more than an extension of the mass media its a shame because we need to be taking seriously the issues you raise but to talk about them we need to get past the notion that the web is all dreck all the time and that it is nothing but a great "seducer" of taste we are amateurs on the web although theres plenty of room for professionals as well but we are not replicating the mainstream media were building something new were doing it together its fundamental elements are not bricks of content but the mortar of links and links are connections of meaning and involvement were creating an infrastructure of meaning miscellaneous but dripping with potential for finding and understanding what matters to us were building this for one another were doing it by and large for free for the love of it and for the joy of creating with others that makes us amateurs and thats also what makes the web our cultures hope what do you think has the net become
