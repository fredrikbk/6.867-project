a rude awakening washington modernism in the first half of the th century was in some respects experienced most acutely by societies that were not yet modern paris new york chicago vienna and berlin were primed to expect relentless innovation in technology and the arts by the final decades of the th century but elsewhere especially in small towns and rural areas the fast track to tomorrow meant a jarring pace of change "foto modernity in central europe " an exhibition now at the national gallery in washington through sept looks at the role of photography in modernizing a diverse and largely underdeveloped part of the continent where the future had slumbered for centuries it awoke with a start when world war i blew apart the old order out of four shattered empires germany austria hungary russia ottoman emerged more than a dozen independent countries including poland hungary czechoslovakia yugoslavia turkey and the soviet union where nationalist ardor mixed in various combustible degrees with radical politics and the modernist creed to "make it new " matthew witkovsky assistant curator of photographs has gathered some prints and arranged them according to themes "new women new men " "modern living " "the spread of surrealism" rather than by country or period this is an ambitious attempt to broaden the story of european modernist photography often told with the same international cast of avant garde pioneers alexandr rodchenko man ray laszlo moholy nagy as they sent influential signals back and forth from moscow the constructivists to paris the surrealists to berlin the dadaists to weimar and dessau the bauhaus the catalog with essays that pull together new research hard to find in english language publications and biographies of many obscure figures contains the sprawl of events and places better than does the show confined to five small rooms it ends as it is finally picking up steam the thematic approach also fails to distinguish peripatetic emigres such as andre kertesz who left hungary in for paris from artists such as stanislaw witkiewicz who stayed in poland most of his life its never clear from the work on the walls which elements in modernist photography were supposedly native to central europe and which were imported the swelling enthusiasm for the camera still and movie in these countries and elsewhere after world war i was related to its symbolism as well as its multiple uses it was the picture machine for the machine age scientific and democratic handheld models didnt require training in state academies so anyone could be an artist camera clubs sprang up everywhere while advancing the cause of progress photography could also document the rapid transformation of daily life and express widespread anxieties about what mr witkovsky calls "the problem of the modern " the form that best embodied the spirit of experimentation and social engagement for many people was photo collage half tone reproductions were filling magazines and newspapers in the s and turning photographs into a cheap common visual currency for the world even when realistic in intent they could have their meanings shredded when torn from a page and combined with other deracinated images the practice originated with th century amateurs artists sympathetic to dada and surrealism had raised its profile as an avant garde gesture but nowhere else it seems was photo collage so popular for so long as in central europe mr witkovsky effectively chronicles how disgust with the great war was reflected in ripped up images of ripped up bodies many figures here are familiar the scorching cynicism of john heartfield born helmut herzfeld and hannah hoch from germany toward political and business leaders of the day set the bar high for those who followed the show also highlights the lesser known paul citroen a berlin artist of dutch ancestry who passed through the bauhaus his renowned photo collage "metropolis" from took cut out images of urban architecture everything from the eiffel tower to the u s capitol to the monadnock building in chicago and crushed them into a delirious version of a modern city that many would be curious to visit and no one would want to live in moholy nagy prominently featured citroens work in his book "painting photography film " distributed by the bauhaus in and a landmark in the spread of modernist doctrine the camera offered a key to what he called the "new vision " a program of seeing that called for photographing the world from extreme angles or in fragments and printing negatives in reversed tones scattered with type or combined with painting and other photographs in short by any means that would disrupt convention moholy nagy is represented here by his vertiginous view looking down from a radio tower in berlin his wife lucio moholy also gets due credit for her monumental portraits of bauhaus personages in the section on "new women new men " but both artists have received lots of attention from historians before the major figures identified by mr witkovsky as vital to modernism in central europe do not differ significantly from those in previous surveys of the period notably in "the new vision photography between the world wars " organized by maria morris hambourg and christopher phillips at the metropolitan museum of art in "foto" excels at uncovering figures and movements neglected until now in american scholarship the research in the catalog on the various groups of czech and polish avant garde groups is worth the price &# of the book i cant tell from the images reproduced here if wladyslaw strzeminski jindrich styrsky latislav sutnar frantisek vobecky eugen wiskovsky and vaclav zykmund all names new to me are artists of consequence on anything but a local or national scale hungary incubated a stunning number of modernist photographers many of them jews moholy nagy kertesz brassai martin munkacsi robert capa who early on left for paris and new york it is good to know more about the backgrounds of the central europeans who didnt emigrate whats more the show has the sense to examine modernism as a movement that cut across political philosophies communists liberal democrats fascists and the nonaligned all adopted the vocabulary of the "new vision" to promote their agendas the cover of a german magazine from has the headline "ski heil " in drop out type over a cropped photograph of a smiling fraulein on the slopes an example of healthy modern independent womanhood found on magazines in many countries then and now the last room in the exhibition is entitled "land without a name " it argues that landscape and ethnographic photography helped various nationalist groups in the s and s to romanticize "homelands" and distinguish the folk from the interlopers a lush and highly doctored view of an alpine mountainside by wilhelm angerer an austrian fascist was part of his grandiose series "song of the blessed " as pernicious as ethnic typecasting has been in this part of europe however its unlikely the land grab that ignited world war ii was advanced by photography of this sort any more than left wing agit prop by heartfield and hoch did anything to prevent it the last photograph in the show and catalog is "souvenir" by the czech photographer jindrich marco taken in as part of his series "springtime in poland " it shows two armed and amused soldiers standing in front of a painted bucolic backdrop in the midst of a bombed out street they are posing there for a photographer probably a fellow soldier who adjusts his camera on the tripod as an old woman looks on the picture seems to accent why documentary photography took hold again at this time and photo collage faded away there was no longer a need to tear photographs into pieces to convey the absurdity of modern life not when reality alas had done the job so much better mr woodward is a new york arts critic
