enterprise green clothing maker indigenous designs puts fashion first do good message is subtle as firm attracts retailers indigenous designs corp prides itself as a truly green supplier its womens clothing is made from all natural sustainable materials such as organic cotton silk and alpaca it adheres to strict fair trade manufacturing practices overseas runs its u s corporate office on solar power and encourages employees to bike to work but all that feel good stuff isnt what the santa rosa calif company pushed when it met with executives from the dillards inc department store chain at a trade show earlier this year instead the apparel maker talked up fashion design and price mentioning the organic and fair trade chit only as an extra bonus "its all about the product but p s there is this story behind it " says scott leonard indigenous designs chief executive and co founder this marketing strategy having a do good message but not beating people over the head with it has helped indigenous designs to survive and segue into mainstream retail while many of its green peers have languished in ecofriendly niches or gone out of business altogether these tactics and endurance highlight a sometimes overlooked truth in the fast growing much ballyhooed green market as much as consumers say they crave ecofriendly products if those products dont look good dont fit right arent durable or arent priced competitively then customers probably arent going to buy them in droves "companies that lead with green and ecofriendliness are in very dangerous territory because they are often not competitive on fashion or function and ask the consumer to make a compromise " says george rosenbaum chairman of leo j shapiro &amp associates a chicago consumer research firm "retailers want green but they wont let green stay in the store for long if its not as good " thats particularly true in fashion mr rosenbaum says where appearance is everything so to keep style at the forefront indigenous designs employs five people on its design team and creates all clothing ideas in house advertising and marketing signage feature models and apparel prominently with the organic fair trade logo plugged more subtly fair trade allows for workers to receive a fair living wages founded in indigenous designs does business with more than retailers nationwide including dillards whole foods market inc and eileen fisher inc revenue will jump to more than &# million this year from &# million last year according to mr leonard mark killingsworth one of dillards general merchandise managers saw indigenous designs wares at a trade show in january and decided to carry the line based primarily on the design fabrics and price which is precisely the order of criteria he thinks women use when shopping for clothes "its a neat handle that something has the green thing attached to it but i dont think weve embraced it as a strategy " he says "its still gotta be the right product at the right price " the organic hook he adds simply suggests that buying the garment is "also the right thing to do " indigenous designs wares will start hitting dillards shelves in september initially rolling out to of the companys stores putting the mission message second hasnt always been easy beyond the fields and farms of peru guatemala ecuador and india where the clothing maker produces its wares the company has steeped itself in green practices back home about of employees own and drive hybrid or biodiesel cars mr leonard also created a program called green steps to highlight other companies using green business tactics net proceeds from the program will go toward purchasing wind credits which offset of the energy of the trade show the purchase is designed to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels clean the air and help keep greenhouse gasses out of the atmosphere funds also go toward purchasing recycled materials for shows aisle carpets and booths at times straddling the two worlds has been a balancing act at an early trade show a sizable retailer called the nature company ordered some units of clothes from indigenous designs in large part because it was impressed by the companys social responsibility efforts but buyers from large boutiques in chicago and new york also descended on the booth mr leonard says when he started to explain his companys mission they cut him off saying "yeah yeah yeah whatever ill take of that of that " mr leonard says he often errs on the side of being shy about his green props and thats something most retailers appreciate "you cannot sell clothing through guilt " says courtney fuchs owner of its only natural a kansas city mo boutique that sells indigenous design clothes among others "you dont want people to come in and feel beat up with facts and figures " ms fuchs says she also has had a keep it to herself attitude about her own green qualifications "i didnt bring it up unless the customer asked " now that the green movement is booming even among mainstream consumers companies like indigenous designs are faced with a new challenge how to stay visible amid an onslaught of new competitors barking their ecofriendly credentials among the rivals are companies that sell only a few products with ecofriendly attributes to enhance their green image with consumers a practice dubbed "greenwashing" among ecopurists to promote its own green stripes enough to stand out without abandoning its product first marketing strategy indigenous designs is crafting new subtle clothing hang tags that will quantify exactly what percentage of the price a consumer is paying goes to the artisan in peru how much goes to certifying cotton is organic etc its also creating ecoshop clothing displays for certain stores where "green" consumers are most likely to shop like whole foods while putting less obvious signage in more mainstream stores like dillards mr leonard believes the shifting tide of popular opinion toward green products has given his company new longevity the number of individual stores where indigenous designs clothing sells has jumped in the past months "if customers love a product and then they find out it is fair trade and organic " he says "they will be a customer for life "
