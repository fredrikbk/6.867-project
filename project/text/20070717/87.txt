politics &amp economics japanese radioactive spill stirs nuclear safety fears a small radioactive spill at a nuclear power complex in northwest japan yesterday underscored the safety and perception issues the technology faces as it gains wider acceptance amid worries about energy costs and global warming industry officials citing the strength of the quake that caused the spill said the minimal safety related problems showed that plants can successfully withstand powerful earthquakes and other natural disasters tokyo electric power co owner of the seven nuclear power plants at the site near the city of kashiwazaki said the magnitude tremor caused some building damage and shook one of the plants hard enough to spill an estimated gallons of radioactive water from a pool used to store spent nuclear fuel assemblies hiro hasegawa head of corporate communications for the japanese utility said after finding about a half gallon of radioactive water near the pool plant engineers calculated that the "shaking of the pool" had caused the water to spill into a sump that emptied into the sea of japan he and other plant officials said no safety regulations were violated and the exposure from the radioactive water spillage was less than some people receive from mineral water at health spas the spillage occurred at plant no which is the most advanced design of commercial nuclear power reactor being sold by general electric co several reactors are under order around the world including two in the u s ge referred calls to tokyo electric the spill as well as a small fire at the site generated photos and headlines and occurred in a nation which has had trouble in the past with nuclear facilities in an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction at a uranium reprocessing plant in tokaimura miles northeast of tokyo killed two employees and spewed radioactive neutrons over the surrounding countryside the tokaimura incident was widely considered the worst nuclear accident since the chernobyl disaster in the ukraine in yesterdays spill "is a reminder that nuclear power is not safe " said norman dean executive director of friends of the earth an environmental group "nuclear reactors are vulnerable to natural disasters and unintentional human errors as well as intentional sabotage such as a terrorist attack " industry experts were awaiting more details from the incident the reports suggest the plants safety systems withstood a severe quake "youve had a major earthquake and as far as we can see the plants have withstood that certainly from the point of view of their safety systems " said adrian haymer who monitors new power plant construction at the nuclear energy institute "the overall response of the plants was as expected " nuclear power has become appealing in many nations as prices for traditional fuels for electricity like coal and natural gas have jumped in price unlike coal fired plants nuclear power plants also dont emit global warming gases like carbon dioxide mr hasegawa said plant engineers believe all seven plants at the site which includes two of the newest ge reactors survived with all their safety related systems intact despite the fact that the shock of the quake exceeded japans design standards three units including no were shut down when the quake hit yesterday morning four others automatically shut down nuclear power plants are designed with thick walls springs shock pads and other mechanisms to protect their pipes and reactors during quakes said mujik kazimi a professor of nuclear engineering at massachusetts institute of technology spent nuclear fuel pools he said are normally open at the top mr haymer said the ge plant is certified for operation east of the rockies in the u s but japan imposed stronger earthquake design standards because it is more prone to quakes he said the ge design is part of a "third generation" of reactors that are being ordered by utilities in the u s japan europe and taiwan as part of the renewed commercial interest in nuclear power
