happy birthday ita there was an american industry that during the generation from to around ran rising trade surpluses with the rest of the world in this industry we imported a rising amount from the rest of the world but we exported even more to the rest of the world a very different generation dawned around exports continued to grow but imports began to explode by the late s this industry had fallen back to about trade balance and thereafter it began to run ever rising trade deficits by the year this trade deficit had reached around &# billion today it is in the neighborhood of &# billion this is the history of which u s industry for many the surging trade deficit will evoke concern about dumping un level playing fields and the like automobiles steel textiles no no and no it was computers and office products a core information technology industry "really " many will ask "i thought it was something america was good at " we are but thanks to the forces and opportunities of globalization exactly what we are good at in it has evolved up until around america was good relative to the rest of the world at making computers and related machinery even the earliest personal computers were produced largely in the united states indeed silicon valley itself had some manufacturing sites then it firms thanks to competition at home and opening markets around the world began to establish and expand global production networks stages of production that had once been bundled now migrated abroad e g hard disk drives to singapore all linked together via international trade and investment in the united states it firms shifted focus to higher value added activities core r&amp d design diagnostic manufacturing marketing and management today these high end u s activities support assembly that is scattered around the world with the massive imports described above now the way final products reach the american market just read the back of my sleek ipod "designed by apple in california assembled in china " a critical force in solidifying and expanding the globalization of it production was the information technology agreement signed in the ita eliminated in four stages from to all tariffs in dozens of signatory countries in hundreds of it capital goods intermediate inputs and final products indeed to this day it remains the only industry to have implemented a comprehensive free trade agreement in the world trade organization not autos or steel or textiles it what impact did all this have on the u s the best way to answer is in terms of productivity which is the single most important metric to gauge the standard of living for any country from to output per worker hour in the nonfarm business sector grew at just per year then in productivity growth began to accelerate from through it doubled to an average annual rate of the importance of this productivity acceleration is difficult to overstate at the previous generations growth rate average living standards required years to double at the current growth rate average living standards need just years to double this carries profound implications for the well being of all americans here then is the critical answer for the first several years after americas productivity acceleration was driven by one industry computers and office products the one industry engaged in implementing a global free trade agreement between half to two thirds of the economy wide productivity acceleration was driven by it hardware through two channels a productivity acceleration in americas it firms themselves and a boom in it capital investment by firms throughout the economy in response to the accelerated price declines in it the globalization of it hardware trade deficits and all has helped boost average u s living standards thus the information technology agreement offers a textbook example of the benefits trade liberalization can deliver a competitive spur to price declines and productivity gains in firms benefiting not just those firms but also companies and consumers economy wide through lower prices and new varieties this month marks years since the ita entered into force as such a happy birthday is appropriate but not a grand celebration thats because despite ongoing discussion since the world trade organization has failed to implement an ita ii to cover the hundreds of new it products invented in the past decade at the same time since u s productivity growth has decelerated every year in part because of decelerating it productivity growth more generally these are dark days for trade on june trade promotion authority for the president expired congress is busy with several anti china trade bills and the doha development round of the wto is on the brink of collapse instead of a grand celebration here are four cautionary wishes for an ita ii for renewal of tpa for congressional forbearance and grandest of all for a breakthrough to save doha mr slaughter is a professor at
