thousands of travelers still attempt to board aircraft with scissors awls hammers and saws they even try to carry on box cutters the weapons apparently used by some of the attackers to commandeer and crash four planes this summer as airport security lines back up amid one of the most congested vacation travel seasons ever prohibited items are one reason last year according to transportation security administration figures airport agents collected "clubs bats and bludgeons" million "knives and blades" and other objects classified as "deadly dangerous " the most lethal items are dispensed with promptly guns an average of two a week are collected nationally are surrendered to local police departments which investigate their bearers hazardous chemicals are disposed of by saic inc a san diego company under government contract but the tsa a division of the u s department of homeland security relies on state agencies like mr ekins to offload tons of other items that passengers

that the items sold on ebay since have raised &# for state coffers as of june in georgia where the government once merely stockpiled surrendered items the legislature last year passed a bill to allow direct surplus property sales to the public part of the reason says mr ekin was to give passengers the chance remote as it might be to recover their goods the store square feet of polished concrete fenced off in a corner of an aluminum warehouse boasts a large collection of potentially dangerous tools and trinkets since the store opened a trickle of passengers have come looking for their stuff "if they can prove its theirs well give it to them " says will smith the warehouse manager a good description of the item suffices as proof he says so far only two people have found their forfeited

scissors over inches is too long to carry on a plane bottle openers pocketknives and multipurpose hand tools the store also sees hammers dumbbells circular saws hockey sticks and nail guns too it once sold a chain saw "im pretty amazed by what people try to get on airplanes " says bob bauer an atlanta schoolteacher who recently purchased a leatherman hand tool while browsing the warehouse for school equipment "but they have some really good deals here " the store receives hundreds of pounds of prohibited items each month and heaps them into wooden bargain bins corkscrews are priced at less than a dollar pocketknives sell for under &# power tools usually go for less than &# the store keeps no official inventory of what it receives or sells it doesnt even tally the revenue from tsa items separately from other state property sold "were not here to make a profit " says mr ekin a former coast guard corpsman "we just have to cover the cost of getting the stuff here " delving further into the boxes from the recent delivery he removed a rattling bundle sheathed in black muslin inside a set of six dull but pointy swords used perhaps in a magic show "this we wont even sell " he said at the harrisburg pa state warehouse the oddity of some objects led administrators to establish a "wall of fame" for interesting stuff they wont sell the wall features deer antlers a foot long fish hook nunchucks a medieval flail and a hand grenade with the explosive drilled out passengers often relinquish weaponry and restraints they had wrongly thought were mere toys "weve got lots of furry handcuffs " says kenneth hess director of pennsylvanias bureau of supplies and surplus operations "riding crops studded collars " sam walls a computer specialist from collingswood n j phoned mr hess last year after surrendering a swiss army keychain knife that his son then a marine fighting in iraq had given him when he was years old mr hess whose office in reunited an elderly california woman with a pair of engraved knitting shears told him it was a long shot but that his staff would look out for the knife identifiable because of a missing emblem on one side "i know they get thousands of those things but it was nice to know it was possible " says mr walls most surrendered items dont have that kind of sentimental value in atlanta where travelers pass through the checkpoints on a busy summer day tsa agents see everything from cane swords to brass knuckles "people are still doing the gun thing " says jamie covil a transport security officer in atlanta who remembers several passengers who claimed to have forgotten that they were packing heat one afternoon at the beginning of the bustling july holiday week passenger lines in atlanta snaked toward spillover queues cordoned before security gates in one hour agents collected two chisels three corkscrews two golf clubs one pool cue four pocketknives and one six pointed throwing star one atlantan threw up his hands when an inspector opened his backpack finding two orange screwdrivers inside "i forgot i had them " said the man who had been using the tools to fix a vacuum cleaner "i was just stupid " the tsa inspector told the man he could exit the line and keep the screwdrivers he didnt have time the man said and hurried down an escalator to his flight the agent handed the screwdrivers to a supervisor who placed them in a shoebox size container the first of the series of boxes that will hold the tools until they get heaped into mr ekins bargain bins
