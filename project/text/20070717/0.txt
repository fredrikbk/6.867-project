for the sake of one man in the six or seven years in which they interacted on a regular basis vladimir putins police state and journalist fatima tlisova had a mostly one way relationship ms tlisovas food was poisoned causing a nearly fatal case of kidney failure her ribs were broken by assailants unknown her teenage son was detained by drunken policemen for the crime of not being an ethnic russian and agents of the federal security services fsb forced her into a car took her to a forest outside the city of nalchik and extinguished cigarettes on every finger of her right hand "so that you can write better " as one of her tormentors informed her last year the year old journalist decided shed had enough along with her colleague yuri bagrov she applied for and was granted asylum in the united states ms tlisova and mr bagrov are as the wedding refrain has it something old something new characters from an era that supposedly vanished with the collapse of the soviet union years ago now that era or something that looks increasingly like it seems to be upon us again what can we do the most important task is to get some facts straight fact no the bush administration is not provoking a new cold war with russia that it is seems to be the view of beltway pundits such as anatol lieven whose indignation at alleged u s hostility to russia is inversely correlated with his concerns about mounting russian hostility to the u s its allies and the likes of ms tlisova in an article in the march issue of the american conservative the leftish mr lieven made the case against the administration for its "bitterly anti russian statements " the plan to bring ukraine into nato and other supposed encroachments on russias self declared sphere of influence in this reading mr putins increasingly strident anti western rhetoric is merely a response to a deliberate and needless u s policy of provocation yet talk to actual russians and youll find that one of their chief gripes with this administration has been its over the top overtures to mr putin president bushs "insight" into the russians soul on their first meeting in condoleezza rices reported advice to "forgive russia" for its anti american shenanigans in the administrations decision to permit russian membership in the world trade organization in the lobster summit earlier this month at the bush family compound in kennebunkport which mr putin graciously followed up by announcing the "suspension" of russias obligations under the conventional forces in europe treaty this isnt a study in appeasement quite but it stands in striking contrast to the british governments decision yesterday to expel four russian diplomats over mr putins refusal to extradite andrei lugovoi the former fsb man suspected of murdering alexander litvinenko in london last november with a massive dose of polonium "the heinous crime of murder does require justice " british foreign secretary david miliband said yesterday "this response is proportional and it is clear at whom it is aimed " would that dick cheney walked that talk now turn to fact no russia is acting with increasingly unrestrained rhetorical diplomatic economic and political hostility to whoever stands in the way of mr putins ambitions the enemies list begins with mr putins domestic critics and the vocations they represent imprisoned yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsky murdered journalist anna politkovskaya harassed opposition leader garry kasparov it continues with foreign companies which have had to forfeit multibillion dollar investments when kremlin favored companies decided they wanted a piece of the action it goes on to small neighboring democracies such as estonia victim of a recent russian cyberwar when it decided to remove a monument to its soviet subjugators from downtown tallinn it culminates with direct rhetorical assaults on the u s as when mr putin suggested in a recent speech that the threat posed by the u s "as during the time of the third reich " include "the same claims of exceptionality and diktat in the world " none of these kremlin assaults can seriously be laid at the white houses feet unless one believes the lurid anti western conspiracy theories spun out by senior russian officials and that brings us to fact no russia has become in the precise sense of the word a fascist state it does not matter here as the kremlins apologists are so fond of pointing out that mr putin is wildly popular in russia popularity is what competent despots get when they destroy independent media stoke nationalistic fervor with military buildups and the cunning exploitation of the church and ride a wave of petrodollars to pay off the civil service and balance their budgets nor does it matter that mr putin hasnt re nationalized the "means of production" outright corporatism was at the heart of hitlers economic policy too what matters rather is nicely captured in a remark by russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin regarding britains decision to expel the four diplomats "i dont understand the position of the british government " mr kamynin said "it is prepared to sacrifice our relations in trade and education for the sake of one man " thats a telling remark both in its substance and in the apparent insouciance with which it was made the whole architecture of liberal democracy is designed primarily "for the sake of one man " not only does mr kamynin seem unaware of it he seems to think we are unaware of it perhaps the indulgence which the west has extended to mr putins regime over the past seven years gives him a reason to think so last night ms tlisova was in washington d c to accept an award from the national press club on behalf of anna politkovskaya "she knew she was condemned she knew she would be killed she just didnt know when so she tried to achieve as much as she could in the time she had " ms tlisova said in her prepared statement "maybe anna politkovskaya was indeed very damaging to the russia that president putin has created but for us the people of the caucasus she was a symbol of hope and faith in another russia a country with a conscience honor and compassion for all its citizens " how do we deal with the old new russia by getting the facts straight that was politkovskayas calling as it is ms tlisovas as it should be ours see related letter "letters to the editor ingrained despotism of russias rulers" wsj july
