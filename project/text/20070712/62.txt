in mr rogers neighborhood hard work made you feel special on behalf of fred rogers production company family communications and the board and staff who worked closely with him for decades were flattered by the idea that fred might be responsible for the attitude of a whole generation "blame it on mr rogers why young adults feel so entitled " moving on july however theres simply no basis for blaming mr rogers for college students narcissism as producers of the longest running program on pbs weve heard from millions who thanked us for encouraging them to be the best they can be when mr rogers opened the door and welcomed his neighbors treating everyone with respect his viewers felt safe and valued the very foundation that helps children develop self discipline and self control fred modeled being responsible he always hung up his sweater he always put away the craft supplies when he finished a project when cellist yo yo ma came on the program he was asked to talk about all the practice it takes to be able to play an instrument well world famous pianist andre watts talked about how much he learns from his mistakes problems in the neighborhood of make believe were solved over a whole week and with much effort fred once said "one of the best feelings in the world is being proud of what youve learned after youve worked hard at it " instant gratification and entitlement are the antithesis of "mister rogers neighborhood " in fact a more accurate interpretation of fred rogers signature message "you are special" is in his quote "whether were a preschooler or a young teen a graduating college senior or a retired person we human beings all want to know that were acceptable that our being alive somehow makes a difference in the lives of others " bill isler president family communications inc pittsburgh repeat after me class "mister rogers neighborhood" was geared to preschoolers "youre special" is an appropriate message for them those of us who actually watched the show with our kids can phrase it this way "its you i like not the clothes you wear " mr rogers is a safe target of course since hes dead how is prof chance still among us actively countering the student behavior he deplores or is he just another living example of the old saying those who can do those who cant talk marilyn janus hagerstown md as an "entitled young adult " i dont disagree with the fact that many college students fight for better grades at the end of semesters but the fact of the matter is they have tens of thousands of dollars riding on it reporter jeffrey zaslows generation was lucky enough to have affordable college affordable health insurance and a good housing market the only thing my generation is entitled to is lifelong indebtedness to our alma mater a weak dollar no future social security and a never ending war that our peers fight and your peers started next time you want to rip my generation for feeling special maybe you should think about how "special" your peers must feel to not worry about future generations joel davis pittsburgh the message of mr rogers was most emphatically not about entitlement as prof chance asserts it was about the uniqueness of each child each human being fred rogers dealt with the rich complexities of human emotions and child development if one looks at his music beyond "youre special just by being yourself " there is a depth of wisdom that addresses the difficulties of being a child or adult learning to navigate the realities of life he suggested constructive ways to deal with anger "what do you do with the mad that you feel " he suggested creative ways to deal with impatience "lets think of something to do while were waiting " he stressed a healthy sense of self esteem and the importance of the person over material possessions and the song that became my mantra as a year old medical student "youve got to do it every little bit and when you do you know who did it just you " that song especially is about hard work being the key to success i would advise prof chance to listen to the words of mr rogers to see what being special is really about julie c keller m d cleveland your article raises important questions about the unintended consequences of excessive "ego boosting" in parenting but while its cute and attention getting to tie this to mr rogers its unfair and grossly inaccurate his supportive language was never intended to condone bad behavior just the opposite mr rogers believed that mastering self discipline was the central goal of the preschool years he spoke often to kids about "that good feeling of self control " fred rogers was my first boss in television and believe me nobody ever worked harder to make certain the right message came across i often saw him parse and revise every word of a script to anticipate childrens questions and prevent misunderstandings the views of one professor and an anonymous online message thread hardly constitute a significant "re evaluation" of mr rogers or his philosophy as millions have discovered "the world according to mister rogers" is a place where you are special but so is everyone else so lets please treat each other accordingly who can argue with that arthur greenwald studio city calif bravo mr zaslow your view of this generation of entitled youngsters is so unfortunately accurate mr rogers well intentioned messages of "specialness" probably only enhanced self esteem gone wild due to indulgent parenting most children come into the world already believing that theyre the center of the universe todays kids would benefit from parenting that doesnt foster that thought but rather tempers it helping them to become realistic respectful young people who expect a lot from themselves instead of others deidre taneman westlake
