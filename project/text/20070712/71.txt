mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q my wife has requested that we get her first "pda" and asked me for my advice on which product to buy i am unfamiliar with the comparative features and function of blackberry and treo what would you suggest a well first of all both of these products are primarily communication devices they make phone calls and fetch email in addition to performing the functions of a personal digital assistant so if she really just needs a pda id avoid both of them and get a cheaper palm pda that isnt a phone or email device the &# z would do the trick and unlike a phone it requires no monthly fee however if she wants a phone and email device that is also a very good pda the treo beats the blackberry hands down the latter is first and foremost an email device and now has a decent phone but its calendar address book and other pda functions are weak the treo which evolved from the palm pdas is much better at these tasks in my opinion especially for personal as opposed to corporate use q your columns helped me select a new laptop today that should be able to run vista ultimate however although two of your columns report that microsoft office should run on vista two salesmen at dell said it wouldnt whos correct a i am and its sad and troubling that dell personnel would give out such patently wrong information one might even suspect they were trying to sell you the newer version of office when you dont need it i have personally tested office on a vista computer and it runs fine but just to make sure i forwarded your question to a senior person at microsoft and he replied that the dell people you spoke to are "misinformed at the least " he confirmed that vista supports both office xp and office as long as they have been kept up to date with the latest service packs as well as the new office one possible explanation is that the dell folks you spoke to misunderstood your question dell and other companies have ceased selling office or will soon stop doing so therefore its possible that they were under the impression that you were seeking to buy it rather than merely to install and run a copy you already owned but office is compatible with vista q i own an apple macbook pro laptop that came with megabytes of memory i am going to upgrade to either one gigabyte or two gigabytes i am not a gamer do i really need two gigabytes for running applications or will one gigabyte suffice the biggest application i use is final cut studio a in general one gigabyte is all a macbook pro needs for doing common tasks such as email and web browsing word processing music playback and simple photo and video editing with built in programs like iphoto and imovie however final cut studio is a massive video production program meant for professionals and it demands lots of memory in fact apples web site for the latest version of the product suggests between two gigabytes and four gigabytes depending on the content you expect to edit and produce so i would go with two gigabytes or even more if your model of the macbook pro can handle it in fact if you are more of an amateur id consider the lighter duty final cut express which apple says does fine with one gigabyte and can handle high definition content with two gigabytes
