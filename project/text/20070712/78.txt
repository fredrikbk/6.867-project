offerings from its pending acquisition of borsa italiana spa adding to its leadership in initial public offerings among european markets but to nudge family owned italian companies to go public at a faster rate it will have to overcome deep skepticism among the countrys investors who sick of underperformance and scandal have been net sellers of stock this year another issue unlike their united kingdom counterparts small and midsize family owned companies in italy traditionally have preferred getting their financing from local banks however costly to relinquishing control to shareholders indeed borsa italiana has already failed three times to establish a popular trading venue for small and midsize businesses for such companies the cost of listing and the lack of analyst research are barriers to going public says simone cimino chairman and chief executive of cape natixis a private equity fund that specializes in small cap firms and has floated three companies in milan this year

cox consultant for bourse consult an exchange advisory business in london says these factors will be key to realizing the benefits of the deal for borsa for which the lse last month agreed to pay gbp billion in its first cross border acquisition "the really big question is whether the lse can operate within the italian financial system and improve the brand image of the italian market " he added the lse led by chief executive clara furse has yet to say how it would organize a unified listings venue for small companies but if the borsas history is an indicator attracting italian companies to the exchange could be a struggle italy has a smaller stock market than switzerland or spain despite having the euro zones third largest economy even after a decade of being the worst performer among
