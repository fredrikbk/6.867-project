a russian ring highlights wagners timelessness new york the german word "reise" means voyage or travel and before world war i germanys mustachioed emperor william ii was rhymingly called "der reise kaiser" because of the almost neurotic amount of train and ship travel he clocked each year but kaiser bill had nothing on the russian conductor valery gergiev who appears to spend almost as much time in airplanes as he does on the podium based in st petersburg and celebrated for his artistic directorship of the historic maryinsky theatre there he is the man who transformed its resident kirov opera company from an exotic provincial troupe to one of equal visibility with the great international companies of vienna berlin milan and new york since mr gergiev has also held the position of principal guest conductor of the metropolitan opera a professional situation that together with his concurrent tenure as principal conductor of the rotterdam philharmonic must do wonders for his frequent flier accounts at the same time mr gergiev introduced a stream of russian singers to the west a situation that has not just made russian singers regular members of the opera circuit but at least to these ears has also contributed to a westernization of the traditional russian singing style mellowing and smoothing the once characteristic metallic edge of russian sopranos and tenors to make them more appealing to western vocal tastes perhaps it is no coincidence therefore that mr gergievs sister pianist and voice coach larissa gergieva has since been the artistic director of the maryinsky academy appointed by her brother to oversee the nurturing of young talent there an undisputed master of the classic russian repertoire from glinka to alfred schnittke mr gergiev has also forged a reputation as a persuasive wagnerite in he conducted "parsifal" at the met formerly the almost exclusive domain there of conductor james levine two years later mr gergiev electrified met audiences with his conducting of "die walkure " bringing several of his maryinsky singers to the cast on friday mr gergiev reveals to new york audiences his take on wagners "der ring des nibelungen" at the metropolitan opera house part of the lincoln center festival the two complete cycles being performed through july are not the mets long familiar productions but mr gergievs so called "russian ring " a term from which he distances himself in our conversation he first produced wagners tetralogy with the kirov in and has since taken it on tour several times including mountings at baden baden germany cardiff wales and cosa mesa calif in a number of the singers including oleg balashov gennady bezzubenkov mikhail kit evgeny nikitin mikhail petrenko nikolai putilin olga savova and olga sergeeva are familiar to new york opera goers from their prior appearances at the metropolitan opera speaking with me by telephone from his maryinsky office he acknowledges that this is russias first complete ring cycle certainly its first sung in german in almost a century that is to say since before the russian revolution "st petersburg was very clearly one of the most important wagnerian cities at the end of th century and beginning of th century " he says "then of course there were two world wars and both times russia and germany were on the different sides of the game " neither the world wars nor the cold war helped the wagnerian cause in the soviet union "basically in the s and s the only two wagner operas you could hear at the maryinsky and in all russia were lohengrin and occasionally fliegende hollander " he says "there were some other wagner performances but they were very very rare " until the last years when mr gergievs maryinsky productions of "lohengrin " "tristan " "parsifal " "hollander" and the "ring" reawakened what mr gergiev calls "interest and respect for wagner operas in russia " and made new wagner productions "a regular factor of our life now " russias leading music conservatories were not even teaching voice students the distinctive germanic style of singing wagner " he observes "and whatever was taught was taught in russian " today especially after several critics at previous european tours of the maryinsky "ring" criticized the often unidiomatic singing of the russian casts mr gergiev brought in what he calls "really prominent german coaches to ensure that subsequent performances would be solidly grounded in authentic wagnerian style " primary among these experts has been the veteran bayreuth festival coach richard trimborn turning to mr gergievs own "ring " visually mammoth according to production photographs and divorced in its unique way from both the th century german naturalistic tradition and the spartan postwar conceptual tradition established by the composers grandson stage director wieland wagner at bayreuth i ask if this production has a political or social underpinning "the word i would put first is timelessness " he says "the forces at work are jealousy power struggle hatred love then come the forces of nature a world of water a world of fire the sky world and underground world these are all timeless forces that always exist in our fantasies " since its opening the production has been nicknamed "the russian ring" by european and american writers not just because it comes from there but because mr gergiev took his fundamental visual impulse from motifs found in the "nartski epos " or nart sagas the great body of stories and creation myths that arose among the ancient tribes of the caucasus mountains bordering southeastern europe and asia circassians abkhazians and ossetians all have versions of the nart sagas many of which share motifs with greek and norse mythology "i am myself ossetian " says mr gergiev inspired by these nart myths mr gergiev invited the kazakhstan born american theater designer george tsypin to read them and create the mis en scene for the production based on his impressions dominating the sets are large totemic sculptural figures sometimes floating above the stage sometimes positioned around it they seem to watch implacably the impotent machinations of the god king wotan and his troublesome brood scheming and battling their way to their final destruction discussing the striking mixture of costumes and stage images that define this production mr gergiev says "do not expect a very slick or pragmatic ring we can only imagine the appearance of a mythical world of years ago and with the power of the orchestra and singers this is what george tsypin and i believe this ring should somehow bring out in a strange eclectic way that has been our goal " mr scherer writes on classical music for the journal see related article " and his enduring mystery" wsj
