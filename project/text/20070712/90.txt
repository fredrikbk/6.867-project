politics &amp economics rio bets on pan am games crime high costs loom over goal of spurring growth rio de janeiro as athletes from countries prepare for tomorrows opening of the pan american games this scenic seaside resort hopes to showcase a new face as a world class center for sporting events but government organizers who have invested an estimated &# billion to &# billion in new facilities for the games are hoping the event doesnt also spotlight some of rios chronic problems such as rampant crime and an overburdened airport in addition cost overruns for the games are making private economists uneasy and they point more broadly to the risks cities face in trying to use sporting events to foster development rio mayor cesar maia notes that while the games may mark a new chapter for the city rio is hardly a novice in hosting big events millions of people come to rios carnaval and new years eve celebrations and those events customarily come off without a hitch he says if rio shows it can handle the pan am games he says the city will have a stronger hand in its bid to attract the olympics in lately though heavily armed drug gangs have been operating so boldly that tracer bullets sometimes light up the night sky pan am organizers say they have taken precautions to locate most competitions at a safe distance from the violent hillside slums or favelas around of the sporting events will unfold around barra da tijuca a district of condos and shopping malls that resembles a mini miami the area has only a handful of entrances which will be heavily policed ironically in its presentation to the pan am site selection committee in rio used security as an argument in its favor to best runner up san antonio texas "we insinuated that terrorism was an even more serious problem " than urban crime says mr maia who thinks the line of reasoning bore weight with the selection committee urban violence unfolds on a vast scale in rio this year is shaping up as even more violent than when rio police shot and killed people about twice as many police killings as occurred in the entire u s according to a study by rios candido mendes university to make matters worse rios civil police who do detective work went on strike for higher pay this week and threatened work disruptions during the games sergio cabral governor of the state of rio de janeiro called it "very ugly blackmail " meanwhile labor unrest and inadequate airport equipment have caused disruptive flight delays for months the government appeared to narrowly avert a walkout by airport workers on the eve of the games and air traffic controllers have been locked in an angry battle for better working conditions since last year the municipal and federal governments have made a big economic bet on the games whose costs have ballooned to three times original projections by some counts mr maia says investments were high because facilities especially the centerpiece seat joao havelange stadium were built to more exacting olympic standards a federal auditor has criticized some contracting procedures as "a babel of agreements bids and last minute contracts " the city council is promising an investigation specialists say trying to bootstrap the economy by hosting sports events is fraught with risks "its a strange strategy " says andrew zimbalist a sports economist at smith college in northampton mass he says cost overruns as well as economic uncertainties about the future use and upkeep of sports facilities can quickly erode the one off gains in tourism from big events mr zimbalist points out that athens greece took advantage of its role as host of the summer olympics to build up its communications systems but did so at a "fantastic cost " exceeding what it would have paid without sponsoring the games another cautionary tale is montreal which imposed a tobacco tax to pay off the debt incurred for hosting the summer games pan am games organizers prefer pointing to happier examples such as barcelona spain which spent heavily on the summer olympics but succeeded in revitalizing its infrastructure and promoting itself as a tourist destination some estimates indicated that rios costs were already several times higher than those of previous pan am hosts santo domingo dominican republic winnipeg manitoba and mar del plata argentina the pan american games have brought together athletes from throughout the americas and the caribbean every four years since mr maia says that along with bringing in an expected visitors for the pan am games rio has lined up major judo soccer and military olympic events for coming years rios move into managing sports events comes when the citys economy has been on a roll the city home to state controlled oil giant petroleo brasileiro sa has gotten a lift from higher oil prices rios unemployment rate is more than two percentage points below the national average that may in part reflect more vigorous pan am related construction fabio giambiagi an economist at the federal institute of applied economic research says the games also have brought intangible benefits by focusing the attention of policy makers and citizens on resolving rios ills "maybe well look back on this as a turning point for the city " he says
