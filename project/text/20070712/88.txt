politics &amp economics as deficit shrinks battle looms bush and democrats prepare to face off on budget washington with the governments financial picture brightening somewhat president bush is going on the offensive against democrats over taxes and spending the battle which is likely to last the rest of the year could help determine the direction of fiscal policy for the remainder of his presidency yesterday mr bush seized on the latest white house budget estimates which predict the deficit will drop to &# billion from last years &# billion to press his point that republican tax cuts and spending policies are working he charged that democrats proposals to raise taxes and expand health care and other domestic programs pose a long term threat to the countrys economic health "weve shown what works " mr bush said at a white house event surrounded by families who say they have benefited from his tax cuts the democrats recently enacted budget for would result in "the largest tax increase in american history" over the next five years he added the new midyear white house estimate suggests that the chronic deficits that have plagued mr bush almost from the outset of his presidency are continuing to shrink from a peak of &# billion in the administrations previous forecast for this fiscal year which ends sept was a &# billion shortfall the actual deficit could be even smaller the nonpartisan congressional budget office is predicting a deficit of &# billion rob portman director of the office of management and budget said the deficit reduction was being driven largely by surging corporate profits which have generated higher than expected corporate tax receipts for the treasury he said the deficit could end up below the &# billion projection and closer to the cbo figure for the omb is now predicting a &# billion deficit up from its february estimate of &# billion mr portman attributed that change to increased spending including higher costs for entitlement programs such as medicaid and medicare and an emergency supplemental spending bill that was passed this year by congress and signed by mr bush that includes an additional &# billion of spending for while a &# billion deficit for might still sound enormous it is equivalent to only about of u s gross domestic product a level many economists believe is sustainable mr bush came to office when the u s was enjoying large annual surpluses but his big tax cuts a brief recession and war costs quickly combined to produce annual deficits democrats sought to downplay the latest good news focusing on the continued high cost of the iraq war the tax breaks mr bush has given to the wealthy and the resulting run up in federal debt "its hard to take a lecture on fiscal discipline from a president who has added &# trillion to the national debt " democratic rep john spratt of south carolina chairman of the house budget committee said this week "most of the increase the lions share comes from increased spending for national defense and homeland defense and weve funded it and gone along with it "for mr bush to come back and blame us for that high level of expenditure particularly for the war is not fair to say the least " mr spratt said liberal critics said much of the rhetorical battle concerns a relatively modest increase of about &# billion in domestic programs that democrats want from the current &# billion mr bush wants to cut total domestic spending including on labor and education programs the white house views as ineffective by about &# billion how the face off plays out could affect policy mr bush has threatened to veto a number of domestic spending measures on which democrats reject his proposed cuts and favor modest increases he is depicting democrats plans to greatly expand a health care program for low income children as an excessive middle class giveaway already some senators are scaling back their proposals for the program the state childrens health insurance program apparently in hopes of avoiding or attracting enough support to override a presidential veto by challenging congress on spending mr bush apparently hopes to energize conservatives who have been disillusioned by the huge increases in government spending he has overseen outlays have risen about since the focus on the budget could also shift voters attention from the continued onslaught of negative news about iraq mr bush yesterday signaled that he means to use the budget update as the staging ground for a broader assault on democrats fiscal policy budget experts on both sides expect the president to remind voters that democrats are likely to roll back many of his tax cuts if they gain in the election and that they have failed so far to address long term concerns about the solvency of social security and medicare yet mr bush too was unable to make progress on those two programs in the four years his party held solid congressional majorities indeed he championed a drug benefit that added billions of dollars annually to the medicare programs cost democrats are mulling maneuvers in response yesterday senate budget committee chairman kent conrad of north dakota expressed reservations about confirming mr bushs latest nominee as budget director former rep jim nussle of iowa because of concerns that he might be too combative congress is debating various spending bills which must be signed by the president and traditionally should be enacted before sept in recent years passage of such bills has often spilled over to the next fiscal year there is talk among some rank and file democratic lawmakers that the partys leaders might combine many of the domestic spending bills with some or all of the defense bills in an omnibus spending measure this fall they would effectively dare mr bush to veto the entire package at a time when the country is at war it is unlikely that a showdown between congressional democrats and mr bush would lead to anything resembling the government shutdown of republicans who ran congress at the time paid a high political price for forcing passport offices and other services to shut down in their budget fight with president bill clinton this time the government would likely function on stopgap budget extensions if the sides failed to reach a compromise that could leave mr bush more time to drag out the fight "its ultimately anyones guess who wins" the war for public sympathy said brian riedl a budget analyst with the conservative heritage foundation but "if the president makes his case to the american people that spending is out of control and pork is out of control i think the american people will side with him "
