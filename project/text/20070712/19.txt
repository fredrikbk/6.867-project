burning problem inside messy reality of cutting co output a power giant waiting for congress to act takes some baby steps new haven w va the panoramic view from the roof of american electric power co s mountaineer power plant here sends a vivid message coal is king conveyor belts pull coal from a nearby mine coal barges bob on the shimmering ohio river and earth moving equipment buries coal ash in a landfill with big plants that burn coal its no wonder aep is the no industrial emitter of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in the u s in some years the company acknowledges the problem but says it faces a bind in solving it new technologies to reduce co emissions will cost billions and may take many years to develop whats more the company isnt sure it can recover its investment through higher electricity rates places like mountaineer are where reality collides with rhetoric about fighting global warming lacking any clear guidance from regulators aep is hedging its bets its working on some innovative technologies but has yet to tackle the kind of top to bottom overhaul that many say will be required to make a serious dent in greenhouse gases michael morris chairman and chief executive of the columbus ohio based utility warns that strict emission curbs wont be cheap "i think power prices could go up maybe more " he says he doesnt think aep can deliver significant carbon dioxide reductions much before aep is particularly interested in two technologies one that would turn coal into cleaner burning gas and another that would capture carbon dioxide so it can be buried deep below the earths surface an initial gasification power plant in west virginia will cost at least &# billion says the company enough to single handedly raise electricity rates in the state by if it goes online five years from now environmental groups agree that experimental technology shouldnt be rushed into service but say power companies and the government should be putting more effort into conservation and energy efficiency u s electricity demand is growing a year in most of the states where aep operates its under no obligation to hold down demand on the contrary it makes more money the more electricity people use each year the u s electricity industry collectively emits billion tons of co which plays a starring role in climate change thats about a third of the u s total like most other utilities aep wasnt spending much on carbon dioxide reduction until recently utilities were too busy dealing with federal restrictions on nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide and mercury aep which produces three quarters of its electricity from coal fired plants has earmarked &# billion between and to control these other pollutants congress has yet to mandate any reductions in co although its mulling global warming legislation some proposals seek to reduce emissions by to compared with levels by state regulators awaiting federal action have generally left it vague whether spending on co cuts could be recouped via rate increases rather than focus on the science mr morris the ceo says executives like him now focus on the "political science" of what congress intends to do in a recent study the electric power research institute in palo alto calif found that even if the u s power industry boosted nuclear power production by doubled wind and solar power and developed viable carbon capturing technology it would still take until or to get the industry back to the emissions level although some congressional proposals call for reducing emissions by half or more over the next few decades the institute concluded "much of the technology needed isnt available yet " the institute is independent but receives some funds from the power industry "you have to throw up your hands a little bit because theres so much that needs to be done " laments bruce braine vice president of strategic policy analysis at aep curbing emissions requires "completely remaking the electric industry " says jim dooley senior staff scientist at the department of energys pacific northwest national laboratory in richland wash at the acre mountaineer plant in west virginia work is just beginning on partial answers to the problem on a scorching afternoon general plant manager charlie powell almost as an afterthought pointed out a yellow building barely bigger than a garden shed ringed by a chain link fence "that " he said "is the well to hell " inside is an experimental foot well drilled three years ago down which it is hoped carbon dioxide can be pumped one day and stored for thousands of years beginning next year aep engineers intend to divert a small stream of waste emissions from mountaineer and run it through an experimental process to tease out the carbon dioxide once the gas is injected into the well porous rock and a capstone should hold it in place scrubbing carbon dioxide out of exhaust gases isnt easy if companies arent careful theyll end up burning a lot of extra coal just to run the cleanup process aep engineers say some of the existing methods would effectively wipe out a century of efficiency gains at power plants finding that unacceptable aep will test a novel process at mountaineer that it hopes will use less than half as much energy if all goes well aep will take what it learns in west virginia to a sister plant in oklahoma by and scale up the technology to handle more exhaust gas the carbon dioxide extracted can be used to loosen petroleum in oil wells and aep has arranged to sell carbon dioxide to an oil services company that operates in oklahoma by if aeps investment of up to &# million in the two pilot projects pans out the process could be used by still more of its plants in addition to the carbon capture project aep plans to build a new kind of power plant at mountaineer one that takes coal and converts it into a gas the process makes it easier to separate out carbon dioxide and other pollutants aep hopes to open the gasification power plant by and produce megawatts of electricity if it can get permission from utility regulators in west virginia and virginia it wants the regulators to let it recover the expense of the plant in its rates someday all the co output could be captured and stored although that isnt part of aeps initial plans separately several power companies including aep and the department of energy are working on a &# billion project called futuregen industrial alliance inc which seeks to develop a zero emission power plant during the next decade using coal aep has about rail cars and river barges that move coal representing an immense investment with only one nuclear power plant and no plans to build more executives say the companys fate is tied to coal aep had hoped to build a second gasification power plant in ohio another big coal state but has run into uncertainty the company wants assurance that it will be able to recover what it spends through electricity rates the states office of consumers counsel which represents rate payers says the state should let other companies compete for the job of building new power plants aep says it may drop ohio and try kentucky instead for an electric utility building a gasification power plant is no simple matter aep managers say the proposed west virginia plant resembles an oil refinery as much as a conventional power plant power plants are "a mechanical engineers playground " says dan duellman head of an aep team exploring advanced technologies "we know that when you burn coal it gets hot and makes steam as mechanical engineers we dont usually care about the chemical process " but chemistry lies at the heart of the process that converts solid lumps of coal into a gas that can be burned to understand that process and create gas with a predictable heat value aep reached out to chemical engineers in the petrochemical industry mike hammond a chemical engineer who worked at a delaware refinery now owned by valero energy corp was a prize recruit when he arrived at aep months ago mr hammond quickly saw a problem in the oil industry refineries run consistently at full blast and store the refined product in tanks at power plants however operations fluctuate in response to electricity demand gas storage isnt an option because the gas that comes from coal would be too voluminous thus the unit that turns coal into gas must be able to fine tune its output to produce just what the power plant needs "the first time this was explained to me i freaked out " says mr hammond equipment used for gasification "doesnt like to be jerked around that way turned up and down " his team thinks it has solved that problem but wont really know until it builds a plant messrs hammond and duellman also worry about what the plants neighbors will think in the early stages while theyre getting the gasifier up and running it wont furnish fuel to the generating plant instead gas will be "flared" or burned off that could result in a spectacular foot flame on top of a foot stack visible for miles around mr morris the ceo says hes confident the technology will work out "im worried about the cost though " he says evaluating the cost of action requires knowing the cost of inaction and thats hard to guess in the absence of federal legislation on curtailing carbon dioxide emissions currently the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is about parts per million up since according to the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change a business as usual approach by utilities would ensure steady escalation and accelerated warming scientists say restraining the growth of co concentration will be expensive according to the u n panel in a may report it said that stabilizing the concentration over the long term at parts per million would require shuttering dozens of older power plants to be replaced by expensive cleaner plants congress is expected to create a "cap and trade" market in which allowances permits to pollute would be bought and sold the number of allowances would decline over time the question is how low congress sets the target for total emissions the lower the target the fewer the permits causing the price of them rise that in turn could raise electricity bills for consumers if reductions are required quickly utilities will have to "slam on the brakes" to comply says richard richels an economist at the electric power research institute companies would have to shut down still viable plants prematurely and spend billions on new ones with expensive emissions reduction technologies or they would have to buy emissions allowances he says such a prospect makes power companies nervous but environmentalists say the industry should support strict federal limits on emissions based on the best global warming science "if aep becomes a serious supporter of limits it will make a palpable difference " says ralph cavanagh co director of the energy program at the natural resources defense council in san francisco yesterday aep endorsed climate change legislation introduced by sen jeff bingaman democrat of new mexico and republican sen arlen specter of pennsylvania it calls for a reduction to emission levels by environmentalists say the bill doesnt go far enough and would allow coal burners to buy their way out at nominal cost if compliance proved difficult researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology recently examined what would happen if congress mandated that emissions in be to below levels initially the polluting allowances might sell for &# to &# per ton of carbon dioxide equivalents which could lift wholesale power costs by two to four cents per kilowatt hour the study found that would lift consumer bills by some to in coal burning regions the study was conducted by mits joint program on the science and policy of global change the longer congress delays the more plants will get built with no plan for the carbon dioxide waste none of the states in which aep operates requires utilities to include an estimate of the cost of dealing with carbon dioxide when proposing new plants this gives an edge to conventional coal plants since the future costs of its carbon dioxide pollution neednt be tabulated regulators generally want utilities to build plants with the lowest projected cost to keep electricity bills in check slowly however states are beginning to recognize that dumping co into the air isnt likely to be free forever and is bad for the planet in florida utility commissioners in early june rejected a new coal plant proposal by florida power &amp light co citing the uncertain cost of greenhouse gas regulation among other factors mr morris says he wishes congress would act sooner rather than later "were in position to change " he says "but were not in this alone "
