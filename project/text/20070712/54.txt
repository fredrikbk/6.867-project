how many trustees do you need as rules and investments become more complex families divvy up trust duties among multiple advisers for a growing number of well off americans the question is not who do you trust but who manages your trust as trusts become more complex and investing strategies become more sophisticated more families are using teams of multiple trustees and advisers each with very specific roles and responsibilities changes in state trust laws in recent years have also accelerated the trend but the increasing fragmentation of trustees can also lead to higher overall trust management fees and legal questions about who is ultimately responsible if the trusts performance goes south these trends come amid a massive transfer of wealth between generations which is causing many families to look to trusts to transfer their assets in an orderly manner and help shield them from taxes and creditors at the same time more families are beginning to use complicated investments such as hedge funds and structured products in their trusts it used to be that naming a trustee was a relatively straightforward affair most families simply appointed either a family member a trust company or a trusted adviser to perform the duties of a trustee those duties include investing and monitoring trust funds making sure paperwork and tax forms are filed and making distributions to beneficiaries families sometimes appointed co trustees typically a family member and an institutional trustee who shared the same responsibilities increasingly however families are "slicing and dicing" trustee duties says dennis belcher a trust lawyer with mcguirewoods llp in richmond va families are specifying that one trustee typically an institutional trust company hold custody of the assets and handle the administrative trustee duties meanwhile another fiduciary often a family investment committee has the authority to direct investments trust creators are also naming separate trustees to handle distributions to beneficiaries to monitor the growing hordes of trustees some trust creators even designate "trust protectors " who generally have the power to fire and hire trustees a tactic that originated in the offshore trust world "its become very customized and tailored " says janine racanelli a wealth adviser at jp morgan private bank a unit of j p morgan chase &amp co which held a two day meeting of wealth advisers earlier this year from across the country that focused on the changing roles of trustees a few months ago paul swenson chief financial officer of a waste management company in chester va adopted a trust agreement to split trustee duties among two institutional trustees the trust previously had a single trustee to handle all duties under the new agreement one firm barrett capital management llc invests the trust assets and another ast capital trust co administers the trust "everyone knows their main goal and they can focus on it " says mr swenson increasingly trustees themselves are delegating to outside managers decisions on specific trust assets such as hedge funds private equity and commodities in industry parlance thats called "open architecture " northern trust corp based in chicago first began using outside money managers for its wealthiest trust clients those with at least &# million in trust assets in the late s says r hugh magill chief fiduciary officer now many of the companys trust accounts including some with as little as &# million invest a portion of their assets with outside managers a trust in its most basic form is an agreement to hand over your assets to someone else the trustee who minds the funds or property for your beneficiaries depending on how its structured a trust can be used for a wide variety of purposes including avoiding probate proceedings saving on estate taxes or providing for future generations in recent years trusts have been growing in popularity thanks to an aging population more aggressive marketing by financial firms and a growing number of wealthy individuals changes in trust laws in many states have made it easier for both existing trustees and trust creators to farm out responsibilities to multiple advisers until the s trustees generally werent allowed to delegate investment responsibilities to outside managers says robert sitkoff a trusts and estates professor at harvard law school however a recent wave of legislation in many states now gives trustees the power to delegate investments and other duties under the laws of most states trustees must still carefully choose guide and monitor outside advisers additionally a growing number of states including delaware and south dakota have enacted "directed trust" laws that explicitly allow trust documents to name separate trustees for administration and for trust investments under these laws administrative trustees and investment advisers arent generally held liable for each others actions says peter gordon a wilmington del trust lawyer such split duty trusts have grown more popular some of wilmington trust corp s business for example is in directed trusts up from in families often use a directed trust if the trust holds special assets such as a privately held family business or real estate that they dont feel comfortable handing to a trust company to manage in other cases they want to ensure that a particular asset isnt sold yet splitting up trustee duties among multiple institutions or individuals also has some downsides for one thing costs could multiply since you may have to pay each adviser separately by contrast banks or trust companies will often bundle total fees into a less expensive package if they handle all trust duties from administration to investments trust management and accounting fees can eat away some of trust assets annually with fees dropping dramatically the larger the trust account many trust companies offer different levels of services and fees depending on what level of fiduciary responsibility they undertake wachovia wealth management a unit of wachovia corp for example charges on &# million trust accounts for its fully managed trusts which includes the use of outside investment managers but only for directed trusts without investment responsibility appointing multiple trustees can also be a legal minefield if the trusts performance falters it can be tough to determine which trustee or adviser bears fiduciary responsibility lawyers say whats more having multiple trustees in different states could cause adverse state income tax consequences so make sure to check with a tax adviser about tax repercussions when setting up a trust with multiple trustees its crucial to outline beforehand what each trustee or advisers specific roles and responsibilities are and to have a clear investment policy in writing ahead of time if possible designate a process for resolving conflicts to avoid expensive and time consuming litigation drafting trusts with multiple trustees and split responsibilities can get expensive often ranging from &# to &# or more depending on the type and complexity of the trust state laws governing trusts vary dramatically so make sure that your legal team is familiar with the laws where the trust and trustees are located as well as where you and your beneficiaries live a matter of trusts heres how trusts are getting more complex more families are using trusts with teams of multiple trustees or advisers and some trustees are delegating specific trust assets to outside investment managers some trusts
