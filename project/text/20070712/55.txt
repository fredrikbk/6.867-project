how medicaid rates tripped up a small hospital in the complex world of hospital financing sometimes the difference between turning a profit or posting a loss can amount to how well one understands the medicaid rate structure that is a lesson north general hospital a small community hospital in harlem n y is learning as it revises its financial results for the fiscal year to show a &# million loss until last week the hospital was reporting to the media and on its web site that it produced a &# million surplus in fiscal which would have been the first profit in its history furthermore the hospital said last week that for fiscal it expects to record a loss of &# million north general was the subject of an article in the wall street journal in that chronicled how the bed hospital which caters mainly to the poor and elderly turned its finances around partly by moving away from low margin routine checkups and physical exams to treating higher margin ailments that affect inner city residents in high rates including cardiovascular problems hypertension obesity and infant mortality however the hospital now says the services it offered to patients brought in less revenue than it initially estimated inner city hospitals like north general get most of their revenue through a series of reimbursements from government programs such as medicare and medicaid and from insurance companies the amount of government reimbursements is derived from a complicated formula that takes into account a range of factors such as local labor costs and the volume of services the hospital provides the level of reimbursement can change retroactively which sometimes catches hospitals off guard that apparently is what happened at north general the hospital "simply overestimated revenue " says john maher north generals chief operating officer as a result of the change in its reimbursement level north general had to return &# million to medicaid and &# to medicare for the fiscal year in addition north general said it overestimated the amount it would collect from insurance companies and patients liz sweeney a health care analyst at credit ratings service standard &amp poors said such changes arent uncommon "it happens theres a lot of estimation that goes into accounting in general and in health care theres perhaps more estimation " she said "you can get outright fraud and sloppy accounting but you can also get people who with the very best intentions get caught in the complex web of reimbursements that is american health care " north general says it has made adjustments to its projections going forward the hospital is also discussing an arrangement with mount sinai medical center one of new yorks most prominent teaching hospitals located just a mile away from north general where mount sinai would manage north generals billing and finance operations the commission on health care facilities in the st century a panel created by former new york gov george pataki to review health care in new york state last year recommended north general strengthen its relationship with mount sinai to a "passive parent relationship "
