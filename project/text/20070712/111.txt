argued that withdrawing american troops from iraq "would be a disaster" even though the government there has made little progress toward a series of political military and economic goals the administration said in a report that the government of prime minister nouri al maliki has made some progress on those benchmarks but that the "security situation in iraq remains complex and extremely challenging " mr bush said the assessment was proof that his strategy is yielding results and that it is not the time to debate pulling troops out of iraq he said that withdrawing american forces before the surge had been given a full chance to work "would be a disaster" and may mean "surrendering the future of iraq to al qaeda " faced with sliding public support for the war and a growing republican revolt in congress mr bush showed no signs of altering his stance he said today that when american troops leave iraq it will be because "our military commanders say conditions on the ground are right not because pollsters say itll be good politics " the report a precursor to one due from gen david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker in september said that iraq has so far made satisfactory progress on eight of the benchmarks while progress on another eight was unsatisfactory and that signals on two others looked mixed white house spokesman tony snow said the report "should provide some space" for iraqs government to press on the report emphasized that many dangers remain in iraq and that the bloodshed there is likely to escalate it warned that "tough fighting" awaits u

says supplies as many as suicide bombers each month for al qaeda in iraq and that iran is helping fund extremist groups it also alluded to the growing divide between the white house and congress over the war and indicated that it has cast a long shadow over the rate of developments in iraq it said the reconciliation process was hampered by "increasing concern among iraqi political leaders that the united states may not have a long term commitment to iraq " retail sales rise modestly sales results released today by many of the countrys biggest retailers suggested consumers may be dialing back a
