icus new message welcome families in units with critical patients hospitals ask loved ones to help emory retools for sleepovers atlanta for decades hospitals tried to keep visitors out of intensive care units for more than a few minutes at a time this year emory university hospital here went the other way it began inviting family members to move into the ward and take a hand in the patients care for three recent weeks scott roberts lived almost full time in emorys new neuroscience intensive care unit which opened in february after a bone marrow transplant his wife kristi was struck by guillain barre syndrome a paralyzing nerve disorder that caused her immune system to attack the nerves outside her brain and spinal cord kristi years old was able to track her husband only with her eyes mr roberts watched doctors and nurses attend to her ventilator and feeding tubes relaying feedback to the staff by reading the look in his wifes eyes donning a sterile gown and mask to protect her immune system from infection he helped nurses stretch her immobilized limbs at bedtime he crossed kristis room to a partitioned off living area with a chair that folds out into a bed he says he was grateful he could stay with his wife until she was well enough to leave the unit "i cant even imagine being allowed only a couple of hours a day " mr roberts said emory is among the first u s hospitals to meld an intensive care unit with family living quarters creating a testing ground for an emerging health care strategy turning friends and families long relegated to the nail biting isolation of waiting rooms into active members of the health care team a wave of recent studies shows that critically ill patients may benefit from having families present theres even a case to be made researchers say for having loved ones present for resuscitation brain catheter insertions and other life and death procedures earlier this year the society of critical care medicine the largest international society representing intensive care professionals recommended that icus offer open visiting hours and increase family involvement "why would we presume that we can dictate how often or who is allowed to visit during the patients most trying moments on earth " says judy davidson a critical care nurse at san diegos scripps mercy hospital and lead author of the societys guidelines the recommendation comes as hospitals nationwide are set to spend some &# billion over the next decade to update aging facilities the result is that many like emory are considering committing the friends and family principle to brick and mortar "there has always been this wall between doctors and families " says owen samuels a neurologist who directs neuroscience critical care medicine at emory "it is high time we take down that wall " the transition has taken some getting used to emorys icu staffers say they have had to curb the irreverent jokes and banter they once used to let off steam nurses have had to cede control they say breaking from their instinct to protect families from hard truths now they are learning to spend time coaching families on how to care for loved ones and prevent infection the new icus bear little resemblance to the hotel style vip wings that some hospitals offer to wealthy patients overnight visitors in emorys intensive care unit for example have a sink in their rooms but have to walk down the hall to use the communal bathroom in october intermountain health care in salt lake city will open a hospital with large intensive care rooms where guests can nap on pull out sofa beds typically these hospitals bill for standard intensive care charges without adding extra fees for lodging for decades u s hospitals restricted visitors to general and intensive care units in part to protect patients from germs and the stress of multiple visitors but starting in the s and s in response to a growing consumer movement they loosened rules to allow fathers into delivery rooms and families into intensive care wards for newborns and children as a grass roots movement toward family centered care gained steam in the s hospitals began to involve loved ones in a broader range of treatments but the units that care for the sickest patients including the coronary and neurological icus remained behind closed doors visitors typically were allowed in for minutes every few hours admitting more than five million patients a year icus account for of the inpatient beds but almost of inpatient hospital costs or &# billion annually in the u s according to the society of critical care medicine doctors and nurses trained to perform complex procedures often on near death patients resisted company many believed open visitation would interfere in care and also result in anxiety for the patient overtaxed emotions for onlookers and possibly danger for staffers if family members became distraught spurred in part by the family centered care movement researchers have conducted more than observational studies and surveys on family visits to icus world wide many show a positive impact from family involvement experts for example had long believed that the stimulation of a visit could elevate the pressure in the brains of neuro intensive care patients to dangerous levels two studies found however that the visits had a healthy effect on intracranial pressure or else no significant effect at all visitors appeared to benefit as well studies suggested that loved ones who witnessed resuscitations or emergency invasive procedures reported that it was helpful to see that doctors had done as much as they could to save the patient family members could also help caregivers by monitoring patients and helping staffers to interpret subtle changes in their condition researchers found such visits may also help reduce length of stay cost and liability from errors in mcg health system in augusta ga affiliated with the medical college of georgia transformed its neuroscience icus shared patient rooms into private rooms with family living areas afterward the average length of time a patient spent in the unit fell by medication errors dropped to six the year after the unit opened from an annual average of the two previous years says pat sodomka vice president of quality for mcg the mounting evidence was enough to sway the institute for healthcare improvement the cambridge mass based nonprofit that leads hospital safety and quality improvement programs nationwide in a editorial published in the journal of the american medical association ihi head donald berwick called on hospitals to open intensive care units to unrestricted family visitation at emory dr samuels believed patients would benefit from such a change his opportunity came in when emory began an internal debate about modernizing the hospitals three small neuro critical care units were in a section of the hospital built in rooms holding the units beds were a tangle of equipment iv poles and machinery space was so tight that medications charts and paraphernalia were piled everywhere including on waste bins "we couldnt even make our way to the bedside without going over an obstacle course " dr samuels says "inevitably youd trip over a cord and pull something out of the patient " when a patient died doctors had to usher grieving family members to an open hallway to discuss organ donation families camped out with blankets and pillows in shabby lounges outside the units doors there was mounting concern at the hospital that the units design carried a risk of medical mistakes and staff burn out emory planned to eventually spend &# million on new medical facilities but dr samuels persuaded hospital brass to fund the new unit immediately arguing that it could serve as a laboratory for family involvement as well as new findings on hospital design he was granted a &# million budget and space on an unused rooftop deck dr samuels turned to craig zimring a professor of architecture at nearby georgia institute of technology who is also an environmental psychologist specializing in the emerging field of evidence based design emory had to overcome the challenges faced by other early adopters providence holy cross medical center in mission hills calif for example began an open visitation program in its existing bed unit in staffers of the hospital in a high crime area said visitors could become unruly and some patients had as many as visitors at a time the icu is now closed for shift changes and rounds three years later geisinger health system in danville pa opened its icu visiting hours but found that families camping out in the unit got in the way of doctors it relaunched the program setting limits on visits and giving beepers to family members so they could leave doctors for delicate procedures and return when paged "open visitation has failed in a number of settings around the country " says kris white a vice president of spectrum health a michigan care provider that expanded icu visitation hours in two hospitals in grand rapids mich months ago "you cant have an unmanaged free for all " at emory hospital staffers worked with dr zimring and hks inc a dallas based health care architecture firm to design more spacious patient rooms high tech equipment would be mounted on ceiling booms to open up space so that neurosurgeons could perform complicated procedures and families could stand nearby they positioned the family sleeping area at the side of the room adjacent to big outside windows inspired by studies on lighting which suggested patients in bright daylit rooms used less pain medication and had lower mortality rates and shorter stays than those in darker rooms the designers separated family and patient zones with glass partitions each rooms family area would include two chairs that convert into beds a sink table and television and a wifi network to economize the hospital planned communal bathrooms and showers plus a common kitchen and lounge area down the hall corridors would be widened to allow patient gurneys people and equipment to move between rooms when construction was completed in january dr samuels had a moment of panic at almost square feet the new unit was more than four times the size of the old facilities though it had three fewer beds its longer hallways increased the distance staffers had to travel between the patient rooms dr samuels worried that the staff could balk at the constant family presence "the nurses are going to throw me out " he recalls thinking "there is going to be a lynching " over a day and a half hospital staffers carefully transferred critically ill patients to the new unit among them was david childs a year old computer programmer who had suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm a week earlier in the new suite davids parents mike and victoria childs and his fiancee teri skinner kept a rotating vigil at his bedside as dr samuels and his team monitored his condition the swelling in davids brain had to be brought down before doctors could attempt surgery to fix the rupture and the family often stood at davids bedside as dr samuels described the oxygen monitor and other machines he was using when david was running a fever his mother and fiancee bathed him with cool cloths davids father said he had felt like he was always in the way in the old icus rooms in the new facility the family camped out mostly with the door left open between the room and family studio nurses worked more closely with them mike childs says and made them feel welcome "they always gave us the option of whether we wanted to leave or stay " victoria childs says "this was our home for a month and it got so that the nurses could tell when we needed a hug " for ms skinner it was enough to be at her fiances side "i was able to just sit in my chair and look at him " she says not everything was smooth family members had to find their way to the unisex bathroom down the hall at a m the communal shower room wasnt always cleaned after other visitors had used it when an alarm went off on a piece of equipment the family was the first to hear it often mr childs says they wandered the units halls to find assistance after two weeks in the unit david developed severe pneumonia leading to a condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome which prevents the lungs from getting adequate oxygen to decrease pressure in the brain dr samuels team put him in a drug induced coma to further protect his brain they lowered his body temperature with cooling catheters in his veins as his loved ones looked on the doctor and a colleague adjusted ventilator settings to get air back into his lungs as his condition was stabilizing late at night a few days later davids aneurysm re ruptured over the next hours the family paced back and forth between the studio the room and the family lounge area "they saw what was going on at every moment " dr samuels says "they saw that we were out of options " as davids parents and fiancee gathered at his bedside dr samuels told them that david was medically brain dead shortly after a team that arranges organ donation came to speak to the trio the family members say they are grateful for the time with david and for the way they were treated "no one ever misled us or told us anything but the truth " says mr childs "we all sat together and wept when he died " says dr samuels the presence of the family he says added credibility to the care by showing the doctors had done everything within their knowledge technical abilities and resources "unfortunately bad things happen despite all of your efforts " he says "if you werent living here and seeing it with us you might never understand that " john scala who has been on emorys nursing staff for six years says families presence was hardest at first for new staffers who faced constant questioning and werent always confident of their answers "its difficult for them to practice in a fishbowl " he says nurses have also become enforcers last month more than people came to visit a young patient who had suffered a massive stroke staffers were forced to remind visitors that the hospital can only accommodate two per patient per night there have been other challenges two computers and some plants were recently stolen from the family lounge area "this is a work in progress " says dr samuels beginning in march chris primrose a national bank examiner for the u s treasury spent of nights at emory his wife beth was transferred to the neuroscience unit from another hospital with complications from a ruptured aneurysm while mr primrose attended to her other family members looked after their three children at home in peachtree city ga about miles away it took two touch and go weeks before beths brain could heal enough to undergo surgery the rupture had caused so much stress to her body that a surge of adrenaline sent her into a condition known as "broken heart syndrome " which leads to heart and lung failure she was at high risk of another rupture or a stroke doctors inserted angioplasty balloons into the arteries of her brain a way to increase blood flow without raising her blood pressure to keep her arteries open they placed a catheter to pump medications into her spinal fluid for much of this her husband was at her bedside but families and staffers are also beginning to understand that sometimes it is best just to leave the room during more invasive procedures such as when a small hole was drilled into his wifes skull to insert an oxygen probe mr primrose would retreat into the family studio or take a jog around the campus now home recently after several weeks of rehabilitation mrs primrose remembers nothing from her treatment but she believes that patients are comforted by having a loved one close at hand mr primrose for his part is more certain "i can just imagine being in her shoes knowing you are in trouble in the icu and not having anyone there " he says "even if there is no way to medically prove it i am sure that my being there helped her "
