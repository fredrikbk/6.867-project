these two laptops are small and sleek but come with flaws the laptop is taking over from the desktop as the main type of personal computer but the most popular and economical laptops sold are too large for maximum mobility making laptops that are tiny as well as powerful is a tough design challenge ive been testing two of the latest efforts to crack that problem the first is from toshiba a company that once dominated the laptop world but has since slipped badly the other is from dell best known for larger clunkier laptops both machines are stylish and worked fine in the tests but each has flaws that might give a buyer pause these two new laptops which use intels core duo processor are very different in size the toshiba portege r weighs just pounds has the footprint of a standard sheet of paper and is only about inch thick at its thinnest point yet it squeezes in a dvd drive it sports a inch widescreen display with very good resolution the screen is lit by leds instead of by traditional lamps that makes for more brightness and saves power the dell xps m while still relatively small is larger than the toshiba it weighs a hair under four pounds has a larger footprint and is thicker it falls into a hot new laptop category that features inch widescreen displays a size considered a good compromise between the small displays on the lightest laptops and the larger ones on the heavier models the m has some very un dell like aspects to it such as a choice of three lid colors and a slot loading dvd drive that doesnt require a pop out tray toshiba claims the r is the worlds thinnest notebook with a built in dvd or cd drive dell claims the optional led version of the m is the thinnest with a inch screen the toshiba starts at &# for a unit with a gigabyte hard disk a gigabyte of memory and built in wi fi and bluetooth wireless networking the dell starts at &# for a model with a gigabyte hard disk a gigabyte of memory built in wi fi but not bluetooth and standard display an led display costs &# more bluetooth is an extra &# i tested the base model of the toshiba r and found that it performed well my particular machine came with windows xp though windows vista is also available in a model that costs &# more the tiny silver computer handled everything i threw at it including microsoft office the firefox web browser the itunes music program and more in my tough battery test where i turn off power saving features maximize screen brightness turn on wi fi and play an endless loop of music the r lasted an impressive three hours minutes i estimate that in more normal use you could get five hours of battery life but my test toshiba a production unit had a major flaw the dvd drive didnt work apparently the lens on the drive had come loose in shipping toshiba sent another unit with a working drive but this is a major issue because the machine uses a new very thin type of dvd drive that seemed fragile to me in fact the r lacked a solid feeling overall the keyboard was ok but the touch pad buttons seemed flimsy and stiff and i had the impression that this was a computer youd have to treat gently it also had trouble reconnecting with my wi fi network after waking up from its sleep state and it was loaded with the trial software and offers i call craplets the dell xps m on the other hand felt solid through and through from its crimson cover to its wedge shape its also a handsome laptop the unit i tested had the led screen and a full complement of options which would have brought its price to &# like the toshiba the dell speedily handled microsoft office firefox itunes and other software its wi fi worked very well my test model used vista and had the extra memory and souped up graphics vista needs to work well the m isnt available with windows xp to dells credit it can be ordered with no craplets on it for no extra money but because it uses vista it starts up painfully slowly a reboot took more than four minutes the big flaw on the dell is battery life a major downside for a machine meant to travel in my test the m lasted just two hours minutes so youd be lucky to get hours out of it in normal use dell says the base model would do better because it has a wimpier but less power draining graphics system you can get a bigger battery for &# more but it makes the machine larger and heavier the dell xps m is a good solid mobile computer that needs better battery life and can get expensive once you start ordering options the toshiba r seems like a dream machine for travelers but its dvd defect is worrisome and you may have to treat it like glassware email me at mossberg wsj com find all my columns and videos online for free at the new all things digital website http walt allthingsd com
