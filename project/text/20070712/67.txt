lead toxins take a global round trip e waste from computers discarded in west turns up in chinas exported trinkets yiwu china high levels of toxic lead turning up in cheap jewelry from china are prompting recalls in the u s but some of the lead used by these chinese manufacturers comes from an unconventional source computers and other electronic goods discarded in western countries and dumped in china liu mouye owner of the yiwu yiming alloy factory here says the lead alloy she sells to jewelry makers around yiwu an important hub for low priced chinese exports is made in part from so called e waste that arrives by ship in southern china from the u s and other developed countries "ive seen the containers come in " ms liu says "each one has about tons of parts removed from machines and appliances" from abroad two recent studies suggest lead from such sources is turning up in chinese made jewelry sold at u s discount stores and malls closing a globalization loop in which toxic materials from high tech garbage are turned into potentially dangerous goods for kids and shipped back jeffrey weidenhamer and michael clement chemists at ashland university in ohio studied the composition of childrens highly leaded jewelry and key chains found in stores last year and determined that some also contained levels of copper and tin that suggested the source was lead solder used in electronic circuit boards other jewelry samples were also found to contain antimony a toxic metalloid element used to harden lead used in batteries the united nations estimates that up to million tons of e waste is thrown away world wide each year large amounts are shipped into china even though the countrys laws essentially ban imports of e waste according to chinas state environmental protection administration for lead the trip to china from the u s typically goes something like this u s consumers and businesses send their old electronics to recycling firms often by way of innocuous recycling drives some of those firms then sell the electronics to dealers in the u s who sell them to dealers in china chinese companies buy the e waste and strip lead and other re sellable materials from it often discarding harmful materials along the way adding to local pollution those firms then sell the recovered lead to alloy makers like ms liu who provide it to chinese manufacturers the lead makes its way sometimes at toxic levels into trinkets sold to consumers in the u s "this return to sender issue is really important " says ted smith founder of the silicon valley toxics coalition an organization in san jose calif focused on the environmental impact of the high tech industry mr smith points out an added irony many of the electronics consumed in the u s are manufactured in china in the first place "talk about globalization " he says "if you drew a map of this the arrows would go in lots of different directions " the u s environmental protection agency says it doesnt regulate the export of most old electronics including cellphones and the circuit boards that make computers run in either a "shredded" or intact form because it considers them non hazardous in january however the agency began enforcing a new rule specific to cathode ray tubes the tv and computer display screens that are commonly known as crts and contain lead now exporters of intact or broken crts destined for recycling must notify the epa of the export and get permission from the country importing the crts before doing so the epa doesnt have any laws that ban the export of non hazardous waste so if what it defines as non hazardous waste is sent to another country it doesnt know "we have had some very general inquiries from the chinese government saying they want to discuss this area but we do not generally get requests from china regarding the shipped materials " says bob tonetti an e waste expert at the epa amid rising concerns about the safety of exports from china lead has become a particular focus especially in items made for children this year the u s consumer product safety commission has issued recall notices affecting more than million pieces of jewelry for children and teenagers that it says contain dangerous levels of lead almost all of it made in china thats a sharp increase from lead related recalls in and three the year before that "in recent years weve seen an influx of metal childrens jewelry" that has "high levels of accessible lead " says agency spokesman scott wolfson public health officials have been fighting for years to keep lead out of childrens jewelry lead has even turned up in snaps on chinese made overalls and shirts for babies and toddlers and on gardening gloves for kids ingested it can cause brain damage and death the risk is highest for young children who are more likely to mouth or swallow pieces of jewelry a new california law essentially limits the lead content of the base metal in childrens jewelry to starting sept new regulations for adult jewelry go into effect march the consumer product safety commission uses the limit as a guideline on childrens jewelry and has proposed it as a federal regulation the recalled jewelry ranged from "best friends forever" necklaces sold at accessories retailer claires stores inc to necklace and earring sets with plastic "birthstones" sold by sears holdings corp s kmart stores the commission has also issued recalls this year for chinese made toys coated with lead paint enforcement efforts have escalated since a child died last year in minneapolis of acute lead poisoning after swallowing a chinese made charm from a bracelet given away with reebok sneakers a spokeswoman for claires didnt return a call seeking comment christian brathwaite a spokesman for sears holdings says "kmart takes customers safety very seriously " adding when a "product has been identified as having an issue with lead weve stopped selling that product " in china however lead alloy remains a favored material for costume jewelry makers it is plentiful and cheap often selling for half the price of zinc alloy the other metal mixture commonly used to make costume jewelry lead has a relatively low melting point which makes it easier to work with and lends heft to inexpensive jewelry the chinese government sets limits on lead content in toys but not in jewelry for children or adults many other countries also lack legal limits or fail to enforce them companies like ms lius and other metal traders and alloy manufacturers say they buy lead from recyclers mix it with other materials and sell it to jewelry makers in yiwu and qingdao in eastern shandong province two centers of costume jewelry production in china nationwide chinas costume jewelry industry has annual sales of about &# billion and about is exported in yiwu jewelry sellers make no secret of using toxic lead alloy in their products they insist buyers know what theyre getting and say using lead is the only way to offer the low prices that foreign purchasers are willing to pay wang xubin the owner of xu lin decoration co specializes in making costume jewelry for teenagers his raw material of choice a metal alloy that he says is to lead the metal is molded into bracelets and pendants in the shape of crosses eagles dragons and crowns "we do what our customers want if they ask for no lead we can do it " says mr wang "but a lot of americans see the cost of lowering the lead content and say forget it " at yiwu zhongtai ornament co s factory on the outskirts of yiwu ingots of lead alloy are melted down in large crucibles young men then ladle the molten metal about to lead according to the company by hand into rubber molds on a recent visit none of the workers was wearing protective facemasks or gloves pieces of molded metal are then popped out filed and plated with a thin coat of another metal often a mixture of gold and silver or palladium they are then assembled by rows of workers soldering and placing fake gemstones on the necklaces and earrings "its too costly to make lead free products " says owner wang qinjuan "chinese products have to be sold cheaply in foreign markets or they are not competitive " some manufacturers say they are moving away from lead alloy at the request of customers especially those from the u s and western europe nearly all say that if a buyer wants them to factories can lower the lead content of their products "people can choose we give them whatever they want " says ni lanzhen a wholesaler of jewelry and trinkets including a tiny ring topped with a lead flower "but most of the market is lead alloy " some importers on the other hand complain insuring product quality from china can be difficult myles marks an employee of dm merchandising in elmhurst ill says that his company stepped up testing after authorities discovered that some chinese made bracelets contained lead which the company was unaware of "there are items weve had to test and retest three and four times " says mr marks when they fail to meet lead standards "its a colossal pain and its certainly costly " mr marks says that sometimes chinese suppliers will "do the old bait and switch " winning an order with a product that meets an importers specifications and then mass producing the items with cheaper lead containing materials but while many companies express frustration few including dm merchandising are willing to publicly identify their chinese suppliers meanwhile the e waste problem is attracting the attention of some lawmakers congressman tom lantos chairman of the house foreign affairs committee recently sent a letter to the u s government accountability office expressing concern about the practice of exporting e waste from the u s to foreign countries prompted by the letter the gao plans to begin research on the topic soon "we need this study to get an idea of the problems global scope " mr lantos said in an email "i am concerned that u s consumers who recycle computers and other electronic equipment may be led to believe that they are doing good when in fact they are doing harm " vauhini vara in san francisco and ellen zhu in shanghai contributed to this article
