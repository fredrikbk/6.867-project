chinas reserves build still higher beijing china continued its recent record breaking run of increasing official foreign exchange reserves adding another &# billion to its stash in just three months but the unusual multibillion dollar transactions thought to have fueled the huge increases in those holdings this year show signs of tapering off separately chinas statistics bureau said the countrys economy in grew at an even faster pace than previously estimated with gross domestic product expanding up from the initially calculated the revision led some economists to predict that china could surpass germany sooner than expected to become the worlds third largest national economy the u s and japan are the first and second largest national economies chinas latest additions to its foreign reserve holdings the worlds largest brought their total to &# trillion at the end of june up from &# trillion at the end of march according to data published yesterday by the countrys central bank the figures highlight the enormous sums of money flowing into china and the difficulty in tracing them because china exports far more than it imports and it invests abroad on a much smaller scale than foreigners invest in china more foreign currency enters the country than flows out of it that allows china to build up its reserves for the past three years china has added foreign reserves at a pace of about &# billion to &# billion a month this year something changed and the pace of inflows suddenly accelerated chinas reserves have grown by more than &# billion a month in the first half that is much more than can be accounted for by officially recorded trade and investment figures the central bank following its customary practice didnt comment on or explain the increase in foreign reserves during the second quarter many economists believe that the even larger &# billion increase in reserves in the first quarter can be accounted for in part by large currency swap transactions by chinese banks bringing home money that had previously been kept offshore in may the peoples bank of china confirmed that "financial institutions and enterprises exchanging funds raised in offshore initial public offerings also led to a corresponding increase in the foreign exchange reserves" in the first quarter however central bank officials have never said how much of the increase in reserves was due to such transactions another possible explanation is that money could be coming into the country through informal channels to take advantage of the booming local stock market and strengthening currency in any case the scale of the unusual fund inflows appears to have diminished since the first quarter of the &# billion increase in reserves in the second quarter about &# billion can be attributed to chinas merchandise trade surplus and about &# billion to recorded foreign direct investment that leaves about &# billion in gains from other sources compared with roughly &# billion in gains from other sources in the first quarter economists estimate investment gains and currency fluctuations in the reserve holdings likely account for another &# billion to &# billion of each quarters rise
