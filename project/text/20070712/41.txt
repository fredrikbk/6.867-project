fashion journal haute couture right off the rack paris pads its signature shows with lots of ready to wear entree for new designers at the semiannual haute couture shows last week in paris i was curious to learn about this exacting craft which we are told caters to the or so women in the world who buy hand sewn completely made to order dresses costing as much as a small house in kansas city i attended the haute couture show of lefranc ferrant a pair of talented new designers who showed finely executed flattering dresses and coats the next day i called lefranc ferrant to ask how one could buy a marvelous gray wool dress that had walked the runway they directed me to the emmy franck boutique on the rue st honore and there it was in several sizes priced at euros or about &# ms franck herself helped me try it on but of course what with the pre made sizes and all it wasnt haute couture "it doesnt matter we know its ready to wear " didier grumbach said with a shrug the president of the french couture federation frances fashion police is allowing designers to break all the rules that have traditionally separated haute couture from ready to wear clothing which is produced in quantity and sold off the rack then he got down to brass capitalism explaining why paris is at this time of year full of the worlds retail buyers placing orders for ready to wear clothing to fill stores next spring also the fall ready to wear collections are just arriving at paris shops these stores are selling their summer fare in semiannual sales what a splendid time for a fashion convention "haute couture becomes a way to animate all the confusion of these other activities " mr grumbach said even if its not haute couture mr grumbach is president of the federation francaise de la couture du pret a porter des couturiers et des createurs de mode which guards the rules for how haute couture clothes are made completely by hand from a pattern that is customized to fit the buyer in a parisian atelier employing at least seamstresses the group also controls the pace for the steady march of paris fashion shows which in turn dictate the stride of style in new york london and milan today the few haute couture shows that stick to the rules more or less are more theater than fashion christian dior designer john galliano threw a fete at versailles attended by the likes of harvey weinstein dita von teese and sofia coppola dali esque shoes with tall heels melting into their soles sent models bobbling down the runway like sleek race cars that had lost a wheel very entertaining waiting for the inevitable crashes little wonder that there are so few customers it takes a remarkable woman to pull off a gown thats four feet wide or imitates what renaissance jesters wore giorgio armanis collection included giant stiff skirts that ballooned like up ended tilted brandy snifters these are clothes made for the press never to be worn off the runway a half dozen well heeled design houses cant fill a week of shows though so more than a dozen less well known but talented designers are invited each season these people cant afford to make eccentric collections that wont sell this season they include boudicca anne valerie hash adam jones and gustavo lins as well as lefranc ferrant felipe oliveira baptistas rail thin models wore finely knitted t shirts over slinky skirts with sequined lightning strikes mr lins showed gray pants shirts and shoes that would look elegant but not outlandish in my office indeed true haute couture may be gasping for breath but these shows are arguably an excellent place to discover agile new designers before theyre bought up by the luxury conglomerates still some in the fashion world feel its time to recognize that the haute couture show calendar is being fleshed out with ready to wear mr grumbach "fills the schedule just to fill it " said concetta lanciaux an adviser to lvmh chairman bernard arnault monsieur grumbach is unworried "gradually these things fade " he said "the difference between haute couture and ready to wear " another shrug "chanel and dior can be the mythical couturiers but they live because of the ready to wear " that doesnt mean the idea of haute couture cant be useful at least for the press releases "couture is a way to give freedom for a designer it allows a house to present designs which are a dream ready to wear is reality " mr grumbach continued making the racks of &# pret a porter dresses at vuitton and bottega veneta sound dreary but these designers use their haute couture shows much as they use the red carpets of hollywood to showcase their ready to wear clothes the much photographed starlet camille belle attended the armani haute couture show last week in an armani ready to wear dress with a black patent bodice and black and white shirt the dress appeared next day in the window of the armani shop on avenue montaigne decades ago the best dressed ladies went to the salons of yves st laurent and emanuel ungaro and coco chanel twice a year to choose that seasons wardrobe multiple fittings resulted in a perfect fit with none of the bulging buttons of ready to wear clothing dozens of designers considered to have the haute couture "savoir faire" were voted into the couture federation after world war ii european factories followed americas lead and began churning out pret a porter mass production was far more profitable these days the french haute couture federation has only members and four of them including emanuel ungaro didnt show this season in another decade predicts pamela golbin curator of the louvre museums musee de la mode et du textile no true haute couture members will remain instead she suggests designers like azzedine alaia will produce high quality clothes for good customers from outside the expensive haute couture system today designers nicolas ghesquiere of balenciaga alexander mcqueen and vanessa seward of azzaro all have the haute couture "savior faire " mr grumbach said wishing they would apply to join the federation "we are snobbish they must ask " he noted the only designer whom mr grumbach has invited without a request is giorgio armani he said it was a bid to boost the fashion week by getting mr armani to show in paris rather than milan azzaros chief executive nathalie franson told me she has no intention of requesting haute couture status the idea is to make high margin shoes and accessories in addition to azzaros famously draped ready to wear dresses global expansion not savoir faire email christina binkley wsj com
