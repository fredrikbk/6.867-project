asset allocation funds may help returns study says these tools keep investors from acting on impatient impulses mutual fund investors can be their own worst enemies but there is hope for curtailing their errant behavior according to a study released yesterday the average mutual fund investor earns significantly less than fund performance figures suggest mostly because of their own impatient behavior but asset allocation funds can "create a comfort zone" to help protect investors from themselves according to dalbar inc s quantitative analysis of investor behavior the boston based financial services research firm examined real investor returns for equity fixed income and asset allocation funds from january through december the results could bode well for investors as the pension protection act of is encouraging increased use of asset allocation funds such as target date and lifecycle funds particularly as defaults in defined contribution plans "the two huge pieces of good news are the flow of assets into asset allocation funds that are likely to be increasing it was the fastest growing mutual fund segment in and the other side of it is that equity investors are actually beginning to hold on " says lou harvey president of dalbar since dalbar has been measuring the effects of investor decisions to buy sell and switch into and out of mutual funds the conclusion has always been the same returns are far more dependent on investor behavior than on fund performance and fund investors who hold their investments are more successful than those that time the market the report found that while the past years have been a boon to the mutual fund industry the average investor has earned only a fraction of the markets results thats because mutual fund performance is based on an investment held throughout a specific time period one three five years etc but investors frequently dont hold the funds for the entire period instead they pour in cash as markets rise and start a selling frenzy after a decline in addition new funds funds that surge in popularity and funds that close may cause investors to switch or withdraw their money which can lower returns depending on when they occur investors arent great about timing the market theyre more likely to correctly guess the markets direction when its rising and to make mistakes after downturns dalbar found "these mistakes occur because investors are driven by the fear that the markets will not recover even though broad indices show that markets do indeed recover " the report says dalbars advice "if you dont know when to get out it is better to stay in " for a &# investment over years dollar cost averaging produced higher returns than those earned by the average investor chasing returns dalbar found but asset allocation funds which for the studys purposes include traditional balanced funds as well as target date and lifecycle funds which automatically rebalance investors portfolios can help temper those tendencies said mr harvey investors are likely to hold asset allocation funds substantially longer than either equity or fixed income funds the year analysis showed for example based on the average investors behavior in an investor in an asset allocation fund would hold it for years while an investor in an equity fund would hold it for only years and an investor in a fixed income fund would stay put for only years the study projected the pension protection act will encourage retirement plans to automatically enroll investors and place their contributions in an established group of qualified default investments asset allocation funds such as target date and lifecycle funds are expected to be among the final list of qualified default investments which has yet to be determined the act will also encourage employers to increase automatic contribution levels over time "it was suggested that one of the reasons for that particular provision of qualified default investment alternatives in the pension protection act was this fact that asset allocation funds tended to improve investor behavior and therefore would ultimately produce a more secure retirement " said mr harvey "you add the automatic features to that which our study doesnt address and i can see a dramatic improvement " however traditional performance measures show that asset allocation funds severely underperform equity funds the dalbar report said the average equity fund investors year annualized return jumped to from in while the average fixed income fund investors return was and the average asset allocation fund investor gained according to dalbar nevertheless asset allocation funds have prevented significant losses due to fear based selling the researcher says "asset allocation funds have been around for several decades but have never enjoyed the spotlight " the report says "perhaps this is due to the way they are measured this analysis shows that asset allocation funds deliver what they promise lower risk no switching and real returns for the investor " even in the face of one of the most severe market declines in history to retention in asset allocation funds remained above years dalbar found on another positive note equity fund retention rates held steady in at years the same as in and and the highest level since the study found that greatly helped investors beat the performance of standard &amp poors index dalbar said "it is too early to speculate whether this improved behavior will continue but it is encouraging to compare the recent investor actions against impulsive reactions around the crash and when retention reached record low levels " the report said mr harvey said the equity fund retention may be "more of an indicator that investors are genuinely getting smarter and recognizing that the fact that the market goes down as it did earlier this year it does come back "
