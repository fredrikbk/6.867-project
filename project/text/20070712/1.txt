and his enduring mystery richard wagners four mythological operas known collectively as the ring scheduled for performance at lincoln center this month by the kirov opera under the direction of valery gergiev have been steeped in controversy from the very moment of their conception in even before he put a single note of the ring to paper the composer began publishing a string of inflammatory essays espousing a futurist vision of opera and a poisonous assessment of the role of jews in the arts in the decades that followed he turned the vision into monumental musically stunning works his music and his ideas changed the course of western culture but they stirred fierce battles between acolytes and foes in his lifetime and considering the additional historical overlay of nazi adulation for this composer its not surprising that the quarreling continues even those who find wagners music ravishing regard the man as an ugly piece of work and that issue is not so frivolous as some might contend daniel barenboim for example conducts this music in israel where it outrages many audience members as if doing so places him on the moral high ground but heres the problem this composers music and his message are so thoroughly entwined that separating the two is really not an easy matter thats why despite its beauty and grandeur wagners work can still be troubling take his aesthetic credo of gesamtkunstwerk his sweeping aside of "pure music" in favor of the emotionally powerful composite of music blended with poetry drama dance and stagecraft this was no academic exercise but part of a potent ideological struggle to resurrect what the composer considered the deep folk "essence" of the german people his aim was to cleanse german culture of those elements that he considered foreign to its true nature hence his attack on jews whose rootlessness and strange ways including "synagogue rhythms" and ornate melodies inspired he claimed an "instinctive revulsion" in gentiles his biggest problem with jewish music was its supposed inability to move the german soul thus he says mendelssohns work engrosses us only on the level of simple amusement at its elegant polished figures it was never meant he insists "to take the shape of deep and stalwart feelings of the human heart " that is its pleasures are merely intellectual one theory of wagners resentment toward jews however stems from the support he received from the jewish opera composer giacomo meyerbeer wagner had a habit of turning on those who showed him kindness his frequent pattern was to steal the wives of helpful patrons philosophically wagner was calling for the musical equivalent of blood lust his hero was the explosive romantic beethoven a composer he said whose musical speech filled "with the force of necessity " could only be spoken by the "whole entire warm breathed human being " even bach fails to live up to wagners ideal his music "can be mimicked at a pinch by any musician who thoroughly understands his business though scarcely in the sense of bach because the formal has still therein the upper hand " in his view the structured rational aspects of music were its least admirable qualities wagner in his embrace of the irrational instinct driven side of human experience found a kindred spirit in philosopher arthur schopenhauer who saw the greatest force in life as a blind relentless ill wind he called "the will " one of my favorite ira gershwin lyrics from the song "isnt it a pity " perfectly sums up the schopenhauerian view of things "my nights were sour spent with schopenhauer " in that landscape raw emotion is the only legitimate coin of the realm and wagners take no prisoners stance toward the forces of musical conservatism placed him firmly in the political sphere of antiliberal far right extremists all this was the basis for major clashes in his day the two warring camps of that time were those of brahms accused of being too cerebral dry and complex and too chamber like even in the symphonies and of wagner whose music and ideas were considered by the brahmsians to be of one cloth and equally abhorrent brahmss friend clara schumann a great pianist and composer herself attended a performance of wagners "tristan und isolde" and declared in her diary "it is the most repulsive thing i ever saw or heard in my life it is not emotion that the opera portrays it is a disease and they tear their hearts out of their bodies while the music expresses it all in the most nauseous manner " and yet wagners operas are to this day enthralling what do we find irresistible in them for one thing the sheer visceral experience they are epic on a scale that is almost guaranteed to induce sensory overload the orchestral forces are massive the voices required to pull it off are huge and the music is consistently in your face the sounds are often incredibly beautiful lush and yearning or alternately brutish startling even scary on a dramatic level the four ring operas depicting the struggles of gods heroes and creatures for a magical ring that grants domination over the world tap our deepest primordial longings and impulses wagner borrowed much from others musically he took especially from the works of chopin weber liszt berlioz and yes meyerbeer his signature use of leitmotifs themes representing characters actions objects and emotions has many precedents his exploitation of myth and folklore was hardly unique the much admired opera "der freischutz" by carl maria von weber came first and left an indelible impression on the young wagner but he pushed things further and made them bigger than anyone ever had before many analyses of the ring operas have emerged over the years george bernard shaw saw the cycle in political terms as a socialist critique of industrial society robert donington viewed it in a psychological framework as the development of unconscious archetypes leading to individuation these varying interpretations attest to the works depth and artfulness but the reason these operas still stir some apprehension is that their essential attraction is inseparable from something wagnerites have long celebrated and that clara schumann loathed the unhampered zeal of an artistic ego gone wild experience has taught us to be wary mr isacoff is editor of piano today magazine and author of "temperament how music became a battleground for the great minds of western civilization " see related article "a russian ring highlights wagners timelessness " wsj july
