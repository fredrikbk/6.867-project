icahn management lp and activist hedge funds including atticus capital lp and jana partners llc known for throwing their weight around have barreled into the railroads too the result as a group railroad shares have surged more than so far this year despite a decline in traffic because of the slowdown in automobile and home sales that is equivalent to a freight train stretching from san francisco to cleveland and back so the question is can they hold on to their gains "the stocks have traded up partly on expectations that something big will happen " says rick paterson a ubs ag

pricing power imports through west coast ports are projected to double during the next decade with trains carrying half that volume according to global insight inc a consulting company in waltham mass meanwhile high fuel prices are hurting trucks more than trains that adds up to a healthy long term outlook for value oriented investors such as mr buffett some hedge funds already are pressuring railroad executives to squeeze more price increases from their customers and take on billions of dollars of debt to ramp up capital spending and buy back shares "what stands between us and better safer less capacity constrained railroads isnt activist shareholders its complacent management teams " complains snehal amin a partner at childrens investment fund management llp a london hedge fund

prices longtime industry experts remember heavy debt loads in the s and s that brought down dozens of railroads at penn central transportation corp ballooning interest payments and declining traffic made it impossible to keep trains running or get tracks fixed later csx and norfolk southern spent several years working down debt from the purchase of the former conrail inc before they could

burkhardt president of rail world inc a regional railroad owner "shareholders are going to benefit more from having the industry invest in increased capacity and competitiveness than buying back lots of stock in the short term " an increase of to a year in railroad shipping rates would send piles of cash to the bottom line investors counting on that are likely to be disappointed since the industry already is on the political defensive because of its increased pricing power some railroad executives are worried that pending legislation to curb rate setting freedoms is gaining traction in congress meanwhile some railroads arent showing any signs of giving their new activist shareholders what they want last month norfolk southern scrambled to put together a presentation to investors who were hoping that the railroad might take on additional debt for stock buybacks instead executives at the norfolk va company announced plans for a &# billion rail corridor between louisiana and new jersey jacksonville fla based csx which has come under pressure from childrens investment fund plans to boost borrowing to help fund &# billion in stock repurchases by the end of it has vowed not to sink deeply into debt claiming that could make the railroad more vulnerable to any downturns in the economy and financial markets investors seeking change "would like to see railroads do some extreme things which appear to be reckless and naive " says michael ward csxs chairman and chief executive tom uutala an analyst at keycorps victory capital management unit which owns shares of burlington
