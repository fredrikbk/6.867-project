weekend journal hollywood report mr hill is ready for his close up another unlikely bit player gets film of his own apatows expanding orbit as things stand today year old actor jonah hill is almost completely unknown to the public hes a chubby self conscious and largely unkempt guy both on screen and off he smokes parliaments lives in a small apartment in l a and during a recent lunch checked his black cotton shirt every few seconds to brush off crumbs but mr hills obscurity is about to vanish his film "superbad " which opens aug is a candidate to be a late summer sleeper hit beyond that mr hill already is set to write produce and star in a couple of major studio films such a rapid rise might not be surprising if mr hill were tall dark handsome suave with the ladies and good with a gun or martial arts a colin farrell or brad pitt on the rise instead hes the latest byproduct of another path to success in hollywood these days the assembly line of new comic talent overseen by producer writer director judd apatow hollywoods current king midas mr apatows two recent directorial efforts "the year old virgin" and "knocked up" were both surprise hits taking in a combined &# million at the u s box office while two other recent hit productions "anchorman the legend of ron burgundy " and "talladega nights the legend of ricky bobby " together sold &# million in domestic tickets mr apatow years old has gathered around him a rotating troupe of actors and writers who use his movies to stair step rapidly from small roles to stardom for example steve carell parlayed a bit part in "anchorman " produced by mr apatow into the starring role in s "virgin " seth rogen a secondary character in "virgin " became the unlikely star of this summers outlandish pregnancy themed "knocked up " now mr hill is on the same path just a couple of years ago it looked as if his hollywood career might be over before it began a cameo in the film "i heart huckabees" led mr hill to drop out of college in new york and return to his parents los angeles home determined to launch his movie career but a predictable dry spell followed and his finances dwindled "broke and living with my parents my ex girlfriend really loved that " he says for most young actors a barren year would have been the end of the line but then mr hill was fortunate enough to come into the orbit of mr apatow he played a small but memorable role in "the year old virgin" as a spaced out kid trying to buy boots with goldfish in the heel that led to a beefier secondary role as one of mr rogens loser buddies in "knocked up " now mr hill is stepping into the lead in a raunchy high school comedy "superbad " co written by mr rogen and produced by mr apatow the movie which follows two teenagers quests to lose their virginity at the end of high school is already helping mr hill hes set to write and star in a movie being developed for universal pictures called "middle child" and produce write and star in a film for sony pictures mr hill credits mr apatow "if youre funny and you understand that being an actor alone wont cut it but can also contribute as a writer while realizing that you might not be the funniest guy in the room then judd will give you a chance " he says mr apatows success seems to lie largely in his method he effectively uses his stable of young and cheap actors to make relatively inexpensive films that often generate large profits for example "knocked up" cost less than &# million to make but in a little over five weeks has brought in more than &# million domestically as his lead actors gain fame and praise they also want to increase their fortune in bigger budget movies which then allows mr apatow to spotlight other less well known members of his coterie for his part mr apatow says he has no master plan or assembly line of comedy he notes that he produced "talladega nights " a big will ferrell comedy and remains committed to projects with mr carell who now commands a huge fee "my theory is that i dont think you need to be famous to be funny " mr apatow says "the audience doesnt care if youre famous they just want someone who is hilarious " sometimes he adds "its more fun to watch someone youve never seen before because you dont know what theyre going to do " for mr hill it was a one liner that led to his big part in "superbad " mr apatow who allows his actors leeway for grand improvisation says downtime on the day of mr hills scene in "virgin" allowed the actor to vamp with his co star academy award nominee catherine keener and show off his comedic chops the improvised dialogue was added to the final cut and mr apatow realized hed found another possible star but "superbad" director greg mottola who worked with mr apatow in television after directing an independent comedy called "the daytrippers " wasnt immediately sold on mr hill the "superbad" lead character calls for a high school senior and mr hill was already in his early twenties mr rogen who wrote the movie with evan goldberg in intended the lead part for himself but had outgrown the role by the time the film was greenlit "at first i was being a stickler and wanted to keep it with a high school aged cast and not go above a year old " says mr mottola "but we just couldnt find anybody who fit and the only person who was likeable and funny in the part was seth but he got too old " mr hills comedic timing and acting skills convinced messrs apatow and mottola that he could play both a loser high school senior and a passable facsimile of mr rogen who took another part in the movie as a rogue cop as for mr hill his face now adorns billboards but as of a few weeks ago he could still eat lunch at a trendy l a restaurant largely unnoticed and unmolested by fans hes also not far removed from the dorky kid he plays so well on screen and is still surprised by his fame recently he says he attended a script reading for ben stiller "and was sitting next to vince vaughn on one side and jack black on the other " he adds "im just sitting there thinking whoa this is insane and i thought to myself man if i could just take a picture of this scene and then send it back in time to myself when i was and hating life in high school and say to myself dude just look how cool life will be so dont worry about how bad high school s that would have been really cool "
