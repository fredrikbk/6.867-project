sallie mae and its prospective acquirer an investment group led by private equity firm j c flowers &amp co sallie mae said the buyout group had informed it that legislative proposals in the house and senate "could result in a failure of the conditions to the closing of the merger to be satisfied " sallie mae said it "strongly disagrees with this assertion" and plans to proceed with the deal which was expected to close in october "as rapidly as possible " an assistant to j christopher flowers chief of j c flowers declined to comment in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange sallie mae shares dropped &# or to &# as investors worried the deal might collapse sallie maes statement which came shortly before the house approved &# billion in subsidy cuts to student lenders over five years underscores the growing hostility in washington toward the student loan industry amid allegations of corruption and conflict of interest it also reflects the growing skittishness of private equity investors whose deal making has fueled the buyout boom as they face growing difficulty getting loans to finance their acquisitions by the house voted to use the money saved by cutting subsidies to student lenders to increase grants to low income students and slash the interest rates on certain student loans president bush has threatened to veto the legislation saying not enough money is going to poor students and too much is going to those who have already graduated from college sallie mae a government sponsored entity until has prospered in recent years as more students have attended college by borrowing heavily to pay fast rising tuition bills under a number of federal programs the government pays subsidies to lenders so they can offer lower rates to students it also guarantees the loans if the borrower defaults sallie mae the nations biggest student loan provider manages &# billion in education loans for million customers the student loan industry has been under fire following a string of revelations about payments trips and other perks provided by student lenders to universities and their financial aid officials new york attorney general andrew cuomo whose nationwide investigation helped to expose those practices said these rewards compromised the advice that universities offered their students about where to obtain loans already more than two dozen schools have agreed to a new "code of conduct" drawn up by mr cuomo that prohibits such practices the six largest student loan providers including sallie mae have settled mr cuomos allegations in its settlement sallie mae paid &# million to a national fund to educate high school students and their families about the financial aid process soon after sallie mae agreed in april to be acquired for &# a share a nearly premium to where its shares were trading before word of a possible deal leaked out by a j c flowers led group that also includes bank of america corp and j p morgan chase &amp co the dispute between sallie mae and its prospective buyers hinges on language in the buyout agreement that gives the buyer the right to walk away from the deal without paying a breakup fee in the event of a "material adverse effect" that harms the business and wasnt already noted in the companys securities filings unless they can show such an event has occurred j c flowers and the banks would have to pay &# million to walk away that would be a massive blow to both the war chest and reputation of mr flowers who has just raised a fund to make a series of financial industry acquisitions a person familiar with the transaction said that sallie maes position is that the buyers already knew about president bushs budget as well as the possibility that congress would cut further when it agreed to the takeover if that view prevailed the buyers would have to pay the breakup fee the issue highlights a practical reality behind leveraged buyouts until the deals officially close they essentially amount to expensive "options" to purchase a company in the sallie mae case the grave risks to both sides might give them an incentive to reach a compromise mr flowerss stance could also be a sign of nervousness among lenders lined up to back the deal at a time when the debt markets used to fund large acquisitions are weakening considerably one standard &amp poors report used the word "meltdown" to describe the current environment investors education experts and people close to the deal also wondered whether the buyers cold feet could be a ploy to negotiate a lower price for sallie mae other observers said sallie mae and its buyers could be trying to affect the scope of the proposals before congress before the deal was announced president bushs budget had already called for almost &# billion in cuts to student lenders over five years but since then congress has wielded an even sharper knife "its hard to tell who is doing what and whether there is an attempt to influence legislation by creating a manufactured crisis " says barmak nassirian associate executive director of the american association of collegiate registrars and admissions officers a spokesman said sallie mae wouldnt comment beyond its statement sallie mae and its buyers have been working hard to mollify congress where democrats have expressed reservations about its being taken private in may the companys chief executive thomas j fitzpatrick quit under pressure in a move that the buyers hoped would help reduce congressional opposition to the buyout deal according to a person close to j c flowers mr fitzpatrick was replaced by c e andrews formerly chief financial officer yesterday the house voted to use the savings from slashing subsidies paid to private lenders to increase the maximum pell grant for needy students to &# by from the proposed &# for it also would halve the interest rate on certain stafford loans the most popular government backed student loan program to by the
