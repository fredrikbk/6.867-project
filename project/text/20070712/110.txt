the daily fix beckham arrives in u s but will his appeal last online edition let beckhamania begin david beckham the british soccer star who made his name with manchester united before moving to european rival real madrid has finally arrived in the u s to make his official debut with the los angeles galaxy of major league soccer beckhams impending arrival has been highly anticipated by the mls and u s soccer fans alike since the deal to bring him stateside was announced in january indeed the very future of the year old soccer league and even that of the sport in this country may depend on him thats a tall task for one man and while not everyone is sure he is up to it they are willing to give beckham a chance some of the skeptics include sportswriters from his home country of the u k where beckhams arrival in the u s has been big news as it has here with him appearing on the cover of sports illustrated this week "hes only one man and the task before him seems as formidable as converting americans to the metric system can one man make the u s public care about the los angeles galaxy about major league soccer about a sport that neither hosting the world cup nor harboring the greatest player ever pele could turn into the mainstream religion that it is nearly everywhere else on the planet " asks grant wahl in his si cover story "or is it possible that year old david beckham ball bending savant global pitchman the newest member of the american sports firmament isnt acting alone could he merely be the catalyst for a transformation already underway " the bbcs nigel adderley had this reaction to the si piece and what it means for his countrys famed athlete "the sight of david beckham on the front cover of sports illustrated is the clearest indication yet that this most insular of sporting nations is taking an interest in his arrival after all this is a place usually reserved for american icons such as michael jordan and tiger woods " beckhams official presentation will come friday evening in a "typical hollywood event" that will be "the ultimate combination of sport and showbusiness " says mr adderley who is in l a "but in such a sprawling city where the lakers and the dodgers dominate the media attention beckham may have his work cut out to keep up a consistently high profile " for those in america not already familiar with becks they will have plenty of time to get acquainted with him "as one name monikers go becks doesnt yet have the sizzle of a rod or kobe but dont be fooled it stands for showtime " says marco r della cava in usa today "look for becks as the brits call him here there and everywhere during the coming summer days " on monday beckham will start practice with the galaxy which has introduced a new logo and uniform for his arrival and will make his mls debut on july in an exhibition match against englands chelsea set to be broadcast by espn using cameras two days before on july he scheduled to be interviewed by espn during the mls all star game in denver for those who catch the interview you may be wondering what all the buzz is about some dont think beckham has what it takes to be as successful in the u s as hes been in europe and for that matter the rest of the world so what does it take john rogers of the associated press has the answer "tiger woods has it so does arnold schwarzenegger and george clooney mickey mantle certainly had it and magic johnson still does its charisma and you cant manufacture it bottle it or buy it it seems youre just born with it david beckham had it in his native england but is it transferable to america " the best comparison may be pele and if so the future doesnt look promising for beckham "pele perhaps the best soccer player the game has ever known and a charismatic figure couldnt do it " mr rogers reminds us "he arrived in the united states in amid much hoopla three years later after he led the new york cosmos to a north american soccer league championship americans saluted his effort and talent then they got back to watching baseball football and basketball " pele who was in new york yesterday to promote a literacy campaign and ring the opening bell at nasdaq had some words of wisdom for beckham "if the team doesnt win then the people dont care he can make big publicity but inside of the field you have to prove it " he told the new york daily news "he has to prepare because its not easy to play here the level of the teams now are very good " unfortunately the l a galaxy arent very good making beckhams job even harder both on and off the field "beckham is charged with not only improving the galaxys disappointing start to the season but also elevating the sport in the united states to a new level and is wisely playing down expectations " writes matt hughes in the times of london "im not silly enough to think im going to change the whole culture because its not going to happen but i do have a belief that soccer can go to a different level " beckham said "id love to be a part of that its about me being the ambassador for mls the expectations are the one thing im worried about because people probably do think theyre going to see me turn out and well win our first game " but denise winterman writing in bbc news magazine wonders if beckham who she says is "a class apart in talent pay and fame " can ever really be part of the l a galaxy which is "languishing second from bottom" in its division "its a position the club has found itself in with disappointing regularity in recent years " she says "however its fortunes might just be about to change as its new signing is david beckham " then again maybe not ms winterman asks if it is possible to build a successful team from "one global superstar and a squad of relative unknowns " she says the "contrasts are stark " with beckham reportedly earning times that of some of hits teammates he has also captained england in the world cup and counts tom cruise as a close personal friend his wife victoria is gal pals with katie holmes the telegraphs catherine elsworth tells the beckhams what they need to know about their new and now permanent home "by now they have probably had enough snapshots of life in the city of angels to think they know what they are getting into but los angeles is about as different to life in manchester or buckinghamshire as can be imagined and not just in terms of annual rainfall it is also culturally a universe away from madrid just when you think youve mastered the cliched oddities of los angeles the city throws you another curveball be it cultural linguistic or meteorological " its a slow time for professional sports with the nba season over and nfl season yet to begin of course theres major league baseball but the teams are just coming off their break for the all star game so what will the second half the baseball season hold well the big event overshadowing nearly everything else although the phillies are only one game away from being the first team to drop games is barry bonds breaking hank aarons all time home run record of hes five homers away from doing just that and the san francisco giants play the l a dodgers friday the big question is whether or not mlb commissioner bud selig will be there to see it when the record falls see the aps second half roundup for some perspective lee jenkins of the new york times harkens back to feb when selig was in san francisco to award the city the all star game and he stood outside the stadium talking about the steroid scandal and bonds who had home runs at the time and wouldnt say if hed even play long enough to break aarons long standing record "and yet on that day more than two years ago all the elements for a firestorm were put into place bonds steroids and the record linked at baseballs premier exhibition " mr jenkins writes "as awkward moments go bonds should set the standard when he hits five more home runs and passes hank aaron on the career list but he gave a dress rehearsal tuesday night jogging onto the field at at&amp t park as the face of the all star game " in a column sure to spark some controversy msnbc contributor bryan burwell says a "drug cheat" like bonds shouldnt receive blind support from the black community just because hes black "nothing is simple as it used to be with barry bonds not the hatred or the love not the villainy or the celebrity " writes mr burwell "as he edges closer and closer to erasing one of the most iconic numbers in american sports somehow everything that used to seem so obvious about baseballs most polarizing figure good versus evil right vs wrong has been blurred beyond recognition " dont worry though barry bonds wont be "the custodian of baseballs holy grail of records for very long " according to bill madden of the new york daily news he says for those who "cant stand the thought of celebrating bonds as baseballs all time home run king" it will only be for about six or seven years "or around the time the surly sultan first becomes eligible for the hall of fame and then the crown will pass to alex rodriguez " mr madden doesnt think a rod who is six homers away from the club will still be with yankees though the team is reportedly interested in keeping him but it will cost them as he looks to become baseballs first &# million a year player regardless of where he is a rods quest for the home run record wont carry the same baggage as bonds "rodriguez is bonds but without an asterisk and steroids controversy attached to his wristbands" says gene wojciechowski on espn com "at least thats the hope " tip of the fix cap to reader don hartline write to worth civils at worth civils wsj com
