may have to agree to the deals that information is important for shareholders who must vote to approve them the court ruled the rulings require both companies to disclose additional information the decisions could slow the pace of some transactions said robert thompson a corporate law professor at vanderbilt university "if you give incomplete information to shareholders the court will hold up your deal or worse make you go back to the drawing board and redo it " because the majority of large public companies are incorporated in delaware the five judge court of chancery is an influential forum for litigating corporate governance issues and takeover disputes there are no juries in the cases the author of both opinions year old vice chancellor leo e strine jr is a colorful figure who has emerged as something of a public face of the court he has also been an important advocate for shareholder rights on the court "his opinions carry a lot of weight " says francis pileggi a partner at fox rothschild llp in wilmington who has known mr strine since when mr pileggi was running for state representative in delaware in the case of lear an auto parts maker that billionaire financier carl icahn is seeking to buy for &# billion mr strine faulted the companys board for letting chief executive robert e rossiter negotiate the deal with mr icahn on his own he also said shareholders should have been told more about an issue involving mr rossiters pension that could give him an incentive that other stockholders didnt share to favor the deal in the case of topps mr strine ruled that the trading card company should have been more forthcoming about an agreement with the suitor to retain toppss management in another ruling in march aimed at protecting shareholders in private

rising complaints and more lawsuits criticizing buyout deals for allegedly enriching corporate executives at the expense of the shareholders the leverage buyout boom has run into other head winds recently congress is threatening to raise taxes on private equity firms and their executives meanwhile credit investors until recently eager to finance buyout activity are also tightening their purse strings some recent shareholder protests have succeeded in forcing companies to go back and secure higher prices from private equity firms that agreed to buy them clear channel communications inc for

for and won richer buyout offers some boards appear to have been altering their behavior even before the rulings the board of cablevision systems inc waited more than a year before accepting the third offer made by the dolan family for the new york media company this year some shareholders still criticize the &# billion proposal as too low in recent weeks several major law firms have alerted their corporate clients to the delaware rulings saying that boards need to be more attuned to the enhanced scrutiny of private equity deals wilson sonsini goodrich &amp rosati llp reminded boards to be candid with their shareholders "sometimes more than the literal truth may be required to be disclosed " the firm wrote in a so called client alert quoting the courts opinion the firm told the boards they need to "avoid making materially misleading disclosures which tell a distorted rendition of events or obscure material facts " the issues raised by mr strine differ from the legal concerns that emerged with the buyout boom of the s that era was marked by so called corporate raiders they offered shareholders rich premiums for their companies and vowed to remove existing management and boards in those deals delaware courts examined shareholder allegations that company management and boards had rejected rich hostile bids to keep their jobs in the current buyout craze many buyout firms retain the management by offering rich pay packages and a stake in the newly private entity these deals are being challenged in the courts by shareholders who allege that they are getting a meager payout for the company they say boards are accepting deals based on factors other than the best available price in addition shareholders are accusing boards of running into the friendly arms of private equity buyers to escape activist hedge funds who are trying to oust them through proxy battles in the case of topps the new york producer of trading cards collectibles and candy shareholders have accused the board of breaching its duties to get the highest price for the company when it agreed to a deal with a private equity consortium led by michael eisner the former walt disney co chief executive the lawsuit alleges that the board under pressure from an activist hedge fund viewed mr eisner as a friendly suitor who had pledged to retain management while the court found no fault in the boards decision to negotiate exclusively with mr eisner it criticized topps for the way in which it prevented a rival the upper deck co from launching a tender offer for the company the court issued an order postponing the shareholder vote on the deal until topps discloses the additional information to shareholders this week topps said that its shareholders should reject a tender offer upper deck ended up making but that it would continue talking with its rival to reach agreement on a higher price "when directors bias the process against one bidder and toward another not in a reasoned effort to maximize advantage for the stockholders but to tilt the process toward the bidder more likely to continue current management they commit a breach of fiduciary duty " mr strine warned in his topps opinion
