readback a bit of english humor our columnist grins while reading two titles from jerome k jerome online edition i rarely bother browsing the humor sections of american bookstores even though i love funny books with a few exceptions christopher buckley bill bryson carl hiaasen american humorists tend to target the juvenile and juvenile at heart fortunately the english take humor more seriously for one thing they keep old humor in print two of my earlier english favorites were "the diary of a nobody" by george and weedon grossmith and "the diary of a provincial lady" by e m delafield small novels about ordinary people who are unwittingly hilarious this week as i read jerome k jeromes "three men in a boat" and "three men on the bummel " i kept noticing i was grinning thank you penguin classics "three men in a boat " published in is neatly summarized by its title three young english men j george and harris take a vacation together rowing and towing a boat up the thames naturally they have many mishaps and run into sometimes literally other oddball boaters and tourists to ensure maximum mayhem j brings his dog montmorency noting matter of factly that "fox terriers are born with about four times as much original sin in them as other dogs are " mr jerome also digresses from the journey with shameless abandon "there is an iron scolds bridle in walton church " he noted "they used those things in ancient days for curbing womens tongues i suppose iron was getting scarce and nothing else would be strong enough " elsewhere he meditates on the agility of cats "i have known crack shots winners of queens prizes shoot with shotguns at cats yards away and never hit a hair i have often thought that instead of bulls eyes running deer and that rubbish the really superior marksman would be he who could boast that he had shot the cat " there are a few patches of syrupy writing that need to be skimmed over but then you get to something like harriss diatribe against people who had privatized bits of the thames stretching chains across streams and posting no trespassing signs wild with rage harris "not only wanted to kill the man who caused the sign to be put up but also he would like to slaughter the whole of his family and all his friends and relations and then burn down his house " then harris said he would go "and sing comic songs on the ruins " maybe because mr jerome earned his living as a journalist for several years his prose is compact and respectful of the readers time "there will be no descriptions of towns no historical reminiscences no architecture no morals " mr jerome writes in "three men on the bummel " "lastly in this book there will be no scenery this is not laziness on my part it is self control " j defines a bummel as "a journey long or short" that has to be taken within a finite period of time in this case the original three men now a decade older and several stones heavier take a bicycle tour of germany although theres no room for the dog many animals make cameo appearances here j s humor takes a darker turn as he studies the german people and "their blind obedience to everything in buttons " if a german "can find a police notice on a tree forbidding him to do something or other that gives him an extra sense of comfort and security " later he writes "from what i have observed of the german character i should not be surprised to hear that when a man in germany is condemned to death he is given a piece of rope and told to go home and hang himself " but he is also appalled at other english tourists he observes in germany "the englishman unable or unwilling to learn a single word of any language but his own travels purse in hand to every corner of the continent the english speaking man stands amid the strangers and jingles his gold here he cries is payment for all such as can speak english " is mr jerome relevant today i say yes visiting reading about miles west of london he describes how the countrys lawyers and its parliament fleeing the plagues of th century london moved their operations to reading "it must have been worth while having a mere ordinary plague now and then in london to get rid of both the lawyers and the parliament " he sensibly concluded write to cynthia crossen at cynthia crossen wsj com
