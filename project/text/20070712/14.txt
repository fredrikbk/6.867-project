big telecom operators fear breakup by eu brussels moves by the european unions top telecommunications official to take control of national regulatory powers are raising concerns among the continents biggest telecom operators who fear their operations may be broken up over the past year commissioner viviane reding has said in several speeches that she plans to propose an overhaul of the eus telecom regulations in october she has said she wants to take over some of the regulatory powers held by national governments and that some national operators should be split up to create more competition in the industry ms reding has long argued that europes largest telecom companies such as france telecom sa and deutsche telekom ag are using their control over existing telecom infrastructure to stifle competition from new entrants her aides say she would like to see breakups in the french polish slovak romanian greek bulgarian and irish markets where competition in broadband internet service is too weak for her liking some national telecom operators are resisting these proposals arguing that investment in national networks and customer services will suffer if they go ahead the struggle comes amid increasing competition in europe to bring telephone internet and television services to consumers a new breed of companies has appeared to challenge europes biggest established telecom companies but the biggest telecom operators in europe most of them former state monopolies control what is known as the last mile of copper network into homes in most eu countries the clash illustrates the eus effort to implement u s style regulation and legislation to harmonize rules across the nation group in the face of resistance from powerful national companies and governments any changes that ms reding will propose will ultimately need to be approved by the governments of the member nations so national telecom operators are lobbying hard in brussels and in their local capitals to try to limit her overhaul plans ms reding has said she wants some national telecom operators to split their operations into two one unit to run and invest in the national telecom infrastructure and the second to offer customer services for that network in competition with other companies an idea known as functional separation disgruntled competitors argue that "functional separation" would make it easier for customers to shop around for their telecom services and would force dominant operators to be more transparent breakups would also ease regulators ability to scrutinize dominant operators and ensure that the fees they charge for network access are reasonable bundled packages for telecom services often lock customers into staying with their countrys dominant provider even if they are interested in switching europes newer operators complain dominant players also use opaque pricing to raise fees and squeeze the profit margins for competitors that are dependent on using their networks the new operators say france telecom is expected to be one of the companies ms reding would like to see split off what is known as its local loop infrastructure according to one of her top aides france telecom is unenthusiastic about the plan "we think functional separation is a false good idea it looks like a good idea but its not necessarily " the company said in a response to questions last month the company argues that a carve up would degrade the quality of the networks infrastructure because the separated unit in charge of running and granting access to the network would have less incentive to maintain high standards in a prepared statement yesterday deutsche telekom warned that a split of its operations could be so expensive that it would do more harm than good
