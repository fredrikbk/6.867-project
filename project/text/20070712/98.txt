politics &amp economics senate crafts climate bill washington congressional efforts to address climate change took a step forward with the introduction of a senate bill backed by republicans and democrats working with labor unions and major utilities to regulate carbon dioxide and other so called greenhouse gases the low carbon economy act would provide billions of dollars of aid and incentives to prod owners of coal fired power plants to reduce their carbon emissions it offers billions more for alaska other coastal states and the poor to deal with flooding and other damage as well as higher consumer costs that could result from global warming the regulatory mechanism centers on a cap and trade system of government issued co emissions allowances that utility owners petroleum refiners and other major producers and users of fossil fuels would be required to obtain it includes a feature popular with industry a "safety valve" that would prevent the trading price of such allowances from rising more than over the rate of inflation in any given year while the bill has the broadest consensus among a half dozen senate measures dealing with greenhouse gases sen jeff bingaman d n m chairman of the senate energy committee and the bills main author said a major push would be needed to pass it this year major environmental groups oppose the safety valve saying it is too easy on co emitters they and some democrats appear to think a stronger bill could emerge from the next congress if the democrats expand their majority and a democrat is elected president on the other end of the spectrum sen james inhofe r okla who has argued that climate change is a "hoax" and has threatened to filibuster co regulation said the measure would "needlessly" increase energy costs the bill modeled after a proposal developed over five years by the bipartisan national commission on energy policy would reduce co and other climate affecting emissions to levels by and to levels by it also provides what mr bingaman called "a suite of carrots and sticks" to encourage developing countries such as china and india to make similar cuts the price of allowances would start at &# per metric ton of carbon dioxide in and then increase initially most would be given away but would be sold by the government at auction which could generate &# billion to &# billion a year this money would be used for a variety of purposes including incentives for coal fired power plants to take early action to capture their co emissions and dispose of them through innovative technologies according to senate aides the bill would be self financing at first and later generate funds for the government the costs of the allowances that industry would be required to buy would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher bills for electricity fuel and products economists and a few lawmakers argue that a carbon tax would be cheaper and easier to regulate than cap and trade
