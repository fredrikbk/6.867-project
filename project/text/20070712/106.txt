surgeon corporal iraq aside the big political story of the week seems to be that richard carmona believes he was gagged if not bound by the bush administration during his tenure as surgeon general from dr carmona made his case before henry waxmans never sleeping house government reform and oversight committee on tuesday and most media outlets played it up at the beginning of his tenure as the countrys top doctor he "was still quite politically naive in the ways of the beltway " dr carmona said "as i witnessed partisanship and political manipulation i was astounded and unsure of what i was witnessing and whether this was the norm for all surgeons general " cue the ominous music we hate to ruin a political scandal but isnt this a tad overwrought as a story line lets assume that bush officials did tell him to keep mum on such issues as embryonic stem cell research and sex education this is what appointed officials of any administration are expected to do support the policies of an elected president if dr carmona really thinks that the surgeon general should be above politics "naive" is not the first adjective that comes to mind dr carmona says he was especially offended that his voice wasnt welcome on matters of "science " he misses a critical distinction science may inform policy but its no substitute for the political judgments that properly play a role in guiding public policy in the area of stem cells for instance there is no ban on debating the science only a question of whether and to what extent it should be publicly funded in any case dr carmona was not an indentured servant if he disagreed so profoundly with president bushs policy he could have resigned honorable people do it all the time and no one should take a job in washington unless he is prepared to resign to defend his principles that dr carmona failed to resign over so long a period suggests that his personal moral agony was rather less tortured than he now makes it seem alternatively the good doctor could have done what some of his predecessors chose to do speak up anyway and face the consequences such as being fired c everett koop did that on aids during the reagan administration and became a hero to the media establishment that had once dismissed him as an anti abortion zealot joycelyn elders also chose to use her pulpit to endorse creative sex education in public schools at least until the clinton administration asked her to resign either decision would have been more honorable than the one dr carmona chose to indulge which is to engage in a late hit on the president who appointed him and only now that he will pay no personal price and it is politically fashionable to do so see related letters "letters to the editor what do we want in a surgeon general a yes man or an advocate " wsj july
