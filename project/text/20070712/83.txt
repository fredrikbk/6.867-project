patent nonsense the u s patent system is beginning to show its age outpaced by the swift evolution of technology and commerce it increasingly favors speculators over innovators impeding innovation and economic growth fortunately the bipartisan "patent reform act of " introduced in both the house and senate would improve the process for granting patents and rebalance court rules and procedures to ensure fair treatment when patents wind up in litigation the senate judiciary committee will take up s today congress needs to pass this bill during this session as the need for reform is clear nationwide the number of patent lawsuits nearly tripled between and and the number of cases between and grew nearly until only one patent damages award exceeded &# million more than judgments and settlements were entered in the last five years and at least four topped &# million one recent decision topped &# billion the number of questionable loosely defined patents moreover is rising one company holds patents that it claims broadly cover current technologies that allow people to make phone calls over the internet another has staked a claim on streaming video over the internet generally and has pursued colleges for royalties on their distance learning programs in a five year old boy patented a method of swinging on a swing unfortunately under current law parties that want to innovate in areas covered by questionable patents have only two options both of them bad an ineffective rarely used re examination process or litigation the average cost of which is by some estimates &# million this impedes innovation as the ftc noted "one firms questionable patent may lead its competitor to forgo r&amp d in the areas that the patent improperly covers " the patent reform act would allow patents already issued to be reviewed either immediately after the patent is granted or later if a party can establish that significant economic harm may arise from the assertion of the patent this new procedure would help weed out bad patents and cut down on litigation as a first resort as it would allow for meaningful challenges to bad patents in the patent office which is best situated to evaluate the claims while some fear this will give patent infringers a tool to challenge patents they are infringing the patent reform act authorizes the director of the patent office to develop and enforce rules to prevent such abuse another area for reform is the standard for calculating damages many products are comprised of thousands of patented components but if one infringes just one patent on say a windshield wiper the patent holder can seek damages based on the value of the entire car to which that wiper is attached this threat of artificially high damages encourages litigation premature settlements and distorts the value of patents in addition a finding of "willfulness" which may trigger treble damages can result from a defendant merely being aware of a patent which the defendant in good faith believed was invalid to remedy these problems the patent reform act would establish a standard for calculating damages based on the actual value of the patented invention not the value of a whole product that has many other components unless the patent in question is predominantly responsible for the value of the product it would establish more rigorous standards for a finding of willfulness that would require actual bad faith on the part of a defendant make no mistake damages do run amok one recent example is the &# billion recently awarded to at&amp t in its case against microsoft regarding patent claims on mp technology how did the jury arrive at such a high number the award was based on the value of the pcs on which microsofts software was installed rather than on the value of the patented component in question such disproportionately sky high awards are not uncommon and they have a tangible adverse impact on both the prices consumers pay and the willingness of companies to take risks and bring innovative new products to market today a company that puts products into the stream of commerce can be sued for patent infringement virtually anywhere in the u s that the product is sold this encourages lawsuits in venues with little relationship to the actual alleged acts of infringement or the parties in the suit shell corporations have been established all over the country to take advantage of this loophole with patents being assigned to such corporations simply for the purpose of filing a suit for example one california based company aptly named plutus ip routinely transfers patents to shell corporations that it incorporates in remote jurisdictions it perceives as advantageous days before filing lawsuits earlier this year it incorporated one such shell corporation gemini ip in wisconsin just days before it filed a lawsuit there against a major california based networking company to get procedural advantages even though no known witnesses or documents relevant to the case were located in wisconsin to address this abuse amendments to the patent reform act would require that cases are brought in venues that have a reasonable connection to the infringement claim where either party resides or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular place of business the u s supreme court has taken four patent cases over the past year an astonishingly high number and in all four of those cases it decisively ruled in favor of those advocating reform "gobbledygook " "worse than meaningless" and "retards progress" are just a few phrases used by justices recently to describe some key patent standards the patent reform act of responds to the need for comprehensive patent reform that protects the rights of inventors while eliminating the incentives that encourage speculators to game the system no good faith patent holder with a substantial claim of infringement would be denied his day in court or appropriate remedies for infringement the bill would benefit inventors consumers and businesses while maintaining faith in the "crown jewel" of americas
