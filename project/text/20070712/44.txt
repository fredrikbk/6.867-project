fiscally fit when it rains financially it pours a week of costly breakdowns highlights the need for emergency savings online edition my husband gerry and i were looking forward to a little freedom this fourth of july thanks to my mom volunteering to take our son gerald camping in the mountains for the week we packed up and headed for the boat and the day started out great until a sensor warned us the motor was overheating it signaled the beginning of an expensive week that drove home the importance of having emergency savings a rainy day fund isnt just for unexpected medical bills or replacing lost wages emergency savings can cover any unexpected large expense and this week we had a slew of them back on the boat we eventually limped back to the marina bought &# worth of engine parts and tried a quick repair but the alarm soon went off again disappointed we pulled the boat from the water for more extensive repairs after consulting with my cousin brian who used to repair motors for a living gerry ordered the parts necessary to fix the motors cooling system another &# still we told ourselves it could have been a lot worse if gerry didnt have mechanical skills and the boats problem was more serious those skills could come in handy brian said wed probably have had to pay at least &# to have someone else fix the cooling system until the parts come in the boats dry docked two days later i noticed our homes central air system didnt seem to be cooling the air gerry found ice forming on the condenser shut the unit down and called his brother brian who used to install residential heating and air conditioning systems yes my familys thick with geralds and brians brian gave us the bad news the condensing unit is just about shot the system is more than years old and it was too small for our home in the first place brian said adding that the extra effort it took to keep the house cool likely shortened the units lifespan the guys are planning on installing the new system themselves in the fall when its cooler if the unit can make it through the next two months the cost about &# for the larger unit and parts brian estimates again wed pay double that amount to have a service install it so were saving money but the weeks wasnt over and we were already &# in the hole bad news came in threes the braking system on gerrys honda started acting up last saturday and after looking over the problem he said it would be a big job one he wasnt thrilled about taking on in our driveway in the middle of summer so we decided to outsource that repair to the tune of &# in less than half a week we were looking at being out roughly &# i griped about the costly repairs with my friend bridget telling her wed pay for them out of our emergency savings bridget just shook her head shes single and rents an apartment so the idea of having a large stash of cash to cover financial emergencies is foreign to her shed been diligently saving for retirement but figured emergency savings accounts were for people with homes bridget joked that the biggest financial crisis she ever faced was an expensive car repair and "thats what credit cards are for " i didnt worry about having an emergency savings account when i was single in fact i was seriously in the hole with student and auto loans and credit card debt it was only after gerry bought his first home when we were years old that i realized the need to have a substantial amount of savings set to cover emergencies a few years after gerry bought our first home wed built our joint emergency savings account up to &# which we naively thought was more than enough to cover any financial catastrophe we deposited most of the money in a roth ira where we could potentially earn interest tax free into retirement if we never needed to tap the cash for an emergency and if we did need the money we could pull our contributions tax and penalty free as the years progressed we earned larger salaries and made sure to add to our savings our rainy day fund now hovers around &# less after a financially challenging week like the one weve just had nearly &# of the savings is still invested in the roth ira after we were no longer eligible to contribute due to income limits we invested the rest in taxable cds and a bond mutual fund with the introduction of high yielding savings accounts weve been moving away from locking money up in cds and putting the cash into a savings account that amount of cash should let us get by for a few months should a financial crisis hit with our &# home equity line of credit providing additional security should we need it our savings is roughly the minimum three to six months of household income financial planners generally recommend for emergency savings part of the reason planners push clients to have such a large stash of emergency cash is because most workers dont have enough disability insurance as this article explains almost three in of todays year olds will become disabled before age according to the social security administration but less than a third of workers at private companies have disability insurance the bureau of labor statistics says workers whose companies do provide disability insurance meanwhile may not realize how much of their income wouldnt be replaced in the event of injury or illness gerry and i have disability insurance through our companies it took gerry and me about a decade to put together our rainy day fund but is it reasonable to expect that everyone should have three months let alone six of income saved of course not depending on where you are in life other savings accounts and debts take priority younger workers often put off saving entirely because theyre struggling with student loan and credit card debt while older workers may have college bills and retirement accounts at the top of their saving priority list that said having little or no emergency savings is a recipe for disaster relying solely on home equity loans or lines of credit or worse credit cards to pull yourself out of a serious financial jam can devastate your finances for years to come particularly in an environment where interest rates are heading higher so instead of focusing on the seemingly insurmountable goal of amassing three months salary take baby steps toward improving your financial security net open a high
