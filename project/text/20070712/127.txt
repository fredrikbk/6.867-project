whole foods is hot wild oats a dud so said rahodeb then again yahoo poster was a whole foods staffer the ceo to be precise in january someone using the name "rahodeb" went online to a yahoo stock market forum and posted this opinion no company would want to buy wild oats markets inc a natural foods grocer at its price then of about &# a share "would whole foods buy oats " rahodeb asked using wild oats stock symbol "almost surely not at current prices what would they gain oats locations are too small " rahodeb speculated that wild oats eventually would be sold after sliding into bankruptcy or when its stock fell below &# a month later rahodeb wrote that wild oats management "clearly doesnt know what it is doing oats has no value and no future " the comments were typical of banter on internet message boards for stocks but the writers identity was anything but rahodeb was an online pseudonym of john mackey co founder and chief executive of whole foods market inc earlier this year his company agreed to buy wild oats for &# million or &# a share for about eight years until last august the company confirms mr mackey posted numerous messages on yahoo finance stock forums as rahodeb its an anagram of deborah mr mackeys wifes name rahodeb cheered whole foods financial results trumpeted his gains on the stock and bashed wild oats rahodeb even defended mr mackeys haircut when another user poked fun at a photo in the annual report "i like mackeys haircut " rahodeb said "i think he looks cute " mr mackeys online alter ego came to light in a document made public late tuesday by the federal trade commission in its lawsuit seeking to block the wild oats takeover on antitrust grounds submitted under seal when the suit was filed in june the filing included a quotation from the yahoo site an ftc footnote said "as here mr mackey often posted to internet sites pseudonymously often using the name rahodeb " after the wall street journal contacted whole foods yesterday the company said in a statement that among millions of documents it gave the ftc were postings its ceo made from to "under an alias to avoid having his comments associated with the company and to avoid others placing too much emphasis on his remarks " the statement said "many of the opinions expressed in these postings now have far less relevance than when they were written " whole foods didnt confirm every rahodeb posting as being from mr mackey mr mackey declined to be interviewed but he soon posted on the company web site saying that the ftc was quoting rahodeb "to embarrass both me and whole foods " he also said "i posted on yahoo under a pseudonym because i had fun doing it many people post on bulletin boards using pseudonyms " he said that "i never intended any of those postings to be identified with me " mr mackeys post continued "the views articulated by rahodeb sometimes represent what i actually believed and sometimes they didnt sometimes i simply played devils advocate for the sheer fun of arguing anyone who knows me realizes that i frequently do this in person too " like whole foods itself mr mackey a year old vegan is somewhat unconventional he dropped out of college and worked at a natural foods store before co founding whole foods in austin texas in he and his wife practice yoga and meditation and own a acre ranch west of austin he once took a sabbatical to hike the appalachian trail he built whole foods in part by acquiring many smaller chains in january he slashed his salary to &# saying "this is what my heart is telling me is the appropriate thing to do right now " whole foods agreed this february to acquire wild oats of boulder colo the ftc sued in federal court in washington to block the deal saying it would reduce competition the agency is trying to use mr mackeys own words against him its suit quotes the ceo as telling other board members the takeover would enable whole foods "to avoid nasty price wars" and reduce the risk that a big conventional grocer would create a competitor to whole foods when that part of the suit became public mr mackey fired back with a word treatise on his blog on the whole foods web site he accused the government of "bullying tactics " failing to do its homework and taking out of context "macho posturing" by executives thats common rahodeb had begun posting on yahoo finance in the late s and quickly became known as a cheerleader for whole foods stock "i admit to my bias " he wrote in "i love the company and im in for the long haul i shop at whole foods i own a great deal of its stock im aligned with the mission and values of the company is there something wrong with this " rahodeb expressed pride in the ceos work "while im not a mackey groupie " he wrote in "i do admire what the man has accomplished " by whole foods &# billion in annual sales made it the leading player in natural and organic foods in january of that year with the stock at a split adjusted price of about &# rahodeb predicted great things " years from now whole foods will be a &# + stock before splits " the stock closed yesterday at &# for an executive to use a pseudonym to praise his company and stock "isnt per se unlawful but its dicey " said harvey pitt a former securities and exchange commission chairman told of the mackey posts mr pitt said "its clear that he is trying to influence peoples views and the stock price and if anything is inaccurate or selectively disclosed he would indeed be violating the law " he added that "at a minimum its bizarre and ill advised even if it isnt illegal " a spokeswoman for whole foods said mr mackey only revealed information about whole foods that already was public knowledge his comments "werent illegal" and werent "against company policy " she said rahodeb sometimes sparred with other users "your quarterly cash flow variance isnt statistically meaningful because the time period is too short " he told a user who criticized whole foods in march rahodeb then pasted a summary of the previous six years of the companys operating cash flow saying that over five years it "has increased " when it came to rival wild oats rahodeb didnt pull punches he often criticized perry odak who resigned as wild oats ceo last year "while odak was trying to figure out the business and conducting expensive research studies to help him figure things out whole foods was signing and opening large stores in oats territories " rahodeb wrote in "odak drove off most of the long term oats natural foods managers " reached yesterday mr odak said he had no idea mr mackey was behind the postings but "it doesnt surprise me " sometimes when rahodeb went without posting for several weeks other users expressed concern once rahodeb reassured them he was keeping abreast of the chat last august rahodeb filed his last post on the yahoo message board he said he had lost a bet with "hubris" about whole foods stock performance and the bets terms required that he quit posting he blamed the whims of the stock market for a decline in the companys shares "whole foods itself has a very bright future and i will continue to hold my stock for a very long time " he wrote "ive enjoyed my eight years on this board but all things must come to an end i wish everyone the very best hog keep the faith liberfar good luck with your market timing game hubris take your profits while you can "
