home &amp family cranky consumer going to the mall for an eye checkup seeing optometrists at five big stores a &# retinal scan special to the wsj if you get your eyes examined at the mall should you get your head examined too we never wore glasses but when our eyesight started to weaken we sought out professional help waiting for an appointment with a local ophthalmologist took months though and once there we spent more time with a technician than with the doctor we wondered why a healthy year old woman with no history of eye disease couldnt be adequately served by an optometrist while running errands at the mall we visited five randomly selected mall based optometrists to find out they were all independent practitioners but worked either inside or directly next door to a national eyewear chain or large retailer with an optical department americans spent &# billion on eye exams during the months ending in march a increase over the same period last year according to the vision council of america in alexandria va patients received nearly million exams about a third of which were conducted at eyewear chains or mass retailers optometrists and ophthalmologists generally provide many of the same services such as conducting eye exams writing eyeglass prescriptions and diagnosing eye diseases optometrists who undergo four years of post graduate training cant perform surgery but can prescribe basic eye treatment medications in many states they also manage eye diseases and diagnose related systemic problems that can appear within the eye such as hypertension according to the american optometric association ophthalmologists who are medical doctors and also perform surgery have more clinical training and experience with recognizing systemic problems and managing complex eye diseases such as severe glaucoma according to david parke president elect of the american academy of ophthalmology we learned that retail based optometry services were appropriate for our needs some of the optometrists we tested used more sophisticated equipment but all identified our basic problem we needed glasses the five eyeglass prescriptions we received were basically similar according to kerry beebe chairman of the clinical care group of the american optometric association and an optometrist in brainerd minn who reviewed them on our behalf we filled one of them and now see well the optometry services were so convenient appointments were available on the day we called that well schedule a check up annually perhaps visiting our ophthalmologist every three years well ask a friend to drive us so we can have our eyes dilated which makes seeing difficult our basic exams cost between &# and &# our optometrist at pearle vision as at the other practices we visited first assessed our vision with an autorefractor a computerized machine that assesses visual acuity by determining how the eye processes light and suggests a baseline eyeglass prescription we then read eye charts as he shone light in our eyes he asked questions about the clarity of different lens combinations as we looked through the phoroptor an instrument that helps determine the strength of eyeglass prescriptions we needed reading glasses he said he explained the purpose of other machines including the slit lamp a microscope that helps optometrists detect eye conditions such as cataracts and corneal disorders he tested for glaucoma using an "air puff" test which measures the eyes fluid pressure by its resistance to a mechanical puff of air as all the practitioners we visited did he offered dilation which provides an optimal view of the retina and optic nerve where tumors may be visible but we skipped it due to time constraints and concerns about driving instead he looked inside our eyes with an ophthalmoscope a lighted instrument that doctors use to examine the retina a wal mart vision center in a free standing store was pleasantly clean and uncrowded our optometrist knew we needed glasses when the autorefractor printed out a general prescription we answered questions about the appearance of lines on an eye chart and lens combinations that improved our vision he used the slit lamp and conducted the air puff test he said were farsighted but also detected a slight distance problem he recommended reading glasses but also suggested progressive lenses which we could wear all day for reading and distance our sears optical optometrist tested for glaucoma by placing numbing drops in our eyes and then measured pressure with an instrument that barely touched the fronts of our eyes she said we had presbyopia a condition that often begins at midlife in which the eyes lenses become less flexible and cant focus effectively causing eyestrain she detected a distance problem in addition to farsightedness and suggested progressive lenses dilating our eyes would take minutes she said we couldnt wait so she used an ophthalmoscope instead we booked our appointment at cohens fashion optical on the internet our personable optometrist conducted the same tests using the more comfortable air puff test for glaucoma instead of the drops and also concluded that we needed reading glasses and slight distance correction he suggested bifocals which combine two types of vision correction in one lens separated by a line theyre different from progressive lenses which dont have lines and blend the different corrections the optometry practice at lenscrafters was the most expensive &# for a standard exam but offered more services than the others we paid &# extra for optomap a computerized retinal scan that provides a wide view digital image of the retina quantifeye a risk assessment for macular degeneration was available for &# the disease caused by the breakdown of the central retina can ultimately lead to blindness our optometrist reached the same conclusions about our vision as others in our test he suggested we begin with reading glasses but wrote a progressive prescription just in case were already tired of taking our reading glasses on and off well switch to progressive lenses sooner than we thought write to cranky wsj com store independent practitioner
