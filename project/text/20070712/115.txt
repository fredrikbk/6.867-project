the true politics of the paranoid style camelot and the cultural revolution by james piereson encounter books pages &# inherit the wind" is running on broadway again night after night pitting the righteously rational clarence darrow against the bible thumping antievolutionist william jennings bryan the play a chestnut of high school english courses across the country concerns the scopes "monkey trial" of and is meant to capture the moment in american history when science and reason superseded at last the myth and superstition of foolish reactionaries it has become something of a liberal sacrament but as james piereson shows in "camelot and the cultural revolution " myth and superstition were the essence of the liberal response to john f kennedys assassination in november it was the liberals who threw evidence and reason to the winds inheriting the crippling effects of their own bad judgment mr piereson is not concerned with showing yet again that yes in defiance of all conspiracy theories lee harvey oswald was the lone gunman on that fateful day "camelot and the cultural revolution " mr piereson explains is less about "the assassination itself than the political reaction to it and the lasting consequences of that reaction " it is one of the best accounts we have of why liberalism which "owned the future" in fell from grace and has yet to recover during his presidency kennedy had repeatedly criticized the irrationalism of far right wing anticommunists and their segregationist cousins it was a turbulent time lest we forget in april the police in birmingham ala had set dogs upon peaceful civil rights marchers and in june segregationists in mississippi assassinated naacp leader medgar evers in october protesters in dallas had harassed adlai stevenson kennedys united nations ambassador dallas was a notoriously segregated city and the john birch society whose members thought president eisenhower had been under communist sway were a part of the citys political culture the societys dallas leader was gen edwin walker whom oswald had tried to kill in april by shooting at him through a window in his home oswald just missed thus when kennedy was shot on nov it was widely assumed that his killer was the kind of hate filled reactionary who believed kennedy to be selling out america to soviet communism and to be showing too little resistance to the civil rights movement such an assumption was buttressed by the great liberal intellectuals of the s such as richard hofstadter and daniel bell whose writings had attempted to show that segregationists and the followers of joe mccarthy with their "paranoid style" of politics in hofstadters phrase were insecure backward looking extremists who threatened americas bright future in the minds of liberals then kennedys killer should have been a right wing fanatic but he wasnt oswald was a man of the hard left he had defected to the soviet union when he found that country too bureaucratic he returned to america and began proselytizing for fidel castro and his supposedly new brand of the third world revolution nor was oswald an irrational discontented dostoevskian loner as some depicted him he was in fact a joiner of movements and something of a self defined intellectual who thought that his mixture of marxism and anarchism made him smarter and more sophisticated than his frivolous peers jackie kennedy was distraught at the nature of oswalds political identity her husband she said "didnt even have the satisfaction of being killed for civil rights it had to be some silly little communist it even robs his death of meaning " but not for long as mr piereson explains jackie carefully planned jfks funeral to resemble that of abraham lincoln the staging was such a success that for many kennedy came to be seen as a martyr to civil rights the kennedy legend began to take hold jackies impulse may have been self regarding but it also served the countrys need to end segregation more problematic was the argument of james reston the influential new york times columnist who just after the assassination argued in a column called "a portion of guilt for all" that kennedy had been crucified on the altar of american violence brushing aside the evidence he insisted that "all of us had a part in the slaying of the president " this claim was but a step from what became the standard issue s argument that american was a "sick society " but reston was the soul of reason compared with the conspiracy theorists who laid the assassination at the feet of a shadowy business cabal or the cia or even foreshadowing oliver stone lyndon johnson it turned out that the paranoid style described by hofstadter was equally a property of the left and the right mr pieresons own argument is persuasive and well presented but liberalism was never as reasonable as he assumes the irrationalism that exploded later in the s had been a component of left wing ideology well before herbert croly the liberal founder of the new republic magazine was drawn to mysticism in the s ex marxists fell over themselves in praise of wilhelm reich and "orgone box " hoping that sexual therapy might replace marxist theory as the toga of the enlightened and in the very early s a veritable cult of castro informed by franz fanons writings on the cleansing virtues of violence emerged among intellectuals searching for an alternative to middle class conventions its not reason that is at the heart of modern day liberalism but rather the claim to superior virtue and even more important to a special knowledge unavailable to the unwashed or unenlightened depending on the temper of the time such virtue and knowledge can derive disproportionately from scientism or mysticism or it can mix large dollops of both "camelot and the cultural revolution" lays bare the long ignored failure of intellect that hastened the decline of american liberalism if liberals can belatedly come to grips with their failure to acknowledge oswalds political identity they might be able to celebrate a revival that involves more than a broadway show mr siegel is a professor of history at the cooper union
