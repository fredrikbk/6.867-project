politics &amp economics bush pays rising price for gonzales washington the political price of sticking by an embattled alberto gonzales is getting higher for president bush now that an increasingly hostile democratic congress is using the attorney generals continued tenure as a cudgel to battle administration priorities key among those is legislation to update a major intelligence surveillance law both democrats and republicans agree it needs to be modernized but progress has been stalled because key lawmakers believe mr gonzales misled them about a separate surveillance program in addition mr gonzales was sidelined during the recent immigration debate in which he as the highest ranking hispanic in the administration had been expected to be a potent advocate there has been little movement to replace a half dozen senior justice department officials some of whom need confirmation from an unwelcoming senate and a new house bill aims to overturn justice department rules on how the agency deals with white collar criminal probes a move the administration was able to block last year the white house has cited the multiple congressional probes and hearings into the gonzales mess which dates back to how the department handled the firing of eight u s attorneys as a sign that democrats are playing partisan games instead of legislating but some republicans say the constant drip of information showing mr gonzales in a bad light may be too much to overcome "as these things mount and accumulate i think we may well get to the point where even the attorney general will see that his continued service is not in the national interest or the president will see that the attorney generals continued service is not in the national interest " said pennsylvania sen arlen specter the top republican on the senate judiciary committee at a hearing yesterday that was the closest mr specter has ventured to push for mr gonzaless resignation in an interview new york democratic sen charles schumer who has led the senate probe of the attorney firings added "the department cant function whether its the intelligence legislation or the vacancies that need to be filled as long as gonzales is there it is tainted " the attorney general suffered a fresh blow this week documents released through a freedom of information act lawsuit by a privacy rights group showed mr gonzales may have made misstatements in testimony to lawmakers regarding privacy violations by the federal bureau of investigation the justice department has said the attorney general technically didnt mislead congress in a written statement brian roehrkasse a department spokesman said "the attorney general has demonstrated he can be very effective based on the success of doj in the past years " he cited successes in fighting terrorism and public corruption and prosecuting immigration cases among other areas for now the heaviest toll from mr gonzaless troubles is falling on one of the administrations top national security goals an update of the foreign intelligence surveillance act the law that regulates the governments eavesdropping activities overseas with mr gonzales sidelined michael mcconnell the director of national intelligence has led the push to modernize fisa arguing that the law as it was written nearly three decades ago didnt account for changes in technology such as the growth of cellphones and the internet as a result investigators have to seek special permission from a secret intelligence court to perform what they consider routine surveillance of overseas terrorism suspects senate democrats and some republicans have stopped movement on the fisa bill until the administration provides details of a post secret surveillance program approved by mr bush the administration initially created the warrantless wiretapping program called the terrorist surveillance program outside the fisa law arguing that the intelligence law was outdated and cumbersome earlier this year it agreed to submit the program to the jurisdiction of a secret court that administers fisa democratic sen jay rockefeller of west virginia the chairman of the senate intelligence committee has been pushing for a deal that would break the deadlock he wants to allow the administration to give senators some of the information they seek about the warrantless program but with mr schumer and other judiciary committee members in a pitched battle with the white house over the gonzales investigation such a compromise has been difficult to broker the bill requires approval of both the judiciary and intelligence committees sen kit bond of missouri the top republican on the intelligence panel is supporting the democrats up to a point he said he has "joined with sen rockefeller in asking for additional documents pertinent to our examination of fisa " specifically what the president did to approve the warrantless wiretapping program mr bond however said he doesnt support democrats demands to see details about the justice departments deliberations and advice to the president on the surveillance program tony fratto a white house spokesman said of the fisa bill "we hope the democrats in congress are not looking for convenient excuses to avoid improving this important law " for civil liberties advocates the attorney generals reduced standing could help some of their causes the american civil liberties union is among several organizations pushing congress to undo some justice department guidelines governing how aggressive prosecutors can be in corporate fraud investigations the guidelines under the so called mcnulty memorandum released in december reined in prosecutors ability to push companies under investigation to break with implicated executives the aclu and prominent business groups say it didnt go far enough to protect attorney client privileges a new house bill which has democratic and republican support could be introduced as soon as today and would seek to reinforce attorney client rights undoing some of the rules in the mcnulty memo
