rio tinto nears deal to acquire alcan of canada bid of about &# billion would thwart alcoa consolidation pressure rio tinto was last night in the closing stages of a deal to purchase canadian aluminum giant alcan inc to help the canadian aluminum giant stave off a hostile bid from alcoa inc according to people familiar with the transaction a final deal should be announced early today these people said and was expected to carry an all cash price tag approaching &# a share valuing the deal at about &# billion alcan shares traded yesterday at &# in p m new york stock exchange composite trading a rio tinto acquisition of alcan which had sought to thwart a &# billion hostile takeover offer from u s rival alcoa would mark one of the biggest deals yet in the four year old commodities boom it would also raise questions about the next step for alcoa which faces competition from growing western mining giants and markets like russia where rivals enjoy significant cost advantages and it puts alcoa on the defensive either forcing it to wade into an expensive bidding war or seek another partner in this rapidly consolidating industry it would also mark an aggressive coming out party for london based rio tinto which has long been viewed as among the most conservative of the big global miners and among the least likely to attempt a deal like this but the climate has changed as companies figure out what to do with money made in the commodities boom the company like its larger rival bhp billiton ltd of australia has a new chief executive combined rio tinto and alcoa would have reported &# billion in revenue and some &# billion in cash flow during stewart spector a new york and florida based analyst who publishes the spector report says the deals are getting too expensive "these people have delusions of what they think these companies are worth if someone bids &# for alcan i dont know how they would make the cost of capital " he said noting that alcan has had meager returns historically "commodities are going through a cycle " rio tinto has been feeling pressure to make the right strategic moves for most of the current commodity boom it has been one of the giants on the block but that is changing as other players consolidate and grow in size brazils companhia vale do rio doce for example has propelled itself into the top ranks as the worlds largest iron ore mining company it has also expanded with acquisitions including the purchase last year of leading canadian nickel miner inco xstrata is another large miner that is growing aggressively through acquisitions and pressuring bhp and rio tinto but a major league acquisition for alcan creates several challenges for rio tinto pushing it into possibly uncomfortable territory "they are very smart people they have been very cautious " said wayne atwell formerly a metals analyst at morgan stanley and now starting his own investment firm "they tend to try to buy long life reserves at low costs " in a key measure under the merger plans being finalized last night rio tinto received a commitment from alcan to divest itself of its packaging business in addition the combined company would maintain three operational locations with engineered products run from alcans home territory of montreal rio tintos bauxite and alumina operations run in brisbane australia and research and development units in both montreal and france after the deal closes rio tinto is expected to review its entire asset portfolio people familiar with the matter said suggesting that select divestitures are part of the plan rio tinto expects &# million of costs savings people familiar with the deal said boards for both alcan and rio tinto have approved the transaction these people said alcoa spokesman kevin lowery said his company has a strategy to respond to a rival bid but wouldnt elaborate on whether it would boost its bid or seek other partners "we have thought a lot of things through " he said alcoas bid for alcan was in part viewed as a defensive move in response to last years merger of russias oao rusal and sual some industry analysts said the already consolidated aluminum industry means that few smart acquisitions are left and some bidders may consider paying more for either alcan or alcoa "in this game of musical chairs there are fewer and fewer chairs if you are trying to reposition yourself there are not so many options left " said mr atwell the move for rio tinto could also help it diversify its material assets hedging that aluminum prices and demand may remain strong even if iron ore prices recede at present the company has capacity to make only metric tons of aluminum a year buying alcan would give it million metric tons of aluminum a year that could make sense say some analysts if commodities have reached a peak but aluminum has less distance to fall than other materials "one of the things that attracts people to aluminum is that it hasnt had the big runup that copper has had " said chuck bradford a new york based metals analyst with bradford research soleil inc "historically the two trade together id rather place my bets on the product that hasnt had the big run rather than on the product that has " aluminum companies cite bullish expectations that aluminum production may double by to million metric tons of production with much of it driven by consumption in china according to some aluminum company estimates steel production has been growing rapidly in recent years causing iron ore prices to increase and creating huge profits for rio tinto and other iron ore miners but many note that iron ore price increases have started slowing and could start coming back down rio tinto is likely to sell off some of alcans assets that manufacture parts for the aerospace automobile and other industries and to focus on keeping and developing the bauxite mines alumina refineries and low cost hydropowered smelters that alcan owns experts suggest that private equity players could likely get involved buying and turning around some of alcans so called "downstream" manufacturing assets the deal could reignite the game of leapfrog in the mining and aluminum industries as it vaunts rio tinto atop the heap of the global miners and leaves bhp billiton cvrd xstrata alcoa anglo american and others with an open dance card some companies may begin pursuing deals in order to keep up in the growth game as well as to avoid being swallowed by rivals alcoas bid for alcan came on the idea that the two companies needed to rejoin to create the largest aluminum company in the world as both were threatened by the growing russian company uc rusal as well as from companies building low cost aluminum smelters in china and the middle east alcoa and alcan once the same company were split up decades ago by court decisions because of antitrust concerns with a changing global industry alcoa has argued that it could mollify antitrust regulators in canada the u s europe and australia by divesting itself of assets it also promised to keep a company headquarters in montreal and expand operations in canada to appease canadian government and regulatory authorities some analysts expect alcoa to keep bidding for alcan because it has few other options "my guess is that if alcan gets a deal from someone else alcoa might step up " said mr bradford yesterday before rio tintos bid became public
