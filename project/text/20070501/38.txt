fords new ads take on rivals marketing executive hopes combative approach burnishes image ford motor co s new north american marketing chief hopes a more combative advertising strategy will put the companys vehicles back on americas shopping list barry engle who became general manager of ford division marketing in january is the latest in a string of executives to tackle fords slumping u s sales and diminished image sales of cars and light trucks bearing the ford brand name and its blue oval logo fell by last year and are down by for the first three months of this year ford brand sales in were one million vehicles behind the brands sales in "i want it to be cool to buy a ford again " mr engle says his tasks could be a formidable one chicago area resident scott young who had been a loyal ford customer for more than years says he has been turned off by bad experiences at dealers and quality problems he has had with ford vehicles he says he will likely buy a honda the next time he shops for a vehicle "i dont know what they could do to get me to change my mind " mr young said mr engles latest hook is a new ad campaign that kicks off today for fords the f pickup truck its best selling model and one of its most profitable one of the new commercials talks about safety and the f s five star crash test rating which takes a jab at the new toyota tundras four star rating the ad doesnt specifically name toyota but a ford engineer in the ad says "some of the others didnt do as well " "were getting out there to tell our story and ask the customers to judge for themselves " said ben poore fords truck marketing manager toyota motor corp spokesman bill kwong said the company is still studying the four star rating because internal test showed that the tundra deserved five stars sales for the f series this year are down through march but it is ahead of the new chevrolet silverado by about vehicle sales autodata corp says the f series has a significant lead over the tundra which toyota redesigned to be more competitive against the pickups of the big three but toyota is pushing to more than double sales in the segment the new f ad illustrates the more aggressive us versus brand x style that mr engle is pushing at ford after last years expensive bold moves campaign failed to arrest fords decline an online documentary which was part of the bold moves strategy and aimed at showing a company in the midst of a turnaround fizzled before the stated goal of episodes because of the intrusiveness of cameras in the workplace and two marketing executives who were architects of the bold moves campaign have left the company for another important product the edge small sport utility vehicle fords ad agency enlisted the help of playwright and director david mamet the ads boast that the vehicle is quieter than a lexus and quicker than a bmw mr engle acknowledged that companies usually avoid giving free advertising to rivals but he said the challenge ads are meant to "provoke people to try our products and making sure we are on the list " mr engle also said ford needs to face the fact that consumers are pitting the companys vehicles against those from honda motor co and toyota when choosing what to buy as a result he aimed at giving fords marketing a more confident tone that approach spawned the ford challenge advertising campaign which asks consumers to compare ford vehicles to their toughest competitors the first television print and online ads launched at the beginning of this year focused on the ford fusion midsize sedan the commercials showed consumers comparing the fusion favorably against a toyota camry and a honda accord both of which were mentioned by name honda spokesman sage marie said the ford ad serves as validation that the accord is a benchmark for the segment toyotas mr kwong said ford wasnt making an "apples to apples" comparison because the ad features an all wheel drive fusion compared with a front wheel drive camry at first the fusion got what ford insiders call the "launch and abandon" treatment as ads for the car largely disappeared several months after the vehicle hit showrooms after its october launch mr engle found that at the end of two thirds of consumers werent aware the fusion existed "in the past we gravitated disproportionately on our new stuff " but after ford renewed its push on the fusion with the ford challenge ads this year fusion sales accelerated up by almost in through march over a year earlier mr engle is using some of the lessons he learned as president of ford brazil five years ago ford faced product and marketing strategy problems there similar to those it faces now in the u s when mr engle took over the marketing position in north america he realized there was a lot more the marketing team could do with the fusion which was the market leader in south america mr engles next high profile project will be this summers relaunch of the sedan formerly known as the ford five hundred which will be renamed the taurus mr engle declined to discuss the campaign details because it was too early but he did say the five hundred was another great product that suffered from lack of awareness and appreciation
