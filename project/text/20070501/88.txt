the daily fix big shot bob strikes again sending the nuggets to defeat online edition if an nba playoff games on the line keep the ball away from robert horry the san antonio spurs erased a point deficit against the denver nuggets last night only to watch the nuggets get back within one on a steve blake footer that the officials first ruled a game tying trey thirty seconds to go ball to mr horry three pointer from the left corner good for a win and a lead in the series "hes been known to do that " deadpanned spurs coach gregg popovich indeed he has ask the orlando magic the philadelphia ers the portland trail blazers the sacramento kings or the detroit pistons about being gunned down by big shot bob in the playoffs mr horry for his part downplayed his latest heroics saying this three pointer wasnt even in his top five or "too much time on the clock " in the san antonio express news buck harvey writes of lessons learned to do so he goes back to the spurs playoff defeat in when don nelson trotted out a seemingly undersized golden state warriors lineup against larry browns spurs and exposed san antonio as less than the sum of its parts "working as spurs assistants then and not saying much were popovich and r c buford they would leave san antonio both going their own ways " mr harvey writes "and when they returned several years later they built a different kind of roster from jacque vaughn the consummate locker room guy to brent barry who could sit on the bench through most of this series before getting a chance in game to michael finley once a star and now happy to contribute to fab oberto who fits as seamlessly as manu ginobili has " in the rocky mountain news dave krieger is well aware of the difference between the two clubs and tries for a little perspective "the nuggets are a work in progress before they acquired allen iverson in december they were a young team built around carmelo anthony with a single veteran holdover in marcus camby when iverson arrived they found themselves with two veteran stars and a maturing anthony and nene hilario suddenly it was time to contend while those four main men were ready the rest of the roster was not the bench is still that of a young team not a playoff contender " the aforementioned mavericks will take the court tonight against golden state in desperate trouble they trail in the series and must win out to advance in situations like this columnists often pull out the "anticipatory farewell" and this one by randy galloway in the fort worth star telegram is a classic of the form "the basketball gods or nellie the golden state god are obviously speaking to us coming in loud and clear spreading the word that the gutless and the confused are again going to be on the wrong side of a historic nba postseason collapse " for a great take on the feud between mr nelson and mavs owner mark cuban read this from our print colleague peter waldman mr galloway may be composing goodbyes but in surveying big playoff upsets the san francisco chronicles bruce jenkins warns that golden states free ride is over "everything changes for the warriors now " he writes "scrappy outsiders no more they actually have something to lose as enviable as their position might be theyre about to face genuine pressure for the first time since the playoffs began " the fitzgerald pioneers of the class d georgia state league were getting blown out on the road in statesboro ga when a drunk crowd began hollering for the manager to "put in the batboy" and the manager obliged sending year old joe louis reliford shy of five feet and pounds up to pinch hit young mr reliford nearly delivered a hit then took right field where he threw a runner out going first to third and made a great catch that appearance makes him the youngest player in the history of professional baseball now add this to the mix this was mr reliford was black and his appearance broke the leagues color barrier and his great catch ended a statesboro pilots batters game hitting streak "them bleachers emptied " mr reliford tells jerry crowe of the los angeles times "can you imagine what i was feeling with all them white people coming straight toward me i caught that mans ball i wasnt supposed to be on the field and he was a white man man i was scared back then a lot of hangings and stuff like that was going on i wasnt too little to know about all of that " so what happened find out here the st louis cardinals returned to the baseball field yesterday for the first time since the death of reliever josh hancock in a car accident sunday and were beaten by the milwaukee brewers with jeff suppan ironically a key member of last years world champs pitching a complete game against them the loss understandably was almost inconsequential as they did five years ago when darryl kile and jack buck died during the same week the cardinals have a jersey hanging in their dugout and shock in their clubhouse cardinals manager tony la russa who had to call mr hancocks family just as he had to call mr kiles had noble words for his team telling them that "people are losing family and friends on a daily basis and they grieve and they go on with their lives and they get up and go to work and thats just the way it is and this team is not immune from that " noble worlds but things could get ugly in st louis while the citys police chief said no alcohol containers were found in mr hancocks vehicle stories about the young pitchers drinking are making the rounds that led mr la russa to take a pre emptive shot at the media warning the cardinals to be careful of "the insincerity of some media people " if alcohol did play a role in mr hancocks tragic death that will come out and should come out in its proper time the fix adds firmly for now cardinals fans are groping for perspective never easy when were jolted by a reminder that sports is after all not fantasy but part of real life and gets no exemption from lifes disappointments mistakes and sudden sickening grief on viva el birdos larry borowsky writes that "being a fan is largely about abandoning perspective you cant feel the weight of every life lost in the world in the country in your town you couldnt function if you did thats another reason we abandon perspective so enthusiastically for the sake of our sanity all of us baseball fans and non fans alike attribute great significance to endeavors that we know are truly insignificant but every once in a while we dont have the luxury as cardinal fans we feel like we knew josh hancock we feel like we know his teammates and friends the loss is a personal one its not an abstraction hence the jarring intrusion of perspective into a realm of our lives where very consciously we are trying to give perspective the slip " on deadspin will leitch a huge cards fan ponders the relationship fans have with athletes one he calls "as genuine as it is bizarre not a single day has gone by since opening day when hancock first appeared on the cardinals roster that he has not been on our mental radar we cheered him we cursed him we forgot about him we repeated the process he occupied a real place in our lives we did not know him and we were not particularly curious to do so if he got batters out he made us happy and that was enough his sudden departure shocking horrible insane makes us feel as if we have lost something that we never realized we had we cannot pretend to have known him or to understand the anguish of those who did we can only know that we have lost something small but real and hope and pray that those who lost more than that can find some sort of peace " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider
