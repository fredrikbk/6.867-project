in an email yesterday that he has "no interest in talking about don nelson anymore than any other former employee " in an email on sunday he wrote "if you take what nellie says as fact you will be wrong to say he conjures up folk tales would be an understatement the contract is the contract and the rest is up to the lawyers " mr nelsons lawyer john oconnor of san francisco who worked with "deep throat" mark felt of watergate fame in his unveiling in said mr nelson "truly feels very proud that he and mark built a great franchise in dallas together " mr oconnor said mr nelson "personally
