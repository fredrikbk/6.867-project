the middle seat southwest makes inroads at hubs airlines strategy bears fruit fares drop revenue rises in the past three years southwest airlines co has moved aggressively into big city hub airports launching flights into philadelphia denver pittsburgh and washington the shift in strategy appears to be working resulting in lower fares for customers and more revenue for southwest new data show that southwests growth in philadelphia pittsburgh and denver basically mirrors the rate at which the low fare airline grew in baltimore in the mid s one of the few times southwest moved into a so called fortress hub where a big airline had of all the passenger traffic fares have come down and incumbent airlines are losing domestic market share as southwest grows also at the same rate as what happened in baltimore in philadelphia for example southwest has grown to nearly of the domestic seats offered for sale there in its first three years from at its start in according to data compiled by eclat consulting in baltimore southwest went from to in the first three years at the same time us airways group inc fell from to of the market in baltimore and after three years of competing against southwest in philadelphia the drop is much the same for us airways from of domestic seats to according to eclat to be sure us airways and ual corp s united airlines are far better positioned to defend their prized turf today but the baltimore experience is sobering for hub carriers over years southwest and us airways switched positions in baltimore with the challenger growing to more than of the market and us airways falling to less than of the passengers for customers the battle yields lower fares and more choices "from a consumer perspective this is absolutely a good thing this makes us all better " said andrew nocella us airways senior vice president for schedule planning for southwest chief executive gary kellys big hub push is largely triggered by its own financial pressure the nations sixth largest airline finds itself with costs creeping higher and few new ways to cut expenses southwest didnt renegotiate labor contracts during the downturn and the labor cost advantage it had over other airlines has narrowed as competitors have grown more efficient with lower pay scales at the same time fuel hedges that mr kelly bought when oil was priced around &# a barrel and lower are slowly paying out still reaping billions of dollars for southwest but gradually forcing the company to buy more of its fuel at market prices around &# &# a barrel as a result mr kelly is trying to keep earnings growing by boosting revenue raising ticket prices looking for more ways to generate cash with its web site and venturing into big markets that the airline avoided in the past like bank robber willie sutton mr kelly is going where the money is "these are big markets but its really the same growth story weve had throughout our history " said laura wright southwests chief financial officer throughout its history southwest preferred secondary airports to fortress hubs to avoid direct battles with bigger airlines big hubs also can slow down an operation with lengthy delays driving costs higher so southwest grew in fort lauderdale not miami for example and avoided some cities altogether such as atlanta charlotte cincinnati denver minneapolis memphis and philadelphia now southwest is financially stronger than its competitors and big enough to withstanding costly turf battles when it saw other airlines reduce service at big hubs like philadelphia denver and pittsburgh southwest thought the time was right ms wright said travelers in philadelphia some angry at us airways for all of its operational problems and bankruptcy woes say they think southwest will do well "us air has a terrible reputation in this market anyone who can come in and shake up us air and give some competition will be well liked " said billy tullos a retiree on his way recently to tampa he noted that us airways at one time charged &# or more for a short hop to pittsburgh from philadelphia a trip southwest now prices at no more than &# domestic ticket prices dropped on average in the first six months that southwest served philadelphia according to the dots bureau of transportation statistics then rebounded higher by the fourth quarter of last year "its now a steady state environment that allows us to make money and i assume theyre making money too " said mr nocella of u s airways like many domestic airlines u s airways has been expanding international service adding flights to europe and the caribbean from philadelphia that doesnt mean us airways is running from a fight with southwest he said with lower costs stronger international connections and amenities southwest doesnt offer like reserved seats first class cabins airport clubs and a frequent flier program with international offerings us airways believes it can hold its own against southwest in philadelphia as it has in phoenix and las vegas "the world has changed a lot since baltimore " mr nocella said in denver southwests growth has been slower after months of service there and while united has lost domestic market share according to eclat frontier airlines holdings inc has held its own and even gained a bit itself frontier says it is adding flights to cities not served by southwest like memphis and vancouver and calgary in canada and experimenting with new service to mexico from cities other than denver such as sacramento and san jose calif to cabo san lucas and dallas to mazatlan "were trying to diversify and mexico is a great place to go " paul tate frontiers chief financial officer said at a recent meeting with investors "southwest has not shown interest there yet "
