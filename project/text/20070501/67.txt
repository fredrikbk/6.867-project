notes on a scandal meet dennis de tray in the summer of the university of chicago trained economist had his minutes of fame when as director of the world banks mission in indonesia he was called by this newspaper to account for the banks performance amid that countrys economic collapse after years and &# billion of loans to the suharto dictatorship it turned out that "world bank officials knew corruption in bank funded projects was common but never commissioned any broad reports tracking how much money was lost to it " according to journal reporters marcus brauchli and jay solomon why the relative indifference to the problem because as mr de tray explained at the time "there is a trade off between shall we say being pure and helping people " and also because "sometimes calling a spade a spade is not the best way" when it comes to confronting corruption had matters rested there mr de tray who still consults for the bank while working at the center for global development in washington d c might never again have had his role in the indonesian debacle reprised yet his name pops up as a signatory to a letter published on april in the financial times under the headline "for the good of the world bank paul wolfowitz should resign " the letter is meant as an indictment of the banks controversial president who may soon lose his job for a promotion and raise he authorized for his girlfriend world bank staffer shaha riza but look closer and what emerges from the letter is a testament to the hypocrisy or worse of mr wolfowitzs leading accusers in mr de trays case it may seem strange that a man who was willing to countenance the theft of the banks money by suharto &amp co as the inevitable price of "helping people" which people should now wax indignant about the damage mr wolfowitz has supposedly done to the banks "credibility as the international communitys trustee of resources for fighting poverty " in the words of the ft letter yet mr de tray is nothing if not consistent since leaving the bank last year he has publicly objected to the "puritan overtone in the current debate on corruption" and argued that suhartos corruption "created value for indonesia just as sam walton created value for the u s " comments that nicely capture the quality of economic analysis at the bank as well as the prevailing in house view regarding mr wolfowitzs anti corruption campaign now consider the case of shengman zhang a former no at the bank who is currently a vice chairman for the global banking division at citigroup mr zhang whose name appears third on the list of signatories is the husband of lingzhi xu a world bank employee who began her career as an assistant working in procurement issues a "level d" position with a "market reference point" of &# and was ultimately promoted to her current job a "level g g" high level staff position with a reference point of &# since mr zhang was a managing director of the bank his wifes employment presented significant similarities to the conflict of interest problem that required mr wolfowitz to seek a new job for ms riza yet it never seems to have raised an eyebrow within the banks management even more remarkable was the relative speed and ease of ms xus ascent "she did two things that are very unusual " says a world bank source who asked to remain anonymous for fear of career reprisals "first she moved from a staff assistant position to an analyst position generally thats very very difficult the technical requirements for the analyst position are usually quite specific its a promotion that needs to go to a sector board and there are question marks about the process that was followed in her case second two and a half years later she was promoted to senior procurement specialist by any bank timeline this is a very quick progression " mr zhang whose office did not return calls seeking comment may be under the impression that his wifes arrangements will go unnoticed and not just his a report prepared by the banks human resource department noted "there were couples with potential for supervision conflicts of interest between spouses " yet about these cases next to no corrective action has been taken according to bank insiders in a similar vein it has also gone mostly unnoticed that among the letters signatories is former hr vice president richard stern mr stern resigned from the bank in when his brother nicholas was appointed chief economist but only after coming under enormous pressure from the banks staff association at the time then bank president jim wolfensohn was inclined to wave off the staffs objections observing at a press conference that while "you cant have brothers and sisters working together at the bank as president you are entitled under article to run the business as you want and if you want to vary the rule you can " the list goes on much has been made of the fact that the raise mr wolfowitz accorded ms riza after his attempt to recuse himself was rejected by the ethics committee and after he was required to resolve the matter himself thereby forcing the very conflict of interest he had sought to avoid means she now earns more than condoleezza rices &# salary less noted is that no fewer than bank employees are at or above that pay grade hardly putting ms riza in an exclusive category by the standards of her peers much has also been said about the role of xavier coll the vice president for hr who is supposed to have allowed ms rizas raise and promotion without actually "approving" it bank insiders report that mr coll now goes about with a blue ribbon on his lapel a symbol of the staffs demands for mr wolfowitz to go how fashionable but if mr coll really believed the terms of ms rizas package violated bank rules he had a fiduciary responsibility to object and even resign that he did not says nothing about mr wolfowitz but everything about mr coll as this column goes to press its unclear whether mr wolfowitzs presidency will survive the week so be it once the wolfowitz "scandal" ends we can begin looking in earnest at the real scandal called the world bank see related letter "letters to the editor
