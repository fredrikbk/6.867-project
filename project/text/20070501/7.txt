chronic in some patients in addition symptoms are mounting among patients who have had cosmetic eyelid surgery and find they cant fully close their eyes even a sliver of an opening that isnt readily noticeable can allow the eye to dry out say eye doctors over all increased demand for dry eye treatment has led a handful of physicians to specialize in the field "my typical patient has seen different eye doctors and says theyve tried everything and nothing works " says robert latkany an ophthalmologist who is founder of the dry eye center in new york city now specialty pharmaceutical companies are targeting this niche market five years ago the food and drug administration approved the first prescription drug for dry eye restasis marketed by allergan inc of irvine calif consumer advocates have said that aggressive marketing surrounding restasis has led patients to clamor for a drug that wont necessarily help them doctors say the treatment doesnt work for everyone and more options are needed "it is truly a wonder drug for a good number of dry eye people some others fail miserably with it " dr latkany says there are some experimental drugs in the pipeline he estimates although only one has advanced through human tests prolacria developed by inspire pharmaceuticals inc of durham n c is under review at the fda inspire said recently that the agency is asking for more

found a new one in a home without pets or smokers cat dander and nicotine aggravate her condition she says some patients complaints are caused by soft contact lenses which absorb fluid on the eye surface a number of contact lens manufacturers have developed lenses meant to alleviate dry eye complaints including coopervision inc with its proclear line and johnson &amp johnson with acuvue oasys ironically chronic dry eye can also be caused by patients efforts to relieve contact lens discomfort some patients who find they cant wear contacts turn to laser surgery but such intolerance is a warning sign of a possibly higher risk of dry eye ophthalmologists say the condition is common after lasik surgery and usually goes away within a few months but doctors say that for a small percentage of patients perhaps dry eye can be a lasting and debilitating outcome there are many over the counter remedies ranging from about &# to &# depending on the product when people go without a doctors
