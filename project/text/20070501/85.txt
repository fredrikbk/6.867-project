talking b school at mit a time of transition the sloans dean stepping down discusses recent changes richard schmalensee dean of the sloan school of management at the massachusetts institute of technology has decided to step down this summer after leading the school for nine years as dr schmalensee who is years old prepares to depart m b a track columnist ron alsop interviewed him about the demands of being dean changes under way at the sloan school and trends in the m b a market wsj why have you chosen to step down as dean now dr schmalensee first i wanted to stay on the job until i got our new &# million building started when i became dean it was obvious that we needed to provide more and better space and to unify the faculty under one roof but it took longer than expected at the same time we have begun some very interesting conversations and experiments to make curriculum changes and possibly add new degrees such as a masters of finance and an executive m b a ive started this ball rolling and either need to hand it off early on or stay the course until its completed i decided i wasnt game to stay four or five more years wsj you have enjoyed a relatively long tenure as dean but turnover seems to be more rapid at many business schools today why do you think theres a revolving door in more deans offices dr schmalensee its a difficult job youve got to deal with lots of constituencies everybody says it must be a tough job managing the faculty thats relatively easy but i also have staff members the students mit central administration the business community the media and alumni as the business world and business schools have gotten more global i also spend more time outside the u s and it wears on you for one trip i literally went around the world in eight days all of that makes it hard to be as involved in academics as i would like wsj how have perceptions of the m b a degree changed in recent years dr schmalensee i think the m b a has lost a bit of luster when there are books with the title "the five minute m b a " you know youre in trouble theres a feeling that an m b a degree has become a bit of a commodity and i find it troublesome that some students are not persuaded that the hard intellectual work in the classroom is worth it they think its just important to learn the business basics and buzzwords network with other students and get their m b a from a brand name school wsj as you know m b a programs have received criticism for not preparing students well for the demands of the business world and for doing too much ivory tower research do you consider the critiques valid dr schmalensee i think theres some validity to the critique that were good at teaching analysis but not as good at teaching management how do we better prepare students to get things done rather than just fly in and make a powerpoint presentation the other major critique is that research doesnt bear as much as it should on real business problems business school faculty havent become dumber but the connection with the corporate world isnt as tight as it once was at sloan we are encouraging our professors to spend more time with executives not just to do consulting but to use their intellectual horsepower to improve the way businesses are run wsj is sloan changing to provide more practical value to students and employers dr schmalensee we dont want to go back to the s and s when schools had businesspeople come in and just talk about how they solved yesterdays problems we still want to give students theory and conceptual frameworks to manage and lead people but we are blending with practitioners more to bridge the gap between theory and practice we had jack welch teaching a class last year and he proved to be very engaging a lot of what he talked about related to theory taught in other classes but jack doesnt make the connection and were not sure students do either hes teaching again this fall and this time we will have classes alternate between jack and a professor who will be sitting in on jacks sessions and making the links with what students are learning in other classes we have also developed the new course "practicing management" to better integrate academic theory with real world applications as they do projects and internships the students should be learning and practicing management just as they would practice tennis or other sports wsj what other significant academic changes have taken place during your tenure as dean dr schmalensee we have concocted a new flavor of the m b a called entrepreneurship and innovation its a program focused on launching and developing emerging technology companies and it has attracted about a third of the class who will receive a certificate along with their degree we also launched a management minor for mit undergraduates its a natural fit for students in science and engineering planning to work in business and has already become the most popular minor on campus wsj given the growth of online education is the sloan school making any moves in that direction dr schmalensee we looked at web based stuff several years ago and did some experiments but decided it wasnt a business we wanted to be in were trying to maximize the quality of what we deliver and dont feel going online will help us achieve that we remain watchful however and its more likely that we would use an online approach in executive education than in a degree program wsj does the sloan school plan to enlarge its global footprint and where does it see the most fertile growth areas for business education dr schmalensee we already have a number of initiatives in china mexico and korea and were in active discussions elsewhere whatever we do well continue to do it through partnerships with schools abroad rather than set up remote campuses currently theres a lot of business school interest and activity in the persian gulf and india china continues to expand too but were pretty well engaged there already working with four schools and helping to train their faculty wsj what are your plans after you leave the deans office dr schmalensee i will continue as a professor of economics and management but first i will take a years sabbatical when i plan to spend time decompressing thinking reading and saying "no" to a lot of commitments my dream job right now is beachcomber
