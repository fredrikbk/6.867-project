wolfowitz weighs quitting if name cleared washington world bank president paul wolfowitz signaled he may consider resigning but only if the banks board clears him of having done anything wrong when he offered a generous compensation package to his girlfriend mr wolfowitz until now had indicated he wouldnt resign a change in his position could pave the way for a compromise that is being explored by the banks board under which the board or a board panel investigating mr wolfowitz would issue a statement that at least avoids a harsh condemnation of his actions he would step down after that bank officials said the seven member investigative panel which was created more than three weeks ago by the banks board to review mr wolfowitzs conduct met yesterday besides hearing from mr wolfowitz the group also heard from shaha riza the bank employee with whom he has been romantically linked despite receiving a pay raise ms riza said she felt "unjustly treated" when required by the bank to work temporarily for the state department after mr wolfowitz became bank president to avoid any potential conflict of interest she said she considered pursuing "legal remedies" at the time but chose not to do so "so as not to cause turmoil " the appearances by ms riza and mr wolfowitz came as the ad hoc committee is nearing completion of a report on the case mr wolfowitzs statement to the panel yesterday and comments by his lawyer suggest the former u s deputy secretary of defense would consider resigning but not in the current environment "only when the cloud of these unfair and untrue charges is removed will it truly be possible to determine objectively whether i can be an effective leader of the world bank " mr wolfowitz told the investigating committee according to a written copy of his remarks his lawyer robert bennett has said mr wolfowitz wont leave "under pressure" or "in the face of false allegations " at the same time mr bennett a combative attorney who once represented president clinton has made clear that the banks board would face a bitter battle if it continues its confrontational approach toward mr wolfowitz "they better de escalate things " mr bennett said he suggested if the board continues to examine mr wolfowitzs actions the compensation deals of other bank officials should also be investigated "if this just keeps going its going to hurt the bank " mr bennett said the broader member board has been debating for several days what actions if any should be taken to resolve the controversy over mr wolfowitzs role in securing a generous pay and promoting package for ms riza the closed door debates have focused on a range of possible disciplinary remedies including whether mr wolfowitz should be suspended from his job the compromise under consideration appears designed to create a face saving atmosphere in which mr wolfowitz could resign said individuals familiar with board deliberations a main player in pushing the board toward a solution for the monthlong crisis has been herman wijffels the dutch member of the world bank board who heads the investigative committee unlike many other board members mr wijffels isnt a career civil servant mr wijffels is a former chairman of rabobank a big dutch financial institution and a prominent figure in dutch politics this year he brokered a deal at the request of the dutch queen that forged a coalition government between warring political parties in the netherlands although he joined the board six months ago mr wijffels has developed a reputation for being tough minded and pragmatic bank officials said he has stepped into the current crisis without being weighed down by the bitter conflicts that arose between the board and mr wolfowitz shortly after he took office in june many bank staffers viewed mr wolfowitz with suspicion upon his arrival because of his role as an architect of the u s s unpopular war in iraq the world bank is governed by a board composed of representatives of the countries that own it the directors all reside in washington the u s the banks largest shareholder so has far stood by mr wolfowitz with president bush reiterating his support yesterday mr wolfowitz he said "ought to stay" in his current job in his appearance before the board panel mr wolfowitz complained he has been the victim of a "smear campaign" designed to create a "self fulfilling prophecy" that he should step down "i will not resign in the face of a plainly bogus charge of conflict of interest " mr wolfowitz said according to his written remarks mr wolfowitz said he disclosed his personal relationship with ms riza when he was named president and proposed to recuse himself from personnel decisions involving her career the boards ethics committee rejected his proposed arrangement which would have allowed him to maintain professional contact with ms riza ms riza was instead detailed to work at the state department mr wolfowitz said the ethics committee instructed him "over my strong and repeated objections" to work with human resources officials at the bank to implement ms rizas transfer as part of that he dictated the terms of her compensation package which guaranteed her a promotion and a pay increase of more than &# bringing her salary to &# "to criticize me when i did nothing other than attempt in good faith to follow the guidance of the ethics committee would be unwarranted and grossly unfair " said mr wolfowitz he said the ethics committee had reviewed the pay arrangement in but took no action the board only decided to look into mr wolfowitzs actions when details of ms rizas pay package became public this year since then the controversy has exploded into a broader debate over mr wolfowitzs management style and the priorities he has set as president the banks staff association which functions like a union for world bank employees and several senior executives and former executives have urged him to step down to preserve the banks credibility
