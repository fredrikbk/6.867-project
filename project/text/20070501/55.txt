mad tv testifying under oath last month secretary of state condoleezza rice misled congress in her strong defense of al hurra the taxpayer financed arab tv network it was unwitting though she herself was misled during the march house foreign operations appropriations subcommittee hearing rep mark kirk r ill pressed ms rice on the wisdom of providing a platform to islamic terrorists citing hezbollah leader sheikh hassan nasrallahs dec speech which al hurra aired live the broadcast speech "went on for minutes " she responded "followed by commentary much of which was critical of nasrallah " in fact mr nasrallahs speech was carried in its entirety roughly an hour and eight minutes the commentary that followed a minute phone interview with wael abou faour a member of lebanons governing coalition was indeed critical of mr nasrallah he accused the hezbollah leader of not being anti u s and anti israel enough while mr nasrallah had claimed lebanons governing coalition was aligned with the u s and had backed israel during the war last summer mr abou faour said that hezbollah was actually closer to the u s and added that any lebanese faction that assisted "the israeli enemy" should not be allowed to engage in political discussion because "the only place they should be is in prison " the secretary of states testimony was without doubt delivered in good faith but the same cannot be said of the information about the broadcast al hurra provided to the state department unfortunately there is no practicable way that foggy bottom or anyone else for that matter can effectively monitor al hurra which has come under fire since the publication of my story about it on this page on march the broadcasting board of governors bbg the congressionally created independent panel charged with oversight lacks the ability to conduct even basic auditing as english transcripts are only provided on request which rarely happens worse there is no good channel for whistleblowers to communicate with the board without fear of retribution with an annual budget now over &# million al hurra has for three years served as the centerpiece of americas aggressive post courtship of the arab world insiders maintain that the network was fulfilling its mission until it hired former cnn producer larry register last november mr register has not to his credit changed al hurras dedication to showcasing the full range of u s politics the other side of the network however has been "gutted " in the words of one staffer even though mr register has made some improvements since the march column al hurra still produces far fewer stories about arab government corruption and human rights abuses mr register did not respond to repeated requests for an interview al hurra was intended to cut through the anti west and anti u s propaganda that permeates even mainstream arab media stories in that vein no longer see significant airtime and nowhere is this more apparent than al hurras new approach to the holocaust the treatment of which in arab society embodies so much that is wrong in that critical region of the muslim world it is precisely because of arab societys persistent refusal to accept the existence of such a defining and indisputable event in modern history that al hurra dared to do things al jazeera would never fathom such as interviewing holocaust survivor elie wiesel and airing the th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz but that was under mr registers predecessor a lebanese born muslim named mouafac harb under mr register al hurra covered the holocaust denial conference in tehran last december but in a stark break from mr harbs era iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the attendees at his conference were treated with unmistakable deference al hurras dec report on the gathering included david dukes praise for mr ahmadinejad and it took at face value the organizers demand for israel "to provide proof and evidence that certifies the occurrence" of the holocaust an official running the event was afforded the opportunity to show the open mindedness of holocaust deniers "if we actually conclude with our experts through this meeting that the holocaust is a real incident we will at that time admit its presence " transcript provided by a fluent arabic speaking u s government employee also broadcast unchallenged were the remarks of the infamous french holocaust denier robert faurisson who informed arab viewers "gas chambers and mass killings of the jews in the way that it is pretended by the jews is completely untrue and an historical lie " the al hurra reporter stationed in tehran referred to those who believe hitler killed six million jews as "holocaust supporters " he took a swipe at the handful of conference attendees who didnt deny the holocaust by noting that they "didnt enforce their statements with scientific evidence " in closing the piece he referred to israel as "the jewish state on palestinian lands " almost six weeks later on jan al hurra aired a follow up story on the neturei karta the fringe group of ultra orthodox anti zionist jews who met with mr ahmadinejad there was obviously world wide media fascination with the jews who ventured to a holocaust denial forum hosted by the man who wants to wipe israel off the map responsible journalists though were careful to provide the necessary context the most important of which is that the neturei karta is a marginal group with world wide membership according to its web site of "several thousand " responsible al hurra was not the neturei karta were presented as mainstream orthodox jews and al hurra claimed that they number more than one million the storys angle is clear from the anchors introduction "they always put israeli officials in a bind who cant seem to understand how jews can oppose zionism or how a jew can encourage iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in his opposition to israel " various neturei karta members uttered outrageous falsehoods about supposed "zionist" cruelty including "torture detention and the burning of their synagogues " none of these libels where challenged let alone debunked "there is no purpose in doing a soft feature of the neturei karta except to pander to or bolster vicious arab and muslim propaganda about jews israel and the holocaust " notes mark broxmeyer chairman of the jewish institute for national security affairs in fairness theres no reason to suppose mr register understood exactly what was being broadcast he doesnt speak arabic then again theres no evidence that he bothered or cared to learn about the contents either way mr register clearly doesnt grasp al hurras mission holocaust denial is rampant in the arab world even among the educated theres a widespread embrace of conspiratorial explanations for world events such as theories about jews perpetrating and notorious forgeries such as the protocols of the elders of zion which is widely sold and read throughout the region arab media do not challenge this mindset but usually indulge it combating this nonsense should be ground zero in our quest to inject truth and information into the arab world if we cant do this how will we ever be able counteract the jihadists who preach to the masses that america is waging war on islam the person tasked with counteracting those jihadists undersecretary of state karen hughes is a stalwart supporter of mr register at an april house foreign operations appropriations subcommittee hearing after two congressmen gave ms hughes a bipartisan earful about mr register she responded that she has heard nothing but "high praise" and "rave reviews " just last friday ms hughes went to al hurras d c area headquarters signaling that she still backs mr register meanwhile five of the six bbg members outgoing chairman ken tomlinson was the lone dissenter are ardent register partisans voting against investigating mr registers questionable editorial decisions key lawmakers dont share such exuberance reps dan burton r ind and robert wexler d fla are circulating to fellow house foreign affairs committee members a letter which asks ms rice for an investigation into al hurra and rep steve rothman d n j who sits on the panel responsible for funding al hurra has proposed live internet streaming of the network full online digital archives and english transcripts for all programs lack of active oversight and transparency has obviously contributed to the current mess at al hurra if someone outside al hurra had been able to view the nasrallah speech merely by going online for example ms rice almost certainly would not have been fed false information but thats not enough the people who already monitor the network its employees need to be empowered to report dubious decisions without fear of reprisal transparency will allow concerns to be investigated swiftly employees simply wont come forward though if they believe no one in power cares for that reason a clear signal must be sent by firing mr register after all if you cant get fired for using u s taxpayer dollars to provide a platform for islamic terrorists and help further holocaust denial then wouldnt congress and the bush administration be communicating that pretty much anything goes mr mowbray is an investigative writer based in new york city see related letter
