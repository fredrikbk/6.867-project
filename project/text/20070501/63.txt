oil and democracy dont mix well most african countries are held back by a predatory ruling class but nigeria is a special case for one thing it is africas most populous nation one in five sub saharan africans lives there for another it is expected soon to supply a tenth of americas oil imports making its stability of strategic concern yet that stability is far from assured nigeria straddles the fault line between the muslim and non muslim worlds it is riven with ethnic animosity and the political system that is supposed to hold the country together is severely dysfunctional it does not have to be four years ago nigeria held elections that were not bad by nigerian standards there was a lot of vote buying and youths with submachine guns stole ballot boxes in some parts of the country but the end result roughly reflected the will of the people the winner of the presidential race olusegun obasanjo was almost certainly more popular than the man he defeated a former military dictator named muhammadu buhari in his victory speech mr obasanjo boasted that nigeria had "come of age" as a democracy if only that were true last months elections in nigeria were worse than a farce they were a tragedy the rigging was not systematic few things in nigeria ever are but it was widespread and egregious polling booths in opposition areas opened late or not at all many ruling party supporters were able to vote more than once many opposition supporters queued for hours but never saw a ballot paper truckloads of cash were used to bribe election officials areas where hardly anyone voted recorded a high turnout and a big win for mr obasanjos hand picked successor umaru yaradua who claims to have attracted an implausible of the vote nationwide beating mr buhari again the main challenger by a margin of four to one this is not a simple story of good and evil one can argue that mr yaradua is the least bad of the leading candidates mr buhari though not personally corrupt did not hesitate to lock up his critics when he ruled nigeria in the mid s several others who sought the top job this year are even less appealing mr yaradua though little known before he received his partys nomination is reckoned to have been one of the more competent state governors the problem is not nigerias new president so much as the system that crowned him nigerian politics is a zero sum game for many nigerian politicians the only issue that matters is how to divide up the nations unearned oil wealth they could spend it on worthwhile things such as roads or schools but many prefer to lavish it on themselves they embezzle they take kickbacks and their example inspires legions of lesser officials to follow suit the policeman who stops you for speeding demands a bribe to let you off the bureaucrat in charge of issuing your firm with a necessary permit demands a backhander not to lose the paperwork and so on a world bank study of public works projects in nigeria found that most are never completed the goal is not to build the clinic but to award the contract to build it to your cousin the anticorruption commission estimates that some &# billion of oil money was stolen or squandered between independence in and mr obasanjos first election in that is equivalent to about five years of national output it is as if americas leaders had walked off with say &# trillion simply put since politics is the quickest route to riches in nigeria a lot of crooks go into politics that makes life tough for those who are trying to clean up the system before the elections put everything on hold mr obasanjos economic reform team had done a good job of making the central governments finances more transparent so much so that nigeria won debt relief in but the reforms did not go far enough and barely began to drain the swamp of state and local politics the chief obstacle to any anticorruption drive is that most rich and powerful people in nigeria have a vested interest in its failure that is also the chief obstacle to real democracy soaring oil prices have multiplied the spoils of office and many of the top offices confer immunity from prosecution politicians who lose their jobs thus risk losing not only their sumptuous livelihood but also their freedom few of nigerias state governors wish to swap a mansion for a jail cell hence the monumental rigging of last months elections all this presents serious dangers in the past corruption and fraudulent elections have provided the pretext for coups and the ethnic and religious grievance stoking that unscrupulous nigerian politicians use to woo support inevitably lead to bloodshed some nigerians have been killed in communal clashes since but it would be wrong to despair nigeria has seen some positive changes since the end of military rule in the late s the media are more or less free dissidents no longer live in fear the economy is growing at an impressive pace though most nigerians are still poor and the country remains hugely vulnerable to a slump in oil prices the country is also not quite as unstable as it looks nigerian muslims do sometimes clash with non muslims but few of them appear to embrace bin ladenism the oil producing niger delta is racked by gangster rebels but there is no appetite for a repeat of the full blown civil war of the late s nigeria may be divided but it is not about to fall apart it would also be wrong to assume that where nigeria leads africa will follow although most african countries especially the other oil producers are hobbled by corruption the continent as a whole has been doing better of late until the s it was virtually unheard of for an african government to be voted peacefully out of power now it is common elections are often flawed but the possibility of losing office by and large makes africas rulers behave better africas economies are getting freer too which is perhaps why the growth rate has been a creditable or so for the past three years growth if sustained will create a larger middle class whose members will eventually demand cleaner more accountable government the ultimate goal many africans would agree is a society where the rule of law trumps the rule of the continents notorious big men but such change will take time in europe it took hundreds of years and though outsiders can lend a hand by offering advice and opening their markets to african goods in the end it is only africans who can make africa work a good start would be for nigeria to hold fresh elections but dont hold your breath mr guest is washington
