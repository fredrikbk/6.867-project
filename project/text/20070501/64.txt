one wrongful conviction out of many rightful ones is still tragic judge morris b hoffman in his april editorial page essay "the innocence myth " ignores the importance of the reliability of prosecutorial judgment in selecting cases for indictment even a small change in the reliability ratio will substantially affect the likelihood that a factually innocent person is standing trial given a guilty plea rate the prosecutor had better be right at least of the time or the five defendants out of a hundred who elect to stand trial will all be innocent or have pleaded guilty despite innocence do prosecutors make a mistake only one time in a hundred maybe the very best do even so it means that of the five of who stand trial one or are factually innocent two mistakes in a hundred and this number jumps to and so on just how error free does judge hoffman think the chief prosecutor for his jurisdiction is anyway on its own terms judge hoffmans analysis is profoundly unconvincing his exaggerated denominator includes the plea cases times the number of trial cases they have no relevance to the issue at hand the prevalence of conviction of the innocent at trial equally flawed is his absurdly small numerator only those previously exonerated by dna testing no one else could be innocent no one who has sat through a criminal trial where no dna evidence is involved and the defendants guilt or innocence is for example based on assessment of eyewitness identification vs alibi evidence could come away believing no mistakes are ever made by juries david w brown rockville md judge hoffmans diatribe against the innocence projects does not represent the view of the majority of veteran criminal justice professionals of course it is true as judge hoffman notes that most cases in this country are resolved by plea bargains but among the cases that go to trial the innocent because they are innocent and will not say they are guilty are disproportionately represented the innocence projects careful accounts of the dna exoneration cases have accelerated widespread law enforcement reform in forensic science training and technology videotaping of interrogations eyewitness evidence collection and a growing list of other areas law enforcement professionals have adopted these reforms not because they imagine that everyone is innocent but because they recognize that some people are innocent that we will only rarely have a dna safety net to catch our mistakes and that every time we do get the wrong person the right person goes free to find further victims a massive energetic effort is under way to apply cutting edge science to catching the guilty instead of the innocent james m doyle director center for modern forensic practice john jay college of criminal justice new york judge hoffman writes that "in imperfect complex systems it is the error rate that matters that means we must look not only at the number of wrongfully convicted defendants but also at the number of rightly convicted ones " but each individual wrongful conviction is a unique stain on the system suppose that in a given year there are convictions of which are wrongful for a wrongful conviction rate suppose that in the next year there are convictions again with wrongful this time for a wrongful conviction rate the fact is that the wrongful in the first year arent made any "better" than the in the second year on account of the fact that they amounted to a lower wrongful conviction rate a wrongful conviction is a tragedy that cannot be overshadowed by any numbers of rightful ones reuvain borchardt shor yoshuv rabbinical college lawrence n y
