rigs keep on trucking searching for parking cities struggle to shoulder new increase in wheelers on any given night the shoulders of interstates leading into big cities like new york los angeles chicago and baltimore are lined with long glistening strands of parked wheelers these are the trucks that couldnt get a space in nearby rest stops or truck stops because those roadsides oases are already packed with resting big rigs "i have never seen it this bad " says john taylor who has been a trucker for years operating mostly in kansas and elsewhere in the midwest "sometimes all we can do is park on an exit or entrance ramp " thanks to a strong economy more trucks than ever are moving on the nations roads transporting goods but the number of places where truckers can stop and get some shut eye during long hauls isnt expanding as fast new jersey voted by the trucking industry as the nations worst state in terms of rest stops has only five public rest stops with bathrooms on its interstates and main state roads not counting toll roads in connecticut alone theres a shortage of public spaces for trucks each night says the states transportation department the shortfall forces trucks into less attractive options such as trekking miles away from the main roads to find a place to stop paying for private lots or simply soldiering on until they hit the legal limit of driving hours at a stretch before they must get a federally mandated hours of rest if there are no open truck stops nearby they simply pull over to the side of the highway even though stopping on the shoulder for anything but an emergency is against the law building more parking spots isnt an easy or likely solution says christopher burruss president of the truckload carriers association a washington advocacy group which represents companies using trucks to move freight for one thing land that is close to highways or major cities where truckers prefer to stop tends to be expensive and parking lots eat up a lot of land some cities and towns dont like the idea of a steady stream of mammoth vehicles rumbling through their neighborhoods communities along californias interstate have passed legislation that essentially prohibits the opening of any new truck stops along the side of the road currently there are about truck stops spread across the country unlike rest stops temporary pull off spots located alongside highways and interstates and usually offering bathrooms and vending machines truck stops have restaurants retail shops repair and gas stations bathrooms and showers as well as dozens or even hundreds of spaces for tired truckers to park most truck stops dont charge for parking but make their money from the various stores and service outlets according to the national association of truck stop operators the average truck stop rings up about &# million in annual sales with most coming from truck drivers locals account for about one fourth of restaurant traffic and pass through car traffic on the way to other destinations about some of the chains that operate these stops such as petro stopping centers lp travelcenters of america llc flying j inc and pilot travel centers llc a joint venture of pilot corp and marathon petroleum company llc say its a good business and the number of truck stops is growing about to a year still they have trouble finding real estate to expand david mcclure director of marketing for petro the fifth largest truck stop chain in the country says his company adds three or four new locations a year none close to city centers "it is almost impossible " he says "if you can even find acres near a highway interchange good luck in getting it zoned for a truck stop " the companys truck stops closest to major metropolitan areas on the i loop outside atlanta and on i outside of trenton n j have space for trucks each "they are full every night " mr mcclure says congress is taking note of the shortage of truck stops it has authorized &# million through for state and local governments to pay for more truck parking along major highways and interstates states would get the money to look for "parking solutions" which could mean the creation of new parking spaces or a system that alerts truckers to where available parking spaces are located its the first time that congress has set aside money for this purpose in the meantime the scarcity of convenient truck parking is forcing some truckers to park far outside of big city limits some big box retailers like wal mart let trucks park overnight but that depends on the whims of local management and there are sometimes private parking spaces available but theyre located off the interstate and lack facilities like bathrooms the countrys largest truck stop iowa so named for its location along interstate in iowa is about three hours west of chicago it has parking spaces and advertises "well always have a space for you " william pendall an independent trucker who hauls sorghum from kansas to chicago often stops at the iowa "it isnt the most convenient truck rest stop because it is far from chicago " he says but "you get too much closer to chicago and you are trying your luck to find a space to settle for the night " many truckers prefer to take the risk generally truckers want to drive as much as they can up to the legal limit of hours at one stretch to maximize their pay when they butt up against their quitting time they stop wherever they can many also leave their engines idling all night so they can have heat or air conditioning hence the ever present orange and red lights that outline the trucks parked along the highways truckers generally dont worry about running out of fuel since their vehicles hold as much as gallons each even at seven miles per gallon that is enough fuel to drive more than halfway across the country trucker randy savage says he reached the hour limit when he was on i outside richmond va the nearest rest stop was miles away so he pulled over and got a &# ticket from a state trooper truckers caught parking illegally along the highway are generally hit with parking fines such fines dont add up to a great deal of money for states which often leave it up to the discretion of police whether to ticket the driver or to just ask him to find a safer place to park for the night that was a dilemma that plagued maryland state trooper and department spokesman arthur betts when he patrolled the rest stops along i between washington and baltimore during a recent stint he says he could have spent his entire shift ticketing truckers for illegal parking if time allowed so sgt betts says sometimes he issued tickets and other times he just issued a warning with a suggestion for a nearby place to park such as a wal mart lot "i wish i could tell you there was a solution " he says "the key thing is that you dont want an accident "
