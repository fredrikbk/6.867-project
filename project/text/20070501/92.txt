every business day sign up for the e mail here terrorism is on the rise world wide according to the latest state department assessment and as the bush administration acknowledges in arguing for a prolonged u s military commitment in iraq terror is both a growth and export industry there the annual country reports on terrorism said the number of terrorist incidents around the world increased to last year from in while those killed by terrorists totaled up from "in reviewing events since it is clear that progress has been mixed " the government says balancing achievements in border and transportation security and the killing and capture of terror leaders against the terrorist response to intervention in iraq improved terrorist propaganda capabilities and terrorist exploitation of grievances like the war there while the invasion of iraq removed the totalitarian regime of saddam hussein and engendered democracy the war has "been used by terrorists as a rallying cry for radicalization and extremist activity that has contributed to instability in neighboring countries " the report says frank urbancic acting coordinator of the counterterrorism office noted that violence there was propagating militancy elsewhere terrorists "learn from each other they watch each other the people in afghanistan are watching the people in iraq the people in iraq are watching the people elsewhere and theres a snowball effect " in iraq alone the number of terrorist incidents involving death injury or kidnapping rose to in from a year earlier with the number of people killed wounded or kidnapped increasing to from president bush has argued the u s military presence in iraq helps to contain terrorism there and prevent terrorists from attacking americans at home and u s servicemen and women are indeed serving on the front line of a violent conflict as the washington post notes "the deaths of more than american troops in april made it the deadliest month so far this year for u s forces in iraq underscoring the growing exposure of americans as thousands of reinforcements arrive for an week old offensive to tame sectarian violence " second to iraq in the rankings of increased terrorism was afghanistan john arquilla who studies terrorism at the naval postgraduate school tells the new york times the numbers highlight the ineffectiveness of fighting terrorism through conventional military means "it is most curious that the areas where we have military operations have the most attacks " he says "these statistics suggest that our war on global terrorism is not going very well it suggests we need to try a new approach " british terror conviction raises new alarms acknowledging the threat of international terrorism the british security agency mi maintains its current threat assessment at the "severe" level meaning it considers an attack in the u k "highly likely " but yesterdays conviction of five british men for a terror plot broken up in has actually raised doubts about mis ability to keep the country safe the men were found guilty of trying to use fertilizer bombs to kill hundreds of people at a shopping center nightclub or other target as the washington post reports and details of the government case released yesterday cast in bold relief the alleged links between british extremists and al qaeda what many government critics found alarming was the first public acknowledgement that meetings took place between the convicted men and two of the four so called bombers who killed london transit passengers on july while british officials had asserted in parliament that security services werent aware of the bombers identities before that attack trial evidence showed that the name of one mohammad sidique khan was twice featured in mi anti terrorist operations more than a year earlier as the times of london reports a parliamentary committee now plans to examine mis handling of intelligence on the bombers as the bbc reports and the agency yesterday was forced to issue a rare explanation of its actions with director general jonathan evans saying "the security service will never have the capacity to investigate everyone who appears on the periphery of every operation " obvious violations of intellectual property rights china and russia continue to harbor the worlds worst violators of intellectual property rights the bush administration said in the governments annual report on the problem which put countries on its "priority watch list " trade representative susan schwab said that "large scale production and distribution of ip infringing optical media and minimally restrained internet piracy are among the major problems" in russia as variety reports and the counterfeiting of clothing and other fashion products in china actually got worse last year despite what womens wear daily notes was pressure from the u s other governments and the luxury industry on the chinese to strengthen enforcement this years report comes a month after the u s filed an official action against china at the world trade organization that included a case focusing on chinas lax legal protection of intellectual property rights "innovation is the lifeblood of a dynamic economy here in the united states and around the world " ms schwab said "we must defend ideas inventions and creativity from ripoff artists and thieves " patents that violate the obvious test at roughly the same time the government was making the copyright accusations against china and russia the supreme court issued a decision on another intellectual property front essentially loosening patent protections in the u s for the sake of innovation the unanimous ruling found the current system so inflexible for inventions deemed "obvious" that it could hold back original advances in technology and other areas the court adopted a new standard "that will make it easier for patents to be denied or challenged on the grounds that the invention at issue is too obvious to deserve patent protection " as legal times reports writing for the court justice anthony kennedy rejected an appellate courts "rigid approach " which looked at an inventors motivation and used tests that depend in part on scientific literature and other evidence that can fall behind technological evolution "granting patent protection to advances that would occur in the ordinary course without real innovation retards progress and may in the case of patents combining previously known elements deprive prior inventions of their value or utility " mr kennedy wrote "the results of ordinary innovation are not the subject of exclusive rights under the patent laws were it otherwise patents might stifle rather than promote the progress of useful arts " in a separate decision the justices put limits on the enforceability of american patents for software installed overseas in a decision that rejected an at&amp t case against microsoft as the wall street journal reports the two rulings "are sure to influence pending patent cases while opening an unknown number of existing patents to challenges " the journal adds "weaker patents that survived under lower court precedents are more likely to be invalidated putting their inventions in the public domain " also of note associated press turkish media say a legal expert has advised turkeys highest
