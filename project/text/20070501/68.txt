patent holders power is curtailed high court rules intent of original law exceeded more disputes may arise washington the supreme court made it harder to get new patents and to defend existing ones giving new force to the law that denies patents to inventions deemed "obvious " in a unanimous decision the justices yesterday sided with critics who argue that lower court rulings have given patent holders more power than congress intended potentially stifling innovation the ruling the latest to roll back patent holders clout comes amid a sharp debate over how to maintain the nations competitive edge while protecting those who labor to design cutting edge inventions many of the developments that drive the economy are governed by patent law an arcane field that has become a battleground in the larger debate about u s industrial strength the opinion could have especially big implications for technology companies whose software programs typically are built through small improvements in prior designs also affected will be the growing and much disputed field of "business method" patents which are granted for abstract processes rather than specific devices in a separate and less sweeping decision also delivered yesterday which involved at&amp t inc and microsoft corp the court limited the enforceability of u s patents for software installed overseas yesterdays rulings are sure to influence pending patent cases while opening an unknown number of existing patents to challenges weaker patents that survived under lower court precedents are more likely to be invalidated putting their inventions in the public domain with challengers emboldened to resist infringement claims more disputes could head to court but patent holders assessing their weakened position could be inclined to settle disputes on more generous terms rather than risk a court judgment that could invalidate their patents outright investors that buy up patents with the aim of obtaining royalties from alleged infringers known as patent trolls are sure to find slimmer pickings in its ruling the court said the u s court of appeals for the federal circuit a specialized court overseeing patent law had been too generous toward patent holders allowing them to claim a patent monopoly for incremental advances the decision swept aside the test used by the court to determine whether an invention was "obvious" and therefore ineligible for a patent patent law aims to strike a balance that provides an incentive to inventors by guaranteeing a limited time monopoly currently years on an inventions use while ensuring that intellectual property rights are flexible enough to allow research and innovation based on prior discoveries while any federal district court can hear a patent suit all patent appeals are funneled to the federal circuit set up in to centralize legal doctrine in several specialized fields in the first two decades that followed the federal circuits creation the supreme court took few patent cases in recent years the high court has repeatedly stepped in to correct federal circuit rulings it found skewed the balance toward patent holders by failing to take into account the fluid nature of the modern economy "what theyre starting to put together here is a model for a st century patent system " said david kappos who oversees intellectual property law at international business machines corp armonk n y "closed proprietary innovation remains important " he said but the court seems to be saying that patent law "can also accommodate st century models that are more open more collaborative " high technology companies have been particularly aggressive in seeking to reduce what they regard as abuse of the patent system which makes it more costly to design and sell new products "what we have is a patent system that has evolved from a focus on protecting innovation to becoming a litigation lottery " said mark chandler senior vice president and general counsel of cisco systems inc the san jose calif maker of networking equipment patent laws came under widespread criticism following the huge windfall won by little known patent holding company ntp inc in march from research in motion ltd maker of the popular blackberry wireless email device faced with a court ordered shutdown of its services in the u s rim of waterloo ontario agreed to pay &# million to ntp whose patents had never been applied to an actual product the most important of yesterdays cases involved an almost textbook example of old industry the design of an accelerator pedal built for general motors corp trucks ksr international corp ridgetown ontario designed the pedals by adding an electronic sensor to a previously developed system rival teleflex corp limerick pa had made a similar device for ford motor co trucks and claimed that ksr infringed its patent a federal district court dismissed teleflexs suit on obviousness grounds but the federal circuit reversed the decision in its cases the federal circuit worried that in hindsight any invention might seem obvious particularly when combining previously existing designs to guard against that it fashioned a test in which something could be deemed obvious if it was foreshadowed by some prior "teaching suggestion or motivation " critics complained that some combinations were so obvious that no one would have thought for instance to publish an article on the topic writing for the court and ruling for ksr justice anthony kennedy said combining a digital sensor with a mechanical pedal would have been obvious to a skilled engineer the federal circuit was too narrow in its definition of "obvious " he wrote saying it should be measured against such factors as changing marketplace pressures and the progressive increase in overall knowledge "granting patent protection to advances that would occur in the ordinary course without real innovation retards progress " he wrote the other case concerned the classification of u s designed software installed on computers assembled overseas at&amp t contended that microsoft had infringed its patent for voice compression software when it sold its windows operating system to foreign computer makers the federal circuit agreed only to be overturned by the supreme court on narrow grounds relating to the difference between "supplying" and "copying replicating or reproducing " the same legal theory used by at&amp t has been used by nearly all of the patents suits pending against his company said brad smith microsofts general counsel "simply by winning this decision today we reduce the liability exposure in these various lawsuits by something close to " mr smith estimated don clark and christopher rhoads contributed to this article
