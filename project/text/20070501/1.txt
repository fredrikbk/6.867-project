a musical family affair revisited there was a sly stone sighting not long ago the reclusive pioneer of soul and funk left his home in napa valley in mid january to perform for nine minutes at the house of blues in anaheim calif during a set by the new family stone which features his sister two daughters and cynthia robinson a member of the original group as a video available on youtube shows the appearance didnt add to mr stones legacy he did a bit better in late march staying on stage at the flamingo las vegas for about a half hour nor did his comments in a rare interview that ran in the los angeles times prior to that show mr stone uttered less than words none of which explained his long absence from the music scene or the decline of his skills following the release of landmark albums by sly &amp the family stone in the late s and early s those albums changed american popular music by morphing bold brassy r&amp b into a differently textured type of pop now known as funk only stevie wonder and the late james brown can be considered as influential in redefining soul perhaps it goes without saying that mr stone declined to be interviewed for this article now sly &amp the family stones seven albums were reissued separately by sony this month several are dazzling on their own but taken together they show how the once gifted mr stone kept refining his music to express something new even when drugs ego and ennui corrupted his vision mr stone still managed to create intriguing popular music when sly &amp the family stone issued their debut "a whole new thing " mr stone was already a seasoned music business pro though only as sylvester stewart hed produced and written for the beau brummels and bobby freeman fronted his own soul band and been an influential disc jockey in san francisco commercially savvy he put together sly &amp the family stone with an eye toward cross over success the talented group was racially mixed and featured women in key roles ms robinson on trumpet provided the bright top to the bands sound a strong counterpoint to larry grahams innovative bass largely a collection of up tempo soul not far removed from the memphis sound "a whole new thing" embraced the shifting zeitgeist in san francisco and its "trip to your heart" and "i hate to love her" stake the same terrain as frank zappas then current band while establishing the template for george clintons p funk units the album was deemed too clever by the bands manager who challenged mr stone to write and record a mainstream hit he responded with "dance to the music " the bands first top hit from the album of the same name which isnt as strong as the single the bands second album of that year "life " is the harbinger of its greatness energetic full of fun and featuring several tasty rock edged solos by guitarist freddie stone the album is a circus on cd from the calliope opening of the title track to "into my own thing" which fatboy slim sampled for his biggest hit "weapon of choice" the band performs with the confidence it brought to its pop masterwork s "stand " "life" may foreshadow something less joyous too the title track contains this lyric "you might be scared of something look at mr stewart hes the only person he has to fear he dont trust nobody " mr stone wrote those words about himself and his future behavior suggests it was a moment of stark self revelation "stand " put the group squarely in the midst of the white counterculture in the albums new liner notes writer barney hoskyns calls mr stone "king of the black hippies " the group was the only soul act on the woodstock bill and as the film and album of the festival illustrate they seized the moment they were well prepared to do so a fierce relentless work released a few months before woodstock "stand " is as much a revelation today as it was years ago with textures and depth that belie its pop cheeriness bassist grahams performance on the extraordinary "i want to take you higher" propels the lockstep rhythm section the coda to the title track is seconds of layered memphis soul and on "sing a simple song" freddy stones guitar portends jimi hendrixs with the band of gypsys while the horns are as punchy and fluid as browns great units the groups first no single "everyday people " ostensibly a sing along about tolerance and equality a theme since the bands first album is surprisingly sophisticated pop with an alluring horn chart and fuzzy rock guitars "stand " marked the end of feel good sly "theres a riot going on " released in a year after the bands hit singles "hot fun in the summertime" and "thank you falettinme be mice elf agin " is mr stones last meaningful recording he withdrew to the hollywood hills jettisoned most of the band and recorded many of the "riot" tracks by himself or with guest musicians thats billy preston on keyboards on mr stones final no hit the dark stripped down "family affair " with its synthesizers drum machines and unadorned guitars mr stone presents soul as rhythmically complex even when its stark and down tempo given the drug and ego fueled atmosphere in the recording studio documented in the new liner notes to "riot" by joel selvin a sly stone biographer its a wonder any music was forthcoming that it was this influential is a miracle "fresh" and "small talk " issued in and respectively were mr stone saying goodbye after hed already gone with the exception of "if you want me to stay " a catchy single from "fresh" that didnt chart in the changing music marketplace the albums are notable only as the last discs of his career or were they mr stone told the times he intends to issue an album of new music later this year if he does it will be measured against the reissued recordings thats a standard too high for any but the most brilliant pop musicians mr fusilli writes about rock and pop for the journal
