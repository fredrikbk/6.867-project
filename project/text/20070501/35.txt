eyes on the road newer cars with latest safety features help in reducing highway fatalities drivers may not be getting any smarter but cars are and that appears to be driving down the risk of dying behind the wheel to further put the odds in your favor drive a big luxury car minivan or car based crossover wagon equipped with electronic stability control these are a few conclusions drawn from a recent study of vehicle fatal crash data compiled by experts at the insurance institute for highway safety the vehicle safety research arm of the insurance industry the institutes status report on driver deaths published april also has some not so good news for detroits struggling brands and raises red flags for greens who wish americans would buy more fuel efficient smaller vehicles the big picture view of the fatality statistics is encouraging says anne mccartt the institutes senior vice president for research between and the average death rate for drivers of car and light truck models was deaths per million registered vehicle years thats down from deaths per million registered vehicle years for models during the period "its more the vehicles than drivers" that deserve credit for this trend ms mccartt says too many people drink and drive almost everyone drives too fast and a stubborn or so still refuse to wear seat belts regularly but newer vehicles particularly luxury vehicles are becoming more crash worthy she says and "some of the safety technology is really making a difference " the difference isnt just the proliferation of airbags including side airbags electronic stability control known by various acronyms including esc appears to be a big factor behind an improvement in the rate of deaths in single vehicle rollover crashes for certain sport utility vehicles stability control systems typically work by monitoring the motion of the vehicle and automatically applying the brakes to arrest a sideways skid the government has mandated installation of such technology by though many auto makers are moving more quickly the national highway traffic safety administration has estimated installation of stability control could save to lives a year in contrast nine vehicles all conventional suvs and pickup trucks that ride high on the ladder frames had single vehicle rollover death rates of per million registered vehicle years the rollover figures highlight another trend vehicles with old designs tend to have worse numbers than models redesigned more recently with the latest crash tests and safety engineering technology in mind the institutes report highlights the improvement in the fatality rate for the ford f pickup the f based on the previous generation design has a death rate of per million registered vehicle years the redesigned model has a death rate score of and it also did far better in the institutes crash tests this is another way in which the competitive handicaps of detroits three auto makers weigh down american brands of the passenger car segments covered in the institutes report that had three or more models measured seven of the top ranked vehicles came from european or asian brands among light truck categories with three or more vehicles measured eight of the no vehicles that is the vehicle with the lowest overall fatality rate came from asian or european brands "if you look at the worst performers some of those are older models " says ms mccartt "u s manufacturers dont redesign as quickly the new designs do better in our crash tests and are more likely to have the safety features" such as stability control finally heres the bad news for greens the statistics reinforce again the argument that occupants of heavy passenger cars have a better chance of surviving a collision than drivers of small sedans or any kind of pickup truck or suv the overall fatality rate for cars weighing pounds to pounds a mercedes s class or lincoln town car was on the iihs scale that compares to for a similar sized suv and for pickups of the same weight best of all were sedans weighing more than pounds such as the bmw series
