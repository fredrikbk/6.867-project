politics &amp economics china seeks advice on health overhauls private competition or more state services so far solicited groups arent saying much hong kong chinas government cant agree on how to fix its ailing health care system through private competition or more state services and has turned to the world health organization the world bank mckinsey &amp co and others for advice chinese planners face two main problems health care is unaffordable for most chinese and the care people do get often is inadequate many people must pay for health care themselves and if they cant come up with the money they are turned away at the hospital door there is little oversight of medical services and hospitals thrive on prescription drug sales often doling out unnecessary drugs to turn a profit the nations communist government once tended to the health of almost everyone now it spends relatively little after a privatization program in the early s shifted the burden of paying for doctor visits and drugs onto individuals in private spending accounted for of health care expenditures in china for several years the government has said it is committed to increasing state spending to make sure everyone has access to good care the question is where to direct that money as government agencies vie for more funding and control "right now there are strong disagreements between ministries " said a person who has reviewed several draft proposals and has spoken with senior officials at some of the ministries involved in the process of finding a health care solution hoping a consensus will emerge chinas top economic planning agency the national development and reform commission invited seven groups to weigh in and "help break the deadlock " the person said that isnt unprecedented the chinese government has in the past sought advice from outside organizations such as mckinsey to help it shape policy beijing also has regularly sought input from chinese think tanks on major laws and even solicited public input on its labor law which is being drafted on health care overhauls the ndrc solicited input from peking university fudan university beijing normal university and the chinese cabinets development research center in addition to who world bank and mckinsey according to the person familiar with the matter a meeting to discuss the proposals is expected to be held in late may in beijing so far two schools of thought are emerging one camp includes the ministry of health some academics within peking university and the governments own research organization according to the person familiar with some of the proposals that group thinks more money should be given to the ministry of health to support state run hospitals township clinics and perhaps village doctors the investment would support the construction of new hospitals and upgrading equipment and would fund the operation of the facilities where chinese people could go to seek care free of charge or at a nominal cost the other camp led by the ministry of labor and social security says "lets not do it completely through public facilities lets rely more on competition " the person said the idea would be to give the money to a government agency that would purchase health services on behalf of patients from state providers or from private clinics and hospitals which would have to compete for funding china also is considering encouraging private investment in health care vice minister of finance wang jun told a health care forum in beijing in march that to dismantle the monopoly of government run hospitals china will "encourage investment from all sectors of society including private sector medical services " according to the state run china daily newspaper another critical question is whether to overhaul the entire system and introduce something akin to universal coverage or whether to slowly expand chinas piecemeal insurance programs in order to get some sort of health coverage for chinas billion people gu xin a professor at the institute of social development and public policy at beijing normal university wrote in an opinion piece in the china daily on march "the brighter path toward universal health care coverage should be careful incremental adjustments to current public health insurance programs " mr gu confirmed that he was working on a proposal to the government the groups solicited by the ndrc arent saying much about what their recommendations might be "we have been told by the central government very explicitly not to send this to the media " a person at who said zhou qing director of the news office at the ndrc had no comment a person at mckinsey familiar with the matter confirmed that the company is working on a health care proposal for the chinese government but said the group working on the proposal hasnt discussed its work outside the team "as a matter of our firms policy we dont discuss client matters " said glenn leibowitz a spokesman for mckinsey adding that the company has a public sector practice "and does serve government agencies around the world on a variety of issues " mr leibowitz declined to comment on whether the firm was being paid by the chinese government joanna brendt a spokeswoman for who in beijing said who would suggest ways to control costs "so that all people can access health care on the basis of need not ability to pay improving quality of health services particularly in poor and rural areas " david dollar the world banks chief representative in china declined to comment on his organizations proposals "what the government wants at this point is informal confidential advice " he said the world bank has been divided on the best solution to the problem according to the person who has seen a draft of the banks recommendations "there are two minds in the world bank " this person said "one group says you should use more competition " the other the person said recognizes that in remote village settings there is often only one clinic or doctor who can provide care so competition in some cases is difficult to foster kersten zhang in beijing contributed to this article
