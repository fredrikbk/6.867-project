tully hall for months while the house is transformed beyond recognition from the auditorium clear out to the skin that renovation is just a piece of the project mr bennack speaks of in lincoln center will turn in anticipation it is undergoing a metamorphosis the founders could hardly have foreseen but would surely applaud descriptions from the early days evoke a fortress surrounded by a slum now that the neighborhood has blossomed the job long overdue is to tear down the walls and throw open the perimeter "to hold the high ground and move to higher ground we have to create a more welcoming campus " mr bennack says has the actual mission of lincoln center changed in the past half century "the mission hasnt changed " says reynold levy president of lincoln center since march after stints in the same capacity at the international rescue committee and the at&amp t foundation "but how its expressed is a function of our response to the felt needs of artists and audiences at a given point in time perhaps right now its more dramatic were opening lincoln center to the community were making it more transparent there will be seating opportunities we want lincoln center to be easy accessible and we dont just want to get people here we want them to know what were doing the big effort is to enjoin to beseech to seduce them to spend more time here " in appearance and demeanor mr bennack and mr levy present a study in contrasts mr bennack the can do corporate visionary in gray flannel with a bon vivants girth apple cheeks and conversational ease the professorial mr levy dressed in brown pensive and a touch hangdog behind his heavy framed glasses even when perpetrating a gentle jest the facade doesnt lie he has lectured on law political science and nonprofit administration at the harvard business school columbia new york university and hobart college his alma mater "staff proposes the board disposes " mr levy says when asked to describe how they carve up the duties of leadership "but the relationship between the chairman and president ultimately is a partnership you have to have a meeting of the minds about what should be accomplished and how to achieve it it gets so that you can complete each others sentences " and see the same vision for a laymans overview of diller scofidio + renfros master plan visit www lincolncenter org and navigate

linking amsterdam avenue and broadway in the past a stark stone patio connecting the buildings on the north and south side of west th street created at street level a dark tunnel with all the allure of a loading dock that patio has now been demolished taking shape before our eyes is an airy "street of the arts " open to the sky offering gracious access to a half dozen lincoln center venues alice tully hall is acquiring at last an entrance and a lobby worthy of its stature behind a facade of glass rather than the old cliff of travertine a miniature grandstand at the corner will be offering a fine view of a new dance studio at juilliard suspended high above the broadway traffic phase coming in the near future is a sweeping reconfiguration of the frontage on columbus avenue or "lincoln center promenade " the staircases along the avenue will be broader and gentler taxis and limos will be diverted to an underground access road campus wide think food service running the gamut from take out to signature cuisine think new green spaces dressed up with art in media from traditional to up to the nanosecond all that and omnipresent lcds twinkling information and directions with new age discretion the budget &# million to &# billion to much of the general public lincoln center exists chiefly as an address home to self standing organizations devoted to music dance drama and film at the highest level integrating performance research facilities and education catering to audiences from every walk of life the list the metropolitan opera as well as the new york city opera the new york philharmonic the new york city ballet and its associated school the school of american ballet the juilliard school the lincoln center theater the chamber music society of lincoln center the film society of lincoln center jazz at lincoln center and the new york public library for the performing arts to those you must add a th lincoln center itself landlord of the acre property presenter of such series as mostly mozart great performers and lincoln center out of doors and home to the lincoln center institute a global leader in bringing arts into the mainstream school curriculum "the chairman is not a determining factor on lincoln centers content or constituents " mr bennack remarks that is not to say that he did not arrive with an agenda "i began " he says "by meeting with the chairs of the constituents engaging in brisk conversation about how we help each other to reach larger audiences and new demographics each constituent guards its content jealously thats as it should be but theres still a role for business colleagues to play in promoting the brand " out of earshot of mr bennack mr levy elaborates "when you have people like frank people with very successful business and nonprofit careers who choose to invest their time and energy it really enlivens the community when you hear him speak about lincoln center with that childlike enthusiasm you see him becoming a role model for his peers these are people who can put their time and energy anywhere and so could he but hes chosen to invest it here were seeing new supporters emerge and traditional supporters being extra generous when you can find the intersection between our needs and their passions its very pleasing what firepower you can unleash " a telling emblem of the current mindset is an agreement with nokia announced yesterday to set up free wi fi throughout lincoln centers outdoor spaces as of next month "wi fi will make lincoln center very attractive to a younger more mobile demographic " mr bennack says "which in turn is very attractive to performing arts organizations " the broadband network will extend to the pocket of urban blight known as harmony atrium a privately owned public space across columbus avenue which lincoln center with the help of tod williams billie tsien architects is reclaiming for free performances civic events a lincoln center information center food service restrooms and a centralized discount ticket service like tkts on broadway "broadway has no subscribers no donors no trustees and all it puts on is theater " say mr levy "to design a discount facility for institutions that do have sponsors and trustees and donors that puts on shows in all kinds of genres and at all kinds of price points its more complex and everybody is rising to the challenge dont forget that when tkts was created it was controversial producers wondered whether a family from ohio that came to the theater all dressed up with tickets they paid &# for would be ok sitting next to a kid in a backpack who had paid &# today we call that yield management the model for our discount service is still evolving but were very encouraged by the cooperation " cooperation at lincoln center from a bystanders perspective it was not so many years ago that the concept seemed unknown even the physical plant cracked pavement on the plaza disheveled jets in the fountain a leaky basin seemed to betoken a deep malaise relations among the constituents as reported in the news amounted mainly to discontent bickering and obstruction no longer these days the rumble of construction is accompanied by a steady stream of new initiatives within constituent institutions among constituents and beyond now instead of joseph volpe standing on ceremony at the met theres peter gelb forging alliances with the lincoln center theater satellite radio and even the metropolitan museum a roman package including a prime orchestra seat for the recent run of handels "giulio cesare" and a vip pass to the museums new greek and roman galleries rather than paul kellogg of the new york city opera pining for a new home theres gerard mortier canny provocateur of the salzburg festival and the paris opera announcing that he likes to work with what he has the classical music world meanwhile is eagerly awaiting the announcement of lorin maazels successor as music director of the new york philharmonic theres no denying the dynamism of individual constituents but "linc inc " takes second place to none of them as evidence mr levy cites lincoln centers leadership role in assuming the early costs of redevelopment and public improvements the establishment of a central campaign office to raise unprecedented matching grants for renovation projects of individual constituents and a partnership with the met to present the mariinsky theater of st petersburg russia in wagners "ring" cycle at the lincoln center festival this summer might a point come when cooperation tips over into cutthroat rivalry "i certainly dont envision that outcome at lincoln center " mr bennack says affably "people are human so theres always a certain amount of competition in peoples minds i applaud intelligent competition but cooperation is the far bigger thing to watch in the end our strength comes from the strength of our parts all advances are good for all anything that raises the profile of lincoln center has to be good " mr bennack is thinking globally rumors are flying that lincoln center like the louvre will soon be setting up a satellite in abu dhabi mr bennack confirms he has paid a visit there and that serious discussions are under way "its a part of the world lincoln center could be very useful to " mr bennack says "well see back in the army we used to say that a good pilot flies minutes ahead today thats not enough " mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on culture and philanthropy
