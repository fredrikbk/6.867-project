mcdonalds winds up for iced coffee pitch local ballplayers will be featured in chicago ads in a sign of how it is democratizing upscale coffee drinks mcdonalds is using chicago cubs and white sox players to pitch a new line of iced coffee drinks throughout the windy city this summer the fast food chain this week will begin selling plain vanilla and hazelnut iced coffees at locations in and around chicago the drinks have been sold in some outlets in new york boston and other cities for a few months to promote the drinks mcdonalds has displayed coffee mugs frozen in ice in seattle and passed out free coffee at boston locations the move is part of a bigger effort at mcdonalds to turn the worlds largest restaurant chain into a destination for drinks not just food since its founding mcdonalds beverage line up has consisted mostly of milkshakes and coca cola co sodas that complement its hamburgers and french fries but the growth of starbucks and the popularity of new noncarbonated drinks sold in bottles have prompted mcdonalds to rethink its entire beverage offering in a few restaurants mcdonalds is testing noncola drinks in bottles made by pepsico and other companies and it is selling a full line of cappuccinos and lattes at outlets in michigan "we look at the beverage business as a tremendous opportunity " says don thompson president of mcdonalds usa "our goal is to move from strictly beverages as an accompaniment to beverages being more of a destination " the chicago iced coffee campaign will heavily market a product that hasnt seen a lot of traditional big budget advertising mcdonalds plans to pitch the drinks by putting ads on the public transit system and at concert venues as well as running a full slate of television commercials particularly during programs geared toward young adults it also plans to put the ads on cocktail napkins inside chicago bars this summer and pass out iced coffee samples at the accenture chicago triathlon and other races starbucks by comparison does very little traditional advertising starbucks spent &# million on advertising last year compared with &# million across the menu at mcdonalds according to tns media intelligence rival dunkin donuts which sells specialty coffees and launched a big tv ad campaign last year spent &# million in according to tns publicis groupes leo burnett created and second television spots for the mcdonalds iced coffees that play off chicagos crosstown baseball rivalry in one spot cubs catcher michael barrett lays mousetraps beside the bed of white sox right fielder jermaine dye who climbs out of bed only to get his toes snapped in another white sox catcher a j pierzynski sneaks up on cubs pitcher carlos zambrano while hes asleep and waxes off his left eyebrow "wake up the rivalry and wake up to mcdonalds new iced coffee " the ads say mcdonalds says it is aiming the ads at consumers age to a younger demographic than customers of its hot drip coffee mcdonalds wont say how much it is spending on the campaign but says it will be one of the chains larger ad campaigns in chicago this summer "as you look at the evolution of iced coffee it did start off as sort of an upscale drink " says rob jackson regional marketing director for mcdonalds chicago region but with lower prices and a humorous marketing campaign mcdonalds wants to convey that the "product is available and accessible " he says mcdonalds will sell all flavors of the coffees in sizes medium and large for &# and &# respectively coffeehouses can charge more than &# for similar sizes of iced coffee and often charge for adding flavors the iced coffees mark the latest step in mcdonalds effort to upgrade its brew mcdonalds used to sell different kinds of drip coffees until it launched a "premium roast" at its restaurants last year most mcdonalds restaurants dont have the machinery to make espresso which many specialty coffee shops use to make iced coffee drinks so mcdonalds formulated its drip coffee into a stronger concentration that runs through its existing coffee makers one of the biggest dangers of adding a new product to the mcdonalds menu is that it can potentially slow down service to avoid that coffee suppliers helped conduct "exhaustive" tests of the drinks and trained workers to make them in as quickly as seconds says bill wolf senior vice president of s&amp d coffee one of mcdonalds main three coffee suppliers "you can do this very expeditiously " he says mcdonalds wont say when it plans to start selling lattes and cappuccinos at more locations but mcdonalds mr thompson says the worlds largest restaurant chain plans to be a much stronger player in specialty coffee "we dont today have a lot of that market and so were going after it fairly aggressively " he says ad notes wal marts latest pitch goes minutes wal mart stores said it will air three minute cable programs highlighting the bentonville ark companys environmental efforts its support for the u s military for organic cotton farming and its employees volunteer activities the first ad includes an introduction by chief executive h lee scott jr who says the commercials detail "some of the things wal mart is doing to create economic opportunity and to give back to our communities " the ads were developed by don mischer productions of los angeles which has produced the half time shows for the super bowl since they will air nationally on the usa network and lifetime cable networks in may and june
