politics &amp economics offshore drilling may get jump start washington in an apparent effort to weaken opposition to offshore drilling for oil and gas the department of the interior will allow exploration of potential reserves off the atlantic coast using seismic equipment evidence of substantial reserves could increase the incentives for coastal states to push for the lifting of moratoria on drilling the department yesterday announced a five year plan to open million acres of offshore land to oil and gas exploration including a triangle containing three million acres miles off the coast of virginia the program could encourage more coastal states to allow oil companies to explore on the outer continental shelf off their shores but if actual reserves are found two federal moratoria banning drilling would have to be lifted by congress and the white house before drilling could begin virginias state legislature and its governor support exploration as a way to produce more jobs and a potential new revenue to support public schools the new areas that would be opened for leasing including waters in alaska and the gulf of mexico could produce up to billion barrels of oil and trillion cubic feet of natural gas over years secretary of the interior dirk kempthorne said the program proposes lease sales including in the gulf of mexico and eight off alaska unless congress acts to block the program within days which lawmakers arent expected to do it would go into effect july the areas opened in the gulf of mexico are in the central gulf miles or more from florida the alaskan leases would open areas in the beaufort sea the chukchi sea cook inlet and the north aleutian basin coastal states and environmental groups blocked a measure passed by the house last year that would have allowed states to opt out of moratoria barring drilling off the east and west coasts environmental groups also remain strongly opposed to the latest program but mr kempthorne said that if virginia establishes that there are substantial resources off its coast and decides to back drilling the politics of the issue could change he said the department has agreed to bar drilling near the entrances to the chesapeake bay at virginias request currently gulf states that allow drilling in federal waters off their shores can get up to of the royalties generated by the energy production while there have been hints of substantial gas fields off the east coast exploration was carried out decades ago without modern seismic arrays paul n cicio president of the industrial energy consumers of america called the interior plan "a good step " but added that more offshore production is needed because the nations domestic supply of natural gas has dropped by since
