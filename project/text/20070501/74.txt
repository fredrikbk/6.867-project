politics &amp economics worsening israeli arab strains renew war fears any misstep might trigger a full scale clash amid growing arsenals and more strident rhetoric jerusalem as israeli leaders defend themselves against a scathing report outlining government failings during last summers lebanon war the chances of renewed conflict erupting this summer between israel and its neighbors seem to be rising heightened tensions on at least three fronts are shrinking room for miscalculation especially between israel and syria analysts say most worry less about any side deliberately starting a war than a seemingly minor incident spiraling quickly into a confrontation and then out of control those concerns are especially high amid newly heated rhetoric a diplomatic freeze and growing arsenals throughout the middle east "any mistake any provocation may lead to a war we didnt see the situation this way even a year ago " says eyal zisser a senior research fellow and syrian specialist at israels tel aviv universitys moshe dayan center for middle eastern and african studies some of this summers potential flash points are familiar israeli intelligence and military officials continue to speak publicly about confronting palestinian militants who are believed to be amassing firepower and preparing defensive positions in the gaza strip such calls are likely to intensify following a decision by the militant group hamas to fire an estimated rockets and mortar shells into israel on its independence day last week a clear violation of a five month old truce across israels northern border tensions with the militant group hezbollah in lebanon have worsened if anything united nations peacekeepers have forced hezbollah to move farther back from the international boundary than its fighters were last summer when some of them crossed into israel and seized two israeli soldiers that sparked a war that left roughly lebanese and israelis dead yet both israeli and hezbollah leaders say the militia is replenishing its firepower including the kind of rockets fired into northern israel last summer as it prepares for the renewed possibility of fighting according to a senior israeli official hezbollahs missile stocks were discussed in an israeli cabinet meeting sunday during a briefing by israeli defense forces chief of staff gabi ashkenazi he told cabinet members the only real solution to missile strikes by hezbollah would be the use of ground forces according to the senior official lt gen ashkenazis comments dovetail with the findings of an interim report on the perceived mistakes of last summers five week war in lebanon it was released last night while the report assails israeli prime minister ehud olmert for what it portrays as severe failings it also emphasizes how unprepared israel was to launch an all out ground assault which it concluded was the only effective way to confront hezbollah launch sites because of the lebanon experience israeli officials acknowledge the nations leaders are likely to react to future incidents more quickly and with greater force avoiding what officials here call "tit for tat" campaigns that is one reason analysts fear small incidents could quickly be transformed into large conflicts this summer the potential for trouble between israel and syria seems to be raising the most concern especially in the wake of recent comments from damascus the syrian government supports both hamas and hezbollah syrian president bashar assad and other top officials have recently suggested that israels refusal to enter peace talks without preconditions could lead directly to war rhetoric that israeli officials say is sharper than anything they have heard from mr assads regime to date syria wants to regain control of the golan heights a swath of territory captured by israel during the six day war of the countries have never entered into a peace agreement in an interview two weeks ago mr assad said "we are working daily to strengthen our defenses we are always preparing ourselves israel is a fierce enemy we have seen nothing but harm from him we do not know if there will be war but we ought not to cancel the possibility " syria has been pressing for peace talks with israel for months while some israeli military leaders have publicly been predicting confrontation mr olmert has dismissed mr assads overtures saying damascus would first have to sever virtually all ties with hamas and hezbollah israeli officials have also cited washingtons strategy of isolating damascus as a reason to abstain from talks though bush administration officials have denied pressuring israel but mr olmert himself has recognized the potential danger of a miscalculation between israel and syria his government has been working in recent weeks to send damascus the message that israel has no intention of attacking and has no interest in a war israeli leaders are also trying to deter a potential syrian provocation the senior israeli official said by making it clear that if damascus starts a war "well finish it " the senior official also said sundays cabinet meeting included discussion of a new intelligence assessment concluding that many of syrias recent military moves appear to be defensive rather than offensive meanwhile the political implications of yesterdays interim report on the lebanon war remained unclear in advance of its release mr olmerts aides had said he wouldnt resign the coalition he heads appears to remain strong although his personal approval ratings have plummeted into the single digits taking stock a special israeli panel issued a partial report yesterday on last summers lebanon war among its key findings prime minster ehud olmert defense minister amir peretz and the former armed forces chief of staff were responsible for a string of very serious failings in the earliest days it singled out the three because it is likely that had any of them acted better the decisions in the relevant period and the ways they were made as well as the outcome of the war would have been significantly better mr olmert committed a serious failure in exercising judgment responsibility and prudence and bears supreme and comprehensive responsibility for failings mr olmert is accused of deciding hastily to strike following the july capture of two israeli soldiers despite the fact that no detailed military plan was submitted to him source official translation of key findings from an israeli government commission investigating the lebanon war
