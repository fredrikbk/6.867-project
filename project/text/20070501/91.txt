the long road to cleopatra the hellenistic age by peter green the modern library pages &# moral is good moralistic is bad military is fine militaristic is not so fine real is real realistic is merely like what is real "the hellenistic age " the title of peter greens short history book holds in its very name the sense of something not quite what it should be the age in question covers the years between b c and b c between the deaths of alexander the great the worlds greatest conqueror and cleopatra the worlds most famous queen the dates suggest momentous historical events but to be "hellenistic" is to be greek without being athenian to be greek but not classical greek without the glories only quite recently has anyone much wanted to study this time at all it was a th century historian robust christian and prussian expansionist who gave the years within these boundaries their name johann gustav droysen admired the way in which the message of the new testament written in an efficient hellenistic greek had been spread into non greek areas as a result of alexanders conquests and his successors military rule it had clearly been gods will that this be so the word hellenistic itself came from the french name for the old testament in greek the work known in english as the septuagint for reasons of politics and religion droysen wanted this hellenistic age to matter but what about anyone not so interested in the march of christiantity around the mediterranean what about the activities of these new greeks themselves the works of the earlier great athenians of the fifth century euripides sophocles thucydides are still read or performed the top hellenistics theocritus apollonius callimachus not much beyond the universities the birth of democracy is still the biggest draw to the classical decades from solon to pericles the death of democracy you can find that anywhere twenty years ago mr green wrote his gripping study "alexander to actium " which gave a fine defense of the hellenistic age its science its new civic freedoms for women its new cities and suburbs its emphasis on private space rather than public at almost pages though it rarely ended up on the reading lists of nonspecialists now mr green has produced a neat page update of his classic a great service for all refreshingly mr green is not enthralled by alexander himself a man he shows as a devious often deranged megalomaniac who never intended or foresaw the extraordinary results of his conquests "the hellenistic age" steps quickly through alexanders paranoiac purges show trials mass marriages and architectural grandiosity we rapidly lose any idea that all this was worthwhile to unify greece or diffuse the love of god and before we can make despotic comparisons with kim il sung or saddam hussein mr green begins brightly with the squabbling successors who carved up the empire after alexanders death this is a complex and spectacular story that needs careful telling watch out for the names of the eventual winners seleucus antigonus one eye and ptolemy spare less time on eumenes a once promising victim of alexanders crack silver shields brigade and perdiccas the winner of alexanders ring but loser in a scrap with nile crocodiles eventually the antigonids got greece the seleucids the larger part of asia the attalids a smaller part the ptolemies whose last ruling queen was mark antonys cleopatra took egypt what did they all do to make their age of domination an age for later historians antigonus ii decided not to be a god "my pisspot bearer knows better" but the other clans thought their own divinity a fine idea inspiring the romans who eventually replaced them they all invested massively in the technology of war in alexandria the egyptian coastal city that alexander himself had founded the ptolemies built a library and a lighthouse that remained famed for centuries within the librarians offices of alexandria began the first recognizably modern literary feud between the short poems are best man callimachus and his go for length rival apollonius an exercise in futile malice made easier in this pioneer age of leisured bourgeoisie but without those squabbling librarians of alexandria there would have been no european renaissance most of the athenian texts that became world classics were collected and copied at the court of the ptolemies in the hellenistic age it gradually became possible to talk about settled economies rather than the mere farms mining and mass rapine of earlier eras mr green makes potent connections between politics and the energy industries slavery was the oil business of its time profitable essential permitting piracy demanding collusion in countless ills the argument was never about the rights or wrongs of slavery itself merely about who should be a slave who should have slaves and how much slaves should cost antigonid macedonia was the first of the successor states to fall to rome the seleucids were next the ptolemies intermarrying themselves rotten nonetheless lasted the longest one of their maddest rulers the benefactor known in the streets as the malefactor expelled jews and intellectuals rather in the manner of hitler and with the same result a diaspora of talent in this case spreading greek ideas and culture throughout the known world and preparing the way for the export of christianity for germanys th century definer of the hellenistic age such an event helped to make the whole period worthwhile for those following later thanks in part to mr greens critical acumen and combative prose there are plenty of other reasons mr stothard is editor of the times literary supplement
