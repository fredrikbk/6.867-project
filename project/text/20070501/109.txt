will investors board a revived delta bankruptcy court exit helps rally airline but shares face pressure when delta air lines inc formally emerged from bankruptcy yesterday it marked the end of a month restructuring process that has enabled the carrier to fly high recently by slashing &# billion in annual costs and transferring excess capacity from unprofitable domestic routes to promising international destinations the carrier successfully repositioned itself to tap strong demand for air travel over the past year the formerly money losing airline has posted an operating profit during each of the past four quarters but dont expect the airlines new shares which will replace those that traded over the counter to take off when delta begins trading again thursday on the new york stock exchange while delta recently dismissed concerns by rival carriers such as southwest airlines co and continental airlines inc that consumer demand has begun flagging investors remain skeptical of many airline stocks at a time when the forecast for the u s economy is cloudy slower economic growth could hurt profits and tempt all carriers to cut fares reversing an unusually long spell of pricing unity in the u s airline industry deltas new shares meanwhile already are trading on a "when issued" basis at levels suggesting that the valuation placed on the carrier by its financial advisers may be higher than what would be buyers of its stock are immediately willing to pay when delta filed its final reorganization plan with a new york bankruptcy court in december advisers suggested the airline upon exiting from chapter would be valued at between &# billion and &# billion that represents between &# and &# for each of the million shares to be issued even the lower end of that range would give delta the second highest market value in the u s airline industry after southwest and a price to earnings ratio second to none based on the airlines net income forecast of &# million for deltas when issued stock though closed last weeks trading at just &# a share and yesterday ended the session at &# those when issued shares currently trade at almost times projected per share earnings for this year cheaper than southwests price earnings ratio but richer than most of its other rivals last week edward h bastian the companys chief financial officer said that management is comfortable with the prospects for deltas share price and recognized that a market capitalization of &# billion or more "would be fully valued " an initial surge in the share price mr bastian added would be an "unnatural build " considering that about of the shares to be issued wont begin trading until the airline completes litigation with a minority of creditors who are still disputing the value of their claims against the pre bankruptcy delta since that process could take months and continue to drag on deltas share price some creditors who would have been issued the companys new shares instead opted to sell before they ever received them last month for instance more than of the airlines pilots completed the sale of about &# billion in claims against the airline to investors more willing to wait for long term growth of the stock and other creditors are expected to follow suit "theres going to be some pretty big sell pressure on the stock because there will be lots of creditors looking for liquidity after being locked in for so long " said bill mann an analyst at the motley fool an online investment advisory firm based in alexandria va "new investors are going to be cautious in the short term " mr bastian said the airlines restructuring makes its long term potential good in addition to slashing its debt to &# billion this year from about &# billion when it filed for bankruptcy protection in september delta cut jobs and wrested more than &# million a year in concessions from pilots flight attendants and other employees in addition delta executives bet big on the future of international travel by relocating many of the airlines wide body aircraft to higher margin destinations abroad from weaker domestic routes "youre seeing greater potential and greater growth in the international economy than you are in the u s and youre seeing delta move from domestic further into international " mr bastian said investors "buy potential and delta has got great potential " still it will take time to fulfill that potential despite its turnaround delta still trails competitors in terms of the revenue it squeezes per passenger per mile lagging behind the industry average by while it expects to close the gap by the end of doing so will depend on the success of as yet unproven international routes that is because a new destination such as tel aviv kiev or accra ghana in its first year generates only about of the revenue that it would when mature delta executives say and as usual in the airline industry the success of such routes depends on myriad factors that are well beyond the control of even the most focused and energized management teams such as political instability overseas to a return of runaway oil prices so while delta may be leaner and meaner it is still a company operating in a notoriously cyclical and volatile industry "if this is the top of an economic cycle then delta would be a richly priced stock " said ray neidl an analyst at calyon securities in new york "but if you assume were only taking a breather and that the industry continues to do well delta is well positioned " corrections &amp amplifications about million newly issued
