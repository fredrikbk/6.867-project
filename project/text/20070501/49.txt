how chavez aims to weaken u s china to get preference with oil from projects now under state control venezuelas leader hugo chavez may have more than just nationalism in mind today when he takes control of four large oil projects run by private firms many of them u s based and hands them over to the state the ceremonies are also part of a larger effort by the self proclaimed maoist to help reshape the global oil business by sidelining the u s and making china his countrys chief strategic energy partner both as a source of investment and an important client for exports since becoming president in mr chavez has tried to use oil as a political weapon against the u s in recent years he has doled out cut rate supplies to dozens of latin american countries to buy support increasingly he is using oil to support the u s s economic rivals like china and political rivals like iran in late march mr chavez unveiled a raft of proposed oil related deals with china valued at about &# billion under terms of the prospective deals china national petroleum corp would develop together with state oil company petroleos de venezuela sa the biggest chunk yet of venezuelas orinoco river region the same area where mr chavez is nationalizing the western companies projects oil produced there would then be ferried to china in a new joint "super fleet" of tankers and processed there at three new refineries built to handle orinoco heavy crude the venezuelan leaders goal is to supply china with one million barrels a day by up from barrels a day while many analysts doubt mr chavezs ability to deliver on his promises venezuelas exports to china have grown quickly from barrels a day in meanwhile with oil production falling and chinas share rising exports to the u s fell in from and nigeria has replaced venezuela as the u s s fourth biggest source of crude oil after canada mexico and saudi arabia "the united states as a power is on the way down but china is on the way up china is the market of the future " the ex army officer said recently at a time of fast growing global demand for stable energy supplies the stakes in this new great game are high for all parties venezuela sits on the largest reserves outside the middle east and if government estimates of orinoco reserves prove right it may rival saudi arabia in its holdings getting preferential access to that oil would be a strategic coup for china the u s for its part is likely to remain venezuelas biggest client for oil in the coming years especially since the andean country owns the u s based oil refiner citgo petroleum corp but mr chavez said this weekend that he aims to sell citgos refineries in order to build refineries elsewhere and sell oil to places other than the u s if mr chavez succeeds with his plans the best the u s can hope for it seems is to keep oil imports from venezuela stable that means any incremental imports to meet rising demand will likely have to come from the volatile middle east the stakes are high for the oil industry too venezuela represents a critical source of new business in future years especially since the industry is blocked from saudi arabia and many other big oil producing nations yet as long as mr chavez is in charge his government seems bent on favoring state run companies from governments he considers friendly consider the list of winners of contracts handed out to companies to certify oil holdings in the orinoco region in the last two years vietnam iran brazil and china last month pdvsa signed a deal with belarus to work in the orinoco meanwhile todays nationalization ceremony pushes out u s companies exxon mobil corp conocophillips and chevron corp along with britains bp plc frances total sa and norways statoil asa however mr chavezs own policies may stand in the way of him carrying out his plans the leaders focus on social spending has turned pdvsa into a poverty alleviation ministry more than an oil company and left the company with little focus venezuelas output has fallen to million barrels a day from million barrels a day since mr chavez took office in mr chavez recently paid off the last portion of debt owed the world bank using venezuelas oil income and paid off all debts with the international monetary fund shortly after taking office he said yesterday he will pull the country out of the lending bodies blaming them for continued poverty throughout latin america mr chavez has announced numerous investments such as domestic and foreign refineries that have never gotten off the ground "he is good at giving oil away but hes not good at producing oil something like this china deal involves meticulous planning and hes shown thats not his strong suit " says luis giusti who was ceo of pdvsa during the s on the other side of the equation china may also decide that the mercurial leader is too risky a partner preferring instead to rely on liquefying domestic coal as a cheaper alternative than shipping in heavy venezuelan crude says amy myers jaffe an energy expert at rice university venezuela was historically one of the u s s most reliable energy allies during world war ii and again in the persian gulf war venezuela pumped as much as it could to ensure steady supplies and during the arab oil embargo venezuela broke ranks with other members of the opec cartel and continued to ship oil to the u s that began to change after mr chavez took power in and relations between both countries declined mr chavez accuses the u s of taking part in an abortive coup against him five years ago and of trying to assassinate him ever since charges the u s denies mixing oil and politics may not help mr chavez in the long run many analysts say he will need private companies expertise to develop the heavy crude in the orinoco region but as long as oil prices stay high mr chavez can probably afford to give state firms such as cnpc an opportunity to learn see related letter "letters to the editor
