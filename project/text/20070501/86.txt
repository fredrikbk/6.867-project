the accidental binge drinker how much we really pour chances are youre drinking far more alcohol than you think the reason wine beer and spirits glasses are surprisingly deceptive and most of us even professional bartenders are over pouring the alcohol we serve while too much alcohol obviously adds calories to your diet other consequences of supersizing alcoholic beverages are even more worrisome the health benefits of alcohol disappear and risk increases when you drink more than a few servings a day and because over pouring can double or even triple a standard serving size many of us are technically "binge" drinking without knowing it wreaking havoc on our livers and overall health a standard "serving" for an alcoholic beverage is fluid ounces of wine ounces of regular beer or ounces of distilled spirits according to the centers for disease control and prevention all three portions contain ounce of alcohol but glasses today come in so many different shapes and sizes tall "highballs " wide tumblers bowl shaped wine goblets and now the new popular stemless wine glasses its virtually impossible to estimate the right serving amount although a traditional wine glass holds about ounces many wine glasses today hold ounces or more beer glasses often hold ounces "often my clients think they are just having one or two drinks when really theyre having more like three or four " says lisa r young a new york university nutritionist try this experiment at home take your favorite wine or beer glass and use water to estimate drink size pour the contents into a measuring cup to see how close you come to the standard ounce wine portion or ounce beer portion i did this myself and was stunned by the result i filled my favorite wine glass just half full but i still ended up with milliliters or ounces double the standard serving size i tried again this time with a smaller wine glass and then again with a large bowl shaped goblet but each time i still poured milliliters or ounces too much the british medical journal published a study of college students and bartenders asking them to pour drinks into different size glasses the study used milliliter glasses but one was a tall thin highball glass and the other was a short wide tumbler study participants were asked to pour a serving of alcohol ounces or milliliters needed to mix a gin and tonic or other popular drinks they over poured by when using the short glass but came close to the right serving with the tall thin glass pouring just too much even the bartenders who had an average of six years experience poured too much when using the tumblers another duke university study also found college students over poured shots by mixed drinks by and beer by and the bigger the cup the more the students overestimated a serving size pouring too much clearly adds calories each additional ounce of beer contains about calories while an ounce of wine contains about calories but the bigger worry is that the maximum health benefits of alcohol come with just less than one serving a day for women and up to two servings for men at that level heart protection is high but risk for other alcohol related health problems is at its lowest studies show people who drink somewhat more for women two to three drinks a day for men three or four arent getting any extra benefit their overall risk balanced with the benefits is the same as people who dont drink at all but once women go above three drinks and men go above four drinks they put themselves at far higher risk for other alcohol related problems binge drinking is defined by the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism as four drinks for a woman and five drinks for a man over a two hour time frame "people do not know how to assess how much they are drinking and when they have two drinks on a friday night it is really four or five because there are multiple doses in one giant cup " says julia chester assistant professor of psychological sciences at purdue university dr young says that a solution is for drinkers at restaurants to count each glass of wine beer or spirits as two servings and at home conduct practice pourings with a measuring cup to see what a real serving looks like in your own wine goblet or drinking glass and avoid short wide glasses that increase your risk of over pouring email healthjournal wsj com
