may day in tehran today thousands of iranian workers are expected to take to the streets in a show of something rarely seen in most may day celebrations courage in tehran teachers plan to demonstrate for better wages and working conditions at the ministry of education elsewhere in iran as many as unions all of them illegal will take to the streets under the banner of the workers organizations and activists coordination council woacc is an unwieldy acronym but in spirit and potentially in importance it is of a piece with the solidarity labor movement that set the dominoes toppling in the old soviet bloc that analogy is hardly lost on the iranian mullahs who according to journalist amir taheri plan to deploy thousands of elite revolutionary guards to police and if past practice is anything to go by crush some of the protests in march hundreds of protesting teachers were beaten and arrested by iranian police the regime has been especially brutal in its dealings with tehrans bus workers whose leader mansour osanloo last year had a piece of his tongue cut out as a warning against those brave workers who would dare to be equally outspoken mr osanloo is now standing trial for "activities against the state and activities against national security" like demanding that bus drivers be given minimal allowances for proper footwear and uniforms we do not often find ourselves on the same side as the afl cio but american unions have for decades supported people like mr osanloo and before him others like lech walesa through the solidarity center which is engaged in labor rights issues from zimbabwe to iran to china thats a reminder that when it comes to such basic and universal issues as the freedom of association partisanship really can end at the waters edge in the face of the iranian threat to its own people no less than to its neighbors thats exactly the kind of may day solidarity we need
