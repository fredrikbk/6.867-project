health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions q in response to your story about risk taking behaviors affecting male life expectancy has it ever occurred to you or those doctors that it does not matter how long you live but how fully a full life for many men includes risky activities sometimes a lot of risky activities stop trying to make men into whiny wimps g h a to my surprise i received a number of letters from men expressing similar sentiments i dont think the goal of the medical profession is to turn men into wimps the goal is to help men become more tuned in to their personal health needs and to encourage them to seek medical help when they are ill one survey found that for one in four men the main health strategy for coping with illness is to "wait as long as possible" before seeing a doctor the issue of risk taking behavior is an important one before the age of accidents are the leading cause of death for men followed by suicide and homicide clearly the behavior of young men is playing a role in their chances of premature death young men typically arent dying from the type of risky activities that might enhance their lives such as extreme sports sky diving cycling or downhill skiing men are dying young from car accidents gun accidents suicide and workplace accidents statistics show that teenage boys are more likely to get into serious accidents and far more likely to die in a car accident than a teenage girl and simply having a teenage boy as a passenger in the car doubles the death rate for both male and female teen drivers according to a report from the insurance institute for highway safety and male adolescents commit suicide at a rate five times greater than teen girls that statistic shows how far we still have to go in identifying depression in young men one of the big hurdles is that we live in a society that values stoicism in men and encourages boys to hide feelings and avoid crying focusing on a mans health isnt about trying to dissuade him from living a full life or even a fully masculine life its about trying to persuade men to take care of themselves so they can live healthier longer live fuller lives and experience all that life has to offer including thrill seeking leisure activities and potentially risky sports that they enjoy q in your article about mens health i couldnt find a single reference to the terrible consequences of cigarette smoking how can you write about life spans and not mention the one controllable variable that probably shortens lives more than any other m h a you are correct that smoking exacts a terrible toll on the health of both men and women smoking is the main reason behind the biggest cancer killer lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the third biggest killer of men in their s is also closely linked with smoking but by now smokers are well aware of the terrible toll the habit takes on their lives many have tried unsuccessfully to quit smoking rates have been relatively stable over recent years and today in the u s of men smoke and of women smoke yes if you smoke quitting smoking is by far the best thing you can do for your health but men who dont smoke also need information about how to boost their health paying attention to cholesterol and blood pressure keeping their waist size below inches and monitoring erectile function are all important ways men both smokers and nonsmokers can pay attention to their health
