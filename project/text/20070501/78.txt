politics &amp economics could bloomberg shake up race voter frustration could open door to independent presidential run in ross perots quixotic run for the presidency tapped into voters deep worries about the state of the country and unhappiness with the major party candidates the texas businessman shook up the race capturing one of every five votes cast fifteen years later the political winds that fanned the perot candidacy might be blowing once again this time stirring talk of an independent run by another billionaire new york mayor michael bloomberg "more people are willing to consider an independent today than in " says frank luntz a republican pollster who worked for mr perot and then for mr bloomberg in he predicts the mayor could get as much as of the popular vote mr bloomberg who is years old denies he is running although the new york gossip columns regularly quote "friends" claiming otherwise "as mayor bloomberg has said repeatedly all of this speculation is flattering but he is not running for president " his press secretary stu loeser wrote in an email mr bloomberg also has said his personal profile a divorced jewish new yorker makes him an unlikely candidate but as in voter disaffection with washington plus an estimated &# billion personal fortune has kept mr bloombergs name alive as a candidate in the most recent wall street journal nbc poll only of voters said the u s is "headed in the right direction " the lowest since july when mr perots poll numbers were at their highest president bushs handling of iraq accounts for much of that dissatisfaction but so does warring partisanship on capitol hill a string of corruption scandals and congresss perceived inability to improve peoples lives that is leading to talk among even establishment activists that voters might be especially willing next year to look beyond the major parties former aides to presidents carter and ford are helping to promote an effort called unity that seeks to put a bipartisan ticket on the presidential ballot after an online primary that could be a natural vehicle for mr bloomberg a democrat turned republican mr bloombergs opening would come if voters were to grow so disenchanted with the big party nominees that they begin looking for an alternative says ed rollins mr perots campaign manager he attributes mr perots popularity to republican disaffection with the first president bush who had reneged on a pledge not to raise taxes and democratic uncertainty about bill clinton whose campaign was rocked by charges of womanizing draft avoidance and excessive political calculation discontent is a bigger problem now for republicans than democrats in the wall street journal nbc poll only of republicans said they are satisfied with their field of candidates democrats say they are generally satisfied with their choices but have doubts they can win the general election the partys front runner new york sen hillary rodham clinton in particular rattles democrats because of her reputation as one of the most polarizing figures in politics in a march wall street journal nbc poll of respondents said they had a negative impression of her seven points more than those who saw her positively the early primary calendar could also help mr bloomberg thirty states may choose their convention delegates by feb that means neither party would be able to rethink its candidate during the spring or summer if he or she stumbled or lost steam in that vacuum mr bloomberg could "go from zero to overnight " says carol darr director of george washington universitys institute for politics democracy and the internet a two term mayor who will leave office at the end of mr bloomberg is known for a get it done management style that helped stoke new yorks turnaround he has riled some voters with his nanny state initiatives such as banning smoking and trans fats in restaurants but he also has won admirers for taking tough stands while national democrats hemmed and hawed about gun control after last months shootings at virginia tech for example mr bloomberg stepped up his campaign against illegal gun sales should he run mr bloombergs fiscal conservative social moderate credentials could undermine the candidacy of rudy giuliani the current front runner for the republican presidential nomination both play up moderate stands on abortion gay rights and gun control mr bloomberg also could draw votes from a democrat seen as too left of the mainstream on taxes and budget control such as former north carolina sen john edwards he might leach support from illinois sen barack obama whose appeal relies partly on talk of ending partisan squabbling an independent candidacy faces huge roadblocks though each state has its own set of complex rules on who can be on a ballot theresa amato who managed ralph naders and bids says he eventually got on state ballots in but had to go to court in a dozen of those and the two major parties have grown increasingly aggressive about keeping third party and independent candidates off the ballot campaign professionals say mr bloomberg could get into the race as late as next spring or summer about the time voters typically begin paying attention mr bloombergs wealth and communications savvy he earned his fortune providing news and analytic technology to business subscribers would enable him to skirt many of the problems that might doom another late entrant he could afford to finance a campaign himself rather than spend energy courting donors whether he could actually win the presidency is another question no independent has done so before and the winner take all nature of the electoral college means mr bloomberg would have to win states not just individual votes even with of the popular vote mr perot won no electoral votes mr bloombergs role could be that of a spoiler though mr perot drew his support from republican deficit hawks and helped mr clinton prevail mr nader in helped mr bush "i dont think mr bloomberg stands a chance in hell " says l brent bozell a conservative activist and president of media research center "i also think anything could happen "
