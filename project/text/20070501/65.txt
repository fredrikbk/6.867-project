out of the mainstream brian williams asked a revealing question at the democratic presidential debate in south carolina last week the nbc news anchor who was serving as moderator inquired whether criticism of the supreme courts decision to uphold the federal partial birth abortion ban put the democrats on stage at odds with the majority of americans who applauded the decision john edwards apparently missing the rhetorical nature of the question responded "no i dont believe it is " polls show between and of americans oppose late term abortions except to save the life of the mother the democratic candidates all of whom vocally criticized the ruling are out of touch with most americans including many who are pro choice on this important issue even some democrats who voted for the ban four years ago such as majority leader harry reid and sen joe biden two of senate democrats to vote for it have dressed down the supreme court for upholding a law they voted for its tragic that abortion rights have become synonymous with modern day feminism but its mind boggling that late term abortions now enjoy the imprimatur of every one of the presidential candidates of one of the two main political parties many early feminists the suffragettes opposed abortion they viewed it as an affront to human rights there is little doubt that they would have recognized elective late term abortion for what it is a gruesome uncivilized and inhuman procedure feminism was meant to establish women as having equal legal rights to men yet in todays twisted debate women are not mere equals instead they have been elevated to a special status where they have the "right" to determine whether a five month or older "live fetus " as the court called it should be partially delivered outside of their body and killed in the most gruesome manner imaginable even if carrying that fetus poses no threat to their life some elected democrats ignored this faux feminist canard and supported the ban including rep james p moran of virginia who said "its not about a womans right to choose its about a babys right to life " the late sen daniel patrick moynihan a pro choice democrat called the practice "infanticide " it needs to be said that there is no constitutional right to crush a living humans skull and suction out its brains no matter where that life may reside inside the womb or partially outside the womb as is done in the so called partial birth abortion its immoral and contrary to the values of the democratic party which prides itself on standing up for the weak and voiceless if democratic power brokers arent swayed by moral arguments then they should consider how their reflexive pandering to the left wing of the party will play in a general election the democratic party has made a huge show of reaching out to religious voters for whom abortion is a central issue overtures have been made to acknowledge the moral dimension of abortion with sen hillary clintons famous remarks that "we can all recognize that abortion in many ways represents a sad even tragic choice to many many women " but terrified by the left wing of the democratic party the presidential candidates are aligning themselves with organizations that malign opponents of unrestricted late term abortions as misinformed hysterics yet some of the people who run those organizations are themselves bereft of factual information about the procedure they champion recently national organization for women now president kim gandy was asked in a radio interview to describe the procedure she so vigorously supports she couldnt when pressed she sputtered "im not a doctor " when the host cited testimony of a doctor one dr martin haskell the man who pioneered and has performed at least a thousand of these abortions mr gandy replied "i dont know who dr haskell is " its important to know who dr haskell is since he has debunked a central claim of unrestricted late term abortion proponents that they are critical to protect the "health" of the mother according to an interview in american medical news dr haskell said "ill be quite frank most of my abortions are elective in that week range in my particular case probably are for genetic reasons and the other are purely elective " rather than defending the indefensible rather than parroting the propaganda that elective late term abortions are "health care decisions" akin to an appendectomy the democratic party should be taking the lead in eliminating a still legal form of elective late term abortion where as the court described it "the fetus is usually ripped apart as it is removed and the doctor may take to passes to remove it " sen barack obama pointed out that late term abortions account for less than of all abortions sounds sort of benign until you consider that in the last years more than million babies have been aborted in the united states ms powers served in the clinton administration from and is a fox news political analyst see related letters "letters to the editor do a majority of americans really support partial birth decision " wsj may
