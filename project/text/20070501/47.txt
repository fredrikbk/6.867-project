illegal residents get legal route to car coverage insurers find a market as states crack down on drivers licenses many states are cracking down on illegal immigrants by denying them drivers licenses but auto insurers are increasingly targeting those unlicensed drivers as a lucrative market for decades many states with big immigrant populations like california routinely issued drivers licenses to foreign citizens regardless of their immigration status but when those states and others began tightening up their requirements amid a backlash against illegal immigration many illegal immigrants couldnt renew their licenses and their car insurance was automatically canceled some auto insurers however were quick to see a golden opportunity california law for example doesnt bar companies from selling insurance to unlicensed motorists so insurers including some major ones like progressive corp are covering illegal immigrant drivers often charging them premiums above the normal market rate "when we figured out it was legal and we werent going to get punished we went into the market within a short while " says brian duffy chief executive of alliance united a closely held auto insurer based in ventura calif "we are exploding with growth " the situation is another example of how illegal immigration and the purchasing power of the nations estimated million illegal immigrants are influencing public and private policy in sometimes contradictory ways while some politicians and others complain that illegal immigrants place a burden on state and local resources businesses ranging from banks to retailers are lining up to cater to them earlier this year for example bank of america corp began offering a credit card for people who lack a social security number and a credit history a category that mainly includes undocumented immigrants smaller businesses have sprung up to help illegal immigrants file tax returns in tapping this new market auto insurers are addressing a big concern for residents in many states the potentially costly prospect of getting into an accident with an uninsured driver undocumented immigrants without insurance have been known to flee the scene of an accident even abandoning their vehicles they also sometimes plead with the other driver to let them pay for any damages in cash to avoid being exposed as uninsured in new mexico which passed legislation allowing illegal immigrants to obtain drivers licenses in police say that the states roads are now safer though critics say that insurance companies are legitimizing the presence of illegal immigrants by offering them insurance some law enforcement officials and immigrant advocates argue that many undocumented workers will drive to reach their jobs anyway and that having insured motorists protects the public at large though driving without a valid license is illegal it often goes unpunished if the drivers car registration and insurance papers are in order amid the national debate over immigration and security in the wake of the sept attacks a growing number of states started requiring applicants for drivers licenses to show proof of lawful residence states with large illegal immigrant populations like texas california and arizona dont issue drivers licenses to illegal immigrants in california gov arnold schwarzenegger citing security concerns vetoed for the second time a measure passed by the states lawmakers to explicitly allow undocumented immigrants to obtain a drivers license in illinois legislators are considering allowing people without social security numbers to obtain a drivers certificate a proposal that has polarized the states voters with the states getting more restrictive some auto insurers have adopted new strategies realizing that many workers without licenses drive anyway several auto insurers began allowing undocumented immigrants to acquire a policy on the strength of a foreign drivers license or even a foreign identification card jeff dailey chief executive of publicly held insurer bristol west holdings inc which specializes in nonstandard high risk insurance says that the "foreign driver" segment has proved to be "good business for us " and has attracted multiple competitors mr dailey says sales agents for his company which agreed last month to be acquired by farmers group inc accept a mexican matricula consular card an i d issued by the mexican consulate from immigrants who dont have a foreign drivers license of the drivers mr dailey says "they arent licensed to operate a vehicle but care enough to want to present proof of financial responsibility in the event theyre in an accident " because their driving records cant be verified he adds "they end up being surcharged for a policy as if they had a lot of violations " nationally of all motorists are believed to be uninsured according to insurance research council but it isnt known what proportion of them are illegal immigrants in inner cities the percentage of uninsured individuals behind the wheel is believed to be substantially higher auto insurance is regulated by individual states and most dont require insurers to limit coverage to people with drivers licenses "we want everyone driving to have liability " says a spokesman for the texas department of insurance the practice of writing auto insurance for unlicensed drivers started with insurers like alliance united a small company focused mainly on nonstandard markets like drivers with bad driving records but larger insurers such as progressive and infinity property &amp casualty corp which also write policies for high risk drivers are active in the business large mainstream insurance companies like state farm insurance co nationwide mutual insurance co and aaa typically require a state drivers license "we want to insure all drivers who want to be insured if the regulations in a state allow us to accept drivers with foreign drivers licenses we price those policies accurately and as the regulation allows and make a policy available to those drivers " says russina sgoureva product manager for progressives agency business in california calls to senior executives at infinity including president james r gober werent returned jose catano an independent agent in southern california runs spanish language radio spots to drum up business with illegal immigrants using a slogan referring to gov schwarzenegger "arnold wont give you a license but catano will give you insurance " what makes illegal immigrants a particularly profitable market he says is that they rarely report small accidents to avoid contact with u s authorities "its very lucrative " he adds "we have good retention " earlier this month mr catano received approval to operate in nevada and arizona both of which deny licenses to illegal immigrants one of mr catanos clients is jose rodriguez a year old illegal immigrant from mexico who drives a honda civic and pays &# a month for insurance "i feel much safer driving knowing that i have insurance " he says "all my friends without papers are getting it " in his car mr rodriguez carries his auto registration and proof of insurance on him he carries a matricula consular card instead of a drivers license "we are the dmv were not ice immigration and customs enforcement " says a spokesman for the nevada department of motor vehicles "its not our issue if you are in the country illegally by law you have to have insurance if you have a car "
