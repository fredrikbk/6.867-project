tpg considers selling stake with pension fund twist another powerful buyout firm is considering selling a small stake to outside investors but instead of engineering an initial public offering of stock tpg the investment operation managed by turnaround specialists david bonderman and jim coulter is in very early discussions with some of its large pension fund investors to acquire a stake under according to people familiar with the matter tpg formerly texas pacific group has been at the heart of some of the biggest buyout deals of the current boom including txu corp the large texas utility burger king holdings inc and neiman marcus group it is unclear how much tpg could net from selling the stake but it would likely be billions of dollars the company manages &# billion to &# billion in investment assets typically private equity firms raise large sums from pension funds and put the money into individual funds that invest in companies or units this would be different because it would make the pension funds partial owners of tpg itself this could be a prelude to an ipo as the firm and its investors could sell a stake to the public later tpgs contemplated move comes as investors await blackstone groups planned ipo scheduled for mid june ever since blackstone announced its plans a host of its rivals have been considering creative ways to raise cash apollo management lp for example is expected to follow soon the sale of a stake in tpg would give messrs bonderman and coulter hard cash as well as a firm valuation that could underpin a future offer that is what fortress investment group did when it sold a stake to a unit of nomura securities of japan before its listing on the new york stock exchange this year goldman sachs group inc did the same in the s and s selling stakes in itself to japans sumitomo bank and hawaiis kamehameha schools trust before going public in tpg signed a confidentiality agreement with oregon and is in talks with other of its largest investors some of its large investors include the california public employees retirement system or calpers and california state teachers retirement system or calstrs both california retirement funds and washington state investment board people familiar with the matter said a move now would allow tpg to lock in money long term from investors potentially at the expense of its competitors "public pension funds have huge amounts of money but not unlimited amounts of money " says mario giannini head of hamilton lane which invests in private equity on behalf of pension funds and endowments it is indirectly one of the largest investors in tpg funds but isnt involved in this deal "there is a limited amount of money in the market" as private equity firms target ever larger funds he said speaking generally in addition to selling a stake in the management company tpg is considering a second move that could also open the fund to more public investors tpg is considering packaging some of its existing fund investments in a new public company that could be bought and sold by stock market investors in a slightly different move last year kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co raised &# billion for a publicly listed fund in amsterdam which essentially gives public investors a chance to invest in kkr deals alongside large institutional investors the kkr company kkr private equity investors hasnt traded well because it hasnt been fully invested meaning it has had lots of cash earning low returns by contrast the possible tpg structure would bundle existing investments made by tpg and its limited partners investors in a new public company its existing investors would in exchange receive a slice of the stock in the newly listed company it is hard to structure deals like this because the value of underlying companies is often hard to discern but proponents see the appeal listing it allows its limited partners to cash out when they choose to rather than having their money locked up conditions are about as good as it gets for private equity stock markets are hitting records which give private equity investors a chance to raise new money and to cash out of their holdings and debt markets are awash in cash making it easy for buyout kings to raise money for deals financed by low interest loans at a conference in new york days ago henry kravis founding partner of kkr described current conditions as the industrys "golden age " and last week david rubenstein co founder of carlyle group was telling audiences at the milken global institute "it cant get better " such talk has given rise to speculation that these new capital raising initiatives mark a peak for private equity in any case the quest to free themselves from repeated rounds of fund raising would likely continue regardless of the cycle tpg has tried to stay out of the limelight last year when it raised its most recent fund it found that it had commitments of more than &# billion making its fund as large as that of blackstone while blackstone upped the ante raising almost &# billion tpg happily surrendered the title of the worlds largest fund
