campus clash as it struggles to change school mirrors koreas woes kaist sought overhaul hired a nobel laureate radical ideas got an f daejeon south korea for decades the korea advanced institute for science and technology has helped fuel this countrys dramatic economic boom but its recent skirmish with an american academic and a campus clash of ideas and ideologies illustrates some of the challenges facing south korea as it adjusts to a tough new climate since its founding in kaist has been one of the leading training grounds for top scientists and engineers manufacturing giants like samsung lg and hyundai have come to rely on the school for its steady stream of graduates three years ago the south korean government fearing that this industrialized economy was failing to keep up with the times decided state run kaist needed an overhaul the new goal produce more groundbreaking research and in the process help low profile kaist gain a place on the international academic radar despite a swift rebound from the asian financial crisis of the late nineties growth in south korea has slowed as low cost manufacturing has shifted to chinese competitors meanwhile south koreas other neighbor japan is newly resurgent after more than a decade of economic doldrums "korea is a small country between the two major economies " says rim kwan former chairman of kaists board of trustees he believes that in order to survive his country needs to move away from the manufacturing sector which kaist was founded to sustain and find "our own blue ocean " as opposed to a "red ocean" that is bloodied by competition in a crowded market "its about finding new business models " he says and kaist must change accordingly to take up the task dr rim and the korean ministry of science and technology which controls and funds kaist took the unusual step of recruiting a nobel prize winning american physicist named robert b laughlin agreeing to name him president in the summer of both the ministry and the kaist board gave him wide latitude to re engineer the school the schools first non korean president dr laughlin knew little about korea or kaist yet he envisioned bold reforms he wanted to expand the curriculum to include more liberal arts offerings as well as pre law and pre med programs dr laughlin also thought that more classes should be taught in english and that the school should charge tuition as a way to wean itself from government dependence in short he set out to remake kaist in the mold of a top american private university dr laughlin a stanford physicist is a talkative man quick to express his opinions his perspective as an outsider was part of his appeal "innovation is very difficult to initiate with a man from inside " says dr rim dr laughlin also had a connection to kaist through a friendship with salk sung ho a leading south korean academic and a member of kaists board of trustees though he lacked administrative experience dr laughlins nobel prize in physics gave him prestige a nobel in the sciences is a stamp of international recognition that many koreans covet says lee yong hee a kaist physics professor koreans "are crazy about nobel prize winners " a california native who graduated from the university of california at berkeley dr laughlin years old earned a ph d in physics from massachusetts institute of technology and worked at bell labs before becoming a professor at stanford he won his nobel in for work he did in theoretical physics at the age of in june of dr salk flew to san francisco with a few other government and university officials to offer dr laughlin &# a year to take the job or about &# more than past kaist presidents had earned at a meeting at his suburban home near the stanford university campus in palo alto calif dr laughlin recalls the korean delegation told him "this is a chance to make an impact itll be easy youll just go there and be yourself " dr laughlin who is married with two grown children discussed the offer with his wife anita and accepted a few days later when dr laughlin arrived at kaist in july of he settled into the presidents house on campus on the outskirts of daejeon koreas fifth largest city and an hour south of seoul by high speed train koreans seemed receptive to a fresh start spearheaded by a foreigner in dutch soccer coach guus hiddink had set an unlikely precedent by leading south koreas soccer team to an upset fourth place finish at the world cup some koreans spoke of dr laughlin as a kind of scientific hiddink who could help bring the institution more fame and prestige as he immersed himself in his new job he developed pointed opinions about kaist he says he saw it as an aging institution and a byproduct of koreas old approach to business in december dr laughlin sent a six page draft proposal to the kaist faculty outlining his reform plan one initiative was aimed at shifting more of the schools resources to undergraduates students in their more formative years and away from the graduate school which he viewed as a ph d mill another idea was to peg professors and researchers pay to their achievements noting that many of stanfords undergraduates were enrolled in either pre law or pre med programs he was keen to bring the two disciplines to kaist he lobbied for courses in the arts and music and suggested building a recording studio for students on kaists campus in arguing for the more creative curriculum dr laughlin a skilled classical pianist himself said that mathematical and musical ability are often correlated and should both be nurtured one of dr laughlins proposals was especially controversial until then kaists tuition was almost entirely subsidized by the government his plan to charge students tuition that would then wean kaist off its dependence on government largess his suggestion implied a wholesale change in kaists mission "the current model " he wrote in his proposal "is to contract with the government to supply highly intelligent well trained workers to industry at low cost the new model is to contract with parents and students to create an excellent general purpose educational environment weighted toward science and engineering " it was he argued "the only way forward " dr laughlin invited the schools entire faculty to a meeting on campus to discuss his ideas some professors had gotten wind of some of his proposals and had already gathered in smaller groups to express their opinions but in the campus auditorium their concerns erupted as they fired questions at the president one faculty member stood up and said "this document is like a tsunami " yoon choon sup a kaist physics professor who was also at the meeting says he was deeply worried "these are drastic changes fundamental changes " he remembers thinking many of kaists professors didnt believe re creating stanford outside of seoul was the answer although they did acknowledge the school needed to update its approach they also maintained that the university had an obligation to train top flight engineers to sharpen koreas industrial edge lim hyung kyu a graduate of kaist and the president of the samsung advanced institute of technology which has some joint research projects with the school says that he does not think introducing pre law and pre med programs into the curriculum would be a good idea "im not sure how those kind of things help " he says "certainly if you have so many things its like an ordinary national university " some of the faculty bridled at the idea of a tuition model they viewed subsidies as the best way to attract top and needy talent they believed the korean government needed to continue its financial support of the countrys scientific establishment in order to nurture future engineers "korea has no resources except manpower " says park o ok a professor of chemistry and biomolecular engineering and one of dr laughlins most outspoken opponents "so we have to focus on science and technology to develop our country in our case customer is government next customer is industry that is the priority " some members of kaists board agreed in principle with a number of the new presidents ideas dr rim the boards chairman at the time concurred that kaist should eventually reduce its government funding but gradually he also viewed the pre law and pre med programs as reasonable additions but it was faculty resistance that prevented dr laughlin from presenting his draft proposal in its original form to the ministry instead one of his deputies helped modify it to make it more acceptable to the faculty dropping some of its most contentious language and ideas and forging a temporary compromise over the next few months however the rift between dr laughlin and his faculty widened by this time dr laughlin an imposing figure at about feet tall with a dollop of snow white hair had earned a reputation for arrogance among the faculty dr yoon from the physics department remembers meeting with dr laughlin and being turned off after dr laughlin monopolized the conversation "this was not only me but that was the impression of other professors " says dr yoon "he just gave his opinions he talked and talked and talked " although he concedes that he had firm ideas dr laughlin says he was a good listener the faculty accused dr laughlin of spending too much time abroad and neglecting his duties the korea times obtained a copy of his personal schedule and ran a story with an exhaustive table detailing each of his trips back to the u s dr laughlin describes the travel flap as a "fake problem invented to destabilize my presidency " he confirms that he took paid leave rather than vacation time to tour the u s to promote a book he had written about theoretical physics but he says the trips didnt violate the terms of his contract the school newspaper written in korean began printing negative articles about his presidency which he dismissed as "propaganda " dr laughlin wanting to reach more students from abroad tried to persuade the kaist times to add english translations to its web site when students resisted dr laughlin found someone to translate the articles and then prepared a sample web page for the students to see but his methods proved unpopular ryu keun chan a member of koreas national assembly who was involved in kaists oversight cited cultural issues as a problem dr laughlin he says "could not communicate his ideas to students and professors " dr laughlin doesnt think that cultural issues played much of a role during his tenure "i find that when koreans bring up those subjects theyre mostly trying to deflect the conversation away from the issues they really care about money and job security because talking about them in public is taboo " in an attempt to assert his control dr laughlin in december set out to personally interview and evaluate every one of kaists or so faculty members focusing mainly on the quality of their research projects and academic work for those professors who agreed to the interviews he gave them a one paragraph summary grading their work from "unimportant" to "very important " his general conclusion that while kaist had some faculty who were "truly inspirational " the school also had a lot of "deadwood" faculty compared with mit or stanford suh nam pyo kaists current president says that he has not evaluated the schools faculty members individually but has found kaist has "many excellent professors " the evaluations united the faculty against dr laughlin and professors began to speak out against him in class the final blow came in march of last year when department heads submitted a letter threatening to resign if dr laughlin did not step down as president around the time of the interviews dr salk took a train to daejeon to meet with dr laughlin at his office on campus and told him it was "maybe better to resign rather than hanging onto it i was really concerned as a friend he was losing his reputation " dr laughlin declined to step down to this day he is convinced that dr salk his longtime confidant tipped the balance of the board when his renewal came up last spring and was rejected dr salk declined to say how he voted lina yoon in seoul contributed to this article
