u s stocks benefit from global growth the u s accounts for of the worlds economy and its the planets most important customer with of all imports so when the u s economy stumbles the world usually does as well but not now the u s has been slowing for a year with growth at an annual rate of just in the first quarter yet growth in the rest of the world remains solid and in some areas is accelerating japans economy grew in the first quarter and the "euro zone" countries that use the euro grew by according to j p morgan chase latin america expanded by and asia excluding japan expanded by led by double digit growth in china and india economists refer to this as "decoupling " and it has potential benefits to american investors its not only that they can insulate themselves from a u s slowdown by buying foreign stocks and currencies they can even benefit at home because u s companies are doing more business overseas than ever u s stocks are more protected from a slower growing domestic market its a little surprising to see the u s and the rest of the world go separate ways as the international monetary fund notes in an april report global markets have become more integrated and international trade more important in recent decades that should make business cycles more synchronized across countries rather than less but this time is different because the u s slowdown is rooted mostly in housing houses are almost entirely built in the u s by u s workers so the housing slump has had very little impact among our trading partners by contrast the collapse in technology and telecom investment in and fell hard on companies in canada asia and europe that exported high tech products to the u s some countries have also become less dependent on the u s in japan sent of its exports to the u s by last year that had fallen to according to stephen jen currency strategist at morgan stanley in the same period japans exports to the rest of asia rose from to of the total even countries still closely linked to the u s are benefiting indirectly from the boom in china the u s accounts for of canadas exports but voracious chinese demand has driven up the prices of many canadian commodities such as oil and nickel buoying canadas economy currency and stock market u s investors can exploit the divergence between u s and overseas growth without even leaving home howard silverblatt an analyst at standard &amp poors notes u s companies for years have been expanding foreign operations now foreign sales represent of the total sales of companies in the s&amp p stock index that report the data up from in with the rest of the world outpacing the u s "all those increasing sales have become significant " mr silverblatt says many u s companies have highlighted the boost to recent profit from overseas operations among them whirlpool coca cola and caterpillar thats one reason the dow jones industrial average is up so far this year not too far behind the gain for a dow jones index of world stocks excluding the u s "the u s equity market has decoupled from the u s economy " says morgan stanleys mr jen vadim zlotnikov strategist at sanford c bernstein says the sectors with the largest foreign exposure are technology and consumer staples which each get more than of their sales from overseas last year foreign sales grew substantially faster than u s sales for both surprisingly he says large and small companies tend to have similar exposure to foreign markets all the same investors in u s stocks have suffered indirectly because the u s dollar has fallen against a basket of its trading partners currencies since september that has boosted returns on foreign stocks in dollar terms relative to u s stocks one factor weighing on the dollar is interest rates the federal reserve in response to the slowdown stopped raising rates last year and the market believes it may cut them this year by contrast the bank of japan european central bank and bank of england have been raising rates that makes interest bearing investments overseas more attractive helping buoy the euro and the british pound though not the japanese yen relative to the dollar in recent months mr jen says that if the u s continues to grow more slowly than the rest of the world the dollar will probably continue to fall and investors should favor investments denominated in the euro pound and australian and canadian dollars however some experts caution that the biggest profits have already been made on foreign stocks and they might actually be headed for a period of underperformance michael hughes chief investment officer at baring asset management in london says world stocks could face a "headwind" if those countries economies overheat and their central banks raise rates much more the decoupling may soon end economists expect u s growth to pick up around midyear as the housing market stabilizes that means the first quarter may mark the low point for u s growth mr jen says investors might benefit by increasing holdings of riskier assets in particular the currencies and stocks of emerging market countries which tend to do well when the world growth outlook is improving but what if the u s gets worse and actually slides into a recession that could happen if for example the contraction in the u s housing market spills over to consumer spending more generally perhaps because consumers dont feel as wealthy when their homes are no longer appreciating in that case expect the world to recouple in a fashion that spells trouble with the faltering u s economy pulling other economies down the u s share of the rest of the worlds exports has actually risen since the s moreover the imf notes that the integration of global markets means a big move in u s markets is more likely to spill over to other countries so if the u s stock market turns south or investors flee the riskier parts of its bond market those shocks could quickly ripple around the world much as the nasdaq collapse in rippled through to high tech stocks in europe that would be bad for stocks everywhere email forum sunday wsj com
