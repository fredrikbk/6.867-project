eyes on the road what will your daughter drive culling the list of used car options based on safety and reliability online edition buying a car thats appropriate for a teenage driver is no easy task but since i may have to attempt it soon i decided to dust off the eyes on the road teen car search system my younger daughter who is six months away from qualifying for a drivers license has somehow acquired a robust interest in cars she has strong opinions about the kind of ride she wants and clipped out of the newspaper a dozen or so classified ads for cars shed be willing to drive see the list lets assume i am willing to spend the money so as to free myself of the occasional obligation to act as a part time taxi driver should i buy one of the cars on her list the system i use is nothing fancy its based on correlating information thats available on the web in several different places i started where most experts in automotive safety say you should begin a search for a young persons car ruling out body on frame pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles these vehicles with their high centers of gravity and higher than average rollover risk can be unforgiving in the hands of an inexperienced driver that limits the field mainly to passenger cars safety experts prefer larger cars with smaller engines many teens like smaller cars especially now with gasoline around &# a gallon i decided to first look for used cars with head protecting side airbags as either standard or optional equipment fortunately sifting for vehicles with a specific feature on a car shopping web site is getting easier kelley blue book www kbb com has a function called "perfect car finder" that helped me to sort for vehicles with head protecting airbags priced below &# other car shopping sites have or soon will have similar functions that price level may be too high for some families and it might seem not enough for others but based on the results that price seemed about right to give me a choice of later model compacts and older midsize or large models from there i tried to narrow the field to vehicles that had at least average reliability scores as measured by consumer reports and had good safety ratings from both the insurance institute for highway safety and the national highway traffic safety administration my filters didnt let a lot of my daughters picks get through right away one of my daughters favorite cars fell by the wayside thats the original scion xb the boxy little mini wagon known to its fans as the "toaster " the scion xb has been a sales hit for toyota motor corp but this vehicle designed for the japanese market is very light just about pounds and lacks head protecting side airbags it earned three out of five stars on the nhtsa side impact test &lt ndash&gt and garnered a "poor" side impact score from the insurance institute the new scion xb launching now has head protecting side airbags and is larger overall the better to protect occupants but the new xb is less of a bargain with a starting price of &# up &# from the old model another car my daughter picked out of the classifieds based on its low price was a chevrolet cavalier but it fell off the list because it was rated poor on the insurance institutes front crash test and earned only one star for side impact protection from the nhtsa indeed nhtsas site flags the cavaliers side impact score with a boldface black "safety concern" label a chevy malibu had "acceptable" crash ratings from nhtsa but consumer reports labels it "much worse than average" for reliability sometimes the data conflicted a kia spectra well within the target price range has side curtain airbags it got a four star ratings from nhtsa for both front and drivers side impact protection but the iihs rated it poor in its frontal crash test the toyota corolla a paragon of reliability according to consumer reports merits only four stars out of five for front crash safety and three out of five for side impact protection on nhtsas test among the cars that stood out from the pack is the honda accord lx it has five star nhtsa front crash ratings and four star side impact ratings it earned "good" ratings from iihs and has demonstrated much better than average reliability a two year old accord has a likely selling price of around &# according to kbb com another good choice would be a honda civic with a five star front four star side crash rating from nhtsa double "good" scores from the iihs better than average quality scores and a price pegged just under &# a volvo s also makes the cut nhtsa gave it a four star front crash rating five star side it has a "good" score from the insurance institute and consumer reports rates it better than average likely price around &# according to kbb com this points out a good strategy for scoring a second hand car with better than average safety technology buy a used luxury car you may pay about the same for a five or six year old luxury car that you would for a much newer mass market brand model but european luxury cars such as the audi a moved more rapidly than mainstream american and japanese brands to adopt side airbags and anti lock brakes a volkswagen passat of or vintage got over the bar with nhtsa scores of five stars for front crash four star ratings for side impact protection it has side curtain airbags and an average rating for reliability if you can find a chevy impala with the optional side airbags it scored five front four side on nhtsas tests a "good" score on the iihs front crash test and scores average on reliability i looked at two other popular midsized cars the toyota camry and ford taurus the camry and taurus didnt score as well the impala on the nhtsa front crash test with four star ratings each both are rated good by the iihs for performance in its front crash test the camry scored a good for side impact protection when equipped with optional side curtain airbags the taurus has no side impact score from the iihs but rated a better than average reliability rating from consumer reports and the camry earned a much better than average rating from consumer reports as with the impala the key is to make sure the used car you buy has the optional side airbags my daughter was pleased to learn that the pontiac vibe a youth oriented mini wagon thats in plentiful supply in the detroit area got through the hurdles but the vibe also illustrates how the welter of different rating systems used by the various scorekeepers of automotive goodness can be confusing for consumers the pontiac vibe earned a five star front and a five star side crash rating from nhtsa and there arent that many cars that get a five star side impact score this is somewhat surprising because the vibe was tested without side airbags according to nhtsas site the car did have available chest protecting side airbags from on according to a pontiac spokesman the iihs doesnt post a ranking for the model consumer reports rates the vibe much better than average and this may be a selling point for some the vibe and the mechanically similar toyota matrix are both built by union workers in a california factory thats owned by a joint venture of toyota and general motors corp but when nhtsa retested model vibes following some design changes to the interior it got only three stars for front seat occupant protection in the government side impact crash test a spokesman for pontiac says the vibes chest protecting side airbag was made less powerful in in response to a change in nhtsas test the change was aimed at making cars safer for very small drivers but the less powerful side airbag resulted in less protection for a larger driver nhtsa hasnt posted a side impact score for the model vibe equipped with side curtain airbags so the vibe is provisionally on my list although i would rather hold out for a car that had good scores and head protecting side airbags my daughter may not be excited about the prospect that the "right" car for her could be something as plain as a second hand honda accord then again she could just keep on riding her bike send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
