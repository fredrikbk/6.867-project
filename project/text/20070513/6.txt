love &amp money the too high price of being green to quote a famous frog "its not easy being green " im finding just how accurate that is after having shopped recently for a new car and as my wife amy and i remodel our bathroom where possible were trying to think environmentally but i have to say kermit was right green isnt easy the reason green is expensive hybrid cars are pricier than their equivalent counterparts and require years of operation before you recoup that cost assuming you own the car long enough solar panels are insanely pricey and make no sense economically even the tankless water heater i recently bought was much costlier than a traditional unit as such this effort to be eco friendly is pitting my personal values against the value of a dollar and honestly the value of a dollar is winning more often than not which leads to the question ive been contemplating in recent weeks how much green are we consumers willing to spend to go green i know i risk angering a lot of people in the green movement who argue that environmentalism is about doing right by the environment not your wallet its about thinking broadly about the future were passing on to our children its about the planets survival philosophically im with you but philosophy doesnt pay my bills its one thing for california gov arnold schwarzenegger to rework his hummer to run on zero emission hydrogen for him for many high profile celebrities now painting themselves green it isnt a financial inconvenience in fact it could help them financially if it boosts their careers but it makes a huge difference for the average family to dump thousands of extra dollars into a hybrid vehicle after all when youre trying to save for retirement and your kids college tuition when youre trying to pay off the mortgage the car note and student loans when youre swamped by the everyday costs of life green sometimes just means a deeper shade of red in your checkbook my friend tara a single mom in pennsylvania is itching to go green she wants to upgrade to an environmentally friendly water heater and windows solar panels to power her house an eco friendly car she has done her homework researched all the tax credits available "id like to do all the things i can do to make myself less of a burden to the planet " she says and yet theres desire and then theres reality "i want to do it " tara says "but it will take decades before it makes financial sense if i knew i was going to stay in my house for years id do the solar thing but i dont have that much certainty " laura a friend in baltimore says her husband has long been fixated on solar energy but no matter where theyve lived the economics of solar have never worked out the same is true with hybrid cars "its hard to justify &# for a prius when you can spend &# for a civic or corolla that gets generally similar gas mileage " she says laura and her husband tried to do the environmental thing when remodeling their year old house installing energy efficient windows and foam insulation but at some point green comes down to time and budget she says "we already had decisions to make and the house already needed way more than we could afford so taking the time and money to track down certified sustainable lumber for the framing or reclaimed lumber for the floor just got dropped " and then theres my colleague suzanne in new jersey who would like to replace her aging minivan with a hybrid "thats big enough for our family and actually saves gas " but she and her husband arent impressed enough by any models to justify paying the extra money her family bought a new energy efficient air conditioner and water heater "but i have to take it on faith that were really saving money " she says "i envisioned seeing big decreases in my bills but electric and natural gas rates have increased so its hard to tell i feel dwarfed by the mass pollution that exists outside my little world and i wonder if the earth really benefits from my newspaper recycling " before amy settled on her minivan i spent time last year exploring hybrid vehicles i liked that they could trim emissions as well as our monthly gas bill but the added cost of the vehicle when compared with a similar model never made a lot of sense financially we would generally break even just about the time we would need to replace the car and the truth is we probably wont keep the car that long and the gas mileage isnt all that better than what wed get from a comparable nonhybrid similar reasoning kept me from buying the solar panels i want i like the idea of relying simply on sunlight to power our lives and id love to see my electric meter run backward but theres no financial benefit i just cant see laying out &# to &# for a system that even if it saves me roughly &# a month and even if i do get some rebates wont pay for itself for years or more and thats breaking even just on the cost not the income lost because we have all that money in photovoltaic panels instead of an investment generating additional income for the familys needs basically what im saying is this im only willing to go so far to do my part including specialized parts and labor we spent more than &# on a tankless water heater more than five times the cost of a traditional unit we also looked at this tankless model runs only when water is on eliminating the need to keep gallons of water constantly hot just in case i need a few ounces or a couple of gallons at some point that makes sense and were putting in bamboo floors specifically because its a renewable grass that reaches maturity quickly and helps the economies of developing nations and im all for that plus the cost was comparable to other flooring so it was a no brainer but the unavoidable flaw in the eco movement as it currently exists is that my family like the bulk of families has more pressing financial concerns constraining our ability to save the planet as laura says this is a public policy issue middle america wont cant rush to buy green cars and green energy alternatives until governments mandate all cars run on alternative fuels and all new homes be built with solar panels or fuel cells or until prices for those options fall to a mass market level until then well only be green around the edges of our wallet jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the
