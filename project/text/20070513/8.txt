small business for the web choose your words carefully theres no denying it how easily youre found on the web these days can make or break your business and one surefire way to be found is to land near the top of the results for common searches on popular web search engines like google com and yahoo com a big factor in how high or low in anyones search list your business appears is what keywords are used the words and phrases a web surfer types into a search engine when hunting for a product or service online search engines scan a sites content and hidden code and the words that appear most often are probably the ones that you will rank highest for some businesses achieve high rankings for their chosen keywords another way by paying for them pay per click ads such as googles adwords program let businesses bid a price on keywords they want to rank well for links to their web sites then appear often under the header "sponsored links " next to the "natural" search results the search engine generates whenever someone clicks on their link they pay a fee either way you go using keywords to improve search rankings only helps business if you use the right ones and thats sometimes tricky many larger companies can spend a fortune on firms that help them best use the short generic terms such as "insurance " or "luggage " on the other hand longer specific phrases think "honeydew colored suitcases" may aptly describe what you sell but potential customers are unlikely to use them in a search so how do you strike a balance and find the best keywords for your web site heres some guidance much of keyword selection involves trial and error and figuring out what words potential customers actually type into the search box to find your types of products says aaron wall an oakland calif search marketing consultant a good start is to use a web analytics program on your site google analytics and clicktracks are two that work by installing some basic code into the script of your web site the programs track statistics about your web site such as the number of visitors what search terms visitors use to get there and whether they actually make a purchase google analytics which is free lets you get a geographic breakdown of where your visitors are coming from other web tools help you see what search terms are most popular for your industry yahoos keyword selector tool and googles adwords keyword tool let you see the search volumes for a particular phrase and related phrases in the past month the goal is to find keywords with the highest search volume but the least competition that describe your product or service for instance typing "pillow" into googles adwords tool shows that while the word is searched often its also used by many other web sites but related search terms such as "microbead pillow " "bed pillow" and "pillow cushion " are searched nearly as often but have fewer sites vying for them other tools are designed to help site owners use keywords more effectively hittail com for instance offers a product that analyzes your web traffic and suggests keywords to include in the content along with how to use them a smart strategy for small businesses especially those on a tight budget is using longer more specific phrases the advantage while fewer people search for them those searchers are more likely to find exactly what theyre looking for so more specific keywords tend to convert to business more often says matt mcgee a small business expert at marchex a seattle search marketing firm "if youre a bookseller in topeka youre not going to beat out amazon com or barnes &amp noble" for a general word like books he says but "you might be able to go after used books or self help books " choice keywords arent always obvious dale &amp thomas popcorn an englewood n j popcorn chain uses analytics software to track its web traffic and search phrases the site focuses on keywords like "gourmet popcorn" and "popcorn tins " but some of its most effective keywords were less apparent until it started analyzing traffic says marketing director deborah krier more people were typing "kettle corn" as two words when searching so the site began using it as two words instead of one it also discovered that many customers were finding the site by searching for popcorn flavors like "chocolate popcorn" and "caramel popcorn" so it boosted the use of those phrases once a business unearths the most effective keywords those words and similar relevant phrases should be peppered into the sites text and in the sites title tags the blue bar that runs on the top of the web browser and the invisible metatags that describe each pages content each page of a web site might have its own keywords for instance a furniture store might focus on the word "loveseats" on a page that displays sofas and loveseats and focus on "cherry oak dining room tables" on a page that sells those but while its important that your chosen keywords appear regularly in your site they should appear naturally in the text and not be overly repetitive "you have to remember that real people are reading your copy " says ms krier "its a little bit of an art " adding extra content to a site such as a blog or informational guides that include those keywords can also help boost search rankings because theres more opportunity for keywords to be used businesses serving a particular geographic market might also fare better by using their location as a keyword many search engines now prominently feature businesses located in a particular region a dentist in denver for instance might choose to focus on the keyword phrases "denver dentist" and "denver dental practice " the address of the business should also be displayed prominently on the web site since the engines now often extract location information directly from the site kelly k spors covers small business for the wall street journal write her at kelly spors wsj com jonathan clements
