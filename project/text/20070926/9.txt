an early look at tax brackets for next year most people will get a modest dose of tax relief next year but high income taxpayers are likely to receive a bigger portion each year the government is required to adjust many tax related numbers including income thresholds to reflect inflation for example in most cases the top federal rate of wont kick in unless taxable income received in exceeds &# up from a threshold of &# for upper income taxpayers will benefit not only from these changes which mean that more income will be taxed at lower rates but also from other inflation adjustments that will enable them to keep more of their itemized deductions and personal exemption amounts many high income taxpayers will also be helped by complex tax law changes enacted in that are scheduled to take effect in these changes will ease the sting of so called stealth tax provisions that impose limits on personal exemptions and certain itemized deductions theyre known as stealth taxes because they increase how much someone pays in taxes without raising tax rates and thus often are overlooked by the public official income thresholds and other inflation adjusted tax data affecting returns to be filed in wont be available from the internal revenue service until later this year instead three private sector tax analysts george jones of cch a wolters kluwer business william massey ria tax analyst at thomson tax &amp accounting and northern illinois university prof james c young crunched the numbers their calculations based on recently released government data on inflation have proven to be highly reliable in the past naturally if the government revises the inflation data the projections may change among next years changes the basic standard deduction typically claimed by about two thirds of all taxpayers will increase to &# up &# from this year for married couples filing jointly for most singles it will rise to &# up from &# the personal exemption amount will rise by &# to &# how much tax relief the changes bring will vary widely depending on the intricacies of each taxpayers tax and income situations its especially difficult for millions of people to project their taxes because of uncertainty about what if anything congress will do to restrain the growth of the alternative minimum tax or amt for or the amt whose origins date to the late s is a separate way to calculate taxes with many rules that differ from those of the regular system temporarily higher amt exclusion amounts expired at the end of last year unless congress changes the law about million people will be hit by the amt for up from about four million in a treasury spokesman estimates congress is expected to approve a temporary cure in coming months for but nobody knows precisely what that fix will look like or what lawmakers will do about its also unclear whether congress will extend the life of several other provisions scheduled to expire at the end of this year such as the option to deduct state and local income or sales taxes leaving aside these questions the inflation adjustments alone will bring "modest" relief to most taxpayers next year says cchs mr jones because of the bracket adjustments a married couple filing jointly with taxable income of &# will pay about &# less in income taxes for than they will on the same income for mr jones says a key reason upper income taxpayers are likely to enjoy more of a tax savings next year the tax law changes affecting limits on personal exemptions and certain itemized deductions here the subject gets tricky in essence you lose part of your personal exemptions and certain itemized deductions once your income goes above certain levels these levels are adjusted annually for inflation for example most taxpayers will begin to lose some of the value of certain itemized deductions once their adjusted gross income for exceeds &# thats up &# from &# for this provision is often referred to in washington lobbying circles as "pease " after a former congressman married couples filing jointly will begin to lose some of the value of their personal exemptions when income exceeds &# up from &# for but there is a new wrinkle for says mr massey after applying the income limits "you get to keep two thirds of the amount you would otherwise lose " tax preparation software can help you crunch the numbers when youre trying to project taxes for some important tax limits wont change even though theyre indexed for inflation for example the annual gift tax exclusion will remain unchanged at &# next year because inflation didnt increase enough to affect the number the annual gift tax exclusion refers to the maximum amount you can give away to anyone you want and to each of as many people as you want without any tax considerations moreover you can pay for someones education or medical bills without having those payments count towards the annual limit just make sure you make those payments directly to the educational or medical provider instead of handing it over to your beneficiary state tax revenue growth perks up a new survey says state tax revenues rose in this years april june quarter from the same quarter last year according to a survey to be released soon by analysts at the nelson a rockefeller institute of government thats an improvement over each of the three previous quarters but its
