a cultural conversation with marin alsop leading the bso in a new direction when the american conductor marin alsop opens her inaugural season as music director of the baltimore symphony orchestra this week she will become the first woman ever to head a major american orchestra tomorrow she and the bso play at the orchestras second home the strathmore music center in north bethesda md and on friday at the orchestras chief home baltimores meyerhoff symphony hall her inaugural program already demonstrates her original thinking not for her the usual selection of old chestnuts so typical of these seasonal openers instead ms alsop or the maestra as the orchestra bills her is flexing her intellectual muscle and her orchestras with an unusual repertoire at once complex powerful and eminently approachable "fearful symmetries" by john adams among todays most widely performed contemporary american composers whose music blends minimalist rhythmic drive and often a noteworthy melodic profile and gustav mahlers fifth symphony discussing this program recently over sandwiches in new york ms alsop observed that "a lot of what i do in baltimore will be driven by programming especially putting new and old repertoire side by side so that people have a jolt of recognition and put things in a new perspective " "jolt" is an apt noun for this inaugural considering the uproar that ensued when the orchestras management announced in that it had chosen ms alsop to succeed the russian conductor yuri temirkanov at the time she was the popular music director of englands bournemouth symphony orchestra a guest conductor of international importance a frequent music commentator on the bbc and a steadily increasing baton presence on naxos compact discs known as a vital interpreter of american music she is also known for talking to the audience about the music she is about to conduct unfortunately the appointment was announced just when the baltimore management and musicians were barely on speaking terms many orchestra members declared that they hadnt had sufficient input in the selection process ms alsop observes that "i got caught in cross fire that was really unexpected " noting that she had previously guest conducted the orchestra about eight times since she says that "they kept inviting me back and each experience had been positive and rewarding " but even at the height of the controversy "i never really thought it was personal " she says that "the whole institution was dysfunctional they had a huge debt their subscriptions were down to they hadnt made a recording in years and had virtually fallen off the map in terms of profile " nevertheless having told the board that she was willing to become music director and "having already spent the six prior weeks asking myself if i could have a positive impact on the orchestra the thought of withdrawing under those circumstances was pretty much unthinkable what would people say she came up against a little pressure and ran like a mouse "moreover i really thought the job was right for me i felt that despite this my experiences with the musicians the audience and the baltimore community had been genuinely positive " one major problem had been a lack of communication between the musicians and management "the musicians felt shut out and i think they hadnt been properly taken care of as human beings in a long time " therefore ms alsop decided "to stick it out and try to deal with the musicians as i would like to be dealt with honestly and transparently i told the board i wouldnt sign until i had spoken with the musicians alone so hugh wolf very kindly gave me minutes of his rehearsal and i just walked in i laid out an artistic plan what i thought i could bring to them what obstacles and hurdles i expected to encounter and i talked candidly to them about this extremely traumatic appointment process admitting that it would take some time to get over but that i was determined to put it behind us and i think that was the start of a relationship " apparently determination has always been part of her nature born in new york the daughter of professional musicians ms alsop studied at yale before switching to juilliard where she received her bachelors and masters degrees in violin but she was profoundly drawn to conducting at one point she would invite musician friends to her new york apartment with blandishments of beer and pizza in return for letting her conduct them after theyd gorged themselves in and she worked as a tanglewood conducting fellow with her greatest idol leonard bernstein previously in she had formed her own ensemble the concordia orchestra to learn a conductors requisite professional skills originally financed by a japanese apparel magnate tomio taki for whose wedding ms alsop had been violin soloist concordia disbanded as ms alsops conducting career took flight however its legacy continues in the taki concordia conducting fellowship which ms alsop founded in to provide young women conductors the opportunity to immerse themselves in the art and business of performing classical music mentoring is an important part of her character and like her hero bernstein she manages to bring an underlying spirit of teaching to her concert work her method is to invite her audience and musicians to approach a concert with a spirit of adventure and a willingness to perceive familiar music in a new way citing "baltimores impressive quickness and fleetness with new music " she says that "by programming a wide diversity of repertoire the orchestra will regain and broaden the depth of what they can do for instance playing john adams on the same program as beethoven informs your beethoven while expanding your interpretive vocabulary " not surprisingly therefore a beethoven cycle is a cornerstone of ms alsops first season "this cycle will be informed by and in part conducted by living beethovens contemporary composers " the pairings are certainly stimulating john adams is conducting his own work and beethovens seventh which mr adams regards as beethovens "minimalist" symphony james macmillan is doing beethovens second and a work of his own thomas ades will conduct beethovens first and fourth symphonies and his own violin concerto h k gruber is doing beethovens eighth on a program with his own "frankenstein " conducting the rest of the cycle ms alsop plans to couple "eroica" with john coriglianos rarely performed piano concerto the fifth with christopher rouses flute concerto the "pastorale symphony" with music by aaron jay kernis a composer particularly drawn to nature and finally the ninth with joan towers concerto for orchestra "im really trying to draw parallels between todays music reflecting the events of our own time and beethovens music which reflects the trials he experienced while writing it " in addition to audience discussions with the visiting composers ms alsop is doing a two day event called "csi beethoven " "neuroscientists from johns hopkins university are going to offer a comprehensive overview of beethovens deteriorating health theyre able to simulate beethovens gradual hearing loss so that people can actually experience what must have been beethovens extreme terror and devastation at the time and for the two evenings the orchestra and i will play short musical examples of significant beethoven works to heighten the immediacy of the connection " beyond the music itself ms alsop supported by a new board chairman and almost entirely new management team is ushering in a new era in baltimore in a variety of ways among them an underwriting program saluting meyerhoff halls th anniversary offering every subscription ticket for every seat every concert at &# "the trick is not just to succeed for the one year but to determine the most effective way to follow this up if it proves a financial success why go back " she says there were several hundred people waiting outside the box office the day tickets went on sale to the general public "i dont think thats ever happened before in baltimore so history " discussing her plans to raise public awareness of the orchestra beyond baltimore she says that she and the orchestra started recording a dvorak cycle for naxos in june theres also a disc coming out of mr coriglianos "red violin" concerto with joshua bell on sony for which mr corigliano has composed three additional movements and to celebrate the th anniversary of the peabody institute the nations oldest music academy "we collaborated with hand picked peabody musicians in a concert performance of stravinskys the rite of spring we made this performance available online through itunes and it went to no it surpassed in popularity even the most relaxing classical pieces in the universe i thought well people must be in need of something really edgy right now because rite of spring is about as far from relaxing music as you can get " still she acknowledges theres plenty of work to be done both artistically and toward deepening the relationship between herself and the orchestra "i try not to force things " she says "my friendships are slowly built and long lasting " mr scherer writes about classical music for the journal his new book "a history of american classical music" sourcebooks is being published in october see related letter "letters to the editor praise for
