broadband taxman for internet users the scariest night of this year may fall on the evening after halloween on november the federal internet tax moratorium is due to expire and no committee in congress has acted to make it permanent last thursday prodded by a flurry of gop press conferences senate majority leader harry reid issued a two line statement saying that he had "every expectation that congress will approve a continuation of the moratorium " not exactly a passionate call to protect americas million internet users commerce chairman daniel inouye added later that hes "hopeful" his committee can move a bill this week and he has scheduled a thursday markup listening to recent democratic talking points on the economy you might wonder why congress isnt all over this issue democrats say they want to make the tax system less "regressive " if only they could get something past president bushs veto pen heres an opportunity to prevent imminent tax increases on poor and middle class consumers and the president is ready to sign it as an additional benefit democrats can avoid presiding over the congress that taxed the internet recognizing the political vacuum former new york mayor rudy giuliani endorsed the net tax ban to thunderous applause at a friday event yet the senates mr inouye is planning to bring up only the four year extension authored by delaware senator tom carper a bill that invites governors and mayors to try to slap new taxes on some components of internet access service while claiming that the finished product remains tax free the better bill is the robust permanent ban championed by democrat ron wyden and republicans wayne allard john sununu and john mccain meanwhile on the house side of the capitol action has been held up in the judiciary committee by an unrelated dispute over satellite tv the good news is that chairman john conyers helped extend the law in and is now crafting a bill the bad news is that lobbyists for state and local government are pressuring him to write a short term extension instead of the permanent ban he has previously supported and that is now included in california democrat anna eshoos bill which at co sponsors clocks in as the most popular approach the internet tax freedom act enacted in and since extended twice prevents multiple and discriminatory taxes on the internet in other words different states cant tax the same e commerce transaction and states and cities cant create internet only taxes that dont exist offline so except for a few grandfathered states internet access taxes are banned but a congressional failure to extend the moratorium would quickly show up on monthly bills and not quietly taxes on telephone service can run above more than triple the average general sales tax rate absent the moratorium state revenue departments will begin to issue letters ruling that internet access services are subject to these same sky high telephone tax rates the revenuers will do this because they can until state courts judge their merit not because they need the money state and local governments have enjoyed straight quarters of increasing revenues unable to show that the tax ban hurts states and localities moratorium opponents are now trying out a new argument yes taxes will raise the price of internet access services but consumers dont care about price right congressional staff tempted to buy this line should remember that theyre the ones who will have to answer the phone when consumers start seeing the new charges the indirect impact on constituents could be even more significant a july brookings institution study found that for every increase in broadband penetration america adds about jobs harvard economist dale jorgenson has found that ironically the internets greatest economic benefits have actually occurred since people stopped talking about them "although the internet was commercialized in its main impact on the u s economy has occurred since the dot com crash in " says mr jorgenson in a recent email "the pace of innovation has accelerated considerably and shows no signs of weakening " a permanent ban should be a political lay up but the clock is winding down and congress needs to take a shot
