tech stocks get giddy apple others at all time highs many investors still avoid sector technology stocks are posting big gains after a long period when they were scoffed at by the market and some money managers say the recent rally is just the beginning yesterday three of the best known tech stocks finished at all time highs google inc apple inc and blackberry maker research in motion ltd and the tech dominated nasdaq index of large nonfinancial stocks is now up so far this year reaching its highest level since february "theres a lot to be positive about in tech " says bruce bartlett a portfolio manager at the &# million lord abbett large cap growth fund which has roughly of its assets in tech stocks some investors wont want to hear this of course the nasdaq composite index the symbol of the s bull market and subsequent tech stock crash is at a two month high but remains off from its record close of hit on march still mr bartlett and other money managers rattle off several pluses for tech stocks starting with strong demand from outside the u s that is especially the case in the emerging markets where a company such as cisco systems inc has seen orders increase at a rate approaching while orders in the u s are expanding in the upper teens then there is the technology itself a new generation of products that bring video to desktops and wireless devices is prompting increased investment all along the tech food chain from the networks built by cisco and juniper networks inc that deliver the new video to the semiconductors in the devices that play the video to the newest wireless products from companies like apple that are being snapped up by consumers at a breakneck pace that kind of real demand should translate into stronger profits for a broad swath of tech companies these portfolio managers say "for the first time in many years were going to get some nice earnings growth " says christopher mchugh a senior portfolio manager at turner investment partners which manages about &# billion in the &# million turner new enterprise fund the technology stake has been raised over the summer and now stands at about of the portfolio up from earlier in the year there are other factors providing a tail wind the continued weakening of the dollar is both a short and long term positive in the near term it translates into bigger profits for technology companies which earn as much as of their money in foreign currencies it also can help their competitiveness against non u s companies as the lower dollar helps them undercut such competition on price and win recurring business lower u s interest rates meanwhile could give a lift to stock price multiples something that technology stocks havent enjoyed in years and short of a serious recession tech companies should be less vulnerable to an economic slowdown than sectors such as materials producers which had been a market leader recently another positive for technology stocks is that they have been under owned by a group that has been historically their biggest fans managers of growth stock funds their buying could help extend the rally in technology stocks over the past years large cap stock funds have held an average of of their assets currently &# billion in technology stocks according to morningstar inc but as of the end of june that figure stood at a smaller percentage of assets than those funds held even at the start of compared with the s&amp p large stock growth funds are still overweight software hardware and telecommunications stocks by about five percentage points morningstar data shows however when measured against the russell growth index large cap growth funds are essentially neutral with a slightly underweighting of hardware stocks and heavier exposure to telecom "a lot of people were burned by technology in the late s and have an aversion to the sector " says conrad herrmann a portfolio manager on the &# billion franklin flex cap growth fund which has been upping its tech holdings and though the gains of this year mean some big tech companies are no longer trading at fire sale prices valuations arent seen as stretched after bottoming out at about times per share earnings in august the average price earnings ratio on technology stocks in the s&amp p is about one point below where it stood three years ago according to thomson financial among the stocks on a number of fund managers hit lists is networking giant cisco at &# per share cisco is trading at roughly times estimated earnings and times its earnings growth rate according to thomson financial "i find cisco to be very attractive at these levels " says turners mr mchugh franklins mr herrmann also likes juniper changing hands at &# for a price to earnings ratio of times next years earnings and a price earnings growth ratio of "the growth of video is going to be a huge driver" of business for networking stocks he says lord abbetts mr bartlett is upbeat on the makers of chips that will help play those videos such as nvidia corp he says that while the companys business historically relied heavily on videogames the market for their chips is expanding he says "video is moving into other devices and theyre growing very strong " says mr bartlett who expects earnings growth at the company to top nvidia already is up this year to &# "its been a strong stock but we think that continues " mr bartlett said the rally that many technology stocks have enjoyed has sent robert martorelli a portfolio manager on the blackrock focus value and basic value funds who uses a more valuation conscious approach away from the established tech names instead hes in search of turnaround stories he likes semiconductor and data storage company lsi corp a stock that is down this year the company has been struggling through the integration of agere systems which it acquired earlier this year
