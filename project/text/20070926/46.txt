echostar slings itself into mobile entertainment for the past few years satellite television provider echostar communications corp has fretted on the sidelines while deep pocketed rivals explored cutting edge ways to deliver movies television programs and music videos to increasingly mobile and tech savvy customers yesterday echostar chairman charles ergen took a step toward catching up echostar said it will pay &# million to acquire sling media inc whose slingbox device has been one of the buzziest media gadgets of the past few years the slingbox allows users to watch their favorite television programs on any internet connected computer or wireless device whenever it is convenient echostar said it is also considering splitting itself into two companies its satellite tv business known as dish network and another that includes its technology assets and sling that move is designed in part to foster more aggressive technology development in the offshoot company that could also benefit the much larger dish network but on the other hand the new entity would end up competing against even larger powerhouses such as microsoft inc cisco systems inc and motorola inc if successful the move into mobile entertainment could evolve into a broader strategic shift for echostar the company in recent years has been outflanked by cable companies offering package tv internet phone deals and an increasing list of on demand movies and tv shows echostars satellite rival directv group inc has focused on high definition programming and sports packages subscriber growth at dish has largely kept up with directv but the satellite industry generally has been buffeted by tougher competition from cable providers and that doesnt include longer term concerns about telephone companies snaring customers by offering their own tv packages in expanding from its core business echostar the nations second largest satellite television provider also could ratchet up pressure on rival satellite and cable operators to develop similar inexpensive portable devices according to analysts and industry consultants the slingbox device which so far has generated a relatively small but loyal following among high tech aficionados takes video signals from a home television set or digital set top box and "slings" them onto the web the programs then can be stored or played back on laptops and hand held gadgets in hotel rooms cars and anywhere else consumers wish including sports events or local shows that otherwise wouldnt be available by embracing slings technology echostar eventually may be able to slash costs and reduce its current total dependence on satellite distribution in the long run satellite television broadcasters wont thrive and may not even survive unless "they can offer video programming that people want to see exactly when they want to see it " according to max engel a consultant at frost &amp sullivan "so much of echostars worth is currently tied up in its satellite assets " mr engel said that the company "has been constrained in pursuing" other content and delivery options for mr ergen echostars founder and iconoclastic chief executive the acquisition is a relatively low risk low cost bid to jump into a promising new arena and set up a second company focused largely on technology development intended to capitalize on years of developing and manufacturing set top boxes for the more than million subscribers to echostars dish network the new entity also would include wholesale satellite leasing and international operations but in some ways the fledgling firm suddenly would find itself competing against technology giants such as microsoft which also has been eyeing a range of offerings aimed at spurring mobile video services according to satellite industry consultants since u s regulators rejected echostars proposed takeover of directv five years ago mr ergen has carefully avoided disclosing his strategic plans while unsuccessfully pursuing some acquisitions and reassuring investors that management was aggressively mulling various growth options echostars shares rose to &# yesterday partly reflecting investor support for the initiative but also spurred by rekindled speculation that echostars direct to home broadcasting operations may become a takeover target "separation of our consumer based and wholesale businesses could unlock additional value " mr ergen said in a news release allowing each segment to pursue different growth strategies and finance expansion plans echostar officials declined to elaborate in the englewood colo company announced plans to market its own portable digital video recorder aimed at subscribers desiring to watch programming on the fly but that project failed to take off as hoped and echostar became a significant investor in sling media based in foster city calif william kidd an analyst at wedbush morgan securities said slings technology probably offers far greater potential "embedded in other devices than being sold as a standalone retail" product if the concept attracts large numbers of dish viewers it would validate the widespread appeal of so called place shifting technologies that so far have been restricted to niche customers looking for cutting edge solutions echostars move although it was described as belated by some analysts and consultants nevertheless may send ripples throughout the pay television world "there is a good chance that echostars next generation set top boxes will be hybrids including" slings technology said shahid khan a consultant at interactive broadband consulting group and large cable television operators which already have studied and tentatively considered offering similar mobile solutions may feel compelled to follow suit if consumer demand climbs "today they dont have an urgency to do it " so "its not a business yet " according to mr khan but slings pioneering efforts he believes could be just as powerful as echostars early championing of digital video recorders which forced rivals to change their marketing plans speculation about a possible takeover of echostar focused immediately on at&amp t inc which has been trying to break into the television business at&amp t has been rolling out its own internet based tv service called u verse but acquiring echostar would enable it to secure better content deals with programmers and also could serve as a back up in case at&amp t faces technical hiccups at&amp t also partners with echostar for a tv service it calls homezone using a television set top box that blends satellite tv with on demand movies and other services off the internet at&amp t declined to comment regardless of echostars fate slings acquisition already is a big win for some venture capital firms that invested in the company one of slings largest shareholders dcm formerly known as dcm doll capital management had invested about &# million in the company since slings first fund raising round in november said david chao a dcm founder and general partner dcm of menlo park calif stands to make five to six times its money on its total investment mr chao says venture firm mobius venture capital also was an investor since sling raised just over &# million from the venture capital firms and other investors including hearst corp allen &amp co goldman sachs group inc liberty media corp and echostar the company was one of the most high profile start ups in silicon valleys digital media sector trying to nurture new internet tv technologies dionne searcey contributed to this article
