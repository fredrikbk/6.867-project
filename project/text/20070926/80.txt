moral dilemma of the pre emptive strike in "jonahs dilemma" editorial page sept michael oren and mark gerson ask provocative questions about the difficulty of anticipating or intervening in history with pre emptive strikes but they do violence to the book of jonah read on yom kippur to make their point seem timely in fact the author of the book of jonah doesnt tell us jonahs thoughts and motives is he trying to avoid "the paradox of prophecy " i e the likelihood of criticism no matter what the outcome or is he basically lazy or perhaps faithless ornery or self centered pursue their analogy to the decisions of our current and recent presidents with care i propose an entirely different lesson from this yom kippur reading for me the book is about gods mercy toward both the disobedient jonah and the sinful gentile ninevites if yom kippur is about atonement forgiveness and reconciliation it would be appropriate to note that the eve of yom kippur this year coincided with the u n international day of peace for all peoples not to mention that this jewish day of fasting this year occurred within the muslim fasting month of ramadan r g palms brooklyn n y live long enough and you will see everything messrs oren and gerson are advocating biblical stories as the basis for foreign policy juxtaposing the complexities of real world decision making with a simple moral fable is a travesty the real world does not have binary decision points with known outcomes to choose from trumans decision to bomb japan was actually two separate decisions with japans response over the hiroshima attack informing his decision to attack nagasaki lets not forget that this was made during a war when high allied casualties to end the war were probable trying to link this decision to george bushs initiation of the iraq war on very dubious premises at best is an egregious distortion if we are going to cherry pick religious fables to make political decisions then we will be truly going back to the dark ages alex tolley los gatos calif the authors subject is the lose lose paradox of the pre emptive strike winston churchill warned of the nazi threat in the s if mr churchill had been able to strike germany pre emptively and prevented world war ii would he have been held responsible for killing germans unnecessarily since the inevitability of war was not known lose later mr churchill was criticized for not taking action to prevent war lose either way he loses if president lincoln had pre emptively killed southern war leaders and their followers would he have been held responsible for killing fellow americans unnecessarily lose since mr lincoln did not act pre emptively some have blamed him for the deaths and millions of injuries of the civil war lose president bushs pre emptive strike against saddam clouds his legacy because of the deaths and strife in iraq lose since president bush did act pre emptively and since it is not known what saddam might have done will mr bushs legacy be the deaths and casualties in iraq lose in view of history will the pre emptive strike attain a level of accepted strategy for civilized leaders in the face of monstrous rogue dictator nations in their development of nuclear weapons repressive religious punishments and death to anyone who opposes them carroll d killingsworth huntsville ala
