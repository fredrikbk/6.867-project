calling rudy most americans understand it takes an extra chromosome to run for president but there are some limits on odd behavior which makes us wonder what rudy giuliani was thinking last friday when he accepted and even flaunted a phone call from his wife judith in the middle of his speech to the national rifle association this was no emergency call his cell phone rang in his pocket during his speech which is itself unusual most public officials turn theirs off during events if only out of courtesy for the audience mr giuliani went on to answer it and carry on a routine "love you" and "have a safe trip" exchange with mrs giuliani while the crowd and those of us watching on c span wondered what in the world that was all about his campaign aides spun the episode as a "candid and spontaneous moment" illustrative of the couples affection we might believe that if we hadnt heard stories of similar behavior by mr giuliani as he has campaigned around the country during one event in oklahoma were told he took two calls at least one from his wife and chatted for several minutes as the audience waited that episode followed mr giulianis eye popping disclosure earlier this year that if hes elected his wife would sit in on cabinet meetings he later downplayed that possibility mr giuliani has run an impressive campaign so far especially on the issues he has a record of accomplishment in new york and he projects the kind of executive competence that many americans want in a president the rap on his candidacy however is that his personal history and behavior are simply too strange for someone who wants to sit in the oval office voters will decide whether thats true but if nothing else mr giuliani ought to be aware of this vulnerability and do nothing to compound it "that was just weird " one nra audience member told the new york post about the phone interruption mr giuliani doesnt need more weird
