why cathays bid failed challenge to a deal backed by beijing was miscalculation a daring strategic gambit a degree of political miscalculation and a bit of bad timing this is the mix that appears to have sunk a bid by cathay pacific airways ltd and its mainland partner to grab a bigger chunk of the booming chinese aviation market at the expense of rival singapore airlines ltd on monday hong kong based cathay and china national aviation holding co or cnahc the state run parent of cathays partner air china ltd backed off from a planned joint offer for shares in shanghai based china eastern airlines corp a play for control of chinas lucrative shanghai gateway that emerged only over the weekend cathay and air china issued separate statements saying they wouldnt proceed with the offer at present singapore airlines looking to establish a foothold in chinas enormous aviation market had agreed earlier this month to buy a stake in china eastern singapore airlines parent temasek holdings pte ltd a state owned investment company agreed to simultaneously buy an additional of china eastern their combined offer of hk&# billion us&# million or hk&# a share has won approval from both chinas cabinet and the china eastern board though it still requires the support of two thirds of china easterns minority shareholders chinas government has been pursuing consolidation in the countrys overcrowded skies for years and cnahc air chinas parent has made no secret of its ambition to dominate the market but analysts say the th hour effort to topple the government endorsed purchase by singapore airlines a deal that goes back to talks held in early was perhaps ill conceived and certainly ill timed they point to a chinese leadership preoccupied with maintaining the status quo on major policy issues ahead of the communist party congress in mid october an event that takes place once every five years "right now it is a very sensitive environment in china " said russell leigh moses dean of the beijing center for chinese studies "the leadership here wants all the focus on the party congress and a deal like this threatens to put the focus on other things " moreover people close to the situation said the singaporeans had "all along sought and gotten assurances from the highest level" that the singapore airlines deal was watertight cnahc as a government controlled company would be sensitive to the prevailing political winds related to the bid industry observers say one person familiar with the matter said the planned bid was driven by cnahc and that cathay would have played a "very small part" in the venture chinese aviation regulators referred questions to the state owned assets supervision and administration commission or sasac which is in charge of chinas major state controlled enterprises sasac officials werent available for comment the chinese governments role in the matter isnt clear but the issues would have been vexing on one hand protecting the state approved and hard won singapore airlines bid would suggest consistency and openness to badly needed foreign investment on the other hand any pre emptive interference would raise questions about how committed the chinese government is to the free operation of financial markets a bidding war also could have proved bruising at a time when china needs foreign expertise to turn around its airlines some of which like china eastern record losses despite a soaring market and develop them into global players market attention to a potential restructuring of the chinese aviation sector was spurred by air china president cai jianjiang who said late last month that it would consider a merger with other domestic carriers because of competition from international airlines from sept through friday when trading in cathays stock was suspended on the hong kong exchange the mainland listed shares of air china surged those of china eastern and those of china southern airlines co partly on speculation that the air china gambit meant consolidation was gathering steam yesterday shares of chinese airlines fell sharply as hopes of an industry restructuring dimmed in the wake of the aborted bid all the major mainland listed companies in the sector dropped by the daily limit in hong kong cathay pacifics shares fell to hk&# and air chinas fell to hk&# merrill lynch cut its ratings on the three chinese state carriers "as the m&amp a story fades " sun yan in beijing jeffrey ng in hong kong and john jannarone and jenny paris in singapore contributed to this article
