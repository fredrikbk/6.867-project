to the colonial past of the netherlands is gaining notice in the dutch market for decades homesick surinamese living in the netherlands have hauled fernandes sodas in crimson red strawberry and amazon green lemon lime among other flavors back in their suitcases the surinamese staple is made by closely held fernandes concern beheer nv founded in by a brazilian family it is one of the oldest corporations in suriname a country of fewer than one million inhabitants on south americas northern coast that won independence from the netherlands in in the s coca cola enterprises nederland bv the dutch division of coca cola enterprises inc of atlanta began bottling fernandes under license and selling small numbers of the sodas at curry shops in surinamese neighborhoods of big cities such as amsterdam and rotterdam about four years ago the unit began to place the drink in supermarkets where mainstream dutch consumers also shopped sales of coca cola sprite and fanta were flatlining in the netherlands the dutch bottler realized because buyers were looking for healthier alternatives such as bottled waters but the company figured that fernandes was distinctive enough to be pitched as a drink appealing to young consumers now fernandes ads in the netherlands show blond teenagers on holiday in the amazon like jungles of the former colony the slogan "discover the taste of suriname " is in english to give the brand a with it image the dutch bottler engaged studio prins an ad agency based in utrecht to handle the campaign surinamese born copywriters familiar with the fernandes brand collaborated with the bottler to come up with a light image that plays off surinames exotic allure some of the people in the ads wear sports uniforms a subliminal reminder to dutch consumers that many of the countrys top athletes especially soccer players are surinamese "the idea is to say be young dare to be different " adds michel brahim the head of fernandess bottling unit in surinames capital paramaribo the marketing campaign also ties fernandes to one of amsterdams hottest television stars comedian joergen raymann whose "raymann is late" is a late night saturday favorite a surinamese of asian ancestry mr raymann pokes fun at immigrants foibles and at dutch fears of foreigners "he knocks all cultures so no one feels offended everyone can relate to his jokes " says shifai ahmadali a marketing executive at coca cola enterprises nederland "hes like our richard pryor " mr raymann appears as a host at fernandes sponsored events retail customers can win chances to meet the performer through raffles on a fernandes web site wholesale buyers and supermarket chain directors get invitations to backstage receptions to meet the comic fernandes also sponsors stand up comedy events where

spokesman for coca cola enterprises nederland says now the bottler is test marketing the beverage in belgium and the united kingdom and has introduced it in the west african countries of senegal and gambia next year the company plans to bounce its south american brand back across the atlantic targeting dutch speaking consumers in curacao and bonaire in the dutch west indies fernandess bubbly sales show the increasing importance of immigrant consumers in europe as foreign born enclaves swell and their incomes increase the fernandes brand sells best in big cities with large allochtoon dutch for "newcomer" populations says jose mes a spokeswoman for ahold nvs albert heijn supermarket chain but ethnic marketing can be a more delicate task in europe than in the u s european countries dont see themselves as nations of immigrants so an immigrant focused ad campaign can produce a backlash especially if the immigrants are muslim as many surinamese are and many immigrants are sensitive to stereotyping so images of carnival loving caribbeans downing soft drinks could backfire "i cant go too heavy say like putting arabic writing at my point of sale displays " explains mr ahmadali the fernandes marketing director "i do that and i drive too many customers away " the fernandes brand doesnt run ads directly targeting immigrants instead it uses store placement to make the link tapping into the diverse religious backgrounds of surinamese coca cola enterprises nederland carefully ties the soda promotions to religious celebrations which extends fernandess reach to immigrants from other countries as well suriname itself is a multiethnic brew of afro caribbean dutch and southeast asian ancestry including muslims hindus christians and jews this month mr ahmadali had sales teams fan out to supermarkets before ramadan moving fernandes displays from soft drink aisles and into aisles with the imported fruits and candies that turkish moroccan and surinamese muslims purchase for evening meals "you think of ramadan as a month of fasting but here muslims think of it as a time of family get togethers " after the fasts end he says in november the company will do the same during a hindu festival diwali corrections &amp amplifications the republic of suriname became independent on nov wednesdays advertising column incorrectly said suriname won its independence from the
