europes telecom chief draws fire for plans to overhaul competition european telecommunications commissioner viviane reding is under fire from the european unions antitrust and industry officials who are lambasting her plans to improve cross border telecommunications competition in the eu two internal documents show a letter from the office of competition commissioner neelie kroes charges that "overall the legislative amendments proposed introduce more bureaucracy increase the complexity and duration of the administrative process and will tend to result in more regulation " while "market developments clearly show increased competition and a decreasing need for regulatory intervention " the upbraiding sets the stage for mid november when ms reding is set to propose measures to overhaul the nation blocs rules for all electronic communication an aide to ms reding in response to the criticism said she plans to stay the course and in november will propose the measures she has been planning this past year according to ms redings comments during the past year the proposed shake up will include a push for a single pan european agency to regulate telecom markets rather than national authorities so that eu telecom and antitrust rules are enforced more coherently throughout the bloc she will also propose letting regulators force "functional separation" the splitting off of network and services divisions into separate business units on dominant telecom operators while the pending measures have drawn criticism from lobbyists and national regulators the documents mark the first sign of disapproval from ms redings colleagues within the eus regulatory and executive branch in separate notes to ms redings office officials under ms kroes and industry commissioner gunter verheugen said that the plan for a single pan eu regulatory agency would increase bureaucracy unnecessarily and might be illegal under the eus current framework the measure would "imply far reaching powers which go beyond those that can be conferred" to eu institutions according to a letter to ms redings office penned by ms kroess office both letters also warn that functional separation would be extremely costly to the dominant operators and would discourage new participants from investing in new technologies and infrastructure by enforcing dominant operators control over national telecom networks
