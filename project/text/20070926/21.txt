business world the never ending dance ben bernanke is wall streets hero ours with an asterisk is mervyn king his british counterpart mr king has been on the rotisserie for the last week his job hanging in the balance he spent the first month of the world wide credit crunch noisily criticizing his fellow central bankers saying their liquidity infusions only "encourage excessive risk taking and sow the seeds of a future financial crisis " but then he turned on a shilling when a sizeable british mortgage lender faced queues of depositors demanding their money back he flooded the local interbank market with reserves and even joined the british treasury in guaranteeing temporarily it is said all the nations bank deposits the about face was too much for the british press which is calling for his head either for hypocrisy on moral hazard or succumbing to "political pressure " whichever is worse wed say mr kings bumbling has produced a magnificent result some complain he should have opened the monetary spigots earlier so britons could be spared the unsightliness of a run on a major bank mr king himself has said he would have liked to engineer a "covert" bailout if only such a thing were still possible under modern shareholder disclosure rules but wouldnt either approach simply have taught lenders that government stood ready to protect them from their bad bets heres the bottom line depositors in britain have been protected an undoubted political imperative and a larger banking crisis has been averted yet northern rock whose chairman is the respected science journalist matt ridley has been exposed to market punishment for an incautious funding strategy its stock price has cratered its brand name has been trashed and several potential acquirers have turned and snatched their money off the table all in all if the goal were to protect macroeconomic stability without training lenders that government would bail them out its hard to imagine a dandier outcome on our side of the watery divide ben bernankes unexpectedly generous rate cut last week has been wildly applauded even as market types puzzle over his thinking most likely it was a political play given the din from cable television to keep the politicians and wall street off his back in hopes of preserving the feds freedom of action to fight inflation down the road but the cost has been steep a manifest increase in inflationary expectations in the short run see the dollar oil prices gold and year mortgage rates mr bernanke may eventually be judged to have made all the right calls but with washington now gearing up to throw money at homeowners and thereby throw money at undisciplined lenders where are our northern rocks microsoft after its big antitrust loss last week warned that the european union had now set itself up as the regulator of "dominant" companies world wide meaning inevitably american companies in return europes competition czar neelie kroes dismissed such "scare stories " saying her door is open to potential cases but her office wont be bringing them willy nilly ms kroes is whistling dixie for reasons microsoft itself will soon demonstrate supply feeds on demand and vice versa and europe has vastly increased the potential supply of antitrust guess who is lining up to be its first customer microsofts target is google whose proposed acquisition of doubleclick would create an online advertising powerhouse perhaps even a "dominant" company so what society is still better off letting google develop the full potential of its business model after all microsoft enjoys a "dominant" franchise in office but hardly an impregnable or exclusive one witness all the companies including google and ibm now offering their own free knockoffs of office unfortunately trustbusters make their living by inviting rivals to fight back with lawyers and lobbyists rather than with business innovations of their own even more so because the genuinely troubling elements of the doubleclick deal are its privacy implications which congress should address directly instead of leaving to be shoehorned awkwardly into the antitrust portfolio gm is showing just how long the lifecycle of such ill conceived policy distortions can be the wagner act was passed in the administrative ruling that decreed the tax free status of employer provided health benefits occurred in that combination of a monopoly labor supplier across the bargaining table and a tax incentive to replace wages with bartered health care helped create the inflationary health care burden now sinking gm labors clout down the years has also meant any concession from the uaw on productivity or costs had to be met with an exorbitant gm guarantee of wages and benefits for the existing workers even if theres no real job for them this begat the indefensible jobs bank which paid workers for not working and which is now the crux of the strike with gm insistent on finally regaining control of its labor costs all the same mondays walkout was a tad stagey dont forget the rank and file came close to voting down health care concessions negotiated by the uaw to keep ford and gm out of bankruptcy in the uaw leadership cant afford to lose a big vote on the eventual gm contract heres betting president ron gettelfinger called mondays strike mainly to soften up his own members who hate missing a paycheck while on strike for the concessions to come
