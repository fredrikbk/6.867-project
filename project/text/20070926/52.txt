free wi fi still an elusive goal san francisco the same forces slowing development of single city wireless internet networks are now overwhelming their supersize versions that cover thousands of square miles and scores of municipalities a telling example of the malaise can be found in silicon valley where plans to provide free high speed wireless internet access to cities in an area of more than square miles have come to a standstill says russell hancock the man in charge of the effort it was once thought that municipal wireless networks of all sizes could be supported through the sale of advertisements that appear during the free internet sessions and the small fee paid by those who want a faster ad free internet service however many cities with wireless networks say that theres been little demand for their premium services and that technology issues have limited the networks reach moreover while businesses were willing to invest in advertising on these single city networks they complain about very little return on their investment given that the regional networks share the same business model doubts about a return on investment have spread to projects under way as a consequence businesses once willing to fully fund such projects have had a change of heart and want substantial help from other partners involved this new paradigm has forced those trying to create regional wireless networks to rethink their options midstream in the case of the silicon valley project organizers are contemplating asking cities to share the upfront costs a worst case option is to scrap the project altogether "we are working now in a new paradigm we understand that " said mr hancock chief executive of joint venture silicon valley network which vows to continue building the network despite the rising odds against it the trouble for regional wireless networks was foreshadowed about six months ago when the business model behind citywide networks began crumbling earthlink inc recently retrenched its plans to build wireless networks in a dozen more cities and the network in minneapolis has struggled as a consequence businesses have also begun rethinking their financial roles in and enthusiasm for efforts such as joint venture silicon valley network the nations biggest proposed region wide wireless network the project was introduced about two years ago and mr hancock said he once hoped to have built a network by covering square miles and encompassing municipalities mr hancock said that isnt going to happen under current conditions "now i just dont know " he said mr hancock said that in the past few weeks it appears there has been a change of heart by international business machines corp and cisco systems inc which are backing the silicon valley regionwide effort with a commitment of as much as &# million to fund the construction the two companies now want the municipalities involved to provide construction funding or some other kind of financial commitment to the networks he said "they said look weve changed our mind we wont build it under these circumstances " mr hancock said "they completely want to go forward with the project but not under this model " cisco spokesman neil wu becker said cisco "is definitely still involved in the project and we have not said otherwise we are definitely not removing ourselves from this project and remain committed to making it a success " mr becker didnt provide additional comment an ibm representative didnt return a phone call seeking comment mr hancock has been on a roadshow of sorts to deliver this message to the heads of the cities that want to be part of the silicon valley project palo alto san carlos and other cities are amenable to the idea others less so according to mr hancock despite some positive response the project in silicon valley is at a crossroads and with it the fate of these kinds of wireless networks as well mr hancock said a wide array of options are now on the table from radically altering how the effort is funded to shelving it altogether for now mr hancock said the plan is to construct test networks in palo alto and san carlos these cities will act as a proving ground to help cities "be in a position to understand" the benefits before making the necessary financial commitment he said "the project has changed we understand that " mr hancock said
