inside microsofts plan to bring in outside talent before brian mcandrews agreed to take charge of a crucial piece of microsoft corp s online advertising business he insisted on a key condition that he be granted certain power over the engineering part of the operation the new job didnt have to include that authority but mr mcandrews new to the company argued that to succeed in his mandate leading the charge against google inc he needed it and in microsofts engineering driven culture such a team could promise something else for mr mcandrews longevity as a microsoft executive that microsoft granted his request illustrates a new approach chief executive steve ballmer is taking as he tries to expand the redmond wash company into new areas from online music to videogames to internet advertising mr ballmer has found he must tap outsiders rather than rely so heavily on homegrown managers as in the past how microsoft fares with mr mcandrews will be a test for mr ballmer who has tried over the years to make the company a more hospitable place for outside talent another test will be don mattrick whom microsoft hired this summer to head its videogame group after a long career as a top executive at game giant electronic arts inc mr ballmer has had some successes bringing in and keeping new executives including microsofts current chief operating officer kevin turner plucked from wal mart stores inc two years ago and finance head chris liddell hired from international paper co in april still a combination of forces within microsoft its engineers exalted stature its insular culture its sheer size make integrating new executives a lingering problem often through microsofts history decisive and aggressive outsiders have been worn down by the second guessing of microsoft veterans before stepping down to less prominent roles or leaving altogether microsoft has high stakes in the success of messrs mcandrews and mattrick in tackling their respective assignments mr mcandrews must help reverse microsofts rising gap with google in online advertising while helping the company catch up in markets like social networking he joined the company through microsofts &# billion acquisition of online advertising specialist aquantive inc where he was chief executive closed in august the deal was the largest acquisition in microsofts year history that puts added pressure on mr ballmer to make mr mcandrewss appointment stick if microsofts talks with facebook inc bear fruit and it takes a stake in that company mr mcandrewss role will be even more important like mr mcandrews mr mattrick takes over a business that is a crucial challenge for microsoft as senior vice president of microsofts entertainment and devices division mr mattrick oversees the range of microsofts expanding videogame business including the xbox videogame console an online game service and development of videogames such as microsofts extremely popular halo series his critical task will be to expand each of those areas while meeting microsofts goal of turning the group profitable for the full fiscal year which ends june mr mattrick comes to microsoft after playing a top role in the rise of electronic arts in the s the job brought him great riches and wide respect when the previous head of microsofts games business left for personal reasons earlier this year mr mattrick was already a paid consultant to microsoft so when he took the full time job he says "i kind of hit the ground running from day one " mr mattricks boss robbie bach a microsoft veteran of almost years says he is now building an "integration plan" for mr mattrick that maps out ways to give the new executive feedback and provides mentors to the newcomer from outside the entertainment division the goal mr bach says is to help mr mattrick quickly build ties outside his group to the rest of microsoft mr bachs entertainment and devices group is already something of a model for the rest of the company with a reputation for hiring droves of outsiders from entertainment fields mr mcandrews joins microsofts platforms and services division the group that oversees microsofts windows software and its online services as the group has struggled for leadership in the fast changing internet industry that is one reason why microsoft bought aquantive the year old mr mcandrews joined aquantive in after nine years at abc inc where he last served as an executive at abc sports he guided aquantive through an initial boom of online advertising and then through the bust that followed he took the company public and expanded it overseeing acquisitions before helping orchestrate its purchase by microsoft that is one reason kevin johnson president of microsofts platforms and services division and mr mcandrewss new boss says he is trying to be hands off "hes used to being ceo " mr johnson says of mr mcandrews "if you let him run his business and let him achieve the goals he wants to well be fine " mr mcandrews comes into a group that is known for clashes between the advertising and technical sides of microsoft he may able to avoid such disruptions thanks to his insistence that he have an engineering team his job is to manage the relationships with ad agencies and the web sites that run advertisements by controlling an engineering team he also oversees the technology for buying and selling online ads mr mcandrews says microsoft wants him to continue building an ad business much as he did before still he says he wants input in the form of technology and other resources from microsoft that aquantive didnt have on its own they "dont want to mess with that formula " he says "on the other hand i want to mess with it some "
