two sides are now engaged in settlement talks mr follieris discussions with mr band extended beyond real estate two people with ties to the clintons say mr follieris offer to help sen clinton win over

catholic church relationships authorization to help hillary in her presidential bid " said mr clintons spokesman mr carson in an email "similar to dougs reactions to many of follieris other ideas doug
