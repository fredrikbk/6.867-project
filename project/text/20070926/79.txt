medical mystery one doctors lonely quest to heal brain damage after years skeptics back hormone therapy experiments in a trailer atlanta as a young researcher in the s donald g stein drilled through the skulls of anesthetized rats and vacuumed out sections of their brains to see the effect on their behavior but he quickly became fascinated by something outside the scope of the research why did some female rats promptly recover from their injuries while males remained impaired his supervisors told him the difference was inconsequential and urged him to move on to more important topics but over his year career as a brain researcher and university administrator he never let go of the question decades of research often conducted in his spare time and with piecemeal funding led him to a surprising hypothesis that progesterone a natural female hormone that protects fetuses in the womb may actually protect and heal injured brains his work slowly helped overturn medical orthodoxy that states that brain tissue once injured stays that way now he and colleagues plan a large scale human trial over the next several years while the outcome is far from assured the effort could produce a new treatment for the estimated million people world wide who suffer traumatic brain injuries each year dr steins journey shows just how difficult it is to challenge the medical establishment which often begrudges ideas outside the mainstream it also underscores how difficult it is for a lone researcher to persevere without drug company or other major financial support for many years dr stein held administrative jobs and had to moonlight to continue his research drug companies tend to focus more on blockbuster drugs they design than on naturally occurring ones with minimal profit potential "this is probably the most promising breakthrough in improving outcomes for traumatic brain injury " says gregory oshanick national medical director of the brain injury association of america which advocates for families of people disabled from brain injury he first heard dr stein present his findings at an international medical meeting in "its absolutely astonishing that its taken this long " he says dr stein an energetic and wise cracking year old researcher at emory university was the only member of his family to take up a career in science "if you grow up in a tenement in the bronx " dr stein says "the last thing you want is to work with rats " as an undergraduate at michigan state university in the early s he helped pay some of his school costs by working in a state mental hospital and the psychiatric ward of a veterans hospital he grew appalled by the ineffective treatments of the day such as blasting hopelessly psychotic patients with water from a high pressure hose to shock them out of their condition and wrapping them in wet bedsheets some of these patients had been given lobotomies an operation that mimics a form of brain injury the therapies "seemed medieval to me and i was convinced there had to be a better way " he says a few years later as a doctoral candidate at the university of oregon in he stumbled onto what would turn out to be his lifes work his job was to surgically injure rats brains to help determine which parts control memory and consciousness but he was struck by an anomaly why was it that about of the injured rats didnt act impaired at all medicines prevailing view held that injured brain tissue would never heal so his professors found his data of little interest "i was told dont waste your time on that stick to your topic " they explained the differences as "natural variation " he said but he was skeptical dr stein took the question with him later that year to the massachusetts institute of technology where he embarked on a prestigious postdoctoral fellowship his supervisor steven chorover and others at mit urged him to stick with the memory work "the work he wanted to pursue was not something we were working on " recalls dr chorover dr stein still wanted to figure out why those brain injured rats seemed to recover but he says he concluded that he wouldnt win tenure if he pursued the question in with a wife and young child to support he left mit to take a job as a psychology professor and director of the brain research lab at clark university in worcester mass his growing interest in the possibility of recovery from brain injury put him in a tiny minority most neurologists at the time still agreed with nobel laureate santiago ramon y cajal who wrote in "in the adult brain nervous pathways are fixed and immutable everything may die nothing may be regenerated " starting in the late s dr stein began publishing research that suggested the nobel winner was wrong his lab began methodically studying precisely why some rats stayed smart despite injury the researchers would place rats in a large vat of water the rats had to swim to reach a safe platform in a test called a "water maze " then the scientists surgically damaged the animals brains to study what happened after injury would they still be able to maneuver through the maze the rats that recovered quickly were all female although not all of the females recovered dr stein considered whether the explanation might be something complex like molecular or genetic differences between males and females but investigating that would take much more time and money than seeing if a female hormone might yield some clues first his team evaluated estrogen but didnt find a major correlation then they tried progesterone a female hormone that helps protect fetuses from injury during pregnancy in these early experiments dr stein tested female rats to see if they would recover better or worse at different times during their hormonal cycles that resemble human menstruation progesterone levels rise and fall during these cycles and these early studies did indeed show that female rats that were high in progesterone recovered faster dr stein thought he had a big part of the answer to the question that had been vexing him for years the medical establishment however largely shrugged off the results a naturally occurring hormone like progesterone some forms of which have been available generically for infertility is of little interest to drug makers thats because the substance probably cant gain secure patent protection that shut off a major avenue of potential funding for his research "big pharma likes more of an airtight protection " says todd scherer director of the office of technology transfer at emory dr steins current academic home caroline loew senior vice president for science and regulatory affairs at pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america the main drug industry trade group says drug companies need patent protection for their research investments but she suggested the situation could benefit from a government action along the lines of the federal orphan drug act which increased financial incentives for companies researching rare diseases a similar idea "may apply to this case " she says dr stein was turned down for half a dozen or more grants from the national institutes of health during the s and s zaven s khachaturian a leading scientist and former nih official says his ideas were "really creative but the nih system never gave them the good scores they deserved " at one point he says "i just told don stein that sometimes it doesnt pay to keep hitting your head against the wall " dr khachaturian says dr stein recalls feeling "shaken" by the denials while at the same time growing more determined to prove his case he kept up a steady drumbeat of research published in a wide range of journals such as science brain research experimental neurology and others during his time at clark dr stein was given to jeans long hair and shooting his mouth off in faculty meetings or challenging guest speakers even eminent ones "eyebrows would go up whenever dons hand would go up " recalls julio ramirez a former student now a professor of neuroscience at davidson college but dr stein also was developing into a powerful speaker himself one speech in copenhagen in the late s ended up offering a lifeline for his research diane bistany then a senior officer at reinsurance company general re corp heard the talk and was impressed dr stein spoke for minutes without notes pacing the stage as he made an impassioned argument for the notion that progesterone could be crucial to recovery for thousands of people with traumatic brain injury there are five million patients in the u s alone disabled from brain injury "not only was it his knowledge but he had a passion for his research and conveyed that this research was going to get somewhere and mean something " ms bistany says gen re soon contributed grants of &# a year for eight years keeping his research going around the same time dr stein grew frustrated at clark which was emphasizing clinical psychology and less so the research he preferred he applied for various positions at other universities but his ideas while intriguing enough to win him speaking invitations still seemed too far out of the mainstream to win him a pure research job finally in he landed an administrative position as dean of the graduate school and associate provost for research at rutgers university in newark n j he would work as dean until about p m then return to the lab for several hours of work in the evening along with his research team their work progressed step by step first did progesterone lower swelling in the brain if so did it matter if the animals were females what did estrogen do if anything when did the progesterone have to be given at what dose did progesterone affect animals memories he found that female rats with much higher pregnancy level amounts of progesterone did far better than other rats in following mazes even male rats also recovered far better from injury when given the hormone performing just as well as the highest performing females the stuff worked when given up to hours after injury then in one crucial experiment in his team tested the amount of cerebral edema or brain swelling in brain injured rats with high progesterone levels versus others with none edema is important because of its role in causing brain damage to proliferate robin l roof then a postdoctoral fellow in dr steins lab was waiting for the results while vacationing in a michigan cottage when a colleague left a message that there was "no difference " she thought the experiment had failed but it turned out the colleague meant that progesterone protected injured rats did just as well as rats with no injury at all immediately says dr roof now a researcher at pfizer inc she realized "this was career changing research " still why would a hormone that rises and falls with menstrual cycles and enables fertility protect the brain unlike estrogen progesterone doesnt produce visible female sex characteristics it is present in men at low levels it rises sharply during pregnancy and helps protect the fetus through multiple studies dr stein and colleagues concluded that it protects the brain in similar fashion in dr stein joined emory as dean of the graduate school and vice provost university administrators neglected to provide him lab space thinking his brain injury research was little more than a hobby so for six years his team worked in a moldy double wide trailer between a parking lot and an industrial size trash bin to complete the picture they installed plastic flamingos in front but meanwhile nih began to back his progesterone research and the centers for disease control and prevention also began giving him grants his studies continued to show positive findings with progesterone and scientists elsewhere began to confirm them often such confirming studies get done because other scientists start out skeptical dr robert vink chairman of neurosurgical research at the university of adelaide in australia was among the skeptics but he grew intrigued by dr steins work dr vink has confirmed that progesterone is beneficial in brain injured animals in numerous ways such as lowering brain swelling and cell death and improving animals cognitive abilities he says dr stein is "persevering hes got data or years now showing that progesterone in animals is neuroprotective theres no doubt about it " still others remain on the fence david a hovda a prominent university of california los angeles neurosurgery professor says he is still unconvinced that progesterone will prove to be an effective human treatment but he says he admires dr steins work "don stein has a history of stirring the pot " he says in the past decade dr stein says he and his team have repeatedly run into walls when trying to discern the cellular and molecular mechanism through which progesterone works but at other times they did have success on this "cellular pathway" research and now are finding that there are at least three or four such mechanisms by the findings of dr stein and other brain scientists were swaying the textbooks one leading neurology tome "principles of neuroscience " said in its edition that functions such as thought language and memory "are all made possible by the serial and parallel interlinkages of several brain regions each with specific functions as a result damage to a single area need not result in the loss of an entire faculty as many earlier neurologists predicted " still as a practical matter this was just nifty rat science dr steins hypotheses wouldnt really matter until they were borne out in humans after hearing dr stein lecture a decade ago arthur kellermann then emorys chief of emergency medicine resolved to get human studies going he introduced dr stein to david wright a young emory emergency doctor with research ambitions drs wright and kellermann wrote an nih grant application in for the first phase of human study two years later the federal agency approved a grant of &# million for the first stage of human research over the next three years the study focused on head injured patients who had been brought into the emergency room at grady memorial hospital in downtown atlanta some patients received standard treatment to control bleeding and fevers along with state of the art head injury treatment others were also given intravenous progesterone at triple the highest natural levels at the end of pregnancy one saturday morning in dr stein was driving north of atlanta on a shopping trip with his wife when a stern sounding dr kellermann called him dr kellermann said he had just learned the studys findings adding "pull over to the side of the road " dr stein froze fearing that decades of research with animals would prove useless that progesterone might have turned out to raise the death rate in humans for some unforeseen reason his heart was thumping as dr kellermann told him the results patients on progesterone had a death rate of just from their head injuries less than half the death rate of those on standard treatment and progesterone showed no negative side effects the subject study was too small to prove that progesterone caused the lowered death rate but the findings were consistent with animal research don stein was so elated that he had to ask his wife to take over the driving in the respected journal "annals of emergency medicine" this past april dr stein and his researchers summarized the study "moderate traumatic brain injury survivors who received progesterone were more likely to have a moderate to good outcome than those randomized to placebo " the story is still far from over before progesterone can be approved as a treatment dr steins findings must be proved in a larger study of humans but as he and his team have persisted in research he has himself become the mainstream of neuroscience his animal research now has been replicated in dozens of studies at numerous research institutions dr stein and his emory team have applied for nih funds to do a patient study which will give the definitive word the nih already has given an initial &# grant to plan the study but emory hasnt yet officially applied for the full grant such a trial could take five years or more meanwhile emorys technology transfer office is "optimistic" about developing and marketing progesterone as a treatment for brain injury says dr scherer director of that office for dr stein the results of the clinical study in emergency head trauma patients were further reason for enthusiasm "a tremendous culmination " as he puts it "most bench scientists work for years to discover a truth about nature " he says "very few of us ever get to have a major impact on peoples lives how can you not be excited "
