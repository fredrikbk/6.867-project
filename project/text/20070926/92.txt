politics &amp economics dispute stymies guantanamo terror trials chief prosecutor claims interference office is in disarray washington a dispute between the chief guantanamo bay prosecutor and a pentagon official has roiled the governments system of terrorism trials the latest snag in a six year bid by the bush administration to establish an offshore court according to people familiar with the matter the prosecutor col morris davis has filed a formal complaint alleging that brig gen thomas hartmann legal adviser to the administrator overseeing the trials has overstepped his mandate by interfering directly in cases in a written statement provided to the wall street journal col davis suggested that both he and gen hartmann resign "for the good of the process if he believes in military commissions as strongly as i do then lets do the right thing and both of us walk away before we do more harm " the dispute between the two air force officers has left the prosecution office in disarray according to officials familiar with the matter prosecutors are uncertain who is in command and which cases they should pursue col davis has refused to file additional charges against guantanamo inmates until the dispute is resolved the pentagons general counsel william j haynes ii appointed brig gen butch tate chief judge of the army court of criminal appeals to lead an investigation into the matter a senior defense official says gen tates report has been filed and backs gen hartmann because gen hartmann is the superior officer "davis is obliged to heed the orders of hartmann whether or not he likes them so long as theyre lawful " the official said "and theres no indication that hes issued any unlawful orders " through a spokesman gen hartmann declined to comment the tensions may affect the case of osama bin ladens former driver guantanamo inmate salim hamdan gen hartmann has suggested to officers he could push for a plea bargain with mr hamdan over the objection of trial prosecutors officials say a lawyer representing mr hamdan retired lt cmdr charles swift says he cant discuss whether any plea discussions are under way prosecutors under col davis have focused on cases that rely largely on unclassified evidence allowing trials to be open to the press to address criticism that the process is too secretive but these cases tend to involve relatively undramatic charges such as providing services to a terrorist organization officials say gen hartmann is pushing for cases that could attract more public attention and perhaps also support for the tribunal system even though they may involve closed proceedings there is also a thorny legal issue at stake under pentagon regulations the chief prosecutor reports to the legal adviser who is supposed to be impartial col davis contends that this structure runs afoul of the military commissions act which bars outside interference in the "professional judgment" of prosecution and defense lawyers officials say "if someone above me tries to intimidate me in determining who we will charge what we will charge what evidence we will try to introduce and how we will conduct a prosecution then i will resign " col davis said in his written statement the conflict is the latest setback to plague the bush administrations campaign to create a free standing court system despite president bushs stated desire to close guantanamo bay officials havent reached a consensus about how to handle people held there creating a court from scratch has also proven harder than many expected the supreme court is considering whether to hear another challenge to the commissions barely a year after it struck down mr bushs first attempt at setting up such a structure in part because the plan violated the geneva convention congress authorized a modified version to fix these legal failings but earlier this year military trial judges themselves ruled that the commissions lacked jurisdiction over guantanamo detainees a decision that was reversed monday by a military appeals court the commissions have notched only one conviction that of david hicks who will be set free in his native australia at the end of the year as part of a plea bargain reached in march col davis the third chief prosecutor was appointed in he has been a vigorous public advocate of the commissions recently publishing an article in the yale law journal defending their fairness gen hartmann a reservist who in civilian life is general counsel of mxenergy holdings inc of stamford conn took office in july as legal adviser to the commissions convening authority that is the military term for the apparatus that administers the trials in that role gen hartmann is supposed to provide impartial advice to susan crawford a former judge who holds the title of convening authority among other duties the convening authority must decide whether charges proposed by the prosecutors are sufficient to go to trial under pentagon guidelines the legal adviser "must make an independent and informed appraisal of the charges and evidence " cully stimson the former deputy assistant defense secretary who helped draft the commission rules said he didnt anticipate the convening authoritys legal advisers "meddling in the day to day operations of the prosecutor " he added however that the authority can negotiate plea bargains even over the prosecutors objection the defense "should not be influenced or have the appearance of being influenced so they can do the best for their client " says mr stimson now a fellow at the heritage foundation "the same should be true for the prosecution " col davis was out of the office recovering from surgery when gen hartmann quickly took charge of the prosecution office reviewing cases and directing staff officials say the disputes havent focused on the "high value" detainees alleged to be top al qaeda commanders rather gen hartmann has criticized the selection of defendants for the "non high value" cases officials say he ordered prosecutors to coin a new name for them that would make them seem more important "gen hartmann has voiced complaints that the prosecution remained after four years still unready to try cases " says a lawyer familiar with the situation "its his frustration with their cant do approach " prosecutors in response say gen hartmann is "micromanaging" cases he doesnt fully understand the case of mr hamdan has struck a particular nerve mr hamdan is the defendant whose challenge led to the supreme court ruling striking down the first military commission plan prosecutors say that making a deal with mr hamdan would be a blow to the governments credibility "think of our only other success in this david hicks " one prosecutor says "how is that a success for the united states government how does that justify guantanamo " col daviss separate complaint with the pentagon inspector general is still pending officials say see related
