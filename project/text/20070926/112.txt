the daily fix padres phillies and rockies brawl for baseballs final playoff spot online edition the american league has all but inked and mailed its postseason invites but in the national league the envelopes are far from sealed because the nl wild card race is wild indeed the san diego padres have a one game lead despite key players losing key parts at an alarming rate a game behind sit the volatile philadelphia phillies and the apparently unbeatable colorado rockies sunny optimists should note that the atlanta braves are three back dour pessimists should note that the staggering but still division leading new york mets are a game better than the padres and could fall into the wild card picture from above whew the padres kept their fans away from sharp objects for another night when brian giles connected for a three run homer in the ninth inning giving the team a lead over the san francisco giants as the pads adrian gonzalez sagely noted instead of a three way tie for the wild card "weve got a one game lead and weve got peavy going for us " the san diego union tribunes tom krasovic has the game story complete with giants and padres not being role models for the kiddies matt cain scott hairston you stop that this instant in philadelphia the phillies were upended by the braves missing a chance to close to within a game of the mets at shea stadium met fans offered utterly unironic tomahawk chops by way of thanks the philadelphia daily newss sam donnellon writes that such a loss is "why it has been so hard for so many to go all in to push their hearts to the middle of the table and suspend all doubt by the time greg dobbs flied out to end it the once fervent fandom had left the site its taillights flashing like alarms in the horizon they have seen the phillies in this spot before several times in recent years a playoff spot attainable through a crisply played week through a couple of big hits a few well pitched games for whatever reason they just cant seem to take the moment into their hard working hands " the rockies meanwhile cant lose they won their ninth straight beating the los angeles dodgers "the rockies stand tall " mark kiszla marvels in the denver post "but if they insist on playing with fate in this crazy dream of making the playoffs anyone who loves them might crumble from the emotional strain " mr kiszla calls the rockies win " excruciating hours and nearly unbearable minutes every last second tough enough to age a witness by years take it on faith colorado won this crucial game for only one reason because the rockies now firmly believe doing the impossible is nothing " the braves need the stars to align win or lose they will have a star of their own to consider what to do with andruw jones the center fielder just has played seasons with atlanta but will now hit the free agent market after a head scratcher of a year the atlanta journal constitutions david obrien sets out the braves options they might go for a cheaper short term replacement until the farm system produces another center fielder they might take aim at the gritty aaron rowand currently employed by the phillies and then theres option three "despite jones diminished numbers there persists in the braves clubhouse a sense that jones is more valuable than stats indicate because of his often spectacular defense and ability to position and help other braves outfielders " the mets arent part of the wild card picture just yet and probably shouldnt worry about that baseball prospectus puts their odds of winning the nl east at but dont tell their fans that last night the mets made mental errors strange strategic moves and failed in the clutch before mounting a furious ninth inning rally that ended with a loss to the washington nationals in the bergen record bob klapisch offers a pitiless look at a franchise in disarray "the look on philip humbers face suggested sweet oblivion not unlike a pigeon about to be sucked into the turbines of a " he writes "the mets empire is being vandalized by the poor and the hungry yet humber says hes not nervous about his role as savior in his first major league start tonight just as well imagine if the kid was really paying attention hed realize theres an unchecked historic collapse taking place at shea worsened by yet another loss to the nationals " mr klapischs conclusion is that the mets are "face to face with a crazy reality the good news is that the playoffs are almost here the bad news the playoffs are almost here " in the new york sun tim marchman is up front about something met fans have wrestled with all year this years club isnt particularly likable ok he suggests deal with it "fans and sportswriters cant expect a team to win on style points every time out just because theyre good " he writes "and a team doesnt have to be especially admirable just because theyre good not every team needs some involved narrative or cast of colorful characters not every team needs to reel off a series of dramatic and improbable successes and not every team needs to have a singular identity teams can just be teams " barring something truly unforeseen tonight will be barry bondss final home game as a san francisco giant before a fan base that gave him the kind of unreserved asterisk free adulation that was often absent in other baseball quarters during his pursuit of hank aarons all time home run record in the san francisco chronicle ray ratto ponders a sluggers farewell and how it ought to be acknowledged which he begins to consider with typical ratto flair "all indications are that tonights send off or kiss off depending on your frame of mind will be dignified and unobtrusive which apparently means that britney spears will not sing the national anthem while biting off the head of a whippet other than that they are keeping the details a secret " of mr rattos suggestions for a parting gift the fix thinks this is its favorite "an actuarial table from stats inc showing how long it will take for the giants to get the next home runs out of their left fielders " in the san jose mercury news mark purdy offers a fantasy about what might happen and an amusing idea that will never happen before settling on what will probably happen "bonds starts in left field against the san diego padres fans applaud he grounds out to the right side of the infield a couple of times then in the sixth inning laces a single into right field as has been his way in he is then removed for a pinch runner tips his cap to the crowd and leaves the field and that will be that " the detroit tigers are still mathematically alive but their "tragic number" is one no matter writes drew sharp in the detroit free press chronicling a game that was the equivalent of an irish wake "there will be no champagne sprays into the crowd like a year ago after the tigers eliminated the yankees in the divisional series " he writes "its the yankees who will serve as executioner this time eventually but the mood was anything but funereal detroit regained its status as a baseball town with its response after the tigers playoff chances effectively expired in a three game sweep at cleveland last week nobody abandoned them folks didnt burn their tickets for what had become an anti climactic last six game home stand they still showed up in large numbers appreciative of a valiant effort it nearly moved jim leyland to tears " tip of the fix cap to readers michelle alessandri and don hartline and to the online journals mark gongloff found a good column from the world of sports
