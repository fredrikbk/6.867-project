commercial real estate remains stalled despite fed rate cut jolt near paralysis continues marylebone pulls sale last weeks interest rate cut by the federal reserve gave hope to many people who follow the residential real estate market but the commercial markets have shrugged it off industry watchers say the new rate could boost consumer confidence but so far it hasnt been enough to significantly ameliorate the credit crunch one factor is that the year treasury yield to which fixed rate commercial mortgages are closely tied has risen in the past week increasing borrowing costs thus many commercial deals could remain stalled experts say "while the interest rate cut by the federal reserve definitely helped restore investor confidence in the near term it will likely have little fundamental effect on commercial mortgage lending " said alan todd executive director and head of cmbs research for jp morgan securities a unit of j p morgan chase &amp co in the days leading up to the feds announcement that it would lower its target for the federal funds rate by half a percentage point to there was a lot of conjecture from those who track the industry about how the move would affect commercial real estate the credit markets had been in a state of near paralysis in recent months following the mortgage market meltdown with fears that the lax underwriting standards that were rampant in residential lending were also commonplace on the commercial side as a result few banks were making new loans for commercial properties the market for commercial mortgage backed securities pools of loans that are sold to investors as bonds had nearly shut down because bond buyers began viewing them as too risky so when the federal reserve made the steep cut it appeared to give a badly needed jolt to the commercial market heres why the federal funds rate is the interest banks charge one another for overnight loans many industry watchers assumed that once lenders had a lower cost of capital they would pass along the savings to borrowers the day of the announcement stocks of publicly traded real estate investment trusts rallied closing up although the have been volatile since according to snl financials equity reit index "the fed is making a concerted effort to avoid an economic slowdown and that will likely keep property leasing demand healthy in the short term and continue to support the perception that real estate values and assets are a good place to be " wachovia analyst christopher haley said nonetheless the credit crunch remains evident late last week united kingdom property company marylebone warwick balfour group plc pulled the sale of its gbp million &# billion hotel portfolio for the second time citing "current uncertainties in the markets" for the postponement of the deal "i think were far from out of the woods yet " said mike kirby chairman of green street advisors a newport beach calif real estate research company one reason is that the federal funds rate has a greater impact on shorter term financing such as construction loans most long term commercial mortgages are tied to the year treasury note not the federal funds rate and the year treasury yield moved up in the past week it typically moves independently of the federal funds rate increasing the cost to borrowers so the federal reserves move has done little to allay bond buyers fears for those needing short term loans "it will help people make deals but we dont see how lower interest rates will break up the logjam and cause bond buyers to buy hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds in all the asset classes " said gary mozer principal with george smith partners a los angeles based commercial real estate finance firm still that doesnt mean some outlets arent trying lehman brothers holdings inc has found buyers for &# billion of commercial mortgage backed securities that will be used to fund its joint venture purchase with tishman speyer properties of apartment company archstone smith trust according to people familiar with the matter who say the buyers are "locked up " lehman began to shop an additional &# billion in debt tied to the deal the day after the fed cut rates lehman declined to comment so its unclear how well those bonds are selling many industry watchers believe it will be months before the market fully recovers "some deals have gone through and pricing for senior bonds is firming up but the market is still a little bit choppy in trying to work its way back to health " said tad philipp a managing director for moodys investors service alex frangos and molly dover contributed to this article
