oil production costs no longer shock in royal dutch shell plc disclosed a cost overrun of roughly &# billion at its giant sakhalin project in russia a disclosure that shocked the market and embarrassed the oil giant this month after much delay and hand wringing over swelling costs shell and partner saudi aramco greenlighted a &# billion project to expand the jointly owned motiva enterprises llc refinery in port arthur texas motiva had previously estimated the project cost at &# billion while shell and motiva officials were a bit sheepish about the higher price tag at port arthur nobody is shocked or outraged anymore by this sort of cost overrun and that reaction says a lot about how attitudes have shifted over time the energy industrys limits in capacity manpower supplies and time are well understood by now and explaining such a large cost overrun to wall street has become easier amid persistently high commodity prices that cushion the financial impact the industry suffered from "sticker shock" two years ago but "theres not the same sort of surprise anymore " said longtime industry analyst and author dan yergin "theres a recognition that this is the new reality and its particularly obvious in terms of these megaprojects " while few experts expect oil prices to linger at todays level following the recent surge through &# a barrel there is broad consensus around the concept that there is a higher floor to where crude prices could drop mr yergin for example said the floor for the medium to long term is &# &# others put that floor closer to &# or even &# equity analysts who follow big oil have become accustomed to swelling spending from companies such as chevron corp which lifted its capital budget from &# billion in to &# billion in and exxon mobil corp which will spend &# billion a year through up from &# billion in while the oil giants vow the additional spending will lift production they concede some of the funds are going to higher rates to rent drilling rigs and loftier signing bonuses for skilled engineers and project managers "originally it was taboo " said fadel gheit analyst at oppenheimer &amp co mr gheit said of wall street attitudes toward cost inflation "we are more forgiving now we are recognizing reality " motivas port arthur project is just one of a plethora of major new energy projects that have been contemplated discussed started or put on the back burner amid a multiyear investment cycle initiated by the oil industry in response to the higher commodity prices of recent years in some cases energy companies have canceled or radically scaled back projects as with exxon mobils decision to abort a qatar gas to liquids venture there have also been reports that kuwait petroleum corp would scale back a grass roots refinery after receiving bids that came in at more than twice the anticipated amount as costs have soared companies in several other prominent cases have gone back to the drawing board and conducted additional engineering to ease the cost pain before the critical construction phase gets under way a joint venture that includes exxon mobil recently shifted back the time frame for awarding an engineering contract to manage a major project in abu dhabi chevron has also taken this approach with the massive gorgon natural gas venture in australia some gorgon liquefied natural gas has already been committed in long term contracts even though the gorgon consortium hasnt made a final investment decision to go forward "weve got to get the optimum design and capital commitment at the front end " chevron chief executive dave oreilly said in march of gorgon "and were going to take the time to do that its because these assets are going to be with us for a long long time " shell officials have cited cost concerns as a major factor in the delay in reaching a final investment decision on port arthur bechtel corp which is working on the port arthur project aims to mitigate the effect of cost inflation via its long term global relationship with suppliers in more than countries where the company has projects "we are able to find the lowest cost material equipment and other supplies around the world " said bechtel spokesman jonathan marshall mr yergin expects most of the big projects ultimately to proceed but pointed to special complexity in cases where oil companies are also contending with resource holding nations or states that are seeking a greater share of revenues from energy development a consortium of oil giants has been locked in tough negotiations with alaska over fiscal terms for a giant natural gas pipeline that would ship to the lower a technologically challenging project that will cost tens of billions of dollars a consortium of companies led by eni spa is sparring with kazakhstan over who will bear the brunt of development costs that the kazakh government said has more than doubled to &# billion meanwhile a canadian government panel recently called for higher royalties on the burgeoning oil sands projects "most of the big projects will go ahead but with delays or postponements " mr yergin said but in cases where there is a "real gap" between the private companies and host governments "things can be postponed possibly for a very long time " isabel ordonez contributed to this article
