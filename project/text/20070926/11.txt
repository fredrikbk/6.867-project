for medicare the prospect of getting health insurance can be daunting it requires navigating a hodgepodge of federal and state laws ignoring health insurance can be catastrophic if you wind up in the hospital without coverage so what are the options for the self employed "the key is to plan ahead " says david guilmette managing director of towers perrins health and welfare practice the health of you and your dependents where you live who you know and what you can afford to pay are among the factors you need to consider when weighing your options he says "nine times out of if you can get access to employer sponsored group coverage take the employer sponsored policy " says karen politz a research professor at the georgetown university health policy institute "dollar for dollar you get a lot more protection " under federal law you cant be denied coverage on medical grounds in an employer sponsored health plan by contrast in the majority of states insurers offering individual policies can permanently exclude pre existing conditions such as high cholesterol or deny you coverage for chronic illnesses such as diabetes the states where you cant be denied coverage are new york new jersey massachusetts maine and vermont employer sponsored group policies are also likely to provide certain benefits such as maternity care that individual plans typically dont a normal pregnancy and delivery can cost &# to &# if your spouse has access to health care benefits through his or her employer getting coverage under that plan is the most cost effective strategy according to ms politz according to a recent survey by the kaiser family foundation and the health research and educational trust an employees average monthly contribution in an employer sponsored health plan for family coverage is about &# and &# for an individual in addition a growing number of employers are extending health care benefits to domestic partners about of the of employers who offer health benefits to employees offer them to opposite sex domestic partners to same sex domestic partners be mindful of deadlines if you quit your job your spouse generally has days to notify his or her employer that you want to enroll also employers may limit when domestic partners can sign up and there can be tax implications so its important to check experts say if the first option isnt available and you currently receive health care benefits through your employer you can extend that coverage after you quit under the federal consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act or cobra you can purchase coverage for as long as months after you leave or lose your job providing that you werent fired for misconduct for the law to apply the company must have or more employees according to tom billet a senior consultant with watson wyatt worldwide the main advantage of cobra is that you will continue to receive the same health benefits as you did under your employers plan if youre receiving treatment and it was covered under the plan this is important if you join another group plan temporary exclusions for pre existing conditions can be imposed however cobra is much more expensive than job based coverage because you have to pay the entire premium based on figures in the kaiser family foundation study that would equate to &# a month for family coverage and &# a month for an individual you also pay a administration fee "most people have no idea how much health insurance costs " says vince ashton executive director of healthpass a nonprofit agency created by the new york business group on health the city of new york and the health insurance industry to improve access to coverage for businesses with two to employees typically your employer has days to notify you of your cobra rights and you have a further days to make your decision premiums vary greatly from employer to employer so find how much your plan costs about of employers dont offer benefits if you dont have access to an employer sponsored plan you may be able to get coverage through professional associations trade or affinity groups however such coverage isnt as common as it used to be and associations can deny coverage on health grounds organizations in which health insurance is an incidental benefit rather than its reason for being and which have strict entry requirements such as requiring a certified public accountant designation tend to offer the better plans according to michael crifasi a certified financial planner with cei financial planning inc in atlanta who is also an independent insurance agent its important to find a well established plan with a history of reasonable annual renewal rate increases he adds experts also advise calling your state insurance department to find out if the insurer that underwrites the associations plan is licensed in the state where you live and if your state insurance regulator is authorized to intervene if you have any problems with coverage in about a dozen states a self employed person can buy health insurance in the small group market for instance in connecticut and delaware you are considered a small business even if you are a sole proprietor with no employees while you cant be denied coverage many states apply rating bands based on health or adjusted for your age the exception is vermont which requires insurers to charge everyone the same premiums however most states do set limits on how much insurers can charge hawaii doesnt impose any restrictions so premiums there can be very high also be aware that some states such as florida and new hampshire have limited annual enrollment windows see http www statehealthfacts org for information about your state if you are healthy purchasing an individual policy such as a high deductible health plan and opening a tax free health savings account or hsa could be the best option a humana ppo policy in florida with a &# deductible will cost a healthy year old woman &# a month in she could
