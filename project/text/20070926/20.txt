business bookshelf business success is not duty free the billionaire who wasnt by conor oclery public affairs pages &# chuck feeney is a hard man to categorize he made billions as a co founder of duty free shoppers the world wide retail chain familiar to almost anyone who has passed through an international airport yet when he is traveling he flies economy class he is a self proclaimed liberal yet he has a libertarians allergy to taxes and in moved his fortune into tax exempt foundations in bermuda he is notoriously averse to publicity yet he has now in his eighth decade cooperated in the publication of a biography in "the billionaire who wasnt " conor oclery is mostly content to trace the outlines of mr feeneys successful life rather than explore its apparent paradoxes mr feeney a child of new yorks blue collar suburbs joined the air force in at age after four years in the service most of them spent stationed in japan he enrolled at cornell university with the help of the g i bill he showed early signs of an entrepreneurial spirit even in school starting a sandwich delivery service for fraternities and sororities after graduating with a degree in hotel administration mr feeney traveled to europe where he discovered that he could make a tidy profit selling luxury items such as cars perfumes and liquor to american servicemen in foreign locales he took orders from military personnel for goods offered at cut rate prices but he still made money because he didnt have to pay tariffs shipping the orders directly from the manufacturer to the servicemens addresses in the u s "receipts for duty free liquor became so commonplace on board ships that they were accepted as stakes in poker games " mr oclery writes thus was born the idea that became duty free shoppers mr feeney and his partners correctly anticipated the boom in japanese tourism that began in the s and set up stores staffed with clerks fluent in japanese where travelers could purchase tariff free merchandise with locations at major pacific destinations and close relationships with suppliers and tour operators the business flourished in the s with duty free shoppers worth billions mr feeney decided to put most of his one third share of the privately owned company and other assets into charitable trusts in bermuda operating as atlantic philanthropies he was left with a personal worth of less than &# million mr oclery offers several reasons for mr feeneys moving his riches into a foundation including the example of his mother who was known for her generosity his desire for his children to earn their own livings and his admiration for andrew carnegie who thought that the wealthy were obliged to give away their fortunes during their lifetimes but business considerations also played a role mr feeneys lifelong drive to make money has been rivaled only by his aversion to spending it among his associates he is famous for his frugality he wears a &# watch and doesnt own a house or a car though not obvious at first transferring most of his assets to charitable trusts was also a cost saving measure the income from his holdings would be exempt from taxation world wide but by locating the foundations in bermuda he could still retain his influence over duty free shoppers and his other investments the u s limits foundations corporate involvement another attraction under bermuda law foundations do not have to disclose their activities to the public for both competitive and personal security reasons mr feeney was obsessively secretive about the extent of his wealth and what he was doing with it the veil finally dropped after duty free shoppers or dfs was sold to louis vuitton moet hennessy in the sale swelled atlantic philanthropies already overflowing coffers by &# billion but it also touched off a flurry of lawsuits and securities inquiries that persuaded mr feeney and his advisers that it was time to make public his identity and the activities of atlantic philanthropies he later came to feel that publicizing his work would encourage other wealthy folks to follow his policy of "giving while living " by then as mr oclery shows the organization had established itself as a significant grant maker it supported the development of research centers and universities in ireland vietnam south africa and other countries though criticized for making grants to sinn fein the political arm of the irish republican army mr feeney also donated money to efforts to reconcile northern irelands warring factions in the u s atlantic philanthropies underwrote a variety of liberal causes and copiously funded cornell university so far the organization has given away about &# billion mr oclery reports and it has done so in a manner that reflects mr feeneys unorthodox style one that flouts many practices held dear by todays foundations grant makers and their government overseers put a premium on public accountability but mr feeneys gifts were made anonymously and the recipients were sworn to secrecy if they happened to find out his identity most big foundations operate with large staffs and dozens of consultants relegating donors and trustees to oversight roles but mr feeney was directly involved in key program decisions at atlantic philanthropies sometimes to the consternation of administrators and even knew junior staff members by name another unusual aspect of mr feeneys charitable work he doesnt want atlantic philanthropies to outlast him most large foundations are set up to operate indefinitely a recipe according to some for ensuring that they will act in ways that their donors never intended atlantic philanthropies is scheduled to go out of business by but since it is now worth about &# billion it will have to donate at a rate of about a million dollars a day to do so "spending is not a big problem " says mr feeney "but spending it meaningfully is " mr oclery gives mr feeney high marks for the quality of his spending so far but the irish journalist focuses overmuch on atlantic philanthropies charitable work in his native land a more thorough accounting is needed especially of the foundations activities in the u s where mr feeney has directed nearly &# billion so far still the bar against which mr feeneys philanthropic work will be measured is low traditional foundation practices are increasingly being called into question at the ford foundation the trustees recently chose as the organizations next president a business consultant with no prior grant making experience the trustees seemed to be saying that philanthropy is too important to be left to professional philanthropists it is a paradox that chuck feeney might relish mr lenkowsky is professor of public affairs and philanthropic studies at indiana university
