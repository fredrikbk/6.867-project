the price of many of the imported goods we buy from crude oil to chilean fruit to japanese dvd players though some currencies including the chinese yuan are closely tied or pegged to the dollar and import prices from those countries are little affected and when foreign goods become more expensive u s producers often feel freer to raise their prices and still remain competitive thus even if your
