europe u s split on emissions brussels europes plan to include airlines in a carbon emissions trading system is hitting trans atlantic resistance but officials insist they will proceed with the measure the international civil aviation organization a united nations body that oversees global air travel has scheduled a vote in montreal this week perhaps as early as today on the european plan u s led opposition is mounting the vote of the u n group wont be binding but it will represent "an important step" since it will show whether "the global aviation community" supports europes stance said joao vieira of the european federation of transport and environment an environmental group in brussels the issue also will be raised at a separate two day high level climate meeting this week in washington which will gather the worlds biggest greenhouse gas emitting countries under the european commissions proposal european airlines would be forced to cap emissions starting in and foreign airlines flying into europe would join the plan in europe launched its trading system in for energy intensive companies outside the transport industry companies that overshoot their carbon dioxide targets must either pay a fine or buy permits from companies that pollute less than their limit airlines represent one of the fastest growing polluters so their inclusion is only natural the commission said the u s supported by brazil japan china and others rejects the european plan as an unacceptable unilateral burden on companies since world war ii aviation regulations have been set on a global basis through the u n body and opponents of the european plan consider it another eu attempt to set regulatory rules for the rest of the world brussels already has required u s companies to adhere to its regulations on chemicals and fined microsoft corp for antitrust activity the eu several years ago got in a similar fight with the u s over europes unilateral moves to restrict noisy aircraft instead of including air emissions in a trading system u s diplomats said europe could do much more to reduce aircraft pollution by streamlining its air control system which forces planes to fly fuel consuming indirect routes across the continent europe should target the predominant source of transport pollution cars buses and trucks not airlines they said "we dont think europe has the authority" to include our airlines so this "sounds like a lawsuit to me " which will end up needing to be resolved at the world trade organization said c boyden gray the u s ambassador to the european union while a wto case remains distant mr gray said manufacturers such as boeing co are developing fuel efficient models that will do more to reduce emissions than any carbon trading system despite u s opposition and a possible rebuke from the u n the eu plans to press ahead the international civil aviation organization supported establishing an emissions trading system in and and shouldnt move backward said barbara helfferich a spokeswoman for the european commission the aviation industry feels squeezed europes proposal will cost the industry about billion euros &# billion a year in fines and permits said giovanni bisignani head of the international air transport association an industry trade group according to u n scientists airplanes account for only of global carbon dioxide emissions airlines are "a small part of the big problem of climate change " said mr bisignani "europes intention to include aviation in its emissions trading scheme was a wake up call for everybody but the environment is a global issue requiring a global approach " environmentalists contest those figures the figure applies only to carbon dioxide not other types of pollution and refers to data said mr vieira of transport and environment by air transport accounted for as much as of the "climate change impact" of human activities he said the commissions ms helfferich said airline carbon emissions will more than double by over levels because of added flights european airlines see political pressure mounting the association of european airlines an industry trade group that represents big carriers such as british airways plc and air france klm sa said it is better to institute an emissions trading system that treats all european and foreign airlines equally rather than one that hits only european carriers "air emissions trading is better than a fuel tax too " said david henderson the associations information manager "we can support an aircraft emissions scheme provided it is a well designed scheme that treats everybody equally what we dont want is a scheme that has only a tiny impact on global emissions and damages the competitiveness of european airlines " analysts believe overwhelming support exists in the european parliament to approve some sort of emissions plan
