schoolkids post modest gains in national test naep scores are up since but persistent gaps fuel fight over no child left behind u s schoolchildren won higher marks on a national report card intensifying the battle over the renewal of no child left behind president bushs signature education law yesterday the national assessment of educational progress or naep administered by the u s department of education showed an increase in math and reading achievement among u s fourth and eighth graders from to supporters of no child left behind immediately hailed the results as showing the success of the law which is up for renewal this year and aims to bring students from all backgrounds up to minimum education standards but despite improving performance among most racial groups the lagging performance of minority students often called the "achievement gap " persisted from past years in addition despite some improvement in math scores since no child left behind took effect in reading results among eighth graders have actually declined since then those results give ammunition to those who want to change the federal education law darvin m winick chairman of the national assessment governing board which sets policy for the naep called the results "a promising report card for american students " but he said the "achievement gaps remain too large and are a continuing challenge that demands our full attention " the results of the naep often called the "nations report card " are closely watched because the assessment is considered the most rigorous broad and significant set of tests given to u s children more than students participated in the latest round states give standardized tests but they vary in difficulty and instructors can raise scores by "teaching to the test " no child left behind mandates that all students be proficient in reading and math by it also requires that school systems show steady progress toward meeting that goal or face sanctions including paying for outside tutors or letting parents transfer their children elsewhere students must show progress not only overall but in subgroups such as minority children or those with disabilities critics including many administrators and teachers have attacked the laws requirements of repeated testing and questioned whether the goals are realistic and the penalties too onerous last month in an effort to answer those concerns george miller the california democrat who is chairman of the house committee on education and labor released proposals that would give school systems more flexibility to meet no child left behind requirements states would let schools that fail tests show progress in other ways such as improvements in test scores in other subject areas graduation rates or college enrollment rates the proposed changes would also make it easier to show progress among students with disabilities and those with limited english proficiency groups that tend to struggle mightily to reach proficiency yesterday mr miller said the results demonstrated the need for changes in the laws accountability structure to "make the law more fair and flexible " he said "with an improved law and better funding i believe that we will see much stronger achievement gains among all students " the bush administration has attacked some of the proposed changes saying they would make it too easy for schools to show their students are making the grade "were going in the right direction and we dont need to let up now " u s secretary of education margaret spellings said yesterday jack jennings president of the center on education policy a nonpartisan think tank in washington pointed out that naep scores have been improving for more than years in a fact sure to be cited by opponents of no child left behind mr jennings noted that gains were sharper immediately before the law took effect than afterward "that finding is going to be one of the most explosive " he said on the reading test on a scale of zero to fourth graders posted an average score of up two points from the gap between black and white students narrowed by two points to points there was no significant narrowing in the gap between white and hispanic students eighth graders also showed gains with scores rising one point to but the results showed no improvement in the achievement gap on the fourth grade math test scores increased two points to with no significant improvement in the gap between white and minority students eighth grade scores rose three points to with improvements in the gaps between the scores of white and black students but not white and hispanic children fourteen states and the district of columbia improved their overall mathematics scores at both the fourth grade and eighth grade levels from to and no state showed a decline in achievement fewer states showed improvement in reading and since no child left behind took effect in national eighth grade reading scores have declined one point to yesterday ms spellings said math scores had improved more than reading scores because schools can have more of an impact on math whereas reading is heavily influenced by circumstances in homes kati haycock president of education trust a washington nonprofit that focuses on raising achievement levels of kids from minority and low income families said the nation has to work on reversing the trend toward poorer results among older kids especially those in high school catherine snow an education professor at harvard university who favors making no child left behind more flexible said the test gains could stem from state efforts that predated the law "one thing we know about school improvement is if it is going to be widespread it isnt going to be sudden " she said a new report card fourth graders math and reading scores rose two points in from progress on the achievement gap between the scores of white and minority students was mixed since when no child left behind took effect eighth grade math scores have improved but reading scores have declined
