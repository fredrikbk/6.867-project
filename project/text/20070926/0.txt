joba the heat the yankees rookie justin chamberlain major league baseball in the st century may be the most ethnically diverse of all major sports with some current rosters looking like a veritable united nations the new york yankees alone field players from japan taiwan puerto rico panama the dominican republic and venezuela as well as players of mixed ancestry such as white and african american and white and thai curiously one ethnic group is mostly unrepresented americans indians now year old justin chamberlain of lincoln neb is changing that in a high profile way if youve been following baseball since early august you dont know him as justin and by the time you read this its likely no one will ever call him that again to yankee fans nebraskans and an increasing number of awestruck american league hitters the name is "joba" pronounced jah buh like the character from star wars jabba the hut those who have seen his phenomenal fastball in person have dubbed him "joba the heat " the name joba came from a young relative on the winnebago indian reservation in northeastern nebraska who couldnt say justin it stuck and joba is currently in the process of making it his legal name "people pronounce it wrong all the time " he says with a shrug "they still say joe ba " not his teammates and their followers to whom joba represents perhaps the last chance for the desperate yankees in the postseason no rookie pitcher in modern big league history has gotten so much attention with so few pitches but what pitches his fastball which has been clocked at more than miles per hour may be the fastest in either league and his down breaking slider which is over mph is faster than most pitchers fastballs "im not sure which pitch is more deadly " says ron guidry the yankees pitching coach "if you dont get good wood on his slider it feels like you just hit a bowling ball with a broomstick and his fastball thats really scary " how scary against the boston red sox on aug he was thrown out of the game and suspended for the next two not for hitting a boston batter but for merely throwing a fastball in the vicinity of his head to yankee fans old enough to remember the glory years of the late s and early s mr chamberlain has stirred up memories of another great right handed pitcher of american indian descent the late allie reynolds mr reynolds whose father was a creek indian from oklahoma joined the yankees years ago and over the next eight seasons won games lost only and helped the yankees win six world series in he pitched two no hitters in a single season "i think joba throws even harder than allie " says "the boys of summer" author roger kahn who covered the yankees for the new york herald tribune "and like reynolds chamberlain isnt afraid to throw inside theres one big difference allie was already when he came to new york yankee fans are going to be watching joba chamberlain grow up " the prospect of a grown up joba is sobering at feet inches and pounds he has already looked overpowering to great hitters like david ortiz of the red sox the detroit tigers magglio ordonez and the los angeles angels vladimir guerrero his appearances have been few but memorable games innings and an amazing strikeouts against just six walks his record so far is and his earned run average is a microscopic "some day somebodys got to score a run off him " said mr guidry a couple of weeks ago "i think " someone finally did mike lowell of the red sox who homered against him but mr chamberlain still got the win jobas story seems destined for hollywood his father harlan who was born on the winnebago reservation was stricken with polio at the age of months the disease ravaged the left side of his body despite the affliction harlan worked more than years as a counselor at the nebraska state penitentiary while raising joba and his younger sister money was scarce but when joba was years old his father scraped enough of it together to buy him a sega genesis "man what a christmas " he recalls "that was my first big christmas present " hard put to afford new baseball gear for his son harlan paid &# for catchers equipment at a yard sale when joba was a boy harlan practiced with him from a wheelchair catching the ball in a glove on his right hand then removing the glove and tossing the ball back toward the end of his high school career joba got serious about baseball and lost nearly pounds he played division ii baseball at the university of nebraska kearney and then transferred to the university of nebraska lincoln a division i school helping pitch the cornhuskers to the college world series fiercely proud of his heritage mr chamberlain makes frequent trips to the reservation to visit among other friends and family his uncle keith and aunt lisa he phones lincoln every day to talk to his girlfriend and check up on his month old son karter and he talks to his father at least once a day harlan a yankees cap on his head follows the games online last sunday he was at yankee stadium watching his son strike out three toronto blue jays while recording his first save in a victory it was also jobas nd birthday after the final strike fans crowded around harlan for autographs the yankees chose joba st in the highest pick for any american indian player in the history of the college draft starting the season with the yankees single a affiliate in tampa he streaked through their system double a ball in trenton n j triple a in scranton wilkes barre pa in what seems like less time than it takes to drive from florida to the bronx the yankees have imposed strict rules for the care and handling of their young phenom the joba rules or the book of joba as they have quickly come to be known include not using him on consecutive days and not bringing him in during the middle of an inning mr chamberlain has been trained as a starting pitcher which is what the yankees expect him to be next year and the team doesnt want him to change that routine to the inevitable question about whether he wants to be a starter or reliever joba is indifferent "wherever the team needs me my dad always tells me joba knock em dead whatever they want me to do my attitudes going to be the same lower my hat grip the ball go to work " mr barra writes about sports for the journal
