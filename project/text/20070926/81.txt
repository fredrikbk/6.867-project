mother teresas struggle against darkness in regard to "the ennui of saint teresa" by arthur c brooks editorial page sept i think most if not all of the reviewers of mother teresas book of letters miss the point who among us would not feel the darkness and sadness if all we did was to care for tens of thousands of sick and dying people who among us would not have questioned god or his wisdom if on a daily basis we saw tens of thousands of young people dying from aids who among us would go on caring unceasingly in the face of all this but a saint mother teresa went on in silent resignation questioning god but always doing his work we are a society that believes that as long as one says the "right things" and gives voice to the "correct causes" one is a good person when those people come face to face with a truly good and honest person they do not understand because that persons actions speak louder than their words i am sure mother teresa is a saint and i now know by her letters she was truly a great human being as well george meringolo dagsboro del arthur brooks proposes that the sadness mother teresa experienced throughout her life was because she may not have felt "very close to god " i disagree i suggest that her sadness was due to the fact that she once experienced the direct presence of christ and like her namesakes therese of lisieux and teresa of avila who had similar experiences subsequently experienced a "dark night of the soul " one could imagine that having once experienced this gift these saints may have longed for it again throughout their lives and were sad at its absence dennis floyd denver i fail to understand the point of mr brookss commentary according to his data religious and semi religious people are likely to be "happier" than their secular peers isnt that the fallacy of religion and various belief systems by embracing the multitudinous forms of what the philosopher david hume so aptly termed the "sophistry and illusion" so typical of religious belief people seek to insulate themselves from harsh reality by subscribing to fantastic non empirical and anti scientific myths they delude themselves into being "happy" an ambiguous term that mr brooks never defines thus karl marx hit the nail right on the head "religion is the opiate of the masses " cant we have even greater respect for mother teresa after reading about her spiritual crisis clearly the terrible human misery and suffering that she witnessed on a daily basis led her toward the obvious conclusion and this in no way diminishes her saintliness robert w torchia ph d philadelphia it is difficult to assign people precisely into categories such as religious and secular a friend of mine once confided to me the irony of him being an atheist and the president of his congregation agnostics and atheists are members of congregations and attend services for reasons of ethnic bonding and family and peer pressure jack d israel bellevue wash
