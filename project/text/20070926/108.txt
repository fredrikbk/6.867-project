sales from mobile book and comic book services are expected to more than double to more than &# million from about &# million last year mobile novel writers like getting instant feedback from readers that encourages them to keep going or even to change stories to suit readers of course the close interaction between reader and writer can sometimes be too much a year old woman who wrote a sad love story called "what the angel gave me" under the pen name chaco became so popular two years ago that she was getting unique online visitors a day chaco who wont disclose her real name says she felt pressured to update her novel and respond to comments every day to keep readers happy "i was getting only one to two hours of sleep a night " says chaco a petite neatly dressed woman her phone was ringing with email messages from fans at four in the morning she eventually moved her web page off the maho i lands web site onto a private site where she has more control over the feedback the novels with the most online readers also tend to sell well in the bookstores starts publishing corp a small tokyo publisher was one of the first to take advantage of the mobile novel genre when a chaco fan

fans of mobile novels say the best of them are a good read maika oya a year old high school student in southern japan says she likes to read dark mobile novels because theyre often based on true stories and "theyre more real" than the mobile novels with happy endings "deep love " about a year old high school student who has sex with men for money is still one of her favorites nobody knows how much staying power the genre will have or whether authors who specialize in writing about their own experiences will run dry but some mobile novelists are determined not to let that happen chaco who wrote the sad story of her romance with a boy who died in a motorcycle accident wants to make a career of writing and she is trying to improve her style "i used to write whatever came to my mind without giving it much thought " she says "but now i think a lot more about story development "
