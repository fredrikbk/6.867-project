dont rush into biotech buys new york the cliche of "buy the rumor sell the news" may sometimes ring true but in the biotech world the theme appears closer to "buy the headline sell the data " it is no surprise that the biotechnology stocks are event driven with double or even triple digit swings based on a study or food and drug administration ruling but there is also a more subtle trend in recent years with shares surging when positive initial data from a study are issued usually in the form of a press release but then showing a notable drop after the full data are released months later for investors who see a positive study as reason to buy one of these stocks there may be an advantage to waiting until after the data are released to get in on the cheap "it is a common phenomenon " says analyst steve brozak with wbb securities "there is so little consistent positive news that takes place in this industry that you get into an environment where any news is rewarded " the preliminary data usually cover the effectiveness of a given trial sometimes with only minimal detail and provide the first hint to investors of the overall outcome with the full data release having the intricate details mr brozak notes that when the full data come out the information provides a chance for a thorough analysis because although data may be "statistically significant " there are other issues to determine whether the data are "clinically significant " "there are quality of life issues and reimbursement issues so it is hard to determine the real significance " he adds a notable example of the difference is the so called crystal study of imclone systems inc s erbitux cancer treatment this year in january the company said the study met its primary goal of increasing progression free survival in colorectal cancer patients when used as a first line treatment with chemotherapy news that sent imclone shares surging but when the data were disclosed in june it was revealed that the actual improvement was only modest sending the stock lower other recent examples include onyx pharmaceuticals inc which nearly doubled when data were released in february but fell in the days after the full data came out in june elsewhere acorda therapeutics inc spiked almost four times its value a year ago on study news but in may dropped in the period after the full data were released despite the information flow being controlled by the company robert baird &amp co analyst christopher raymond doesnt think that companies are overselling the data in their releases he said long term investors have no reason to worry about these moves "this is a short term trading call not a long term fundamental call " he adds indeed traders are aware of the trend and look to make money by marking their calendars for fda rulings along with study and data releases from biotech companies according to william lefkowitz chief options strategist at vfinance investments inc "if they come out and say positive things it doesnt always seem to come true " mr lefkowitz said he notes that there are often traders buying put options on the days when companies surge on this type of news put options are contracts that give traders the right to sell a stock at a fixed price in the future accordingly they rise in value as the stock falls below their exercise price though investors need to look ahead and account for when the data are expected to be released it is often a money making maneuver "if you can pinpoint the date you can definitely buy those puts as the stock often comes down " he said in the meantime investors are hungry for data following imclones surge last week after positive news from its overseas marketing partner for erbitux merck kgaa a study showed the drug increased survival in advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer patients when used with chemotherapy but the details of the study wont be seen until some point in the first half of similarly pharmion corp surged in august after impressive top line survival data for vidaza showed that it prolonged survival in higher risk patients with myelodysplastic syndrome a blood disorder compared with a collection of conventional care regimens but mr raymond warns that the data presentation at decembers meeting of the american society of hematology is critical as details of side effects and dosing become clearer as must it must show advantages as it competes commercially with mgi pharma inc s dacogen mr raymond suggests that investors that become interested in these stocks following positive top line data may save some money by waiting until all the details are known
