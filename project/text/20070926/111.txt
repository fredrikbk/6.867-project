the afternoon report is everybody happy online edition general motors and the united auto workers made music in motown on wednesday reaching a tentative contract agreement and putting an end to a two day strike a critical negotiation point was that of gms retiree health care obligations estimated at more than &# billion over time as of tuesday the burden was equivalent to more than double gms market capitalization and also eclipsed comparable costs at other u s auto makers the deal allows gm to move the liability off its books and to an independent trust which it would fund with an up front payment of up to &# billion uaw would then invest those funds and assume responsibility for the health care costs of about retired gm hourly workers and their spouses "year after year gm would spend &# to &# billion on retiree health care but couldnt estimate what the line item would be " said rebecca lindland director of the automotive industry group at global insight creating the trust she said "allows gm to stabilize a cost that was unknown every year and it also guarantees the union that they will be able to have elite health care coverage " so called legacy costs are only part of gms problem noted peter morici a professor at the university of maryland school of business "this pact does a lot to reduce legacy costs but not enough to eliminate actual costs gm faces in making vehicles today " he wrote in a note this morning a two tiered wage system that lets gm pay less to non manufacturing employees recalls a structure that is already in place at toyota but the costs for workers on the assembly line at gm remain high and gm is still committed to making certain products in the u s a constraint that doesnt apply to toyota he added remaining competitive with toyota is a pressing concern as the japanese car maker continues to build on its share of gms home market gm chief rick wagoner said in a statement that the labor deal "helps us close the fundamental competitive gaps" in the auto business an apparent reference to the labor cost differential of about &# to &# an hour between gms unionized u s operations and non union toyota plants for his part uaw president ron gettelfinger said in a radio interview earlier today that union membership would be "very pleased" with the agreement which includes a commitment from gm to make substantial investments in u s plants he conceded that the creation of the retiree health care trust would likely spark debate as to whether those benefits would be sufficiently funded the proposed contract also gives gm the ability to buy out thousands of production and support workers and replace them with new employees who will earn much less nonetheless the deal has enough give and take to make both parties happy and should find support in the rank and file said gary chaison a professor of labor relations at clark university in worcester mass "i think most workers understand that these are hard times in the industry and strong medicine is necessary if the company is going to turn around " the contract which workers may vote on this weekend is expected to set the standard for uaw negotiations with other auto makers next gm boosts markets gm shares were ahead at &# around midday driving a broader rally the dow jones industrial average added or to while the nasdaq composite index gained or to the s&amp
