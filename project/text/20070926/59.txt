gm uaw discuss final details of proposed labor agreement framework gives company more hiring flexibility creates health care fund detroit general motors corp and the united auto workers were working on the final details late last night of a new four year labor contract that would create a multibillion dollar union run retiree health care fund and allow the auto maker more flexibility to hire new workers at lower cost according to people familiar with the talks at the same time the agreement under discussion would assure the uaw that gm would make continued investment in the u s these people said in a time when the auto maker has looked increasingly abroad for growth a deal wasnt final last night and details have yet to be completed these people said individuals familiar with the process cautioned that the situation could remain fluid until uaw president ron gettelfinger and the uaw leadership formally sign off on a deal still considerable progress had been made on a proposed agreement that included all major economic issues including wages pensions benefits and plant investments said the people familiar with the matter the movement in the talks came at the end of the second day of a national strike by the uaw against gm a uaw official briefed on the talks said the unions executive board still needed to vote on the proposed agreement before it was final in anticipation of an agreement the union had begun to write up highlights of it late last night this person added gm which is leading talks that also cover workers at rivals ford motor co and chrysler llc has been seeking a transformative labor deal that would help it close the cost gap with asia based auto makers which have been taking market share in their core u s market any agreement will be studied closely to see how competitive it makes the big three which have lost billions in their north american operations in recent years a major component of the proposed agreement was the trust which would handle billions of dollars in retiree health care costs as of late last night the union run investment fund called a voluntary employees beneficiary association or veba was likely to be funded at cents to cents on the dollar according to people familiar with the talks this person added that because of the complexities of the fund and the different ways a retiree health care obligation can be accounted for gm and the uaw may say it was funded at different levels gm has an estimated &# billion retiree health care obligation to uaw members and retirees at cents on the dollar the fund would be worth in excess of &# billion among the other key elements of the proposed agreement these people said were substantial changes to the much maligned jobs bank a job security provision that allowed unemployed members to receive full pay for years without working the provision will still exist but will be changed to make it much less likely there will be many people in the jobs bank for any length of time other elements as of late last night these people said included a new hire rate for new uaw members brought into gm the rate would probably be far less than the current wage and compensation package given to uaw gm members said these people however to temporary workers at gm would be hired in as full time workers and paid what is called the master wage the rate paid to big three uaw employees that combined with benefits adds up to &# to &# an hour the temporary workers were making far less to make room for new hires gm would again offer substantial early retirement buyouts for workers getting these temporary workers hired as full time gm employees at the compensation rate was a top priority for the uaw which has seen its membership slide and was seen as a graying union under the framework taking shape last night the uaw would be able to point to increased pensions for retirees and substantial investment commitments from gm for plants in the u s many of those tied to new cars trucks engines and transmissions the company has on the drawing board gm would be able to negotiate a diversion on cost of living adjustments and increased cost sharing on health care for active workers another potentially big gain for gm if the agreement is approved no wage increases during the life of the contract as of last night there was also a likely &# signing bonus for workers plus lump sum bonuses of and of their annual pay over the last three years of the deal said these people among the final hurdles on the deal said people informed on the talks were discussions about sanitation workers at the plants what they will get paid and how much their wages could grow despite the strikes disruption the auto makers shares weakened only slightly in p m new york stock exchange composite trading gms shares were down to &# investors and analysts were betting that more than striking auto workers will shortly return to the assembly lines the two sides have been holding marathon sessions since sept but the strike and a series of public statements by mr gettelfinger have made it clear that for much of that time gm and uaw leaders were miscalculating the resolve of their counterparts yesterday mr gettelfinger stepped up public pressure on gm to improve its offers on job security and profit sharing with union workers the walkout the first by the uaw against gm since comes as strikes have waned in the u s and as labor experts question their effectiveness the declining ranks of union members in the u s and the increasing shift of work abroad two issues faced in particular by the uaw have heightened the risks for striking workers in an interview with detroit radio station wjr yesterday mr gettelfinger said "we went in there knowing that we were going to do some things differently its just unfortunate that they didnt meet us halfway " still he said "both sides have failed at the bargaining table " and he said the strike "may be a good thing because it may bring an end to this thing quicker " the union in years past typically entered negotiations with the big three with an eye on scoring higher wages and benefits without any significant givebacks but the u s auto industry has undergone significant changes as the big threes market share has dwindled the recent downturn in sport utility vehicle and pickup demand has battered the u s auto makers and all three still are struggling to compete in passenger car segments dominated by asian auto makers gm chief executive officer rick wagoner meanwhile has pursued a strategy aimed at minimizing the uaws power over the car makers production and profitability mr wagoner took the helm of gm in implementing a policy of designing gm vehicles so they could be sold and built anywhere in the world by analysts expect gm will be in a position to shift a significant amount of work out of the u s if the conditions warrant kris maher in pittsburgh contributed to this
