video for everyman until recently paulino brener used an eight millimeter camcorder to shoot videos and sometimes edited them on his pc with software from microsoft corp but the minneapolis based spanish teacher found the video making process cumbersome since the camcorder downloaded video slowly and he used the windows movie maker software to make only simple changes so four months ago mr brener bought a small &# device that stores video on built in memory and plugs right into his computer he says his new flip video camera from pure digital technologies inc is easy to use to film short clips and he rarely needs any software to edit his footage today the year old posts videos on video sharing sites like google inc s youtube and his own blog more regularly than in the past "i havent done anything i would consider professional " says mr brener "its more like snap and go and not a lot of processing which i kind of like " mr brener is part of a new generation of consumers taking a different approach to making home videos in the past many consumers purchased expensive camcorders from the likes of sony corp and victor company of japan ltd s jvc as well as well as pricey video editing software such as adobe systems inc s premiere elements in order to create professional looking videos of their kids first steps or sporting achievements but spurred by the popularity of sharing video clips via email or on sites such as youtube which generally feature short lower quality segments consumers like mr brener now say they no longer need such heavy duty technology many of these consumers arent as concerned with picture quality or shooting video in high definition since the file would be too hefty to easily email or upload to the web to cater to this generation makers of camcorders and video editing software are unveiling cheaper less powerful versions of their products sony rca pure digital and samsung electronics co recently introduced stripped down camcorders some with built in memory that can record up to an hour of video the new devices which typically weigh a third of a pound compared with around one pound for a traditional camcorder also are less expensive and often can fit in the palm of a hand most cost around &# compared with &# or more for many traditional camcorders because electronics makers can skimp on expensive components that improve picture quality the cameras also record in a format known as mpeg that can be compressed into smaller file sizes to easily email or upload for extra recording time many of the cameras come with slots for standard memory cards that fit into many digital cameras meanwhile yahoo inc adobe and others are offering new free video editing software tools online unlike existing video editing software which

last year yahoo acquired jumpcut a maker of free online video editing tools other video editing web sites such as motionbox inc and one true media inc have also emerged these companies provide basic editing tools free and some charge annual fees for premium services such as additional storage and features such as certain music additional art and download capabilities in case of mishaps the original videos stay intact "everyday consumers dont know how to use desktop video editing tools so we really aim to provide a much easier web based experience " says chris obrien chief executive of motionbox in new york that approach appeals to consumers like william hessian a year old minneapolis based artist mr hessian uses his two year old digital camera to film short clips and then uploads them to the web and edits them online at yahoos jumpcut site mr hessian says he previously edited a movie using apples final cut express software that software was a big investment and took a lot of time he says with jumpcut he finds it simple to use and likes that he can access the online service from any computer with an internet connection "its way more easy to be creative within the small amount of editing options and the simplicity " he says "when you have all the options of pc based video editing software youre kind of overwhelmed " the no frills video movement is taking off as the traditional video making market matures camcorder sales for instance have been relatively flat world wide camcorder production reached million units in down from according to market research firm isuppli corp the category is expected to decline to million by "that is what is exciting about this new interest in online video sharing its a new usage which is stimulating interest in camcorder and video recording devices so thats an opportunity for our industry " says yolanda hunt boes a spokeswoman for sony rcas small wonder camcorder recently caught the interest of kim huston a year old video editor for a production company in milwaukee ms huston says she is the type of person who always wants to have a video camera on her but her previous digital camcorder was "huge and expensive and i had to put in tape " so several weeks ago she bought the rca camera because it was portable and easy to use "its such a difference from having this giant pound case of a camera " says ms huston "i can put the rca camcorder in my purse and i have a really small purse "
