work on paralysis shows just how hard it is to read minds i want you to close your eyes and concentrate hard on what its like to use your hand to click your computer mouse now i want you to really click your mouse you wouldnt think so but as the exercise shows its often easier to simply do something than to think about doing it thats one of the brains many mysteries as well as one of the challenges facing researchers trying to enable people to control computers using only their thoughts the goal of this "brain computer interface" work is to bring some form of communication to people who are fully conscious but paralyzed on account of disease or spinal cord injuries laypeople might think that to click a mouse the brain sends some sort of "click mouse" signal thats easy to detect with medicines growing arsenal of brain imaging hardware no such luck while sensors honed in on the specific part of the brain involved with hand movement will indeed pick up electrical signals scientists dont yet understand which of those signals are just "noise " moreover the next mouse click might produce different signals in different groups of neurons as a result brain computer control is currently painfully slow it may take several seconds for patients to move their cursors from one side of a screen to another though they tend to get better with practice for paralyzed patients of course communication at any speed is welcome john p donoghue a brown university researcher says the best he expects for the first generation of widely deployed brain computer control systems is performance a little better than that associated with parkinsons disease dr donoghues work involves tiny sensors that are surgically implanted underneath the scalp these sensors are presumed to give more precise readings of the brains electrical activity than the familiar eeg headsets which fit over the skull like a cap and must deal with the brains roar of electrical activity but jonathan r wolpaw of the wadsworth center in albany n y a leader in eeg work says external devices are getting much better and are becoming as precise as implants are said to be but without requiring surgery thats true he says even though eegs are a more familiar technology having been around for nearly a century with none of the futuristic appeal of implants which are of more recent origin the computer control systems of both prof donoghue and prof wolpaw require users to concentrate on a task another approach to the problem is to take advantage of the brains "reflex" actions those that occur without our conscious knowledge for example neurons in the visual cortex will automatically "fire" at the same rate as something blinking so melody moore jackson at georgia tech university shows patients a keyboard on a screen each "key" a colored square flashing at a different frequency she monitors her patients brain activity as they concentrate first on one square and then another the result is that patients can "type" at up to eight characters a minute none of these systems has been tested with more than a handful of patients and widespread availability is years away because of the slow speeds of these brain control systems they arent being considered as replacements for the keyboard and mouse used by fully abled people but other possibilities are being explored researchers for example are getting better at detecting overall brain states such as attention excitement or anger which might one day be useful in the office desney tan a microsoft researcher describes how an operating system many years hence might use a brain oxygen scanner built into your chairs headrest to glean that at a given moment youre completely preoccupied with whatever youre doing the software might thus hold off on alerting you to a new email at least until the scanner senses that you again have the mental bandwidth to deal with it one group might be ready for brain computer control right now computer gamers who tend to match a love of gadgets with abundant disposable income companies including neurosky and emotiv both of california expect game controls using their technology will be available next year the systems will be too slow to control rapid fire shooter games but can be used say the companies for slower movements such as checking inventories researchers are skeptical that brain computer control technology has evolved enough to be useful now even in a game but say theyre watching commercial developments with interest dr donoghue notes that the ultimate goal is restoring the use of a paralyzed body if we can reliably detect a "move mouse" brain signal he says theres no reason that we shouldnt be able to actually signal the hand to move which was the brains intent all along in that spirit he envisions a future system in disabled persons in which scanners pick up brain signals and transmit them over a fiber optic cable implanted in the person connecting the brain with a hand or leg the signal can then be used to trigger the intended muscle movement while "mind reading" is part of the standard orwellian dystopia the actual technology is still extraordinarily primitive thats bad news for immobile patients but should be solace for anyone worried about private thoughts being public email me at lee gomes wsj com
