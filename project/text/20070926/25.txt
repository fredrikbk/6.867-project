common sense u s auto firms need one goal build the best smartmoney in another life id love to run a u s auto maker with general motors on strike billions in losses and u s auto makers market share in a seemingly irreversible decline i can understand why youd think this is crazy maybe im an incurable optimist when it comes to american cars rooted in a love affair that began when my father brought home a desoto with power windows but detroits glorious past isnt the main reason im convinced that all the industry needs is some bold ideas and leadership id like to think that alan mulally at ford is the man for the job since i own the stock myself and have held on despite several opportunities this year to exit with a nice profit but i have some bold ideas myself i start with the proposition that quality is not only the most important goal but the only goal quite simply the reason i want to be chief executive of an auto maker is to make the best car in the world id manage everything around that aim that may sound simple but consider what goals get lost as a result market share short term profitability number of employees health care and other benefits and everything else that creates static when the auto industry is the subject all of these problems would vanish if people were lined up to buy american cars because they were the best and lets dont pretend that they are now im tired of all the hand wringing in detroit about the inexplicable failure of american customers to recognize how much detroits products have improved yes they have improved its impressive that buick tied lexus at the top of the latest j d powers quality survey but as an american i take it as an affront that the most exciting car on the road is the toyota prius the simplicity of this goal also offers a road map for labor relations the uaw has to get on board and will when it recognizes how a thriving quality based auto industry will meet its workers needs i have some sympathy for the unions current plight the workers werent responsible for the decision to stake the industrys future on trucks and suvs but auto workers need and should embrace incentives that align their interests with the goal of building the best cars this may mean a more competitive less egalitarian workplace in the short run but the alternative is far worse to further this effort id like to see someone step up and offer a prize to the team responsible for designing and building the best new car in the world whoever funds the prize could define the parameters and time frame but surely qualities would include environmental sustainability performance style practicality and affordability google has offered a &# million lunar x prize to the first team to land a vehicle on the moon by how about at least that much for a project a little closer to home earlier this year the x prize foundation proposed an automotive x prize to "inspire a new generation of viable superefficient vehicles that help break our addiction to oil and stem the effects of climate change " id prefer something a bit less polemical but this is a good start guidelines are being developed and a dollar prize hasnt been announced so theres still a google like opportunity for someone to step in and make this a reality x prize hopes to hold races in and this being a global economy the competition would be open to anyone it might well be won by the japanese europeans or anyone else but americans invented the car they thrive on competition if i was running a u s auto company wed be in the competition and id bet on the home team james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
