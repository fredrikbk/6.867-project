moodys s&amp p answer critics over bond calls rating firms to explain their mortgage miss reforming the system credit rating firms evaluate the risk bonds wont be paid back on time now they are working on a different task damage control over some critical evaluations of their own performance executives of moodys investors service owned by moodys corp and mcgraw hill cos standard &amp poors are scheduled to speak at hearings on capitol hill today and tomorrow the appearances will be some of their first public comments over the outcry that has followed their decision to downgrade hundreds of mortgage bond ratings over the summer a move that came a little too late according to some critics and helped exacerbate the credit markets woes since moodys also is trying to answer some critics by suggesting a host of industry overhauls it says would help prevent a repeat of this summers problems the effort is an attempt to head off more extensive and expensive federal regulations while restoring ratings firms reputation among investors who worry the ratings for complex structured mortgage products may not be as reliable as they thought rating firms play an integral role in the mortgage market homeowners borrow from mortgage bankers which often resell the loans to wall street firms the loans get bundled and repackaged as part of securities that are evaluated by the rating firms and then sold the rating firms help investors understand the risk of these bonds defaulting by putting a rating such as a stellar triple a on the bonds some of those ratings have come into question as the firms have downgraded hundreds of previously highly rated securities contributing to the turmoil in credit markets as investors dumped downgraded securities and refused to step in and buy securities on the market "were very nervous right now " says richard metcalf director of corporate affairs for the laborers international union of north america which advises pension funds "well be much less likely to invest in these types of products if were not assured were getting an honest and independent rating " some have questioned if the rating firms are independent from the wall street firms that issue bonds and pay for their ratings mr metcalf says he wants rating firms to disclose more about their business practices much like accounting firms did with the sarbanes oxley law moodys is focusing on changes that could improve the data it relies on to rate bonds in the hard hit subprime mortgage area moodys and other rating firms sometimes relied on what turned out to be bad data on the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the homes they bought among the firms suggestions requiring more reporting on loan performance and including auditors who would review the accuracy of loan information such as appraised home values and borrowers credit history moodys suggests a third party a mortgage trustee for example could audit loans by contacting borrowers to confirm their income loan terms and whether the house is their primary residence "we have to restore the confidence in what we do " says brian clarkson president of moodys rating business moodys says it would potentially give higher ratings to mortgage bonds that abide by its recommendations the problems with the ratings started when the default rates on some subprime bonds started coming in much higher than projected if investors lose confidence in ratings markets for new issues can dry up hurting revenue at both the ratings firms and at wall street firms if worries persist ratings could be viewed as less valuable and issuers may become less willing to pay firms to rate their bonds in a recent interview with a german newspaper former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said people believed rating firms "knew what they were doing" in complex mortgage products but that in fact it wasnt feasible for them to rate some of these bonds correctly in any event he said more regulations for rating firms arent needed because the issuance of structured finance products will drop in response to concerns about the ability to rate the instruments still the senate banking committee today and a house financial services subcommittee tomorrow will ask if rating firms need more rules securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox is slated to testify today the committees chairman christopher dodd wrote to mr cox on monday suggesting topics could include whether the agency should consider revoking firms designation to rate certain securities in cases where ratings have been particularly inaccurate last fall congress passed the credit rating agency reform act of aimed at fostering more competition among rating firms and giving the sec the ability to inspect the books and policies governing ratings firms the law prohibits the sec from second guessing rating decisions saying the agency cant substitute its judgment for that of the rating firms mr cox is expected to discuss today the secs investigation into whether the rating firms were unduly influenced by underwriters and also whether rating firms diverted from their stated ratings methodologies the issues affecting the ratings are most acute in subprime mortgages and moodys expressed concern that similar problems could affect the trillions of dollars of consumer bonds tied to other mortgages tuition payments credit card bills and auto debt moodys is trying to tackle mortgage industry problems head on calling for tougher regulation of mortgage brokers and considering adding new ways to quantify the risks of structured mortgage products the firm in a three page paper that will be provided to congress this week suggests the mortgage fixes could also be used in other structured finance ratings s&amp p the other large rating firm has so far focused more on defending its role in the recent mortgage market meltdown and improving its processes for rating mortgage bonds a spokeswoman for s&amp p says in addition to "increasing the frequency of our reviews" and "modifying our analytical models " s&amp p acquired a structured finance software firm and is "looking for ways to enhance the quality and quantity of data available to us " rating firms could face numerous proposals to change their practices among the ideas rotating analysts and requiring that analysts take time off before working at a wall street firm whose bonds they rated new york senator charles schumer a senior democrat on the banking committee is expected to raise the idea that credit rating agencies should switch back to having investors instead of issuers of the bonds pay for the ratings
