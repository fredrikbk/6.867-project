giving advertisers avenues to attract fickle young crowd questions for michael barrett company fox interactive media a unit of news corp title chief revenue officer myspace last week began offering advertisers the ability to target ads to myspace members based on their interests as defined in registration data and information on their personal profile pages the offering is one of the latest steps by the social networking web site to cash in on its enormous traffic but it comes amid signs that myspace may be losing ground to facebook inc among its fickle young audience myspace one of the most popular sites on the web drew million unique u s visitors in august the site anchors news corp s fox interactive media unit and accounted for about of fox interactives &# million in revenue for the fiscal year ended june news corp has agreed to buy the wall street journals publisher dow jones &amp co for more than &# billion a portion of that &# million came from an online advertising deal with google inc struck last year but myspace is rolling out other offerings for advertisers on monday fox interactive launched a mobile advertising platform for myspace as well as other fox interactive web sites such as ign com and photobucket com in hopes of tapping the fast growing mobile ad market myspace has launched sites in countries with at least international sites in the works in june michael barrett joined fox interactive as chief revenue officer he is responsible for all revenue expansion from international business development to subscriptions commerce and sales he came from time warner inc s aol where he was executive vice president of sales and partner marketing below mr barrett talks about developments at myspace and other fox interactive properties the wall street journal how important are profile targeted ads to myspaces future revenue projections mr barrett it is a huge piece of it since the very inception of social networks the promise for the owner of these networks and the marketers was the ability to target based upon folks passions and interests hopefully that would result in relevant ads to the right people at the right time that is what we are embarking upon wsj given that a lot of people lie about their age or location how can you guarantee to advertisers that the targeting information is of any value mr barrett i dont think there are any guarantees i think most marketers believe that there are going to be some profiles that are put in buckets that arent going to be spot on you are eliminating waste for the marketer but i dont think anyone is of the belief that we are anywhere near to the point where there is going to be zero waste wsj the no issue that comes up when marketers start talking about targeting their ads to specific consumers is privacy what precautions are you taking to protect users but still give advertisers the level of targeting they crave mr barrett ultimately if you allow users to opt out after you explain to them what youre planning on doing with this information that is out in the public youve gone as far if not further than almost any other web company in terms of protecting folks privacy wsj how do these ads differ from behavioral targeting which tracks the web sites a user visits and then delivers them an ad based on their likely interests mr barrett essentially one is inferred behavior if someone went to a travel site and then went to a bridal registry a behavioral targeting engine might assume that that person is planning for a honeymoon and so it serves them honeymoon ads as opposed to what we might do which is someone just got engaged and they post pictures of the evening they got engaged and they are talking about how excited they are and all their wedding plans and we know exactly that they are engaged so wedding marketers or travel marketers for honeymoons would be a perfect target for them ours is explicit the other is kind of implicit wsj is this a more viable type of targeting mr barrett early results show that it is effective i think it takes behavioral one step further wsj have any marketers expressed concerns that facebook seems to be gaining popularity with kids at the expense of myspace despite the size of the site mr barrett i dont agree with the statement that facebook is growing at the expense of myspace there is nothing that shows that our growth has plateaued but it would be pretty hard to get any more penetration than what we do in the u s you are starting to see a world in which people can have multiple profiles and multiple networks what does myspace do for them that a facebook wouldnt it seems that they are watching a lot more videos on myspace they are listening to a lot more music meeting new people now that social networking is so mainstream i dont think anybody is going to have a monopoly on social networking wsj how are you doing dealing with some of the issues that scared some advertisers away from advertising on the site such as risque material or sexual predators mr barrett two years ago it was the first question out of every marketers mouth now that most marketers are using social networks themselves as consumers they are starting to understand how there are safeguards in place this isnt just what some articles might portray as this scary dimly lit city wsj myspace is the no video site on the web after googles youtube with online video ads among the fastest growing categories of the online ad market can you talk about your efforts to generate revenue from those videos mr barrett most of our efforts in the video area are going to be around the professionally produced content it is easier to sell to marketers there also is a sense of comfort on the users part in that they are willing to wait through an advertisement because they know what is behind it which might not be a pet trick the user generated videos we are really not putting a lot of focus on right now in terms of monetization our focus is to become known as a destination to upload your video become known as a destination to view these videos downstream well figure out a way to make money off of it if there is a way wsj how will you stand out in the mobile ad market mr barrett marketers are already asking us to bundle their buys for myspace online with the mobile properties i think that is how we stand out we just use our existing relationships with clients and integrate programs and add mobile pieces to it because they want to reach that user of myspace anytime they are using myspace
