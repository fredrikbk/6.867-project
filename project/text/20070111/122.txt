the numbers guy epa improves its mileage estimates but stats still dont tell the whole story this fall car buyers may suffer from a new kind of sticker shock mileage estimates for model year cars will show figures much lower than in previous years some drops may be as high as the cars themselves arent changing instead the u s environmental protection agency has issued new rules for fuel economy testing that attempt to better mirror the experiences drivers have on the road everyone agrees the current numbers havent done a very good job at that for example the numbers you see on cars today are based on tests that assume acceleration of miles per hour per second though you dont see many ads trumpeting the achievement of zero to in seconds the current numbers also dont account for the use of air conditioning and assume maximum speeds of miles per hour critics of the epas current stats including the environmental group that proposed the change and auto experts and consumer advocates whose independent testing showed change was needed generally applaud the overhaul they say it brings more accurate information to consumers who are increasingly conscious of the environmental and financial impact of gasoline usage but caveats remain about the new fuel economy labels including their reliance on what is essentially a treadmill test of cars which still may not accurately capture real world performance also some critics say the focus should be on annual fuel cost not miles per gallon some cars with particularly high mpg ratings including hybrids will appear to take the biggest hit under the new rules when in fact their advantage over lower economy cars could end up being even greater more on that in a bit the numbers "help the public to compare one vehicle with another vehicle " margo oge director of the epa office of transportation air quality told me in an interview "it was really never meant to be a accurate test that reflects the fuel economy of every driver in every vehicle in different road conditions across the country " the new mpg ratings take into effect faster speeds miles per hour instead of and quicker acceleration eight miles per hour per second instead of they also consider the use of air conditioning and driving in cold weather in general average city mpg will drop by and highway will decline by the epa says the epa conducted road tests of vehicles including a test of more than cars in kansas city in and to calculate the effect of the new factors then it derived averages for each vehicle class for now auto makers are free to use these class average revisions or to run their own epa monitored tests on each model but by the model year all models must be individually tested current mileage estimates are based on tests car makers conduct using epa guidelines the epa runs its own tests on to of the cars to make sure there are no significant discrepancies ms oge said the new tests will create incentives for manufacturers to optimize their cars for the real world factors being tested such as minimizing gas usage while driving with the air conditioner on manufacturers began mandatory testing of their vehicles in the oil hungry s the last major revision of mpg estimates came in when the epa revised numbers downward in response to criticism that they didnt represent real world conditions since then evidence has mounted that the numbers again had fallen out of touch but the epas priorities were elsewhere ms oge said mainly focusing on reducing emissions from cars and other vehicles "it wasnt until a couple of years ago that the public cared so much about fuel economy " amid a rise in gas prices she said russell long first noticed discrepancies between published mpg numbers and the real world with his toyota runner purchased in "i estimated fairly precisely that the vehicle was underperforming its epa mileage labels by to " said mr long executive director of the bluewater network a san francisco based environmental group that brought a petition to the epa seeking the changes "since then ive purchased several vehicles and ive always found them to be far from the estimates on the vehicles " consumers also have shared their own mpg numbers on an epa web site other checks of epa numbers also have shown them to be too high though the testers used differing methods two years ago steven mazor chief automotive engineer with the automobile club of southern california an affiliate of aaa recruited volunteers to test how close their cars were coming to the epas fuel estimates to start his team brought the cars all model year or newer to the clubs laboratories and made sure they produced numbers in line with the epas when subjected to the same treadmill test technically the treadmill is called a dynamometer more details on that test are here once the team confirmed the cars performed the same on the treadmill as during the epas tests it returned the cars to their owners who were told to hit the road and keep track of mileage and fuel purchases they found that the cars were on average getting a fuel economy four mpg lower than the epas reported values the club shared its results with the epa mr mazor said of the planned changes "theyve done a very good job " edmunds com editors got similar results when tapping into logs theyd kept of their use of cars in the los angeles area an average discrepancy of from the epas estimates said philip reed consumer advice editor at the auto site mr reed who is currently driving a lexus rx h hybrid offered a caveat as "enthusiasts" driving cars they dont own edmunds editors "dont abuse the cars but we explore their full potential" by cranking up the acceleration and speed "and we probably do a higher percentage of stop and go city driving than many people would " for its tests consumer reports used its colchester conn test track and the roads nearby comparing models with epa numbers and finding discrepancies as great as to for city driving numbers unlike edmunds and the auto club consumer reports directly measured fuel usage with a meter situated between the tank and the engine the organization said that method is superior to the one generally employed by car owners which is to compare distance traveled with how many gallons are required to fill up the tank with "full" measured by the automatic sensors in gas pumps all three testers told me they think the epas new numbers will be more in line with the results drivers actually achieve on the road still a full analysis of the new numbers wont be possible until revised stats are available for all models for now you can find your model on fueleconomy gov and apply the epas average changes to get an idea auto makers have generally supported the epas new approach saying it is in their interest for consumers to have accurate information about the cars theyre buying "we believe the new mileage labels will help more accurately reflect how we drive today and we encourage these estimates to be used by consumers when comparison shopping for a new auto " charles territo spokesman for the alliance of automobile manufacturers a washington d c trade group told me michael love national regulatory affairs manager for toyota motor corp said his company suggested to the epa that the new mileage labels emphasize annual fuel costs rather than miles per gallon the current labels include such an estimate but in relatively tiny type "you dont pay for miles per gallon " mr love said "you pay for gallons of gasoline using a consumption metric would be much much easier to understand for the public and a much better metric to use " the epas ms oge responded "the fuel economy label that we finalized is what received the highest support overall" from consumers in surveys and focus group testing the annual cost estimates include annual driving of miles with of the miles driven in the city and highway figures are updated each year with average fuel costs focusing on consumption rather than mpg ratings can make a big difference consider this example compare a compact car that today is labeled at mpg and a sport utility vehicle rated at mpg suppose both are being driven miles a year the compact would use gallons of gas a year and the suv would require gallons or gallons more than the car now suppose that the compacts mpg estimate drops by to mpg and the suvs drops by just to mpg at first glance it seems the compact has suffered more from the change but crunch the numbers and youll see that miles of driving would consume more gallons in the suv than in the compact the small cars advantage increased by gallons thanks to everyone who posted to the most recent forum about my column on tracking internet numbers ill be reading and
