dazzling innovations end their days as commodities products that anyone can make and that are bought only according to their price columbia business schools bruce greenwald once expressed this view with the quip "in the long run everything is a toaster " mit media lab researcher michael schrage finds that innovation has a continued role even in such staid objects as toasters and vacuum cleaners high tech companies who panic about the day when everyone can make their latest futuristic doodad at a low price should take note ignoring innovation and focusing on cutting prices can be fatal the evolution of the toaster shows that the appliance is in fact "an unlikely symbol of sustainable innovation " mr schrage explains since the first commercially successful toaster was made by general

cleaners cheaper when there were innovations still to be had observe the success of dysons expensive and pleasingly bagless vacuums price wars for products dont necessarily mean that innovation has

fluctuations in electricity demand the way easily stored fossil fuels can but a new type of battery called a "flow" battery might offer an economical solution to the problem like regular batteries flow batteries store electricity in chemicals there is only a limited amount of the chemical in a regular battery but a flow batterys electricity storing chemicals can be pumped away and stored elsewhere this means farmers or other big power consumers could harness the energy when the wind is strongest for use at a later time the nascent technology costs more than regular batteries but some businesses are showing interest canadas vrb power systems inc plans to build a massive flow battery near a wind farm in ireland vrb also hopes that one day electric cars might run on the liquid from
