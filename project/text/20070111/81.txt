mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q will the new office require windows vista or will it run on windows xp a office and windows are separate products office runs fine on both the forthcoming version of windows called vista and on the current windows xp i have tested it on both q you didnt mention microsoft access in your review has it changed along with the other office programs a i never review access because it isnt meant for average consumers who are my primary audience and it isnt included in the standard or home versions of office however access does have the same all new user interface as the rest of office for more information see office microsoft com en us access fx aspx q i understand that the new excel can handle much larger spreadsheets than the old one but am wondering if using these giant spreadsheets would slow down a computer a yes microsoft says that excel can now handle spreadsheets with up to one million rows by columns compared with rows by columns in the prior version the company adds that to help with the load excel can now make use of both processor cores in one of the new dual core computers however its safe to assume that such a huge spreadsheet would cripple an average older pc for more on the new excel see office microsoft com en us excel fx aspx q when will the macintosh version of office come out will it have the same new user interface will it be able to read the new office file formats a the windows and macintosh versions of office while similar in many respects are different programs with different names and release dates which are developed by separate teams at microsoft there wont be an office for the mac per se but there will be a new mac version of office in the second half of this year according to microsoft it will be called office this new mac version will have its own new interface which will differ from the one in the new windows version and wont be as much of a radical change unlike the new windows version the forthcoming mac version will still have the usual menus it wont have the "ribbon" interface used by the windows version but will have something called the "elements gallery " as to file formats the new mac version will be able to read and write the new formats introduced with the windows version for users of the older mac version of office microsoft is promising to release converters in beta form in the spring q you reported that microsoft has stripped outlook from office if you install the new office can you still keep the old outlook a whoa there i never said outlook had been stripped from office i merely said it had been dropped from the cheapest version of office the &# home and student edition its still a part of the standard version and all the other versions as for keeping outlook when you install office home and student edition microsoft says you can do it but only if you select "custom" in setup and specifically choose not to remove outlook the standard install process would remove the old outlook even though no new outlook would be installed however the two programs wont work perfectly together outlook wont use word for composing and editing emails but will instead revert to using its internal message editor for that purpose you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online at the free personal technology web site http ptech wsj com
