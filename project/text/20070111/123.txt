these opera singers are a lounge act new york it was italian night last wednesday at the parkside lounge a bar on the lower east side of manhattan this had nothing to do with any ramp up in requests to pour the chianti peroni or even asti spumante and everything to do with the music pouring out from the back room now verdi now boito now rossini all sung by members of the year and a half old classical music collective opera on tap the evenings nine performers all in their s and early s had to wrap it up by sharp because thats when a rock band was taking over the tiny red curtained stage meanwhile they kept their few dozen listeners engaged and kept the beer and bravos flowing "to love and the hell it puts us through " called out emcee anne ricci the insouciant founding diva of opera on tap as she donned her horned valkyrie helmet and raised her glass in a toast to a pair of classic neapolitan songs of amore "non ti scordare di me" and "o sole mio" performed with all due lather by baritone ko kaiden "we like shtick a little more than we should at opera on tap " confessed ms ricci inviting the audience to sing along to a lusty preintermission round of "coro di zingari" perhaps you know it as the anvil chorus from "il trovatore " "we have postcards for sale and t shirts " continued the year old lyric soprano "you want to see our t shirts they come in chocolate brown and chocolate brown " ok maybe not so many colors but plenty of coloratura opera on tap grew out of a conversation between ms ricci and donald ofinn the manager of freddys a bar in brooklyn "i was there to hear one of my country singer students perform " said ms ricci whose day jobs include teaching voice and clerking in a brooklyn cheese store "id reached the point where i was fed up id been spending the majority of my time as a performer just auditioning " mr ofinn whose bar is known for wacky events like spelling bees and "cringe night" customers reciting homemade poetry from their high school days thought opera would work well in the seat back room the ceiling was tin the acoustics were good bring on "boheme " "ive always been a fan of arias " he said "and this has been a huge success for us " so much so that ms ricci and her cohorts now have a regular gig at freddys the second thursday of the month as well as at the parkside lounge the first wednesday of the month "its generally standing room only " added mr ofinn "its wonderful to have opera be readily accessible and not be this long winded thing " while this is "rigoletto" and "rosenkavalier" without remuneration its also an opportunity to perform without pressure "ive recovered a real sense of enjoyment that id lost doing tons and tons of auditions and getting nowhere " said ms ricci "i also wasnt happy with the way i was performing id become very self conscious and opera on tap has allowed me to relax and loosen up and sing more from the heart " "a lot of the appeal is that the performers play up a lot of aspects of opera you dont get in more formal situations its kind of campy " said adam wasserman the online editor of opera news who attended a recent opera on tap show at the parkside lounge "it was nice to go with some of my co workers and be in a relaxed environment and have a beer and hear music sung by people our age music we love the performers enthusiasm counted for a lot " he added diplomatically "youre there for reasons other than the aesthetic experience you expect at the met its like an indie music concert " partly because it simplifies the process of assembling a program partly because it makes a nice little publicity hook opera on tap tends toward themed performances a recent christmas show for example featured snippets from handels "messiah " the bach christmas oratorio and a wintry moment from act iii of "la boheme " a "back to school" night in september featured participants in pigtails and focused on new beginnings thoughts and emotions with music that included cherubinos love song from "the marriage of figaro" and the first love duet from "otello " and "the menstrual woman of opera" well that dealt with grouchy sopranos and the benighted tenors and baritones who love them coming up a couple of so called sobriety nights in honor of the new year these will get a bead on moments of self realization in opera "were going to include things from mozart and verdi requiems " said ms ricci who with co founder and co managing diva carla roberts holds auditions for new members three or four times a year "when we first started it was on a referral basis and we found we were getting a full range of skills some people werent quite up to scratch " while she estimates that of the opera on tap performers get some paid singing work "its not enough to cover their bills i definitely fall into that category " the second of three children ms ricci grew up in suburban detroit where her father was a newspaper columnist and opera lover "i was exposed to the music from an early age " she said her first passion was "carmen " her first performance according to family lore took place in the bathroom where she lined up small playskool plastic figures on the toilet seat amphitheater style and sang to them ms ricci performed in high school musicals but after a voice teacher introduced her to classical repertoire "i just felt that my voice went there naturally " even so success in her chosen field has been elusive "i definitely wanted to be singing at the metropolitan opera and have an illustrious performing career " said ms ricci who got her vocal training at indiana university and the manhattan school of music "i did the met competition twice " she continued referring to the vaunted talent search for promising young singers "and i didnt get very far but thats all right " she doesnt put it this way but opera on tap has been one of those when a door gets slammed a window pops open situations "its been a journey of self discovery im really loving running a business who knew " an immediate goal for the group aside from scoring a bit more rehearsal time is to expose new audiences to opera and change their perception of it as the last refuge of the stuffy "our broadest mission " said ms ricci "is to become a national organization with chapters were also kind of interested in pairing with big opera companies as a form of outreach for them we want to be something that provides a service to the greater opera world " that mission may already be accomplished "im not an opera buff but this is opera for the people " said elaine matthews a research scientist who came to last weeks show at the parkside lounge with two young friends who were visiting from austria "its very compelling these performers could make everyone love the opera "ive been to lincoln center " she said dismissively then added con brio "i want to come back here and see these people " ms kaufman writes about the arts and culture for the journal
