frees apple and its fellow vendors from running complicated labor intensive production lines while the ability of taiwanese companies to slash manufacturing costs helps cut product prices over time apple is using a similar setup for the iphone the multimedia cellphone the company unveiled tuesday with great fanfare at the same time the company dropped the word "computer" from its name apple
