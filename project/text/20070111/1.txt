a museum transformed by true objects of veneration los angeles holy image hallowed ground icons from sinai " the getty museums inspired and inspiring exhibition is a singular event simply because these rare byzantine works of art have rarely been seen away from their home at st catherines monastery in egypt and never before in such profusion its also an occasion to consider that an overwhelming increase in museum attendance has generated the illusion that museums have replaced churches as venues for inspiration that probably represents a bit of wishful thinking by museum folks considering that the u s has a higher level of church attendance than any other comparably developed country the gettys expansive exhibition catalog suggests that there is much we have yet to learn about the early christian tradition in which icons painted images of sacred subjects were primarily used in private worship before they became part of byzantine church decoration of the awe inspiring objects in the exhibition ranging from the th to the th centuries are on loan from st catherines so its surprising to learn that they were first published only in the s the getty exhibition suggests a range of questions about religion and art ones we generally find easy to ignore these days western museum tradition assertively deconsecrates sacred art in the gallery merging liturgical impulses with aesthetic sensibilities isnt easy while viewing a museum wall of magnificent renaissance madonnas even when we know the religious nature of the subject its the glory of bellinis painting im admiring not his image of the holy mother that sensibility often follows us even when we see those paintings within the churches for which they were executed were annoyed at worshippers blocking our view in bringing these rarely seen icons to a large public the getty museum staff dared to face this conundrum directly enabling us to view these images as supreme examples of byzantine art without forgetting the sacred role they play at st catherines monastery few of us will have a chance to visit the sinai desert so the exhibition includes site photographs emphasizing the remoteness and historical sanctity of the place from which these works have come the message is clear this is not just another exhibition of great paintings its no mean feat to make the multiple meanings of mount sinai resonate in an exhibition but the getty comes close or is it the icons themselves that do this the spare installation is so finely tuned that although each icon must have its own climate controlled case the usual temperature and humidity meters are kept out of sight the potentially risky decision to create a simple iconostasis the elaborate screen that ordinarily serves as a partition in orthodox churches but here serves as an organizing module for the installation is managed with restraint the several icons installed on this ersatz iconostasis as well as beautiful photos of the monastery church assist viewers in understanding the important physical relationships between worshippers and icons one is consistently encouraged toward solitary engagement with the icons themselves an experience that somehow transcends the conventional museum visit the transformational power of these images is almost as mysterious as the events some of them chronicle i suspect that even someone immersed in the iconoclastic traditions of judaism and islam would be captivated by the several images of moses that come from the very place of his encounter with the deity the th century "moses receiving the law before the burning bush" presents us with a somewhat delicate and diffident young man not the awesome lawgiver we know so well the icon painter clearly understood moses reluctance to undertake his sacred task that endearing sense of reserve remains evident in "moses with the virgin and child " a th century panel in which moses animated gestures contrast with the several frontal posture of mary and jesus these familiar subjects appear in sometimes unfamiliar guises often opulently highlighted with gold leaf and contemporary viewers may be drawn to the occasional suggestion of proto modern abstraction in a variety of garments as in icons of st basil and the archangel michael indeed there are even flashes of breathtaking flourish as in the th century "annunciation " where masterful shifts in the direction of gilt burnish accentuate the halos of gabriel the virgin and the holy ghost they could almost be gold platters awarded for hit songs this viewer was most captivated by the images of solitary figures whose powerful faces exude an astonishing warmth and humanity one can begin to understand the daily interaction of monks with this array of holy personages and almost feel guilty of depriving them of this simply for the sake of our gallery delectation the exhibition also includes other liturgical artifacts including metalwork and manuscripts as well as an early triptych by el greco from the galleria estense in a th century mannerist mode that seems wholly out of place here other than to emphasizes the intimacy of the relationship between the icons from st catherines monastery and their sinai site indeed rare for an exhibition of this kind its difficult to escape that sense of engagement in the liturgical and numinous meanings of these works while the overly earnest monks climbing "the heavenly ladder of st john climacus" late th century might appear amusing in another context their risky ascent and the unhappy fate of those being dragged down by devils turn into a truly frightening image we want to share in their attempts to resist temptation and achieve the perfection of christ at the ladders top the rarity of encountering an exhibition that is both beautiful and inspiring isnt lost on getty visitors many of whom are treating their trip to the museum with a reverence we usually see only in the case of some painting that has surpassed record auction prices that speaks both to the force of these works and the sensitivity of their installation outside their usual sinai home its a rare triumph of what we too often claim for museums that they provide us with spiritual as well as aesthetic renewal mr freudenheim a former museum director writes on art for the journal
