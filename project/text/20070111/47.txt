generous to a fault a close look at giving the foundation by joel l fleishman publicaffairs pages &# learning from your mistakes is a well accepted practice in the world of commerce even a celebrated one businessweek ran a cover story last summer under the headline "eureka we failed " it included articles by ceos from ge coca cola and irobot describing their "favorite mistake" and the positive results that eventually came of it but the same mindset has yet to penetrate the philanthropic world according to insider turned analyst joel fleishman "wouldnt it be refreshing and reassuring " he asks "to read similar headlines featuring the ceos of such foundations as ford rockefeller and macarthur " dont hold your breath in mr fleishmans view foundations are too often unwilling to assess the value of what they do and how they do it "the foundation" is his critique of philanthropic practice and an agenda for reform but it is not mere polemic mr fleishman a longtime duke professor was once president of the atlantic philanthropic service co and is now a trustee of the markle foundation he is anything but a diehard foundation opponent he says rather that he has been engaged in a lifelong "lovers quarrel" with foundations his book is a form of tough love mr fleishman begins "the foundation" by spelling out the many ways in which the charitable enterprises of american fortunes have been "a major force for good " he devotes an especially meaty chapter to "high impact initiatives " among them the support of the rockefeller and ford foundations for the green revolution which combated hunger in the developing world through agricultural improvements the recommendations of the flexner report funded by the carnegie foundation which led to the reinvention of medical education in the u s in the early th century the efforts of former sears roebuck president julius rosenwald to construct schools for rural blacks in the s and the projects of financier george soros aimed at weakening communism in eastern europe in the s including his purchase of rudimentary but devastating weapons xerox copiers for hungarian libraries and universities yet for all such accomplishments mr fleishman argues foundations are less effective than they could be why because he says they are arrogant secretive and insular they latch onto fuzzy trendy initiatives without ever evaluating the results and above all they resist transparency and accountability such bad habits and bad attitudes mr fleishman observes are in a sense understandable because foundations face no consequences for poor performance "there is no functioning market in the grant giving sector " he notes unless a founder explicitly calls for a sunset provision dictating the point at which all his money is to be given away foundations dont go out of business however wasteful they may have been by mr fleishmans account there were some foundations in the u s in controlling assets in the range of &# billion and making some &# billion in annual grants the lions share of those dollars belong to large foundations promoting in one form or another "large scale lasting social change " they do so mr fleishman says without the sort of humility that would seem appropriate to their daunting mission there are over the top perks of course but also a variety of maddening practices that mr fleishman recounts in unflattering detail foundation officers are notorious for instance for neglecting to show would be grantees even the most elementary courtesy they dont return phone calls or emails or explain why they have rejected a particular proposal more fundamentally they sometimes sign off on expensive projects without ever asking anyone grantees or members of their own staff precisely how according to what "theory of change " a given program or grant is supposed to achieve its goal and without measuring later whether it has succeeded in such a way millions and millions of dollars are thrown away every year what is to be done mr fleishmans reform platform alas turns out to be a rather heavy handed regulatory scheme he calls first for a kind of self policing but should such efforts fail he would have the federal government require foundations to make public many of their internal decision making documents he would even create a congressionally chartered private regulatory body devoted to overseeing nonprofit organizations it is hard to imagine how these new government initiated oversight efforts with their inevitable political imperatives would inspire the "culture of high stewardship" that mr fleishman with good reason longs to see among americas philanthropies he is on firmer ground when he writes about how foundations can reform from within by rigorously measuring outcomes by funding initiatives that can be taken to scale even by being open to intuition and serendipity he recounts the response of john d rockefeller to a letter from albert einstein asking for &# "lets give him &# he may be on to something " the future of grant making he concludes may lie with "venture philanthropy " in which donors play a role akin to that of venture capitalists investing in and nurturing charitable projects that show promise with the understanding that many will not pan out failure after all can be instructive just ask any ceo mr wildavsky a former assistant managing editor of u s news &amp world report is a senior fellow at the ewing marion kauffman foundation
