the doctors office fewer freebies more patient time since doctor said no to drug reps i dont hate drug reps really in my last column on prescribing drugs for "off label" use i mentioned that i no longer welcome drug reps in my practice the reader response was intense and worth following up on a couple of years ago i did something a little unusual i stopped seeing drug company sales representatives see my column then in an effort to simplify my professional life streamline my daily workflow and spend more time seeing patients i decided the sales call distractions had to go my main concern was the time sap my patients didnt like to wait while i talked to drug company reps around the time of their visits i find it easier to run on time for appointments and do my charting when i dont take time out to see salespeople patients that wait are unhappy and unhappy patients are bad for business family medicine is a complex low margin business with high overhead and a huge personal time commitment i couldnt afford to run behind schedule and i couldnt afford the inefficiency and loss of revenue during my office hours seeing drug company reps it could be as many as six on a busy day has been replaced with one to two additional patient visits adding an estimated &# in annual profit the perception among the general public is that drug companies give doctors a lot of free stuff that influences their prescribing habits and drives up the costs of drugs the halcyon days of doctor goodies were way before my time the freebies arent all that great anymore and meal opportunities are limited if i want to go to a company sponsored dinner they wont cover my spouse or kids still studies do show this gratis stuff can affect doctors plus i didnt want to fuel the perception of influence by making my office an unofficial billboard for the pharmaceutical industry my partner still sees drug reps so some promotional material finds its way in the common areas of our office and while ive lost a few pounds from missing the lunches i occasionally slip to the culinary dark side and listen and nosh or eat leftovers from the visits to her but i now carry my own generic looking black pens and the promotional materials are not in the patient rooms i use i wanted my patients to get the message that my medical opinion is not for sale or overly hyped by marketing thats a differentiator in a market where the most valuable thing i have to offer is my knowledge and advice one concern of mine was that id have fewer samples especially for my lower income patients but other than a couple patients who continue to ask for large amounts of free samples of their maintenance medications on every visit my patients havent missed out on much in any event sample medications arent as useful to me as they once were due to the proliferation of restrictive formularies insurer drug lists including for medicare the samples are often for expensive new medications that may not have good formulary coverage or may have layers of preauthorization before i can prescribe them even if the patient gets a good response from a sampled drug they often cant afford to continue on it as for information about new drugs ive got plenty im still an early adopter of new medications and treatments not seeing drug reps hasnt changed that online i monitor multiple sources of breaking news on drug therapy i get newsletters from sources i trust like my practice areas medical organization i dont need a company sales representative to bring me new ideas what theyre really doing is pushing a product in a very focused sales call the educational component is a minor part of it pfizer inc recently announced plans to cut of its domestic sales force i think a number of those plus people had been coming to my office but i dont hold myself completely responsible for the restructuring i think its part of a larger trend the era of the job security for drug sales reps is passing like jobs for telephone operators and at full service gas stations is there an ethical way that drug makers can market to doctors about the latest advances in drug therapy doctors like to make money but they also deeply want to help people and learn about the latest treatments these are desires that can be nurtured for mutual benefit i bet the drug companies have figured out how much a sales call costs if that money was redirected for social causes in a public way it would go a long way toward addressing the image problem of the pharmaceutical industry rather than employ a host a people to make sales calls or bring lunch for my staff id like the industry to put their educational programs online and make a charitable donation each time i view new material there is a possibility of bias in the information as with most any form of communication or marketing but at least with the internet i can filter it better and wont be as susceptible to slick in person pitches care of aids orphans and provision of medical care in the developing world would be my choice for donations for my reading time this way companies could provide up to date information to doctors patients benefit directly and i learn about the latest treatments while helping someone out that sounds better than lunch any day readers are strongly urged to post questions and comments in the doctors office forum
