bushs iraq plan faces obstacles on two fronts democratic opposition divisions in baghdad may hamper new push washington the success of president bushs controversial strategy for stabilizing iraq depends on the cooperation of an iraqi government paralyzed by sectarian tensions and a democratic congress that appears increasingly eager to challenge the administrations handling of the war in a prime time speech to a nation wearied by the violence in iraq mr bush acknowledged prior american failures there and announced plans to send at least more u s military personnel to baghdad and the restive anbar province white house officials said the first brigade of additional forces would arrive in iraq later this month with the remainder streaming into the country over the next four or five months the new troops are the centerpiece of a broad administration push to retool the military economic and political aspects of its iraq strategy and to find a way of stanching the continued decline in american support for the war in addition to the extra troops administration officials said they will ask congress for more than &# billion in new funding for programs designed to boost reconstruction economic growth and job creation in iraq including &# million to expand a program that gives military commanders money they can use on small scale development projects in the areas they patrol speaking from the white house library mr bush used unusually pessimistic language to describe the situation in iraq and conceded mistakes in previous strategies for the war saying "the situation in iraq is unacceptable to the american people and it is unacceptable to me " the president said that earlier efforts to secure baghdad had failed because there werent enough u s military personnel to hold neighborhoods after they had been cleared of insurgents and because the shiite led iraqi government prevented american personnel from conducting operations in the shiite districts that shelter the militias responsible for most of the current violence the white houses so called surge strategy by contrast would ensure that "we will have the force levels we need to hold the areas that have been cleared " and enter shiite areas of the city mr bush said still the administrations ability to control events on the ground in iraq is rapidly diminishing and it is far from clear that the strategy will find enough support in either baghdad or washington to have much chance of success iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki has long opposed the deployment of more u s forces to iraq and his government crippled earlier u s efforts to stabilize baghdad by failing to deliver the iraqi security forces it had promised and refusing to allow a crackdown on the countrys shiite militias the surge plan also comes amid increasingly hostile sentiment toward the white houses iraq strategy on capitol hill and amid signs that the newly democratic congress is testing how far it can go in influencing the white houses handling of the war starting as soon as today democrats hope to capitalize on the growing discontent among lawmakers in both parties by putting forward nonbinding house and senate resolutions against the troop increase their strategy involves persuading more republicans to go on record against the white house plan as a way of gauging the depth of opposition to it even before mr bush spoke last night conservative republican sen sam brownback of kansas eyeing a presidential bid said he was opposed to sending more troops to iraq while republican sen chuck hagel of nebraska derided the move as "a dangerously wrongheaded strategy that will drive america deeper into an unwinnable swamp " beyond rhetorical opposition to mr bushs strategy democrats may try in coming weeks to use congresss power of the purse to impede the troop increase white house officials previewing mr bushs speech acknowledged that its success depends on a new level of cooperation from mr maliki and his government and said that the administration had received firm iraqi commitments to devote significant numbers of iraqi security personnel to the new push to secure baghdad and more crucially to allow american and iraqi forces to confront forces loyal to radical shiite cleric muqtada al sadr mr maliki has made similar promises in the past however only to renege on those deals when the fighting started and pressure grew from shiite militia leaders to curb the offensives mr maliki owes his position as prime minister to mr sadr who remains his strongest political patron one of the most noteworthy aspects of the new strategy involves iraqi rather than american troops a senior white house official said mr maliki had pledged to send three additional iraqi army brigades to baghdad in a broad restructuring of security operations in the city individual iraqi officers instead of u s generals will be given responsibility for each of baghdads nine districts and will answer to a single iraqi commander who will have command authority over the capital senior u s military officials who remain skeptical about the iraqi armys abilities and mr malikis will to take tough stands played down the bush administrations suggestions that iraqi forces would be in the lead initially instead they suggested u s troops would take the more prominent role until the situation was stable enough for iraqi troops to move to the front "we first have to set the conditions for an iraqi led defense of baghdad to work " said one senior military official involved in planning the operation the first two attempts to stabilize baghdad this summer and fall were plagued by the uneven performance of iraqi forces sectarian agendas and a shortage of both u s and iraqi troops military officials said the bush administration hopes the influx of new troops will remedy those shortcomings but the surge of about more soldiers all the overstretched u s military can provide is far less than what most proponents of that approach have advocated hawks like sen john mccain of arizona and frederick kagan of the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank have called for a minimum of to soldiers to stabilize baghdad white house officials said another big element of the new plan is a greater u s demand for accountability on the part of the iraqis they said that mr bush had made clear to the iraqi leader that the u s commitment to iraq isnt open ended but the officials acknowledged that mr bush hadnt threatened specific consequences such as a reduction in u s military and economic assistance or a withdrawal of u s forces if mr maliki again fails to meet his commitments to provide additional iraqi forces or to permit a crackdown on shiite fighters "when youre trying to empower a government you dont talk to them in those terms you must do this or else " a senior administration official said on capitol hill doubts about mr malikis capabilities and intentions are fueling growing opposition to the administrations strategy and triggering talk of legislative maneuvers like trying to restrict mr bushs ability to send more troops to iraq which would have been unthinkable even a few weeks ago the democratic leaders of the house and senate rep nancy pelosi of california and sen harry reid of nevada both back the idea of a nonbinding resolution opposing the troop increase others want to go further sen edward kennedy of massachusetts introduced a bill earlier this week that would prohibit any additional troops from being sent to iraq unless explicitly approved by congress rep john murtha d pa a military veteran who is chairman of the house appropriations defense subcommittee recently introduced a similar measure outlining options that would restrict any troop escalation if it meant reducing readiness at home or extending the tours of troops now in the war zone one possible financial pressure point could come as soon as mid february when a stopgap spending bill that has been funding most of the federal government since october is due to expire that is a powerful political tool for democratic critics of mr bushs policy amending the measure might be risky since failure to pass the legislation could shut down many agencies but if an iraq amendment or funding limitation were attached by congress the president couldnt simply brush it aside many democrats are loath to take steps that might paint the party as undercutting the troops in iraq but some measures could gain support in coming weeks especially if proponents succeeded in making the point that by opposing additional troops they are not undermining those already on the ground in iraq balancing concerns about seeming to oppose the military democrats run some risk within their own ranks if they are seen as being too pliant toward mr bush in the weeks ahead especially after having won control of congress partly because of the publics antiwar sentiment democratic opposition to the administrations handling of the war is growing markedly across the party with some of the most conservative democratic leaders joining some of the most liberal ones not only in opposing the troop increase but also calling for the beginnings of a military withdrawal from iraq former north carolina sen john edwards who has staked out an array of liberal positions as he campaigns for the presidential nomination has strongly condemned the surge proposal in recent days and instead argued for sharp troop reductions yesterday he was joined by one of the more conservative members of the new democratic congressional majority former navy adm joe sestak of pennsylvania who said that the "bottom line is that the way forward is not to add more troops but to set a deliberate timetable for redeployment from iraq at least by the end of this year to serve as a catalyst for the iraqis to accept responsibility for their country " david rogers contributed to this article
