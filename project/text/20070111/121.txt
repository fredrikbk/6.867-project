the morning brief bush raises u s stakes and his own in iraq the wall street journal online the deployment of some additional u s troops renewed emphasis on economic rebuilding the almost beseeching conferral of another chance for the iraqi government to get with the white houses program these measures all expected were in president bushs address last night so was his long held argument that iraq is the key battlefield of a post fight against terror what mr bush also offered were benchmarks that an increasingly skeptical congress will undoubtedly use to judge and likely fight his decision to raise rather than diminish the u s stakes in iraq mr bush acknowledged the current situation in iraq is "unacceptable to the american people " and though in the past he has suggested problems resulted from tactical errors among the wars planners rather than the administrations must win strategy the president added that "where mistakes have been made the responsibility rests with me " months of consultations across the array of the u s national security agencies and departments advice from the baker hamilton iraq study group and talks with members of congress brought accord that "there is no magic formula for success in iraq " mr bush said but also that failure there "would be a disaster for the united states " radical islamist extremists the ideological enemy of our time as he described them would gain strength chaos would threaten the middle east and "iran would be emboldened in its pursuit of nuclear weapons " he argued but he didnt address a point of criticism made these days by both democrats and some republicans and in part by the white houses own national intelligence estimate last year that these things are already happening as a result of the war which is inspiring and shaping what the nie called "a new generation of terrorist leaders " mr bush said "many listening tonight will ask why this effort will succeed when previous operations to secure baghdad did not " the differences he said are that the u s and iraqi troops will now be in sufficient numbers to hold and keep peaceful neighborhoods they have fought to secure and that iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki has promised an end to the "political and sectarian interference that prevented iraqi and american forces from going into neighborhoods that are home to those fueling the sectarian violence " moreover the iraqi government plans to take charge of security throughout the country by november to share iraqs oil wealth among all its citizens relax post invasion de baathification laws and hold provincial elections this year mr bush said "ive made it clear to the prime minister and iraqs other leaders that americas commitment is not open ended " he added but he mentioned no consequences if these benchmarks arent met a problem the wall street journal notes is that "mr maliki has long opposed the deployment of additional u s forces to iraq and his government crippled earlier u s efforts to stabilize baghdad by failing to deliver the iraqi security forces it had promised and by refusing to allow a crackdown on the shiite militias responsible for much of iraqs current violence " aides to mr maliki tell the new york times that his government is wary of u s efforts to assert a greater role shiite leaders tell the times that american troops should stay away from shiites and focus on fighting sunni insurgents current and former military officials tell the washington post the new operations are likely to intensify fighting "compel american soldiers to rely on questionable iraqi army and police forces as never before " and "place a major new strain on u s forces that already are feeling burdened by an unexpectedly long and difficult war " with the details of this long awaited strategic address mr bush is betting on a reversal of the circumstances playing havoc with previous plans while mr bush predicted the year ahead will still be "bloody and violent events in iraq over the coming months will likely spell out whether the conditions needed for a new direction are coming to pass ciscos trademark fly in apples ointment so confident in the technical prowess and stylish desirability of its newest product apple may have let hubris blind it to a pressing business requirement for the new iphone the well known fact that cisco systems owns the trademark for that name the

"the largest and most beautiful screen ive ever seen on a cellphone even though its incredibly thin " says "it felt great in my hand " and waxes on about its "brilliant new user interface" and "the handsomest email program and web browser ive ever seen on a phone " still mr mossberg noted the iphones "potential downsides" include the lack of a physical keyboard rather than a virtual one on the screen "which may put off heavy email users " and the fact that its debut will come on the "relatively slow edge cellular data network " but mr mossberg describes the iphone as a threat to palms line
