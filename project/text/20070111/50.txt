home &amp family cranky consumer wheels on demand for city dwellers car sharing grows more widespread wheres the mini doing without a car in the city can be a smart move urbanites who live without wheels can skip high parking and insurance fees and they never feel guilty when a car alarm erupts on a city street but when car free adults travel beyond their public transit map or have heavy duty errands the options arent very good they can choose an expensive cab ride or a wait at the rental car counter at the latter theyll rent a car for more hours say than they really need it while enduring a sales pitch to upgrade to a bigger vehicle or buy supplementary insurance coverage there is an alternative for such drivers car sharing car sharing companies offer members access to fleets of vehicles available by the hour two companies flexcar and zipcar offer service in multiple u s cities several smaller businesses run car sharing operations in single cities flexcar was launched in as a public private partnership within metro seattle the company is building out its fleet and cities of service and a company spokesman says flexcar now has more than members and a fleet of roughly cars zipcar based in cambridge mass says it has more than members and a fleet of about cars it is expanding domestically and internationally leveraging &# million from a recent round of venture capital to enter markets such as toronto and london car sharing companies place cars at multiple locations grocery stores or parking garages for instance within an urban area rather than bunch them at single locations as would a rental car company members use coded "smart cards" to unlock the car theyve reserved from a specific location get keys from the glove box and drive off prices generally range from &# to &# per hour car makes available such as honda hybrids bmw minicoopers and volvos are cooler than rental agency rides but how easy are these services to use we donned driving gloves and checked out flexcar zipcar and a san francisco bay area service called city carshare enrollment in a car sharing service can take more time than arranging a traditional rental but once enrolled reserving and using car share vehicles is time efficient all three car sharing services required a multistage sign up first collecting our drivers license and credit card information which took about minutes online once initial registration is complete all three services promised us that membership cards would be approved within seven business days both flexcar and zipcar offer pay as you go plans and a variety of monthly pricing plans based on hours of car use rates for pay as you go plans fall in the &# to &# range flexcar via a marketing partnership with a seattle area grocery co op let us join on a pay

mileage to miles per hour period as of feb zipcar allows miles per hour period city carshare charges cents per mile all three services included gas and insurance once signed up reserving cars was easy however car sharing services determine which sorts of cars are "stocked" at which pickup spots this meant we could almost always find a car nearby but not necessarily the make we coveted specifically the bmw minicooper zipcar made minicoopers available but not at our nearest pickup location in seattle the most common vehicle in our neighborhood was a honda sedan all three services offered clear instructions for locating cars zipcar told us to call an urban parking garage an hour before pickup so the car would be waiting flexcar and city carshare offered online maps car condition and cleanliness was a little substandard compared with what wed find at a rental agency but then we realize that car cleanliness is a function of the last driver services offer credit to drivers who present receipts for car cleaning in san francisco city carshares minicooper looked great outside but crumbs were stuck between the front seats and we found an m&amp m on the passenger side floor a honda from flexcar also had crumbs and specs of dirt on the back seat but was otherwise clean in new york zipcars vehicle was clean and came with a sun roof but its much touted xm satellite radio system wouldnt work for us still these considerations were minor given that we could walk to a car site near our home or office drive off on errands then return the vehicle just as easily and pay less than &# for a two hour trip for infrequent but occasional drivers with urban errands to do or the occasional business offsite the services make more sense than renting for overnight travel these cars are available at day rates of &# to &# and up at zipcar and flexcar respectively prices that compare with what a regular rental agency offers but the real draw appears to be hourly usage shivani vora
