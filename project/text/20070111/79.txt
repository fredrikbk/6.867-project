minimum wage increase easily clears house vote washington legislation to increase the federal minimum wage cleared the house by an almost three to one margin giving senate democrats increased confidence that they can win quick enactment together with tax breaks targeted to small business ending years of party resistance house republicans joined in approving the increase raising the minimum hourly wage standard to &# from &# over the next two years the first of three cent increments would take effect days after the bill becomes law and would be the first increase in the federal standard in almost a decade the long gap under republican control of the house both raised the political stakes of the wage issue and diminished its direct impact on the economy labor economists estimate that the six million workers directly affected by an increase represent about of the work force compared with the directly affected when congress last approved an increase in the impact also varies since more than half the states have raised their own minimum wage standards often to a higher level than the new federal requirement nonetheless the symbolism of the vote was huge for the new house democratic majority which is struggling to stay focused on its domestic agenda as the debate over the iraq war increasingly dominates congress "this is a question of economic fairness this goes way beyond the dollars and cents of the minimum wage " said house education and labor committee chairman george miller d cal final passage followed skirmishes over republican efforts to add tax and health related amendments but senate democrats are poised to add a small business tax package that will require tax loophole closings to pay for the estimated year cost of &# billion to &# billion "this will pass " said senate finance committee chairman max baucus d mont who is moving to attach the tax package to the house passed bill and thereby pick up the extra republican votes needed to assure senate passage he wants to make permanent the current work opportunity tax credit for employers hiring low wage workers small business depreciation benefits could be expanded and mr baucus said he is looking at a proposal to make it easier for small employers with inventories to still use cash accounting under tax rules when congress last approved a minimum wage increase in the attached business tax benefits approached &# billion or twice what is now envisioned but mr baucus is reluctant to go further and use up more of his tax offsets options he will need in the future to pay for democratic energy initiatives as well as some form of middle class protection from the alternative minimum tax instead he and the ranking republican iowa sen charles grassley are expected to rely on a small reservoir of tax shelter changes that the senate has passed before but were resisted by the house when under republican control among these targets are leasing tax shelters known as sale in and lease out transactions which have been criticized by the internal revenue service and which congress has largely outlawed for leases entered into after march given the continued irs criticism of the shelters senate tax writers have argued that even in cases of leases entered into before the law the holders of the shelters shouldnt gain future benefits especially if the lessee is a foreign person or company mr baucus said companies that rushed to enter leases after he and mr grassley had set a cutoff date in could be vulnerable
