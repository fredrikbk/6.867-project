readback in a strong field six books stand out i was planning to make a list of the five books i read last year that i liked best but i could only narrow the field to six these five novels and one memoir were my favorites in a strong field two excellent nonfiction books were "the looming tower" by lawrence wright and "stumbling on happiness" by daniel gilbert the following are listed in alphabetical order by the authors last name because it would be impossible to put them in order of preference "restless" by william boyd bloomsbury another fine book by an author who has never received the attention in america he deserves start with "the new confessions " then move on to any one of his other eight novels "restless" is the story of sally gilmartin an elderly woman who has kept secret even from her own daughter what she did in the years leading up to world war ii her job for the british secret service was to plant propaganda items in newspapers to provoke america to enter the war as in all good espionage yarns theres a double agent in "restless " whose vengeance sally gilmartin narrowly escaped but has never forgotten or forgiven typical of mr boyds work "restless" is graceful intelligent surprising "talk talk" by t c boyle penguin mr boyles th novel is among his best my earlier favorites "worlds end" and "drop city" mr boyle is both topical and literary in his terrifying story of dana halter a young schoolteacher who discovers after a routine traffic stop that her identity has been stolen dana also happens to be deaf mr boyle obviously researched identity theft and deafness exhaustively but the details are neatly woven into a suspenseful narrative of dana and her boyfriend tracking down the thief mr boyle also draws a surprisingly nuanced portrait of the thief "as i began to explore the issue of identity theft as it is used for criminal purposes " mr boyle wrote about the book "i found myself meditating on identity in general that is how we distinguish ourselves from each other how we know who we are in our own minds " those meaty questions are provocatively addressed "my life in france" by julia child knopf you dont need to be a chef or even like to cook to appreciate julia childs memoir when mrs child moved to france with her husband in she didnt speak a word of french but she instantly knew she had found her calling to master french gastronomy and introduce it to american cooks mrs child personified the phrase joie de vivre but she was also a stubborn cuss which served her well when trying to convince french snobs that an "unserious californian " as she described herself could be a world class chef written with mrs childs grandnephew alex prudhomme "my life in france" is as rich and tart as a lemon blueberry trifle but with zero calories "the echo maker" by richard powers farrar straus and giroux a year old man mark schluter loses control of his truck on a nebraska road and barely survives when he emerges from a coma he has a rare neurological disorder called capgras syndrome which makes him believe that his older sister his only surviving family is an imposter a double pretending to be karin schluter running parallel to an exploration of consciousness memory and chemistry mr powers eulogizes the spring migrations of the sandhill crane on the platte river and makes delicate connections between the hard wiring of different species brains "the echo maker " which won the national book award is not only about what it means to be human but also what it means to be alive reviewing "the echo maker" in the new york review of books the novelist margaret atwood wrote "if richard powers were an american writer of the th century hed probably be the herman melville of moby dick his picture is that big " "heaven lake" by john dalton simon &amp schuster this extraordinary book will inevitably be shortchanged by my trying to describe it in a few hundred words i dont remember how it came to be on my shelf i know i bought it but on whose authority because the topic a young christian missionary goes to china to convert the heathens isnt my usual bill of fare once i decided to follow vincent saunders initially a bit of a self righteous jerk to a small town in taiwan and then on his travels around china i was hooked vincent of course is himself converted but in subtle and often amusing ways mr dalton who spent eight years writing "heaven lake " has said he wanted vincent to wrestle with "questions of god loneliness and desire " vincent did that and more as did i "ghostwritten" by david mitchell random house "ghostwritten " mr mitchells first novel is an ambitious and invigorating appraisal of st century life its patterns coincidences and most of all its interconnectivity the book is nine related stories each narrated by a different character the stories unfold around the globe from london to hong kong new york city to mongolia at moments "ghostwritten" is science fiction at others its a thriller a comedy and a ghost story its consistently sharp and challenging "readers time if you bought it off them is expensive " mr mitchell said in a interview "someones going to give you eight or hours of their life i want to give them something back and i want it to be an enjoyable experience " for me "ghostwritten" was one of the highlights of another happy year of reading what was the best book you read last year my reading list is never too long and ill pass along your suggestions in my next column write to cynthia crossen at cynthia
