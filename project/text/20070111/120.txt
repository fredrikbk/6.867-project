the michael nifong scandal no one could have imagined when the story began last march how soon and completely that bit of shorthand "the duke university scandal" would be transformed scarcely months after the term is now almost universally understood as a reference to the operations of michael nifong the durham county district attorney whose abandonment of all semblance of concern about the merits of the rape and assault accusations against three duke university students was obvious from the first so was his abundant confidence while broadcasting comments on the guilt of the accused he seemed a man immune to concerns for appearances as he raced about expounding on the case against the accused lacrosse players and calling them hooligans he would hear nothing by way of concern from duke administrators seven months into this affair the university president did find an opportunity to mention the accused students right to a presumption of innocence and certainly none from the politically progressive quarters of the duke faculty who lent their names to an impassioned ad thanking everyone who had come out to march in protest against the rape and assault of the exotic dancer faculty members signed it among them such duke luminaries as alice kaplan author and student of fascism and frank lentricchia literary critic unable to take part in the ad signing dukes administrators nonetheless found ways to identify with its spirit soon after news broke of the duke athletes alleged brutish sex crimes against a black woman the administration undertook a well publicized campaign targeting the entire lacrosse team for offensive behavior president richard brodhead was it seems barely able to recover from the shock of his discovery that a party thrown by male jocks could occasion heavy drinking and related loutish behavior not to mention a stripper lacrosse was suspended for the season and the team coach mike pressler was shortly after forced to resign mr brodhead in due course reinstated the team but on probation and with conditions i e no underage drinking and disorderly conduct and no harassment the members of other duke organizations sports teams included which had sponsored parties where alcohol flowed freely and which had featured strippers an informal count reveals at least known to have done so no doubt understood that they faced no similar disciplinary action the reason for the moral cleansing program devised for the lacrosse team could scarcely have been missed mr nifongs confidence that he had nothing to fear from establishment opinion or from the leaders of the great university as he bounded about making hash of the rules of justice prime among them the accuseds right to a presumption of innocence proved justified and might have remained so longer but for the catastrophic effects of the accusers unraveling stories mr nifong is no anomaly merely a product of the political times a prosecutor who has absorbed all the clues about the sanctified status now accorded charges involving rape child sex abuse and accusations of racism which has in turn ensured their transformation into weapons of unequalled power like others before him the da quickly grasped the career possibilities open to him with such a case and proceeded accordingly denouncing racism and the rape and assault of a helpless black woman and the duke athletes guilty of these crimes in every media interview available to him and they were many for all the public shock and fury over his behavior there is little that is new or strange about mr nifong we have seen the likes of this district attorney uninterested in proofs of innocence willing to suppress any he found many times in the busy army of prosecutors claiming to have found evidence of rampant child abuse in nursery schools and other child care centers around the country in the s and throughout most of the s they built case after headline making case charging the mass molestation of small children and managed to convict scores of innocent americans on the basis of testimony no rational mind could credit law officers who regularly violated requirements of due process in their effort to obtain a conviction they grasped the special advantage that was theirs that for a prosecutor dealing with molestation and wearing the mantle of avenger there was no such thing as excess no limits to what could be said of the accused in court rules could be bent any charges presented and nonexistent medical evidence proclaimed as proof positive of the accusation in his role of avenger of a young black woman alleged to have been brutalized by white males mr nifong proceeded with similar assurance his was a crusade who but enemies of the good would object confronted with hard questions about his evidence whether from the defense or the press mr nifong answered that these challenges were all designed to intimidate the rape victim more than once the da suggested as criticisms of his case multiplied that he was himself a victim of the press he could have had little complaint last summer about the new york times which provided its own reports on the duke story it maintained that that the das case had been distorted by the defense and that there was in fact a body of evidence that supported the decision to take the case to a jury a close study of this works wondrous logic and of its body of evidence should provide rich material for students of the press for years to come the jury to which mr nifong played the black population of durham duly helped re elect him this could not prevent his case of rape and abuse against the three duke students from coming undone thanks in part to his own heedless behavior but mainly to the accusing dancer herself whose shifting stories and checkered past could not be hidden mr nifong had of course nothing like the advantages of nursery school prosecutors endearing and year old witnesses clutching teddy bears who came to court to recite lies they had been cajoled into inventing about how the accused had raped and stabbed them cut off the legs of animals the kinds of charges mounted against elderly violet amirault of massachusetts and her adult children cheryl and gerald proprietors of the respected fells acres day school many like them were caught up in the eras whirlwind of accusation and sensational trials invariably leading to conviction on which ambitious prosecutors built careers almost all those cases would ultimately be thrown out by appeals courts most of the time not before those convicted had served long years and paid with the ruin of their lives mr nifongs case has come undone long before any trial fortunately for the three duke students charged they have had nevertheless a powerful taste of what it means to have been named and despised as perpetrators of abhorrent sexual crimes i could go to prison for years reade seligmann one of the accused told the late ed bradley during a " minutes" interview last october and "for something that never happened" neither mr seligmann nor the other accused duke students will ever have to contend with a punishment like the one meted out to gerald amirault who was sentenced to a to year term for something that never happened atrocious sex crimes that never took place of which there was no physical evidence or anything resembling a credible allegation what did it matter that the childs testimony that resulted in geralds conviction had claimed rape with a large butchers knife one that had magically left not the slightest injury the jurys most important duty was the prosecutors informed them to believe the children and show that they honored their testimony the same young witness also testified that gerald was accompanied by a green silver and yellow robot r d from "star wars " what did it matter either that special judicial hearings about the amiraults prosecution had concluded that it was a travesty that a tough panel of former prosecutors the governors board of pardons had virtually declared gerald amirault innocent and voted for commutation of his sentence or that he was finally granted parole nearly three years ago after nearly years imprisonment he was almost immediately classified by massachusettss sex offenders registry board as a level offender the kind that is deemed the most dangerous and most likely to re offend this bizarre classification the board made clear had to do with the number of counts of sex abuse charged to him and the fact too that he continued to deny guilt he now has to wear a large tracking device around his ankle and obey a curfew confining him to the house from p m to a m every day he has not surprisingly been unable to find a job he is sustained as ever by the unstinting devotion of his family and he grieves now mainly for the loss of the chance he had dreamed of in prison of earning a salary and finally lightening the burden his wife had carried uncomplaining and alone during his years in prison he has recently been advised of pending legislation that will require him to pay &# a day for the global positioning tag on his leg that tracks him the accused duke students can be grateful that the case against them has collapsed and that mr nifong now confronts a serious ethics complaint filed by the north carolina state bar they will never have to face anything like the malignant force which descended on the happy and ambitious amiraults in and turned their lives to dust but reade seligmann david evans and collin finnerty have this year had a look into an abyss that has claimed many others and that is never less than terrorizing it is a piece of their duke education they are unlikely to forget ms rabinowitz is a member of the wall
