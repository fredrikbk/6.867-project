the iraqis must step up to the plate "looking back i think that if we had then realized the confusion and chaos which existed we would indeed have thought ours a hopeless task certainly the authorities in washington who had prepared the occupation policy did not visualize these conditions " gen lucius clay as in germany a half century ago the american experience in iraq has proven more difficult than anticipated mistakes were made including my own denying government positions to officials in the top of saddams baath party was correct but it was a mistake to turn implementation over to iraqi politicians rather than to judges and in requesting american money to help rebuild iraqs economy i put too much emphasis on large scale projects when smaller ones would have shown quicker results to the average iraqi the president has frankly acknowledged the need for a new approach he has assessed the various options and has courageously and in my view wisely rejected the politically popular course of withdrawing over the past four years progress in iraq has always depended on the interplay among the political economic and security sectors clearly only iraqis can design the necessary means to bridge their sectarian and ethnic divisions the shiites need to show they understand that democracy involves the proper respect for minority rights the sunnis must be brought to understand that while there is a place for them in liberated iraq their centuries old domination of the country is over the kurds with longer experience in elected government must show patience as their arab brothers wrestle with these and other issues iraqis cannot make the necessary political compromises in an atmosphere of sustained violence and although iraqs economy has done well since the liberation reconstruction too has been severely hampered by the lack of security so security for iraqs population is the sine qua non for success by committing additional american forces the presidents new approach recognizes this fundamental reality it is no secret that i would have preferred that we would have sent in more forces much sooner but we are where we are today now the iraqis must step up to the plate for months they have promised additional iraqi forces for baghdad forces which until now have never arrived and iraqi and coalition forces operating in the capital have been subjected to constant political interference hampering the effectiveness of those operations an early test of the new approach will be whether prime minister nouri al maliki now makes good on the promised iraqi reinforcements and on his commitment to allow them to deal with the militia especially those of the radical moqtada al sadr even a successful campaign in baghdad will not end violence there but a significant reduction in attacks in the capital would give the iraqi government the political latitude needed to broaden its political base the prime minister will also be watched carefully in washington and in iraq to ensure that he delivers on his promises to move on the sensitive issues of oil policy and provincial elections both important to encouraging an atmosphere of reconciliation if he does not then surely the iraqi people will hold his government accountable as is provided in the iraqi constitution the presidents new approach is bold unpopular and risky but he is right to reject calls for american withdrawal those who advocate such a course need to be frank about the drastic consequences of such a course first it would abandon million iraqis to broader and much bloodier violence some americans seem prepared to accept this outcome arguing "its their country let them sort it out " this is shortsighted and uninformed broader sectarian violence between iraqs arabs would certainly provoke the kurds to declare their independence from iraq over the past four years i have often spoken about this issue with the kurdish leaders they have made clear that their decision to join a liberated iraq depends on a government which can provide security for all its people and which is not dominated by sectarianism an independent iraqi kurdistan would have an irresistible attraction for the millions of kurds living in syria turkey and iran and would surely lead to a wider regional war such a war would threaten american interests and allies throughout the region and lead to american military re engagement probably on a very large scale most importantly an american defeat in iraq would immediately endanger americans by confirming osama bin ladens analysis that america is a "weak horse" driven out of lebanon in and somalia a decade later defeat would be a major recruiting poster for islamic extremists everywhere if force again rules mesopotamia there is a real risk that extremists will establish themselves there as they had done in afghanistan but this time with major economic resources and an operating base not on the periphery of the middle east but at its heart these then are the stakes in iraq the president has acknowledged the need for new leadership and a new strategy he is to be commended for rejecting the easy popular course
