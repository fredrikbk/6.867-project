politics &amp economics fcc rejects comcast in bid for more time for set top box change washington federal regulators denied a request by comcast corp for more time to make changes to the set top boxes it offers delivering a major victory to consumer electronics makers in their decade long battle with cable companies for control of the television federal communications commission chairman kevin martin speaking at the consumer electronics show in las vegas yesterday said it was way past time for standard technology to be used so consumers wouldnt be tied to rental set top boxes and would soon have more options to access digital and internet video on new television sets "its important to find a way for consumers to go into best buy buy a tv hang it on the wall and plug it in and it works " mr martin said following the speech currently cable companies design their networks so that any tv set top box digital video recorder dvd player or other set top device can deliver their signals as long as they are outfitted to use special "cable cards" that cable operators are required to provide but cable companies dont have to use the cards in the set top boxes they rent to subscribers device manufacturers say this gives cable companies a big advantage mr martins decision means that some cable operators must use the cards in the boxes they provide consumers even lower end models starting in july the fcc denied a request by comcast last night to postpone implementation of this decision and is expected to deny a broader request by the cable industry soon the agency gave smaller operators more time to comply it was a blow for cable operators particularly comcast which argued that the fccs decision would result in higher costs for consumers as much as &# to &# a month because it will require more expensive equipment the decision may eventually jeopardize the steady revenue stream cable operators have received by renting boxes to consumers "this amounts to an fcc tax of hundreds of millions of dollars on consumers with no countervailing benefits " said comcast executive vice president david cohen he said comcast will appeal the decision the fccs decision may eventually be a boon for consumer electronics makers which will finally be able to market competitive set top boxes and cable ready digital tvs to consumers tired of renting from cable operators congress directed the fcc more than a decade ago to take action to encourage competition in the set top box market but that effort has been plagued with delays the fcc required cable operators to come up with technology that would allow consumers to directly plug a cable line into a tv set the cable industry came up with a credit card sized device that could be plugged into digital tvs set top boxes dvd players and other devices and would allow consumers to do without a separate box from their cable operator however the device originally didnt support two way features such as allowing users to use popular features like on demand movies and on screen programming guides newer devices offer those features corrections &amp amplifications only set top boxes provided by cable operators currently support cable two way features such as video on demand and the interactive program guide an article yesterday inaccurately reported that some newer devices sold by consumer electronics makers also offer those two way cable features wsj jan
