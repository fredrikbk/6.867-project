the hormone decision how to weigh the risks navigating the research for women facing menopause the truth about hot flashes on the morning of july women woke up to some shocking news the menopause hormones they had been taking to cope with hot flashes improve their sex lives strengthen their bones and possibly help their hearts had turned against them or so it seemed the subject was the womens health initiative whi a government funded study of more than women that had set out to determine whether menopause hormones helped prevent heart disease a benefit widely ascribed to hormone use as it turned out women in the group who took a mixture of estrogens and a progestin had more heart attacks and breast cancer than non hormone users government health officials decided the risks to the women in the study outweighed the benefits prompting them to shut down the main part of the study the impact was immediate and lasting hormone sales plummeted overnight as women threw out their pills going off hormones cold turkey made them miserable but they were too scared to keep taking them over the ensuing weeks and months it became apparent that something had gone terribly wrong screaming matches and name calling erupted at medical meetings whi investigators stood firm in their findings the researchers believed that the real problem was not the study itself but the fact that hormone proponents had spent years touting the benefits of the drugs and now just didnt want to admit they were wrong meanwhile longtime believers in menopause hormones were convinced that the study itself was somehow flawed and that this was all an effort to undermine hormones in favor of other types of drug treatments so who was right a closer look at the study shows that key mistakes were made in the early design of the whi for a variety of reasons the whi was not a study of menopause but evolved as a study of older women who took menopause hormones long after they completed menopause the average woman in the whi was and most women in the study started taking hormones at least years past menopause indeed in the years since the study results came out its become clear that little from the whi can be extrapolated to the typical user of menopause hormones but it can give us some important clues several researchers have begun to parse the data in an effort to better understand how hormones affect younger women in the midst of the menopausal transition while the scientific questions about the timing of hormone use and the potential for heart benefits continue to be debated there is little debate now about the safety of hormones for women with menopause symptoms since the initial whi announcement nih officials have softened their statements about hormones noting that the drugs are a reasonable choice and likely safe for women to use for the short term treatment of menopausal symptoms that doesnt necessarily mean women should make the decision to use them it means only that they need to go into this decision with an open mind shaking loose fears about heart attacks and other health problems that have scared so many women away from this treatment in recent years ever since the release of the whi results doctors around the country have been struggling to advise women on hormone therapy most experts now believe that the most important lesson of the whi may be to "individualize" the hormone decision to each woman but what exactly does that mean its important to remember that even the british medical journal which examined the whi data along with all the other evidence on hormone use came to the conclusion that the benefits of hormones to women with menopause symptoms outweigh the risks during five years of use the same article concluded that women with no symptoms face more risks than benefits if they choose to use menopause hormones here is a look at how to weigh symptoms and risk factors to help make a choice thats right for you hot flashes and night sweats an american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog task force concluded that menopause hormones are the most effective treatment reducing hot flashes by up to they also recommend that women adopt lifestyle changes such as wearing lightweight clothing maintaining cool room temperatures and avoiding spicy foods caffeine and alcohol if you are a generally healthy person and your the flashes are severe or disruptive to your life hormones are likely a good option however if you have a family history of cardiovascular disease breast cancer or blood clots then there are other issues to consider before making the hormone decision the acog panel advises women to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time and to re evaluate hormone therapy every year a north american menopause society panel says that an annual re evaluation isnt enough and that women should regularly consider lowering the hormone dose or stopping treatment altogether the acog panel notes that about of menopausal women will continue to have hot flashes beyond the average four years it takes such symptoms to resolve "it is inappropriate to withhold ht hormone therapy from persistently symptomatic women who prefer to continue ht or who do not derive relief from currently available alternatives " says the acog report heart attack the whi and other important studies have shown that a woman with a history of heart attack or heart disease should not take menopause hormones but the impact of hormone therapy on the heart health of women who start using it close to menopause is not yet fully understood many in the medical community remain convinced that when the whi data are broken down they actually show that hormones arent risky to women who are still close to menopause and may actually be beneficial to the heart this theory is supported by a voluminous amount of data from animal and observational research including the whis own observational study which suggests that women reap heart benefits from taking hormones at the onset of menopause still there are many unanswered questions about the timing of hormone use in terms of when hormones are helpful and when they cause harm in the view of most experts the whi has raised enough questions that women shouldnt take hormones in the hope of preventing heart disease or helping their hearts however the whi data should be reassuring to the typical woman whos considering hormones to address menopause symptoms stroke just as with blood clots menopause hormones appear to increase the risk of stroke however since the typical menopausal woman is younger than age her overall risk of stroke remains low so any additional risk caused by hormone therapy is unlikely to dramatically change a womans absolute risk of stroke the acog panel recommends that healthy women be counseled regarding the small but real increase in stroke risk associated with hormone use the nams panel says that women known to be at higher stroke risk should not use menopause hormones women can help protect themselves against stroke by not smoking managing blood pressure cholesterol and diabetes staying active eating a healthful diet and maintaining a healthful weight breast cancer for many women the breast cancer question will be the most complicated component of their personal hormone decision for women at average breast cancer risk heres what to think about if you are a woman who has undergone a hysterectomy and would take only estrogen data from both the whi and the nurses health study paint the clearest picture yet of how long women whove had a hysterectomy can use estrogen therapy overall theres no statistically significant increase in breast cancer risk for up to years of estrogen use after years breast cancer risk goes up slightly for estrogen users although for breast cancers that are responsive to both estrogen and progestin risk rose at the year mark fifteen to years is far longer than most women would ever consider using menopause hormones the nurses health study suggested that estrogen may lower breast cancer risk during the first years of use while according to the whi an average of seven years of estrogen use could lower breast cancer risk the bottom line for women who take only estrogen is that we have strong data to show that the hormone doesnt increase breast cancer risk for the first seven to years and may be safe for up to to years if you are a woman with a uterus and would take estrogen and progestin because progestin protects against uterine cancer most of the scientific data suggest that women who take both estrogen and progestin do have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer than women who dont take hormones however the overall risk to an individual woman is still small the acog panel notes that according to the overall whi data a womans risk of developing breast cancer while using combination hormone therapy was less than one tenth of one percent a year the risk may be even lower for the typical woman considering menopause hormones the most important relevant data from the whi looked at breast cancer risk among women who had never used menopause hormones before these women most closely resemble the typical woman seeking relief from menopausal symptoms because their breasts hadnt been exposed to hormone therapy women in the whi who had never used menopause hormones but started taking them for the study were more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women who never took hormones at all a increase in risk is relatively small and far less scary than many of the headlines about hormone therapy and breast cancer risk would have you believe consider this a year old woman may have a chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer in the next five years if her risk increases by once she begins hormone therapy her overall breast cancer risk remains just regardless of whether a woman uses menopause hormones she should be getting regular mammograms usually starting at about age because hormones can change the way a breast appears on a mammogram a woman who takes estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progestin should talk to her doctor about getting regular breast sonograms as an added precaution adapted from "the hormone decision " by tara parker pope copyright rodale books ms parker pope writes the weekly health journal
