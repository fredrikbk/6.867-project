the evening wrap surging opposition democrats have shouted their opposition to president bushs plans to send more troops to iraq but as senior administration officials fanned out to sell the policy even some republican lawmakers stepped up to voice their discontent secretary of state condoleezza rice and defense secretary robert gates went to capitol hill to promote the administrations plans to devote thousands more troops and billions more dollars to the nearly four year old war ms rice said at the outset of the hearings that she keenly senses the heartbreak americans feel over the loss of thousands of soldiers in the conflict but that this "is a time for a national imperative not to fail " but it soon became clear that a number of key republican lawmakers have grown impatient with events in iraq and are in no mood to support an escalation nebraska sen chuck hagel who served in vietnam and earned two purple hearts said that mr bushs plan was the "most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since vietnam if its carried out " sen george voinovich the ohio republican said that he could no longer stand behind the administrations vision for iraq "youre going to have to do a much better job" explaining the wars rationale "and so is the president " mr voinovich told ms rice "ive gone along with the president on this and ive bought into his dream and at this stage of the game i just dont think its going to happen " the president hasnt lost all support minority leader mitch mcconnell said he would filibuster any efforts by the majority democrats to introduce a measure expressing disapproval of the presidents plans with democrats holding just a one seat majority mr mcconnell says hes confident that they wont be able to produce the votes necessary to quash any stalling tactics but the anger on display among republicans today may create some uncertainty for the minority leaders whip count and deploying the filibuster seems certain to kick up more controversy republicans threatened the so called nuclear option of doing away with the filibuster in the last congress when democrats threatened to stymie consideration of the presidents judicial nominees making use of the filibuster early in republicans return to the minority especially against a bill long on symbolism but short on legal force could backfire mr mcconnell acknowledged discontent with the troop plan in his party but said "congress is completely incapable of dictating the tactics of the war " meanwhile on the other side of the hill mr gates sworn in at the pentagon just three weeks ago acknowledged that the patience of the american public "is limited and obviously if the iraqis fail to maintain their commitments well have to revisit our strategy " much of the presidents plan hinges on whether the government of prime minister nouri al maliki is able to get iraqi boots on the ground and govern in a way that smooths sectarian fissures instead of tearing shiites and sunnis further asunder but mr gates also said that whether or not one supported the invasion there "seems to be broad agreement that failure in iraq would be a calamity for our nation of lasting historical consequence " this morning mr gates said that he wasnt sure how long the surge of u s troops might last but that he expected it to be a question of months not years "its viewed as a temporary surge but i think no one has a really clear idea of how long that might be " he said tech stocks lead gains technology shares continued to perform well helping traders to overcome their
