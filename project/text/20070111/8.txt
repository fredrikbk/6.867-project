alitalia faces flying solo italy seeks buyers in a test for subsidized european companies rome for years european union regulators have been trying to persuade governments across europe to wean their unprofitable state owned companies from the subsidies that keep them alive this month rome is finally doing just that cutting the cord of alitalia spa after years of keeping the albatross of european airlines alive the italian government has set jan as the deadline to find private investors to take money losing alitalia off its hands rome isnt the only government to run afoul of brussels for keeping big employers on life support greece confronts a similar quandary as it tries to salvage debt laden state carrier olympic airlines brussels insists that olympic hand back hundreds of millions of euros in state subsidies hampering the greek governments plans to privatize the airline in france a multibillion euro package in to rescue conglomerate alstom sa from bankruptcy and save jobs went through only after nine months of wrangling with brussels soon afterward the eu issued rules to further restrict state sponsored bailouts brussels also is fighting germany in court in an effort to repeal a law that protects car maker volkswagen ag from a takeover and possible job cuts the italian government however has bowed to eu pressure and concluded that selling alitalia is the only way to save the airline from political meddling that has weighed it down in the past rome which owns of alitalia wants to sell at least a stake which would give the buyer control of the airline and require it under italian securities law to make a cash offer for all shares outstanding several buyers have expressed interest including a consortium led by rothschild bank which includes two u s private equity funds according to a person close to the situation air france klm sa holds a stake in alitalia and has discussed plans in the past to merge though it has insisted that the italian carrier return to health first whether the state can find willing buyers ultimately depends on whether it can offer the right conditions and price one key unknown is how much leeway any potential buyer may have to restructure the carrier the treasury ministrys tender presentation stipulates that maintaining alitalias "national identity" is mandatory while maintaining the current work force is "of general interest " but the government and any potential owners are caught in a bind years of coddling by rome have made the carrier too inefficient to succeed in its current form with some employees however the airline is too big to fail without causing a political fiasco rome only decided to privatize alitalia after using every trick in the book to pump state money into the company in rome floated a convertible bond to keep the carrier flying in it backed an emergency bridge loan and in it bought half of a billion euros &# billion rights issue those deals gave the carrier more cash to burn but never forced it to make the tough choices it needed to compete the european commission approved the bridge loan on the condition that rome afterward must turn off the spigot "the government is really at a dead end here " says tito boeri a professor of economics at milans bocconi university "they did everything they could to postpone this decision " alitalia is a tough sell whoever takes over the company will have to negotiate with no fewer than unions whose strength and tight relations with political parties in the government have frequently given them the upper hand over management in for example the government decided to remove chief executive francesco mengozzi rather than back his turnaround plan that called for a work force reduction of rome has insulated the carrier from competition and allowed layers of expensive privileges to accumulate alitalia female flight attendants have the right to two days of paid "menstrual leave" a month according to the company alitalias boeing s are among the only planes in the industry that still have space carved out for a bed for tired crew members the airline last year tried to remove the beds to make more room for passenger seats but abandoned the plan because of union resistance unions went on strike for a total of hours last year bringing the airline to its knees during some of the busiest travel periods alitalia also operates an aging and inefficient fleet often flying planes that burn more fuel and carry fewer passengers than newer models making it difficult to make money even when planes are full because of political pressures the airline must service unprofitable domestic routes meanwhile commercial airports in italy have proliferated creating opportunities for low cost carriers such as ryanair holdings plc to service airports that charge lower fees traffic from low cost competitors has risen in the past year according to alitalia the company hasnt had a profitable quarter in more than four years it reported an operating loss of million euros &# million for the third quarter of on revenue of billion euros chief executive giancarlo cimoli has tried to make alitalia more competitive by splitting off the companys ground service business allowing the carrier to focus on trying to make its core flying business profitable mr cimoli also has tried to wrangle labor concessions from unions to increase worker productivity and has tried to reduce costs by regaining leverage over suppliers but the ceo has complained that alitalias labor contracts are significantly more restrictive than those of its competitors and that it operates in an unfriendly regulatory climate that forces it to pay above market fees at airports alitalias unions meanwhile remain steadfastly opposed to any privatization plan that calls for job cuts and have called yet another strike for later this month in protest "we refuse to remain spectators and wait while others make decisions on our future and our life " says claudio genovese a labor leader with the cisl union sabrina cohen in milan contributed to this article
