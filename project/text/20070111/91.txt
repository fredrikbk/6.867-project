politics &amp economics democrats litmus electability key issue for race poses hurdles for clinton obama washington for a party long known for subjecting presidential wannabes to a battery of litmus tests on issues from abortion to trade democrats are uniting in raising one big issue for electability who can win that question is paramount for many activists donors and voters desperate to reclaim the white house and its one that poses a big hurdle for both democratic front runners sens hillary clinton of new york and barack obama of illinois widespread concerns about whether either could get elected mrs clinton because she is a woman and a polarizing figure mr obama for being african american and relatively inexperienced potentially prevent either from running away with the democratic nomination that in turn is what keeps hope alive for about a half dozen rivals maneuvering for advantage should the leaders stumble of that pack polls and early organization suggest the best positioned is former north carolina sen john edwards the vice presidential nominee today sen chris dodd of connecticut officially joins the race with his announcement on the radio show "imus in the morning " the three republican front runners arizona sen john mccain former massachusetts gov mitt romney and former new york city mayor rudy giuliani have the opposite problem of their democratic counterparts each of them is considered electable the question is whether they can get nominated in a party in which the conservative base demands that the nominee oppose abortion same sex marriage and taxes but believes that each of these men is suspect for their part democratic activists and voters alike have become more pragmatic than any time in decades which many in the party attribute to the chastening effect of recent years out of power in washington and many statehouses as for the liberals who make up democrats base for all their passion about jobs and global trade health care the environment abortion and gay rights and especially the war these days the left cares "big time" about whether a candidate can get elected says robert borosage co director of the union supported advocacy group campaign for americas future likewise feminist leader kate michelman says that in her travels "i hear people talking about electability all the time and democrats are going to continue talking about it " even among audiences eager to see a female president she says skeptics ask "do you think the country is really ready for a woman " ms michelman is supporting former north carolina sen john edwards not she says because she considers the front runners unelectable but because mr edwards is the best candidate for womens issues and electable last years midterm elections which gave democrats a majority in congress for the first time in years offered a preview of their partys pragmatic bent primary voters chose a number of moderate to conservative democrats over liberal stalwarts for the partys nominations to increase the chances of winning republican held suburban and western seats "primary voters vote with their heads not their hearts " says democratic consultant stephanie cutter an adviser to john kerrys presidential campaign she and some other strategists cite that year for early evidence of democrats emphasis on electability when mr kerry won the nomination over howard dean then the darling of antiwar liberals "they dated dean but married kerry because he was the best positioned to beat president bush with his military record and proven experience " ms cutter says yet mr kerry wasnt elected and that has other democrats in particular clinton and obama advocates warning against taking the electability test too far neither mrs clinton nor mr obama has announced for president though both are expected to create exploratory committees this month "i think both are electable " says illinois rep rahm emanuel who has ties to both as mr obamas friend and fellow chicagoan and as a former top adviser to mrs clintons husband "bill clinton had an electability problem until the primaries were over" in mr emanuel recalls but his strong performance in the primary campaign overrode controversies about his political stands avoidance of the vietnam draft and alleged philandering much like her husband years ago mrs clinton is often seen as too cautious and calculating leaving many questioning what she stands for unlike him she lacks a compensating charisma despite bipartisan praise for her senate record on issues from education to national security even admirers lament that she would draw republican attacks like no other democrat given conservative activists loathing for both clintons then there is the fact americans have never elected a woman complicated in mrs clintons case by her spouse being a former president suggesting a co presidency of sorts "anybody who has questions about her electability should look at what shes done in new york " says spokesman howard wolfson he notes that she defied skeptics in by winning election to the senate with of the vote and last year was re elected in a landslide thanks to greater support from independents and republicans mr obama exudes the charisma authenticity and optimism that many democrats find lacking in mrs clinton yet while he was raised in hawaii by his white mother and grandparents from kansas his public identity is defined by the african skin and muslim name inherited from his late father barack hussein obama of kenya inevitably democrats ask would americans elect an african american and one whose name rhymes with the terrorist they most revile skeptics also cite the year old mr obamas inexperience after just two years in the senate days after mr obamas return last week from a holiday visit to hometown honolulu hawaiis longtime democratic sen daniel inouye was quoted in the citys paper saying mr obama should wait "he has been in the senate for what two years " for eight years previously mr obama was an illinois state senator as a youth he lived for a time in indonesia was the first african american president of the harvard law review then a community organizer in chicago and a constitutional law professor "people measure experience in different ways " says adviser david axelrod "i think were all an amalgam of all our experiences and his are extremely varied and rich " that is chronicled in mr obamas best selling memoir of struggling with his mixed race multicultural background "dreams from my father " written in before his political career the book includes what would be another first for a presidential candidate mr obamas acknowledged use of "blow" cocaine as a young man strategists in both parties suggest the admission wouldnt be fatal "i think americans are at a moment when candor counts for more than the original sin " democratic pollster geoff garin says for all the scrutiny of the front runners other aspirants face electability questions as well should they attract more attention steve elmendorf a veteran of several democratic campaigns says such judgments are premature a year before the first primary by then he says performances on the stump and in debates will give voters a better sense of each candidate and ultimately mr elmendorf notes "how electable you are depends on who you are running against "
