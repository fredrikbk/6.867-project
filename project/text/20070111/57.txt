igenius unless you were one of the poor reporters who had to yo yo between las vegas and san francisco this week you may not have noticed a hidden message in all of the hoopla over the new apple iphone apple computer make that apple inc now deliberately counterscheduled its annual macworld expo and its important new product announcement directly against the consumer electronics show the worlds biggest consumer electronics convention apple was sending a message that not only does it not inhabit the same universe as the rest of the consumer electronics world even microsoft felt obliged to attend ces but that its announcement would trump anything coming out of vegas and it did the blogosphere lit up the moment steve jobs took the stage on places like fark com the usual fights broke out between the eternally moonstruck macolytes more cruelly "macsturbators" and the increasingly jealous apple haters cnn as is usual with apple turned its news coverage into a day long iphone flack and at mr jobss old high school my sons sophomore literature final exam was interrupted by his teacher who projected on the classroom screen the new iphone for everyone to see this raises the obvious question of why apple needs to spend millions on advertising thus adding to its notoriously high product prices when it has cable networks and schoolteachers doing its marketing for free but even more than that one has to ask how did steve jobs and apple get to this point where the entire tech world waits on their every announcement and why havent other far bigger competitors such as hewlett packard dell and sony learned from them mr jobs is the most paradoxical of creatures on the one hand though time and mortality have mellowed him he remains something of a monster if like me you grew up in the same neighborhood went to the same school interviewed him in the early days of apple and even wrote a book about him and his company there will always be things about him that are unforgivable cruelties and manipulations especially to steve wozniak early crimes illegal telephones ironically megalomania and an unquenchable need to take credit from others do you know who led the original mac team invented the ipod devised the new iphone i didnt think so and that no achievement will ever erase yet there is no denying that mr jobs is a business genius the greatest marketer of our time the most charismatic figure in electronics history and he is the only really interesting person left in high tech once the liveliest most maverick corner of the industrial world sometimes he seems like the only guy left in tech whos having fun of course there are also the products themselves the imac the ipod and the new iphone are whatever the flaws masterpieces of industrial design and enlightened human interfacing they make competitors products even when theyre better machines seem plodding and prosaic so even if mr jobs shamelessly steals the limelight from his subordinates we have seen and hope never to see again what apple looks like without him thats why even tech people who are repelled by mr jobs and his style caught their breaths a few years ago when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and again a couple weeks ago when he was linked to some shady backdating of apple stock options more than one silicon valley leader privately muttered that for the sake of high tech and american competitiveness it might be best if the feds just forgot all about the matter this week mr jobs showed just what he can do when hes in good health and sitting on a cool new product there were great products at the ces but after tuesday no one noticed the iphone which wont be shipped until june suffers from a number of classic apple under jobs weaknesses not enough memory probably not enough battery a comparatively large though wonderfully thin case a touch screen that will infuriate cell phone users and scratch up like the early ipods and an unpopular distribution partner cingular and the iphone is stunningly expensive &# plus a two year cingular commitment but who cares as mr jobs said the iphone is going to revolutionize the phone not because it offers anything fundamentally new but because it brilliantly ties together nearly all of the currently disparate portable consumer tech functions into a single exquisite package driven by a powerful and intuitive interface but thats only part of it the iphone will transform the market because unlike other tech mavericks who try to push the envelope mr jobs can introduce the iphone even in a clumsy overpriced version and trust that the army of several million apple true believers will rush out and buy that is the crucial often overlooked key to apples continuing success other wildcatters have to pray the market recognizes their brilliant new products quickly enough before they go bankrupt apple by comparison always knows that it will be able to finance versions etc on sales to its captive market and by then it will have perfected a definitive product the whole world wants to own mr jobs recognized the power of communities a generation before the current web crowd and is now its greatest master apple has produced a few clunkers that even its own fanatics wont buy and mr jobss obsession with control operating system code distribution partnerships usually cripples the companys competitiveness in the long run but as long as he can keep pulling new market making rabbits out of his hat even that doesnt matter a question remains why do none of his competitors adopt mr jobss business strategy its not like theres a shortage of good design engineers and smart code writers so why do so many tech products these days seem so alien to human nature only the game console companies seem to have some of apples risk taking and cleverness is it a lack of courage an unwillingness to trust the creativity of employees if its a fear of failure apples immense success and skyrocketing stock price ought to teach otherwise whatever the reason its not likely to disappear soon we cant count on an outbreak of cleverness in tech in the near future so that leaves mr jobs for all his demons thank god for him in this age of cookie cutter ceos for a decade now and for another decade at the beginning of the pc age he has run the most enthralling and rewarding show in high tech lets hope he gives us at least one decade more mr malone a columnist for abcnews com is author of "bill and dave how hewlett and packard built the worlds greatest company " to be published in
