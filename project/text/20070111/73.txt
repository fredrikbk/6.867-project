to celebrate that " said marc perry the multicultural marketing manager for ford lincoln mercury uniworld group the new york agency specialized in advertising to african americans brought ms aberra to lincoln since the late s lincoln has struggled to find a consistent new look for its vehicles and a powerful new advertising hook now lincoln executives say they see an opportunity in carving out a position as an approachable and casual luxury brand this is in contrast to daimlerchrysler ags mercedes benz which lincoln labels as "old world" luxury and general motors corp s cadillac brand which lincoln calls "money is everything" luxury lincoln wants to be the universally likable luxury brand the oprah winfrey or ralph lauren of the automotive world brand executives say "we have a different set of values " says lincoln marketing manager mike richards about other auto makers "our customers are not concerned about shouting about their success lincoln is not arrogant or boastful " lincoln executives say the company wanted to get away from the hip hop image in order to broaden its appeal in addition the company is seeking to distinguish itself from other auto makers that rely on hip hop in their marketing in recent years when auto companies have sought to make their products cool they have turned to hip hop stars chrysler for example had snoop dogg and before that it dropped singer celine dion in favor of hip hop star missy elliott lincoln hooked up with hip hop star kanye west who featured two lincoln vehicles in his music video "drive slow " and the company hosted his grammy party last year but lincoln says its relationship with mr west has ended and it is now focused on its partnership with ms aberra and other initiatives to make lincoln an "approachable" brand initially the commercials featuring ms aberra were slated for the minority media and certain urban markets but lincoln later decided to include the amsale ads in lincolns general market ads shown on prime time television next year lincoln says ms aberra will participate in other promotional efforts for the new lincoln "this is an important product line for us to get young people to consider lincoln amsale represents an agent of change " mr perry says lincolns new ads also feature scott tucker a black furniture designer in a lincoln navigator ad its part of lincolns overall "reach higher" campaign lincolns shift comes as rival cadillac having capitalized on rappers and athletes to promote its flashy escalade suv now also is trying to broaden its appeal to those who may be turned off by hip hop at a power point presentation for the media last year cadillac showed crooner frank sinatra and hip hop star cent as the two extremes of its image cadillac is seeking a more middle ground a recent commercial for the escalade featured new york giants running back tiki barber lincoln was the best selling luxury brand in america in with hits like the navigator which started the luxury suv craze and the venerable town car the limousine of choice in new york and other large cities but ford allowed the lincoln lineup to get rusty as it invested instead in its premier automotive group of european luxury brands including volvo land rover jaguar and aston martin while lincolns competitors notably cadillac came up with refreshed models and new segment entries lincoln lost ground in lincoln sales fell putting lincoln in th place among major luxury car brands in the u s last year lincoln sales fell lincolns new strategy could backfire because many luxury vehicle buyers purchase a vehicle precisely because they want to flaunt their success in a recent luxury institute automotive brand survey lincoln was at the bottom of the list of luxury cars when it came to brand status quality perception of exclusivity and social status "the american consumer is looking for american luxury so lincoln does have a chance " luxury institute ceo milton pedraza said "still lincoln has a lot of work to do " lincoln is banking on four redesigned or new products that are hitting the market within a four month period first out is the mkz formerly known as the zephyr which went on sale in
