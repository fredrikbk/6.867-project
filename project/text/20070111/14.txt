blackjack beats out palm but iphone may well top both when apple rocked the cellphone world tuesday by unveiling its radical and gorgeous new iphone it was bad news for palm inc whose treo smart phones will be severely challenged by the new iphone when it goes on sale in june i attended the iphone launch event and was able to use one for a little while thats too brief an encounter to allow me to write a proper review but i can say that it has the largest and most beautiful screen ive ever seen on a cellphone even though its incredibly thin it felt great in my hand it has a brilliant new user interface the handsomest email program and web browser ive ever seen on a phone a full blown ipod music and video player built in and even a cool new voicemail system the iphone has some potential downsides it doesnt use a physical keyboard instead relying on a virtual keyboard on the screen which may put off heavy email users it runs on the relatively slow edge cellular data network though that flaw is partly offset by the fact that it can also use speedy wi fi wireless networking and with a &# base price its expensive still the iphone made my relatively new treo p seem primitive in many respects when i compared them side by side and the apple product isnt palms only problem palms position as the design leader in smart phones has been under assault for months major phone makers like motorola and nokia have introduced models that have most of the treos capabilities but are thinner sleeker and lighter and much less expensive the treo maker is starting to respond but haltingly it has brought out a couple of slightly smaller new models but theyre no match in sleekness or style for competitors like the motorola q they also arent as cheap they do though have some advantages in software and functionality that for some users will make them preferable ive been testing the latest skinny contender the samsung blackjack along with palms newest treo the slimmed down treo both of these phones like the apple phone run on the cingular wireless network both also use microsofts windows mobile software the new treo is slimmed down a bit from the familiar treo and models the is also a little shorter because it does away with the protruding antenna in addition its a hair thinner and about lighter but next to the new samsung blackjack the treo looks bulky the blackjack is a striking all black model in the slim tradition of the motorola q it manages to cram a full keyboard like the treos into a body that is much sleeker and better looking the blackjack is lighter and smaller overall than the treo it has a physically smaller screen but that screen has a third better resolution than the treos of course both screens look tiny and grainy compared with the display on the new apple phone also the blackjack claims better battery life than the treo and it runs on a faster data network than the treo neither phone includes wi fi and to top it all off the blackjack is half the price &# compared with &# for the treo one of the treos biggest advantages has been its palm software which i consider to be better designed for email and phone calls than the windows mobile software from microsoft but the new model cant claim that advantage because while it has palm hardware it uses the microsoft software the treo does have a small software advantage over the blackjack it uses a fuller version of windows mobile that has more features than the stripped down version used on the blackjack and the motorola q and because it has a touch screen the treo is easier to navigate than the blackjack which must be controlled with buttons and a scroll wheel on the side also the treos control pad felt better to me than the blackjacks which was cramped i kept hitting other buttons on the blackjack while trying to scroll or select icons in my tests both the palm and the samsung sent and received voice calls well both also exhibited the clumsiness that is inherent in windows mobile multiple key presses were needed to do simple tasks both have basic cameras with resolutions of megapixels the apple iphones camera will be two megapixels the blackjack runs on cingulars new broadband data network called "g" or hsdpa while the treo uses a slower network called umts oddly however in my tests the treo was generally as fast or even faster at retrieving web pages than the blackjack of these two phones i prefer the blackjack but if youre in the market for a smart phone and can afford &# you might want to wait until june for the apple iphone the apple entry is so full of promise that anyone buying a smart phone in should at least wait for the full reviews and a chance to try it out email me at mossberg wsj com
