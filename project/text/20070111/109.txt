schwarzeneggers bond sequel at this rate gov arnold schwarzenegger may become known as the bond inator last year the former "terminator" star persuaded california voters to pass a record bond package totaling &# billion to help rebuild the states aging infrastructure this year he is proposing that california go back to the well for an additional &# billion in bonds to help accelerate the rebuilding work and that is making even democratic allies of the republican governor a tad nervous "im a little taken aback that the governor would go back to the voters before we have even spent the bonds we just got " said don perata the president of the democratic controlled state senate after mr schwarzenegger made the surprise proposal in his state of the state speech here tuesday night the governor offered up an ambitious agenda for his second term vowing to take on the problems of health care climate change crumbling roads and a host of other difficult issues "we must be ambitious to get california to the future " the governor told legislators gathered in the state assembly chamber "we are addressing needs that have been ignored for decades " mr schwarzeneggers office says more borrowing is prudent because the state is in much better financial shape than when the governor took office in indeed mr schwarzenegger released a budget proposal for yesterday that would enable the state to repay years ahead of schedule the billions in bonds it borrowed in after the collapse of the internet boom the governors spending plan of &# billion also holds general spending to a relatively tight increase although as a whole it is up over the same time it isnt just the size of the proposed bond package but also the mix of it that concerns some the governor would ask voters to sign off on &# billion of the bonds which would be spent on such things as rebuilding and expanding schools and colleges and providing for new dams to store water in the arid state but the other &# billion much of which would go toward expanding the overcrowded prison system would come from lease revenue and self liquidating revenue bonds state sen denise ducheny said the lease bonds are more expensive than general obligation bonds and so wonders if they would be prudent also added the democrat who mr schwarzenegger will need to work with as she is the incoming senate budget chair voters may become bond weary "we have to be a little cautious " said ms ducheny who represents a district in san diego still the governor has regained enough political capital since clashing with democrats on several fronts in that even his detractors say they are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and work to find common ground conservative republicans may prove among the toughest to get to sign off another bond deal since they have complained in the past about excessive spending and borrowing in sacramento political strategists say thats partly why mr schwarzenegger opted to include a highly controversial plan to build new dams in california that the republicans generally support while the democrats dont indeed fabian nunez the powerful speaker of the democratic controlled state assembly already calls provisions for more water storage a nonstarter saying those supplies could fall into the hands of profiteers the governor probably knows he isnt going to get everything he wants though added mr perata who along with mr nunez was instrumental in selling the governors bond package last year "his strategy here seems to be you send five receivers down the field and you throw to one " mr perata said
