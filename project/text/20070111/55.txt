how the income share of top of families has increased dramatically in his dec editorial page commentary "the top of what " alan reynolds casts doubts on the interpretation of our results showing that the share of income going to the top families has doubled from in to in his critique contains serious misunderstandings of our work first mr reynolds points out that in contrast to our results the official census bureau figures show only a modest increase in the top income share the reason for the discrepancy is that the census bureau estimates are based on survey data that are not suitable to study high incomes because of small sample size and top coding of very high incomes in contrast tax return data provide a very accurate picture of reported incomes at the top our key contribution was precisely to use those tax data to construct better inequality estimates we found only families within the top experienced very large gains relative to the average since and that upper middle class families the next below the top experienced only modest gains this shows that the census bureau figures based on data that cannot measure top incomes misses the extraordinary gains going to the top which is perhaps the most striking change in the u s income distribution in recent decades second mr reynolds asserts that our estimates are upward biased because our total income measure is smaller than personal income from national income and products accounts our measure of income is cash market income defined as gross income reported on tax returns less government transfers such as social security or unemployment insurance personal income is a broader measure of income which also includes non cash market income such as fringe benefits from employers imputed rent for homeowners under reported income due to tax evasion but also government transfers such as medicare social security conceptually it makes more sense to focus either on market income before deducting taxes and including transfers or on disposable income market income net of taxes and including transfers we chose to estimate inequality based on cash market income but it would certainly be interesting to estimate inequality based on disposable income as well to assess the effects of government taxes and transfers on inequality the official concept of personal income is not appropriate for either computation because it mixes market income with transfers but does not subtract taxes mr reynolds says transfers have increased since but taxes on high incomes have decreased substantially actually we have estimated the average federal tax burden on top families has decreased from in to in the decrease at the top outweighs the increase in transfers at the bottom therefore the top disposable income share has most likely more than doubled since third mr reynolds points out reported incomes may not reflect true incomes because of tax evasion or tax avoidance this is a legitimate concern and we along with a number of colleagues have actually spent substantial time investigating this issue most of the scenarios he described such as a shift from corporate income to individual income or from qualified stock options to non qualified stock options would imply that high incomes used to receive capital gains instead of ordinary income for example a closely held c corporation that does not distribute its profits increases in value and those accumulated profits would appear as realized capital gains on the owner individual tax return when the business is sold yet our top income share series including realized capital gains has also doubled from in to in there is a debate among economists on whether reported incomes respond to tax rates the emerging consensus is that there can be substantial responses in the short run due to retiming of income such as realizing capital gains before a tax rate increase but that the long term response is small our series focusing exclusively on w wage and salary income excluding both business and capital income show that the top wage income share has increased from in to in in sum our work has shown the top income share has increased dramatically in recent decades and has reached levels not seen since before world war ii and even since before the great depression when including capital gains the reduction in taxes at the top since has mechanically exacerbated the discrepancy in disposable income between the rich and the rest of us thus it is obvious that the progressive income tax should be the central element of the debate when thinking about what to do about the increase in inequality thomas piketty professor of economics paris school of economics paris emmanuel saez professor of economics university of california berkeley calif see related letter "letters to the editor inequality problem" wsj january see related letter "letters to the editor is income inequality a real problem " wsj jan
