can delta win battle to keep flying solo carrier talks with northwest mounts lobbying campaign as us airways hikes bid in the two months since us airways group inc announced its hostile bid for delta air lines inc the embattled carrier has mounted a high octane campaign of grass roots organizing and fierce political lobbying to try to stay independent but all that has succeeded in doing is attracting a higher offer and a potential new suitor yesterday us airways increased its bid to &# billion up from its original proposal while people familiar with the situation said there have been recurring talks between delta and northwest airlines corp about the two combining when each emerges from bankruptcy later this year while delta maintains its insistence that its future is brightest as a stand alone carrier the talks with northwest suggest that delta executives are grappling privately with how much more the airline can afford to pay to creditors to remain independent northwest has emerged as a "promising third option " according to one person familiar with the matter northwest is expected to file its preliminary plan of reorganization in the next few days and has been out raising equity capital to help fund the company once it leaves chapter in the second quarter northwest last month hired investment banking and restructuring advisers evercore partners inc to help it evaluate and possibly implement a merger acquisition or other business combination delta has also run the numbers on a potential merger with northwest and continues to update the calculations as the two companies reorganizations progress according to a person with knowledge of the matter deltas creditors committee has directed its advisers to do the same and will meet with the airline in the coming days another person said an important question for deltas creditors does it make sense to pursue a merger in bankruptcy which could extend deltas stay in court protection and hamper business or would the airline be better off weighing a combination once it emerges in april after waiting weeks to mount a counterattack against the original offer delta has become relentless in trying to defeat us airways using tactics ranging from million emails to frequent fliers to "keep delta my delta" buttons worn by airline employees us airways chief executive doug parker said the efforts to fan opposition to the takeover havent tilted the odds against his airline "i dont believe thats the case at all " he said still mr parker said last week that he wasnt considering increasing the tempe ariz airlines initial offer because it was obviously superior to a restructuring plan proposed by delta last month but it became clearer since that creditors were "wrestling" with the two offers he said yesterday j p morgan analyst jamie baker wrote in a research note last month that deltas "hard sell" has slightly improved its chances of remaining independent though he expects the company will eventually succumb to us airways or another merger partner the sweetened offer will test fragile allegiances delta has been forging with pilots other employees customers and political leaders who were squeezed for concessions by delta as it tumbled into bankruptcy in if it decides to increase its go it alone bid to creditors delta might be forced to shrink the amount of equity and profit sharing that employees stand to get under the airlines current turnaround plan us airways set a feb deadline for its latest offer comprised of &# billion in cash plus million shares of us airways common stock that likely will force creditors to start making up their minds sooner than the feb bankruptcy court hearing where delta had hoped for approval to start asking creditors to vote on its plan yesterday us airways shares rose &# or to &# in new york stock exchange composite trading at p m putting the value of the us airways bid at &# billion in a memo to employees delta chief executive gerald grinstein said the enhanced offer fails to "address serious concerns " including deltas claim that the merger would cost thousands of workers their jobs and cant clear antitrust hurdles the deal also would "increase the debt burden of the combined company by yet another &# billion " he added to regain momentum for independence delta must now ratchet up its lobbying and organizing efforts while simultaneously giving creditors what they want most of all more money delta is considering inviting a private equity firm to invest in the airline finding deeper cuts as part of its stand alone restructuring plan or merging with someone other than us airways according to people familiar with the situation deltas recent campaign is a sharp contrast with its flat footed response to the original bid two months ago when mr grinstein heard about it on the radio as he dressed for work mr grinsteins communications director had recently resigned leaving behind a thin staff and while us airways approached delta twice before going public with its hostile bid delta said little about the surprise offer for several days instead executives kept their daily schedules behind the scenes jim whitehurst deltas operating chief pressed delta officials to fight toe to toe with mr parker arguing that delta would win if it engaged creditors and other groups aggressively delta soon installed outside media consultant cynthia hudson who helped during bitter pilot contract negotiations as temporary head of corporate communications and turned to crisis communications firm kekst &amp co the new york company which has worked with delta for several years helped walt disney co resist a takeover by comcast corp in since then delta executives and lobbyists have been making the rounds on capitol hill with their efforts gaining enough traction to force a senate committee on commerce science and transportation hearing jan on the mergers potential impact on competition and customers mr grinstein who has visited lawmakers personally is expected to testify meanwhile a delta employee group has been using part of its annual funding from the company to finance its "keep delta my delta" campaign which began the day after the hostile bid "we started right then trying to figure out the best thing to do because we knew that delta people would not want to sit idly by and let this play out " said bill morey a member of the employee boards council the group has distributed buttons to flight attendants ticket agents and other delta employees throughout the world and the airline waived rules so workers can wear the buttons on their uniforms the new keepdeltamydelta org web site solicits signatures for an antimerger petition that will be sent to the justice department and delta supplied information on an interactive map showing the negative effects the carrier contends would result from a takeover the air line pilots association which represents delta pilots and holds one of the largest bankruptcy claims has held demonstrations in a dozen cities including a rally in deltas home city of atlanta last month that drew more than current and retired employees members of georgias congressional delegation and a days worth of media coverage delta has even started new service to charlotte n c and pittsburgh two us airways hubs as part of a push to project delta as a vigorous quickly recovering carrier delta wont comment on how it decided to launch the flights or if they are aimed partly as retaliation against us airways yesterday us airways launched its own takeover web site called buildingabetterairline com in a letter to us airways employees mr parker reiterated his pledge that no "frontline" workers will be laid off if the hostile takeover succeeds
