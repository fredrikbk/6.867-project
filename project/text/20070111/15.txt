bling bling buick seeking younger buyers general motors staid brand uses customized cars celebrities to reach the hip hop crowd the average buick buyer is a man in his mid s not the type of consumer inclined to trick out his car with inch wheels a lowered suspension and tinted windows so why was a buick lucerne with just those modifications on display at a party hosted by general motors corp last weekend that also featured actress vivica fox known for roles in movies like "booty call" and "soul food " and hip hop star jay z the answer is simple math for sales of gms buick were down by almost compared with according to autodata corp now the brand is trying to expand its appeal among young urban consumers deemed essential if its going to help reverse gms flagging fortunes and build sustainable sales "the idea is that the urban market sets the trend for the mainstream market " says heather waszczenko buicks national advertising manager with that in mind buick is re examining its advertising and studying car customization trends so far that has brought about the brands first major appearance at a large car aftermarket show the venue for the customizers to show off their souped up vehicles in las vegas a pilot marketing program in atlanta featuring billboards lucernes displayed outside nightclubs and radio spots and bigger wheels for buick models buick is not alone in trying to court a younger urban buyer ford motor co s lincoln and volvo luxury lines and toyota motor corp s lexus are among the other automobile brands that traditionally appeal to a more mature demographic and have recently been looking for younger buyers such attempts to speak to a younger and more urban audience carry risks they could alienate the brands longtime older customers who remain comfortable with their cars sedate and respectable image and if the companies try too hard and dont have a clear idea of who they are trying to reach they could alienate consumers of all stripes buick says its too early to tell whether its new efforts will work but says more car customizers are asking for buicks to soup up for shows and other events buick first realized its brands potential among young african americans early last year when dub an urban custom car culture magazine asked for a buick lucerne that it could customize for events around the same time buicks product manager for the lucerne started hearing about "scraypers" or "scrapers" a style of customized car developed by young african americans in the oakland calif area buick models from the s and s are popular in the genre outfitted with wheels so big that the tires scrape the inside of the cars fender according to some definitions of how the genre got its name to learn more about what buick can do to appeal to the young urban and mostly black men who hold so much sway over popular tastes these days buick hosted an "urban media roundtable" in atlanta last june bringing together about a dozen journalists most of them african american from publications from hip hop magazine xxl to luxury lifestyle web site ecityofstyle com the goal was "trying to understand the pacemakers and what they think is hot " says david darovitz buicks manager of communications as well as figure out how to market new buicks to them buick has already started implementing a number of suggestions from the gathering but the discussion also showed the disconnect between the brand and its target audience that could hinder buicks turnaround and possibly turn off some customers ken panton the year old president of ecityofstyle com and a buick roundtable participant said the brands idea of "urban" a young black teen listening to run dmc seems a bit old fashioned today he says "there is a new definition of urban " embracing upper middle class white kids wearing lacoste shirts and sean john jeans during the discussion marcus amick who writes about cars for the mostly african american readership of the michigan chronicle and other publications said buick and its gm brethren rely too heavily on celebrities to reach younger consumers the discussion turned to hip hop star ludacris who moonlights as a pitchman for gms pontiac solstice convertible kimatni rawlins the year old publisher of automotiverhythms com a web site devoted to the "urban automotive experience " piped up "there is no way you can convince me that ludacris is driving a solstice " "he definitely owns one " shot back larry woodard whose urban advertising firm vigilante developed the ludacris campaign "he owns it because it was probably part of his sponsorship deal " countered mr rawlins a spokesman for the entertainer confirms he owns a solstice as part of his deal with pontiac buicks mr darovitz eventually steered the conversation back to buick "if there was one celebrity you would align with buick who would that be " tiger woods the panelists chimed in together some rolled their eyes "tiger woods is nice hes a very successful golfer but he doesnt necessarily resonate with people in the urban center " said greg morrison a year old free lance journalist formerly with the black family channel mr morrison had the impression that buick was lumping all black and hispanic people together in a narrow definition of urban "we play golf we have memberships to country clubs and nice homes " he says still he gives buick points for trying "its a learning curve the best analogy i can give you is trying to teach george bush the bankhead bounce " referring to a hip hop dance named for the atlanta neighborhood where it originated a month after its urban roundtable buick hosted an "immersion day" in atlanta organized by vigilante where buick marketing executives and dealers listened to a panel of urban lifestyle experts from music fashion and other industries one of the first tests of buicks new strategy came in november at the specialty equipment market association show in las vegas the largest car customization and accessory show in the u s as the hip hop hybrid music of violin playing duo nuttin but stringz played to the crowd buick lifted the veil on lucernes tricked out by customizers and rides magazine the cars were styled with "black cherry" paint lowered suspensions inch wheels souped up sound systems suicide doors paired side doors that open away from each other and alligator leather upholstery one of these customized vehicles is on display at the consumer electronics show in las vegas this week "i always thought of buick as an older name but now they are doing what were also doing were infusing two worlds hip hop and classical " says tourie escobar years old who with his brother damien constitute nuttin but stringz as part of a pilot marketing campaign buick is also parking lucerne sedans outside nightclubs movie premieres concerts barber shops and other venues in atlanta where trendsetters are known to gather print bus and billboard ads in atlanta show lucernes
