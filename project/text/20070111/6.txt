a guide to watching network tv online though more shows are becoming available on the web finding and viewing prime time hits can be a chore adan canizales suffers from tv gridlock three of his favorite shows "the o c " on fox "scrubs" on nbc and "greys anatomy" on abc all aired on thursday at p m this past fall so mr canizales a new york university law student devised an elaborate solution he watched "the o c " on tv and recorded "scrubs" on his tivo digital video recorder but since his tivo cant record two shows at once he later opened his laptop to watch "greys anatomy" online "there is no way i could watch all of them at the same time even with tivo " he says last year was the year the television networks took the plunge and allowed some of their programs to be available online free they didnt want to end up like the music industry which initially fought the web and suffered from decreased sales whats more tv networks saw customers fast forwarding through commercials on their dvrs and wanted to provide a format where they couldnt zap the ads but networks are still gauging how audiences are responding to online programming currently most web offerings are delayed between an hour and as much as a day after they are aired on tv and advertisements which might differ from those that appear on tv arent skippable "everything is untraditional in this new space " says vivi zigler executive vice president of nbc digital entertainment and new media an nbc unit that seeks out new ways to reach consumers "you put something out there and see how people respond " its too early for real ratings data abc which is owned by walt disney co for instance says it had a total of million "starts" last fall on its full episode web programming meaning viewers who at least clicked on a show at the beginning considering that abc was measuring eight prime time series over a period of three months the result was tiny compared with regular tv the networks "desperate housewives " for instance had million viewers for a single episode this week whats more ad revenue from online programming is small but viewership is growing mostly among tech savvy young people who like the convenience of watching a show anytime without having to record it "while its still early its clear that there is a demand for online video " says albert cheng executive vice president of digital media for disney abc television group "there is an audience for our shows and it is an effective vehicle for advertisers to reach our customers " for now online viewing can be confusing as each network has its own system abc general electric co s nbc and news corp s fox for instance offer a handful of programs on their web sites whereas cbs corp makes almost all its prime time lineup available also inconsistent are the timing of when shows are updated with new episodes and how long they remain available online even finding the shows can be a chore most networks let people click to watch from their web sites although each site has the button in a different spot fox programs however arent available directly on www fox com you have to go to myspace the popular social networking site owned by news corp or to certain local fox station sites but watch out the myspace home page doesnt have a button pointing to the fox shows you have to go to www myspace com fox and for some people watching the videos online hardly compares with sitting on a couch and enjoying a program on tv with friends or a bowl of popcorn michael hickerson a state government employee in nashville tenn watches several shows online including nbcs "heroes" and "friday night lights " but makes it a point to tune in to abcs "lost" when it airs on tv "in my circle of friends everyone is talking about it the next day " mr hickerson says "i want to be part of that water cooler buzz " the web tv audience soon can expect an expanded lineup of shows and web exclusive programming as well as more interactive components like blogs and games this past fall nbc featured a "producers cut" of "the office " providing eight additional minutes of content that werent available on tv fox offered special pre tv debuts for "the o c " and "the simpsons " the cable networks also are testing the field mtv streamed the season finale of "two a days " a series about high school football on mtv com before airing it on tv networks also are experimenting with user generated content and social networking experiences whether viewers want all these extras isnt clear the networks early research shows that web viewers are mainly ardent fans of shows that they cant always catch on tv kevin elwell a junior at university of central florida is a self described "lost" addict "once i got into it i couldnt miss it " he says but this fall he was stuck in a business class on wednesday evenings when the show aired instead he arranged to watch it online later with a friend who also had classes to attend during the broadcast but if youre a fan of "e r " youre out of luck the reason nbc doesnt own the show and is limited by licensing agreements with warner brothers which makes the program and owns the internet rights networks that have more flexibility with the licensing of their shows such as cbs offer more of their lineup online all of the networks say theyre pushing to add more both in terms of the number of series and episodes to their online offerings still some shows like "the simpsons" havent been made available even though theyre owned by the company that airs them heres a network by
