limited menu japans cancer refugees demand more options patients decry system thats frugal universal but restricts choices tokyo with the prime minister looking on a legislator named takashi yamamoto stood before japans parliament last may and told his colleagues that he had cancer then he denounced the nations standard of cancer care "even when there are treatments people are being told they will never get better " he said "these abandoned cancer refugees are roaming the japanese archipelago " the speech galvanized the parliament which had been dawdling over a bill that called for more cancer specialists and a permanent role for patients in policy making within four weeks the bill became law it was a signal victory for a spreading movement in japan among patients who want american style care and drugs for cancer but the idea of becoming more like the u s raises alarms among policy makers in japan the government guarantees that everyone has health insurance coverage and it pays most of the bills masaharu nakajima until recently director general of the health bureau at the ministry of health labor and welfare says japan already offers excellent cancer care with a huge national debt and corporations worried about higher taxes japan cant afford to throw money into treatments and training that offer little hope of significantly extending lifespans he says "if we keep going like this japan is going to be crushed under medical expenses " says dr nakajima a surgeon who used to treat cancer patients before joining the ministry referring to the demand for more specialists he says "america did too much of this and thats why their medical costs have grown " the debate in japan raises the question of where nations should draw the line when modern medicine offers almost unlimited ways to spend money in the u s both private insurers and public programs such as medicare take a relatively generous view usually paying for treatments that offer some hope of helping the patient japan is far more tightfisted spending on health in japan each year is roughly half the level of u s spending adjusting for the size of each countrys economy health spending in japan is even lower than in most western european countries and canada yet if thats hurting people its hard to find evidence in the statistics japan has the worlds highest life expectancy for women men are no and one of the worlds lowest infant mortality rates many countries are grappling with how to improve care while containing costs in japan debate about the system has focused on cancer by far the nations leading killer the internet has helped break down patients isolation from information about their disease and supplied data on foreign treatments cancer activists believe inadequate treatment on occasion cuts short the lives of japanese some focus their ire on the very notion that mortality numbers can measure the value a health care system delivers hidesuke hashimoto who has been treated for lung cancer and leads a patients group says japanese bureaucrats unlike americans fail to recognize the value of pursuing all possible avenues of treatment when a person is seriously ill "our rights as individuals arent being recognized " says mr hashimoto a year old retired math teacher "we have the right to live " more government spending on health care he suggests would be a small price to pay for promoting democracy and the rights enshrined in japans u s written constitution article says all people are entitled to a minimum standard of "wholesome and cultured living " cancer accounted for deaths among japanese in or of the total more than heart attacks and strokes combined the rate of cancer deaths per population continues to rise slightly in contrast to a slight decline in the u s whether poor care has something to do with that is a matter of debate demographics and lifestyles also may play a role japan is a rapidly aging nation where nearly half of men smoke while obesity and heart disease are relatively uncommon those factors tend to increase the proportion of deaths caused by cancer since japan introduced universal health insurance coverage in the late s and early s its policy has focused on ensuring a minimum standard of care for all people are required to pay a monthly health insurance fee large companies must also pay health insurance fees but the rules of the game what is covered how much doctors get paid are mainly set by the central government in tokyo after world war ii japan achieved an improvement in life expectancy just as spectacular as its rise to become the worlds second largest economy japanese women have been the longest lived in the world since according to the health ministry meanwhile the governments frugality has helped keep medical costs at a minimum the restrictions arent like those in england where the government employs most of the doctors japan is the largest example of a "third way" medical system also common in continental europe that combines universal health insurance with private doctors japan saves by requiring less training of doctors and paying them less aspiring doctors typically go to medical school straight out of high school and become m d s in just six years compared with eight years of post high school education in the u s until japanese doctors could go straight into practice without any internship now they must serve as interns for at least two years the average doctors annual income is just over &# compared with about &# in the u s doctors say they have little time for patients because people in japan are generally free to visit any doctor they like the experience of going to a doctor whos popular is often summed up as "a three hour wait for a three minute visit " health spending in japan is about of gross domestic product versus in the u s the frugality has extended to cancer care more than in the u s surgeons take a major role including deciding on drug treatment typically the province of a specialized cancer doctor in the u s through the late s the concept of a second opinion was virtually unknown today japanese people borrow the english words and talk about getting a "sekando opinion " until recently cancer patients often did little to buck the system for a simple reason many werent told they had the disease it was common for patients to place complete trust in their doctor and refrain from asking why they were receiving an operation or medicine family members usually heard the true diagnosis but they often felt it was cruel to burden the patient with that information shintaro abe a politician and father of japans prime minister shinzo abe was widely known to have cancer for two years before his death in but the elder mr abe was kept in the dark about his pancreatic tumor until his final two months when he suspected the truth according to his widows memoirs mr hashimoto the former math teacher says he was first diagnosed with liver cancer in and underwent surgery to remove a tumor but his family kept the diagnosis from him he says he was shocked when his son told him in that he had cancer and it had spread to his lungs the son wanted mr hashimoto who lives near kobe to travel to tokyo to get chemotherapy at the national cancer center and realized it was no longer possible to hide the diagnosis unlike most japanese patients mr hashimoto dived into studying his disease scouring books and the internet "i was told twice that there were no more treatments for me " he says but each time he moved to a new hospital for experimental treatment sometimes paying out of pocket for procedures not covered by the state he joined and eventually led a patients group with his activism mr hashimoto was joining a growing movement around the turn of the century new chemotherapy drugs and the spread of the internet spawned a class of activist cancer patients the government was quick to approve a handful of drugs that clearly could extend lives in particular novartis ags gleevec which was approved in japan the same year as the u s but other drugs with more marginal benefits languished for years sometimes foreign drug makers were slow to seek approval in japan fearing the government set price would be too low to make it worth their while to desperate patients it was infuriating that the government didnt rush every potential life saver to market however slim its benefits might be one example is eloxatin a drug that has been shown to extend lives by a few months on average in patients with recurring colorectal tumors after patients held street rallies passing out fliers and repeatedly visited parliament japan approved the drug in nearly three years after the u s other drugs have yet to make it to japan the government is reviewing avastin approved in the u s in february the genentech inc drug also can extend lives by several months on average but costs tens of thousands of dollars a year a movement for more drugs and better care culminated in may when patients and family members packed a hall in osaka for the first national convention of cancer patients one of the organizers shoichi miura was a doctor and himself a cancer patient in his speech he summoned up a common image here the "gan nanmin " or cancer refugee "while japan has become economically prosperous cancer patients are in the same position as refugees who wander in search of food water and someone who can help " said dr miura who died seven months later japans public television network nhk added to the chorus with a two night prime time documentary that portrayed japan as far behind the u s in cancer care nhk introduced the nationwide audience to a hospital in texarkana texas and showed a meeting in which doctors nurses and other specialists discussed cancer patients care it contrasted that with japan where a single doctor with minimal consultation might make a diagnosis decide treatment and carry it out the public pressure has had an impact last april for the first time a medical society designated doctors who had passed rigorous tests as certified oncologists cancer specialists qualified to administer chemotherapy drugs the u s has had a similar process since overseen by the american board of internal medicine and today thousands of oncologists are certified by the board the law passed by parliament last june doesnt call for immediate new spending but it creates targets and committees that will force the health ministry to do more says mr yamamoto the legislator whose speech spurred the laws passage "cancer patients are becoming informed and beginning to act it is late compared to america " he says mr yamamoto says japan should be ready to raise taxes to finance more generous care for cancer patients and others he himself has gone to a maverick doctor who charges patients &# out of pocket for a consultation and believes in aggressive treatment but government leaders show little willingness to fund a big expansion in health care the government is grappling with a huge budget deficit left over from the s the health ministry has slashed doctor reimbursements and raised co payments for patients many people must pay of their doctor bills in addition to their regular health insurance fees and the maximum monthly out of pocket cost went up on oct to yen &# from yen meanwhile the government cut doctors average reimbursement by last year following a similar cut in that infuriates doctors "its been one cutback after another " says toshio nakagawa a neurosurgeon who serves on the board of the japan medical association "this time i think theyve gone too far " dr nakajima the recently retired health ministry official says policy makers must also worry about the competitiveness of japanese companies "executives want to keep costs down " he says dr nakajima says a diligent surgeon who bones up on the latest literature can do just as good a job as a licensed oncologist he says cancer patients may feel reassured if they see a certificate on their doctors wall but that feeling alone isnt worth blowing the governments budget says dr nakajima "its simply not the case that the survival rate goes up just because somebody got a certification "
