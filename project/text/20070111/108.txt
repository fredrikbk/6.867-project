style tricks of the trade a modeling executive smiles for the camera in the past years modeling industry veteran john casablancass picture has shown up in the press more than times often alongside supermodels like naomi campbell and cindy crawford the founder of the agency elite models as well as an eponymous chain of modeling schools says that despite the years of experience in front of a lens he usually doesnt like the way he looks in photos "i am a terrible model " says mr casablancas years old who now lives in rio de janeiro "i am very self conscious " the best photos he says are those that are spontaneous his favorite a shot of himself from years ago in which hes walking around with his son julian on his shoulders he thinks he looks comfortable in the photo which now hangs in his office the biggest mistake people make when they sit for a photo he says is concentrating too much "when you become too focused you look like a phony " he says at a party people should continue their conversations as if nothing unusual is happening instead of trying to pose still there are some small things people can do to become more photogenic mr casablancas says like keeping ones chin low and avoiding light that illuminates the face from beneath "if light is under the face it has a tendency to grow " he says another common problem is the positioning of the legs "people are so focused on their face that they dont realize their feet are in an inelegant position " he says keeping ones feet firmly planted on the ground and not turned in or spread apart works best to add sensuality to a shot he recommends opening ones mouth slightly which helps eliminate the problem of pursed lips elongating the neck "in a regal type position" creates the illusion of extra height which can be slimming and he suggests making sure that ones face is parallel to the cameras lens "so that certain parts arent more distant than others " shine the appearance of oily skin can also ruin a perfectly good photo dabbing pressed powder on the forehead nose and cheeks can mitigate the problem he says varying ones facial expression is another way to ensure a better outcome "most people think they have one great expression like a grin " says mr casablancas "then you look at their holiday album and they are making the same face in every picture " photographers can also help improve the looks of their party photos by not waiting too long to snap a picture after telling subjects to smile ideally photographers should snap the photo midsmile before the grin gets too big "you have to hope that the picture will catch you while you were on your way to getting to maximum width " mr casablancas says
