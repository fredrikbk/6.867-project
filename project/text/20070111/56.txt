how to set financial priorities first pay off debt then experts say focus on savings now that the holidays are over its time to honor those new years resolutions and get your financial affairs in order but which order people often make mistakes in their financial priorities most of us need to save more and get rid of debt but some tasks are more pressing than others for instance parents frequently and understandably save for their childrens college education when they should be saving more for their own retirement first "priorities are the key " says sophie beckmann a financial planning specialist at a g edwards inc "youll have long term goals and short goals youre saving for retirement a house a car college for a kid " heres what many financial advisers say is the right order in which to prioritize your financial goals debt the first priority is to pay off high cost nondeductible consumer debt "dont even bother saving for retirement or saving for college if you havent paid credit card debt " says rande spiegelman vice president of financial planning at the schwab center for investment research a division of charles schwab corp thats because paying off a credit card thats charging interest "is like earning a risk free tax free rate of return " he says there are a couple of different strategies for getting rid of debt some people like to first pay off the credit card with the lowest balance to see faster results the most cost effective method says stuart ritter a financial adviser at the t rowe price group inc in baltimore is to pay off the card with the highest interest rate first he also recommends saving at least something for retirement and emergency spending while paying off debt so youll get in the habit of saving cash savings once the credit card debt is gone experts advise saving enough cash to live on for three to six months and to keep it easily available in a money market account for emergencies someone with more financial flexibility who could use a credit card if the car breaks down could set aside less cash but you should save as much as possible if a job loss or other major event could be on the horizon retirement savings once you have a cash cushion you should contribute to your k retirement account as soon as you hit the work force "invest at least to the amount of the company match because thats free money " says ms beckmann most people get their raise in january making this a good time to increase your k contribution before the money even hits your checking account ideally people should be saving at least of their salary for retirement according to financial firms while most investors dont reach the maximum an investor could contribute &# into a k plan which is for people in the private sector or a b plan for those in academia or nonprofits people and older can contribute an extra &# annually to these accounts depending on your tax situation and especially if your employer doesnt offer a pension you should also contribute to an individual retirement account "whatever youre going to do automate it " says mr ritter who teaches a financial planning course at johns hopkins university "if you automate you dont have to think about it every month " college savings its not what parents want to hear but saving for retirement must come before saving for college for the kids thats because there are many ways to pay for college a student could borrow get scholarships or attend a less expensive community college or state university but no one is going to lend you money or give you a scholarship for retirement "retirement is a priority " says ms beckmann "if you need to you can borrow to go to college but you cant borrow for retirement " if you are saving of your salary in a k by all means put some money away for your childrens education the most effective way to save is to contribute after tax income into a state sponsored college savings plan money in these accounts grows tax free and can be withdrawn free of federal tax on investment earnings as long as it is used to pay for higher education more than states also provide tax and other benefits such as a tax deduction for contributions and the fees on many accounts have recently fallen significantly prepaying your mortgage many people find it tempting to prepay their mortgage according to new research though youre probably better off putting that extra money into your k at least up to the maximum matched by your company prepaying is a good idea says greg mcbride senior financial analyst at bankrate com if youre close to retirement or already saving enough for retirement consider prepaying he says "if you are in the latter portion of a mortgage where your interest is no longer enough to justify itemizing your tax deduction " buying insurance if you havent evaluated your insurance coverage in a while do it now home values have soared in recent years make sure that your homeowner and auto policies are up to date and that the deductibles make sense do you have enough life insurance as a general rule of thumb a full time worker with a family should have life insurance equal to six to times salary in recent years the cost of life insurance has dropped significantly especially term life additionally people need to consider whether to buy long term care insurance which can help pay for time spent in nursing or assisted living care estate planning no matter the size of your estate its important to update your will to ensure that your wishes are carried out that means you also should have a durable power of attorney and a health care power of attorney which authorizes someone to make medical decisions if you cant make them yourself planning ahead also saves time and money for your heirs make sure the beneficiary designations and titling on your bank brokerage and retirement accounts are up to date because its not unusual for someone to accidentally leave something to an ex spouse
