in the fray why mcgwire struck out at cooperstown the only court that mark mcgwire will ever face concerning his suspected use of anabolic steroids ruled against him on tuesday fair or not the outcome was inevitable structured by the slugger himself mr mcgwire was dubbed baseballs savior when in playing for the st louis cardinals he defeated sammy sosa of the chicago cubs in a season long home run hitting contest the game had been in a slump since a strike canceled the post season including the world series and messrs mcgwire and sosa were the feel good story that drew the fans back mr mcgwire was gracious in victory posing with family members of roger maris the player who held the previous record of for years maris had died in mr mcgwires fall from grace was actually foreshadowed earlier in when a jar of androstenedione considered a steroid precursor was discovered in his locker slowly but relentlessly rumors began to swirl that at least part of his strength came from drugs but that was before more reports of steroid use hit baseball and national pressure forced the problem into the public consciousness he did nothing to help his own case when in he told the u s house government reform committee "i am not here to talk about the past " bad move mr mcgwire is smart enough to know that baseball and its fans worship the games past the past fills record books and grants immortality through entry into the hall of fame but it was not his words that doomed mr mcgwire it was the bond of trust he violated admittedly this is a gray area he never tested positive for any banned substance baseball did not test players in his day there wasnt even a specific rule against using steroids only a policy against illegal drug use androstenedione or andro until was classified by the fda as a dietary supplement and not an illegal drug but it was known to add strength and thus was banned by the ioc the nfl and the ncaa the mcgwire matter as with every other athlete suspected of using performance enhancing drugs goes to the very heart of sports the assumption that every competitor achieves his or her results from hard work and natural skill not from trickery this is especially true in baseball where the records of achievement are close to sacred the most tackles made or touchdowns scored in football are known only by aficionados while every kid grows up knowing that babe ruth hit home runs in one season and roger maris hit now barry bondss pursuit of hank aarons career record of is big news we as fans need to know that these records were set honestly maybe more now than ever before we are bombarded by news stories of corporate heads and politicians who dance around the truth or look us straight in the camera lens and lie by coaches who swear they are not leaving for a better job one day and then scoot out the back door the next we need to know that at least in sports games governed by rules designed to keep everybody playing under the same conditions we can trust that what we see with our own eyes was fairly achieved that is what those hall of fame voters were saying on tuesday they believed that cal ripken jr played in all those consecutive games for all those seasons fairly and that tony gwynn had won all those batting titles honestly they questioned that mark mcgwire had accomplished his exploits under the same conditions trust in the integrity of the game is all that separates sports from the show business spectacle that it daily threatens to become we can stand for choreographed introductions of players sculptured cheerleaders and dramatically produced half time shows if we believe that at least between the lines the game itself is honest that the team that won actually won and we need to know on those magical occasions when a player without a history of performing herculean feats lifts himself or herself to do something really great that only muscle and heart made it happen when an average pitcher throws a brilliant game the way that don larsen did when he pitched a perfect game in the world series or when ryan howard clubbed home runs for philadelphia in the most since bonds hit in we need to know that we can cheer instead of immediately suspecting that hes done something terribly wrong hollywood can produce fairy tale endings but nothing thrills more than athletes beating the odds anyone who watched boise states football team complete its improbably undefeated season by beating mighty oklahoma in overtime in this seasons fiesta bowl knows this sports can hold the special place in our hearts that it does only if the games are honest on tuesday only of the voters said that they believed that mr mcgwire deserved to be in the hall of fame thats and far short of the needed for induction mr ripken was named on of the ballots mr gwynn on these are great numbers for great players and a testament to the way they played this was not a legal decision we may never know if mr mcgwire cheated but in the eyes of the public and on the ballots of those sports writers there was enough question to keep him out of the hall of fame he will be judged again next year and the year after that and some voters may change their minds but i doubt if enough will to make a difference in the court of public opinion the heroics of mark mcgwire will forever be questioned and in the world of sports ultimately that is the only court that matters once fans stop believing in the game its only a show mr rozin writes about sports for the journal see related letter "letters to the editor how breach of trust diminished baseball" wsj jan
