in baghdad slum sectarian strife is also childs play war games are part of life for little hassoni hussein a shiite in sadr city now baghdad iraq a year ago a young gunman walked into ali husseins living room and drew a weapon the intruders head was wrapped in a scarf leaving a narrow slit for his eyes his clothes were all black the favorite attire of a powerful shiite muslim militia he introduced himself as a commander shouted the incantation "god is greater" and warned sunni muslims not to fight back with that he raised his plastic pistol the gunmans name is hassoni and he was only years old at the time the scene unfolded in his fathers house in baghdads sadr city slum a sprawling shiite muslim district stretching toward the eastern edge of the iraqi capital "i was happy to see him this way because it means he has courage " mr hussein said of his son since then hassonis favorite game has grown more elaborate migrating from the living room onto the neighboring streets drawing in other children and increasingly emulating the violent world of the adults as iraq careers toward full scale civil war between its shiite majority and sunni minority the culture of celebrating sectarian strife has taken root even among the very young in sadr city home to more than two million people the baghdad district is the stronghold of the mahdi army a shiite militia blamed for abducting and killing sunnis but to sadr city residents the mahdi army is a revered self defense force the only group they see as capable of preventing wholesale slaughter of shiites at the hands of sunni extremists shiite politicians blame atrocities against sunnis on rogue forces that falsely claim to represent the real mahdi army the celebration of sectarian violence is widespread here some militia leaders have acquired almost mythical status including abu dera an elusive gangster alleged to be behind some of the worst sectarian killings of sunnis in the lore of the streets abu dera and other fighters are zorro like figures who strike into the heart of sunni neighborhoods dispense swift revenge and return home unharmed hassoni who is now spends hours listening to such tales in his familys grocery store where customers routinely trade stories real and imagined of shiite militias fighting sunni insurgents abu dera became his hero and his father has helped encourage the adulation by playing songs on his stereo extolling the valor of shiite gunmen "abu dera is trying to kill the bad guys " said mr hussein who works as a security guard at the ministry of education and sometimes helps patrol his neighborhood a friendly boy with striking brown eyes and neatly combed hair falling over his forehead hassoni says he wants to grow up to be powerful enough to have a big car and armed guards surrounding him when he plays with friends the boys divide themselves into two groups one shiite and the other sunni and shoot at each other with pellet guns lurking behind cars and in roadside ditches "kids always refuse to be sunnis but because they need to play some of them have to pretend to be sunnis " said mr hussein who often watches his sons hours long battles using trash the children erect their own barricades hassoni likes to pretend to be abu dera and calls himself the leader of the gang other members include a boy nicknamed bush senior for his foreign looking red hair hassoni often returns home with torn clothes and pellet bruises a few blocks away qassim abdul ridha a father of four said his year old son karar and his gang fight street battles against other children often sending a girl to scout out the rivals hiding places chanting "muqtada" in homage to muqtada al sadr the powerful shiite cleric who leads the mahdi army the boys try to capture their opponents toy guns as trophies the real mahdi army is always nearby to provide inspiration sometimes hassoni hangs around grown up gunmen manning the real roadblocks and runs errands for them such as bringing them food and drink he also gathers war stories and then breathlessly relays them to his parents the latest tale hassoni heard on the street involved a group of shiite gunmen who mounted a rescue mission of shiite hostages held by sunni extremists the gunmen ended up kidnapping the kidnappers and brought them to sadr city "hes very excited always smiling when he tells us these stories " his father said one day hassoni brought home a steel pipe he found in a garbage dump and declared it to be a rocket launcher which he was going to use to fire mortars at sunni neighborhoods much as real militiamen do asked recently what he thinks of sunnis he answered with one word "terrorists " together with other children hassoni fills empty bottles with sand and sticks a twig in them to resemble a fuse the bottles serve as make believe bombs for use against imaginary sunnis or american patrols hassonis arsenal of toy guns has grown from one plastic pistol to include two ak models and a sniper rifle with a scope now his favorite weapon mr hussein gave him the rifle as a gift at the end of the fasting month of ramadan when iraqi families exchange presents hassoni was so excited his father says that he paid no attention to a toy train and a toy piano given to him by his mother and aunt the black life size rifle looks completely real the line between the game and real life has grown increasingly blurry in late november suspected sunni insurgents detonated five car bombs inside sadr city killing shiite civilians the bloodiest attack since the u s invasion in the blasts occurred just over a mile from mr husseins house and hassoni saw the black plumes of smoke later that evening hassoni and other children patrolled their street looking for strangers hassoni started saying things like "sunnis hate us and dont want us to be anywhere near them " his father said a few days later hassoni and his gang spotted a boy they didnt know they stopped him and demanded to know what he was doing on their street "i heard the mahdi army saying that if you see strangers ask them where they come from and what they are doing here " he said "and that kid was not from our area " when the boy tried to run away hassoni and his friends caught him and beat him up later it turned out that the boy and his parents all shiites were visiting relatives on hassonis street "we had a lot of problems with our neighbors because of this fight " mr hussein recalled he said he sat his son down for a talk telling him it is wrong to attack other boys hassoni promised to behave but said he will continue looking for strangers on his street
