the daily fix duke and uconn stumble while iu and uk soar with the preliminaries done the college hoops season is turning to conference rivalries and among the traditional powers contenders are being sorted from pretenders surprisingly duke so far has shaken out into the second category dropping its first two acc games espn coms mark schlabach says the problem begins at the point where sophomore greg paulus has struggled in his second season but sportslines gary parrish argues that the problem runs deeper duke despite all its former mcdonalds all americans simply isnt that talented uconn another perennial power dropped to in the big east after falling to marquette the huskies first home loss in nearly two years "team embryo never looked younger " jeff jacobs writes in the hartford courant "there were double dribbles there were passes off hands there were guys refusing to shoot just as against lsu there were guys blowing layups there was an up and down call for cryin out loud and how often do you see that in a game beyond the cyo level " in contrast kentucky has won its two sec openers by a combined points against ole miss and auburn "it just so happens the way the cats early conference schedule has fallen the marquee monsters in americas best league are down the road " john clay writes in the lexington herald leader "first on the calendar are the conferences lesser lights those pesky bottom feeders who pray they can catch someone fat and sassy or snoozing or peering ahead ask tennessee the vols lost at vanderbilt last night " indiana ran out to its second straight big victory by a combined points after a point win against purdue last night so rousing that students cheer of "stand up old people stand up old people " got the adult fans on their feet "in fact they stomped roared waved their arms and celebrated the kind of victory that reminds people of the energy that can percolate in this place " rick bozich writes in the louisville courier journal none of those four teams made sports illustrated college hoops writer grant wahls list of the eight teams from which he guarantees the national champ will emerge he has a record of six for seven in prior magic eight lists see who mr wahl picked on si com an ncaa panel is urging womens teams to stop using men as sparring partners in practices as many basketball teams do amy merrick profiled some of these male players last march in the print journal cincinnati post columnist lonnie wheeler decries the decision both because male practice players can help the womens teams and because of the effect the experience has on the men "very possibly some of the practice players having been changed by their associations with female athletes and edified by their exposure to the inner workings of a collegiate program will pursue a career track of coaching girls or women " mr wheeler writes "very certainly many will become fathers of daughters who will benefit from their dads extracurricular educations in such ways the game will continue to advance " why arent columnists in kentucky up in arms about the departure of coach bobby petrino to the atlanta falcons because athletic director tom jurich is sticking around "if the university of louisville had to lose half of its dynamic duo the cardinals lost robin and retained batman " mr bozich writes doing fix double duty mr jurich hired steve kragthorpe from tulsa less than hours after mr petrino left new york columnists are more upset that their giants didnt lose their coach the embattled tom coughlin "somehow they extend the coachs contract one more year in the big blue belief that his vision of a better tomorrow is a lot less blurry than it turned out to be this season " steve serby writes in the new york post "it is a doomsday scenario giving the very players who refuse to rally around him enough rope to hang him " but the newark star ledgers jerry izenberg preaches patience "start with the first fact there is really nobody out there to hire at this time " mr izenberg writes "next year should coughlin fail there will be multiple choices " david beckham will turn down offers to stay at real madrid and to return to englands premiership choosing instead to take a deal in the u s the times of londons matt hughes reports his times colleague rick broadbent says the move makes sense "beckham has a football academy in los angeles and would relish the lifestyle he would also be free of the cynicism and criticism that have threatened to undermine his status as a very good footballer and the united states would welcome him in a way that italy or england could never do " in beckhams homeland there is no bcs the original football playoff began there years ago pitting teams of every rank against each other as rob hughes points out in the international herald tribune genuine upsets in the fa cup persist and are its magic and if swansea can win at the home of sheffield united why cant boise state beat florida the national soccer team is one of iraqs few unifying forces today the toronto stars kirk semple writes after the sides surprising run to the asian games finals last month "during each match involving the iraqi squad work ground to a halt across iraq as people gathered around televisions " mr semple writes adding "soccer has become an escape from the uncertainty and violence of life a source of camaraderie and even a binding force of nationalism in a country riven by sectarianism " when columnists make mistakes the clever ones reap new columns out of their apologies shortly after trading allen iverson to denver the philadelphia ers bought out the remaining years on chris webbers contract ending a failed hoops experiment two years ago philadelphia daily news columnist john smallwood applauded the move "to make matters worse i also said the move instantly made the sixers the favorite to win the atlantic division and proclaimed that the iverson webber combination would make them serious contenders for the nba eastern conference championship for the next several seasons " mr smallwood writes "less than years later iverson has been shipped to the rocky mountains to play for the denver nuggets kings career is hanging on the whim of bouncing ping pong balls and webber apparently is about to be paid close to &# million simply to go away " the orlando sentinels david whitley saw his prediction go bust much faster on sunday he wrote "after a week of intense film study breaking down depth charts and drinking margaritas by the pool ive yet to find a reason to pick against ohio state " today a sheepish mr whitley writes "who knew florida intentionally had kept its scores down all year who knew troy smith would play like troy mcclure who knew ted ginns teammates would maim him while celebrating his opening kickoff return " sentinel columnist mike bianchi knew making the gaffe hurt even more mr whitley writes last week green bay press gazette columnist scott venci fired up by the story of a local prep athlete busted on a dui after being suspended from his team for drinking called on high schools to adopt a zero tolerance policy to drugs and alcohol mr venci was overwhelmed with reader response which he sums up this week "many remarked on the parents role we live in a community that almost takes pride in its drinking how many times
