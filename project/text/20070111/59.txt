how wall street sweeps the cash investors idle money is a brokerage firm bonanza the phrase "cash sweep" may sound like a cleaning crew gathering loose change but on wall street the top brokerage firms are increasingly turning cash sweeps into gold the blue chip securities firms are reaping bigger profits from a few simple changes to how investors idle cash balances are treated and most investors either dont notice or dont care that wall streets gains are coming at their expense as brokers turn around and reinvest the money for their own benefit at a higher rate merrill lynch &amp co which pioneered such tactics starting in is expected to report next week that its profits derived mainly from reinvesting customers cash will top &# billion for up from &# billion two years ago last year morgan stanley ramped up the same strategy of "sweeping" client cash to insured bank deposits which pay rates as low as on the smallest accounts and the smith barney unit of citigroup inc in september also began paying rates as low as for cash in smaller accounts smith barney had considered such moves earlier but hesitated because its former chief executive sallie krawcheck who led the firm between and raised questions about whether such "tiering" tactics could hurt customers according to people at citigroup this year the firm decided it couldnt afford to pass up the profits and risk being left at a competitive disadvantage other people said in a statement smith barney said it shifted "to a relationship based offering" that included "clear and abundant client disclosure " the firm said it offers rates "among the most competitive in the industry " and clients have "ample" alternatives regulators at the new york stock exchange warned firms and investors in that such programs risked being instituted "without fully appropriate levels of disclosure or customer consent " bank deposits are more profitable for wall street because they can be reinvested at profits of roughly three to four times the fees on money funds but the bank deposits where the money is swept all pay less than annually for the smallest accounts far below current money fund rates of where wall street firms could put clients idle cash merrill has about &# billion in bank deposits which pay as little as for small brokerage accounts last year morgan stanleys total deposits rose to &# billion from just &# billion in james gorman who helped establish merrills program as a top executive of its brokerage force took the top brokerage job at morgan stanley last march analysts estimate that such bank sweeps can be reinvested at a profit of to of balances by comparison fees and expenses for taxable money market funds currently average of assets according to imoneynet a newsletter publisher in westborough mass "one of the questions that has come up is why customers would put up with this " says connie bugbee managing editor of imoneynet she believes one answer is the inattention of customers who focus instead on which stocks to buy or sell indeed brokerage executives say their own soundings confirm investors generally arent focused or overly concerned about rates they receive on cash balances take wachovia corp its brokerage pays just on bank sweep cash for accounts with under &# in assets and for accounts under &# while accounts with over &# million get joe nadreau director of client strategy acknowledges the lower rates are "beneficial" to wachovia but notes they are just one element of its fees and costs in "the whole competitive fee landscape" in which larger accounts are inherently more profitable one person familiar with merrills decision to move uninvested funds to bank deposits starting in said it was inspired partly by a strategy pursued even earlier by discount broker charles schwab corp schwab had used its own interest bearing account effectively a schwab iou as an alternative to money market funds for client cash earning a profit by reinvesting the funds at higher rates currently schwab and other online brokers earn more in interest income from cash balances and margin loans than from commissions amid the regulatory prodding some firms send clients brochures about their sweep programs that include some cautions but readers have to look closely to discern that they may suffer financially the merrill lynch disclosure for example carries the bland headline "timely reminder concerning yields on deposits with the merrill lynch banks and certain investment alternatives " it says rates are "tiered" without saying plainly that small accounts get less but it says the deposits are "financially beneficial" to merrill lynch and a table indicates that accounts with less than &# will receive just and rates of up to are available in money funds if clients speak with their broker a merrill spokesman said the tiers are part of "relationship pricing which rewards those clients with larger asset bases for consolidating all of their business with the firm the process is transparent and fully disclosed in writing to clients " although the interest profits add up to a big number at merrill they are small for most of the firms millions of brokerage clients said one person at the firm its brokers are "encouraged" to discuss higher interest options "to meet specific client needs " a merrill spokesman said a disclosure by wachovia starts out upbeat saying its cash sweep "allows you to earn a return on the uninvested cash balances for which no interest is otherwise earned or paid " but its fourth paragraph is a little more blunt wachovia it warns "may seek to pay as low a rate as possible "
