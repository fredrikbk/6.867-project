india cellphone shares may gain from bidding for hutchison essar telecoms potential in nation is object of global interest mumbai india the brewing bidding war for indias fourth largest wireless company by subscribers hutchison essar could have the side effect of lifting the share prices of indias only publicly traded cellular companies bharti airtel and reliance communications international and indian cellular companies and private equity investors have long been waiting for a chance to bid for all or part of hutchison essar which isnt publicly traded the company is owned by hutchison telecommunications international a unit of hong kong tycoon li ka shings flagship hutchison whampoa which has said it is considering selling its stake indias essar group a conglomerate with businesses ranging from steel to refining owns the other the list of potential acquirers includes indias second largest wireless operator reliance communications as well as vodafone group of the united kingdom essar group also has said it would like to buy hutchisons stake in their joint venture yesterday the board of reliance reaffirmed the companys interest in buying hutchison essar and authorized its chairman anil ambani to raise the money and do the negotiating needed to bid meanwhile vodafone chief executive arun sarin said his company had begun due diligence on a bid to acquire hutchisons stake and indicated vodafone is willing to link up with local players for a larger presence in the indian market analysts say the competition to purchase hutchisons controlling stake could push the value of the entire company to &# billion to &# billion any deal in that range would confirm the rising international interest in indian cellular companies which in turn should eventually lead to higher share prices for other indian companies said priyanko panja vice president of edelweiss securities in mumbai "it should positively reflect" on bhartis and reliance communications stock prices he said pushing them up as much as in the next months if a big ticket deal goes through he said he didnt have specific target prices for the two companies shares by almost any valuation measure a price above &# billion for hutchison essar would value the company at a large premium to bharti and reliance both of which have larger networks in india bharti is the largest operator now a &# billion bid for example would value hutchison essar at about times expected earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda according to analysts by comparison bharti and reliance are valued at about times ebitda each analysts say of course it is possible hutchison essar wont fetch as much as anticipated still many analysts believe the company will sell for at least &# billion largely because they anticipate that bidders are willing to pay a premium to capture some of the long term growth in indias rapidly expanding cellular market if reliance wins a bidding war for hutchison essar and if it pays a high price more than &# billion the acquisition could prove a double edge sword for its shareholders they might like the companys greatly enhanced role in the indian cellular market but they also might think reliance overpaid for it in which case the share price could fall "if the bidding takes the price to new levels whosoever takes it is going to get hammered" in the stock market said arun kejriwal director of kejriwal research &amp investment services in mumbai still the international interest in hutchison essar reflects optimism for the telecommunications industry in india overall india has the worlds fastest growing cellular services industry as it adds more than five million new subscribers each month no matter which company buys hutchison essar or even if the owners decide not to sell that growth wont slow anytime soon analysts assert "this is what happens in every mobile telecom industry in the world consolidation " said jon thorn fund manager in hong kong of india capital fund "it usually comes down to two or three players and the only surprising thing is that it has taken this long to happen in india " this month both bharti and reliance are expected to announce strong earnings growth for the quarter ended dec in the previous quarter reliance recorded a profit of billion rupees &# million after a year earlier loss of million rupees for the same three months bhartis profit surged to billion rupees the two companies shares have outperformed the broader indian market since mid bharti has climbed since the end of june while reliance
