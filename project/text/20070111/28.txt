can delta win battle to keep flying solo continental ex chief bethune could play a pivotal role in fate of delta and industry retired airline chief executive gordon bethune became an icon of the aviation industry when he turned around failing continental airlines inc in the s now he is emerging with a pivotal role in determining the fate of delta air lines inc and whether a wave of airline mergers could be on the horizon the official committee of delta air lines creditors who will decide whether delta emerges from bankruptcy court protection as an independent company or as part of another airline recently hired mr bethune to help them examine their options accept a hostile merger bid from us airways group inc support a plan by deltas management to emerge from bankruptcy as a stand alone carrier or push for additional bidders and hold a de facto auction for the atlanta airline in an interview mr bethune was adamant that he hasnt reached a conclusion and must still thoroughly assess the scenarios and answer creditors questions before weighing in with a final opinion still he made clear he believes consolidation is needed "the industry is dysfunctional theres really no reason to have airlines and there ought to be more stability for people like boeing and airbus youve got lots of competition and do you really need that much " mr bethune said in the interview on friday following his appointment that became official late last week "everybody can write a plan can you really implement it successfully thats what im being asked to answer " known best for steering the dramatic turnaround of continental airlines in the s after painful mergers bankruptcy and union management strife the year old mr bethune remains a respected and influential force after six years with aircraft maker boeing co where he served as a vice president and general manager of customer services and oversaw the manufacturing for the and airplanes mr bethune joined continental as president and chief operating officer in early he retired from the houston airline years later as chairman and ceo and has since been acting as an industry consultant while serving on several boards including aloha airlines of hawaii where he is chairman and prudential financial inc and honeywell international corp his presence already is having an impact in the delta matter at a three hour meeting with us airways executives in new york monday the notoriously blunt consultant urged the airline to put forth its best offer for creditors to review according to people who were in the meeting or briefed on it yesterday us airways raised its bid to a total of &# billion in stock and cash up from &# billion based on yesterdays closing stock price in a revised offer made early in the morning ahead of a regularly scheduled delta creditors meeting mr bethune also met with delta executives late last week to review their stand alone plan and then with the delta creditors committee at yesterdays meeting people who have met with mr bethune in recent days say he has indicated he thinks a delta merger with us airways makes sense and could win antitrust approval from u s regulators yesterday other people familiar with the situation said delta and northwest airlines corp have had regular contact for months about a possible combination though the discussions remain preliminary the sweetened offer was well received by delta creditors said one person familiar with the creditors reaction "its a significant increase in value that changes the dynamic " this person said creditors now plan to pressure delta to consider opening its books to us airways as well as other potential bidders this person said separately an unofficial committee of delta creditors representing about banks and hedge funds is urging delta to "immediately" allow us airways access to deltas books for review according to a statement the group is also urging delta to be open to transactions with other airlines that may be superior to deltas stand alone plan both northwest and delta said yesterday that they dont comment on rumors and speculation northwest told its employees that while it remains focused on completing its reorganization and leaving bankruptcy court protection in the second quarter it "is monitoring developments in the airline industry and is committed to acting in the best interest of all of its constituents " if mr bethune recommends the merger with us airways and creditors take heed to pressure deltas management into a deal a domino effect of industry consolidation will likely follow and reshape the industry for consumers airline employees and creditors in years to come already the merger of us airways and america west in late has put pressure on airlines to consider consolidation to remain competitive that consideration has gained strength since us airways made a public bid for delta nov indeed exploratory merger talks between the united airlines unit of ual corp and continental airlines gained more urgency once us airways disclosed its bid if mr bethune takes a different path and convinces creditors to vote for a delta standalone plan airlines are more likely to stay put with the industry remaining as it is oversupplied and fragmented according to many industry officials including mr bethune himself whatever happens mr bethune says big airlines should marry partners that add complementary routes in other parts of the world "you dont put all your eggs in one basket " he said adding that when europe is doing poorly latin america may boom and vice versa "airlines need to get some scale that allows them to become more stable and not live or die on the next snowstorm " he said he cautions that it is a big mistake to marry the wrong partner and gives us airways ceo doug parker credit for merging america west with us airways to boost the two airlines chances of survival he says delta has "come a long way" since it filed for bankruptcy court protection in and is delivering on what it has said it would some in the industry have suspected mr bethune was hired as cover to justify a creditors committee bias toward a delta stand alone plan that belief is rooted in part in mr bethunes history with delta he used to work for delta ceo gerald grinstein at western airlines in the s and considers mr grinstein a "good friend" and "classy guy " "he still calls me oc for oil can and i call him grindstone " said mr bethune who was vice president of maintenance at the time mr bethune dismisses the notion that his ties to mr grinstein will influence his recommendation now noting that the two had a run in in the late s when mr bethune approached mr grinstein about continental merging with delta and mr grinstein said he would fight against that mr bethune says his approach to reviewing deltas current situation will be to assess the probability of success or lack thereof on various components of the competing plans such as whether revenue and cost savings projections can realistically be achieved whether antitrust obstacles are realistic and whether plans for handling union integration are achievable the committee then will have to decide whether or not to push delta management into opening up the companys books for us airways or any others to study the committee doesnt have to follow mr bethunes advice he makes the point that the level of risk he might personally be willing to take may not be the same the creditors would take financial advisers and lawyers for deltas creditors committee approached mr bethune in recent weeks after the committee found a "pressing need" for an airline consultant with broad experience his perspective "will be of critical importance in understanding the short and long term effects that any transaction proposal and or plan of reorganization may have " the committee said in a document filed with the bankruptcy court mr bethune will receive &# for the first days of consulting work and &# more for every days of future service up to &# million according to a court document after that the committee would need to seek further consent from debtors or a bankruptcy court order to exceed that amount mr parker said mr bethunes arrival in the process is like a breath of fresh air "frankly it was refreshing to present the merger plan to someone who really understands how this works we had a nice dialogue " he said of us airwayss monday meeting with mr bethune mr bethune isnt shy about his pro consolidation stance or the role he believes it should play in the industrys future "i have been a proponent of stabilizing the industry by consolidating " he said he partially blames airline executives for the industrys current problems "the barrier to consolidation has been as much testosterone as it is the government " he said referring to airline executives who cant decide which ceo and management teams will run a combined carrier "somebodys got to leave thats always a big impediment to consolidation " consolidation done well enables airlines to achieve cost savings and increased revenue by rationalizing their fleets and saving on overhead by getting rid of duplicate costs mr bethune envisions an industry that has fewer carriers not only for profitabilitys sake but also to create a stable industry in which employees can work pensions can be provided and creditors like boeing and pratt &amp whitney can avoid getting less than full payment from airlines that file for bankruptcy court protection he thinks his vision is attainable if the government permits it "logic needs to prevail " he said susan carey and corey dade contributed to this article see related story "carrier talks with northwest mounts lobbying campaign as us airways
