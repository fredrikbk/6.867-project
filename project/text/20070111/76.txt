middle seat mailbox when customer service goes missing it wasnt weather that stranded flight but americans misfiring corporate culture storms pound a big hub airport and planes end up scattered at smaller airports around the region in austin texas one diverted flight sits on the tarmac for eight hours with no water no food and overflowing toilets the problem chronicled in this weeks middle seat wasnt with the unpredictable weather the problem was how american airlines handled the plane on the ground this wasnt a story about the "perfect storm " but about corporate cultures that dont put customer service first readers got that many were outraged at americans performance you didnt have to be on that flight to feel the pain of those passengers some had stories of their own about similar though less severe travel messes on lots of different air carriers and lots of readers raised good questions about the current state of air travel in the u s but before we get to that let me offer a postscript of my own airlines and the federal aviation administration have to figure out a better way to handle weather disruptions this isnt a new problem but it does seem to be getting worse why not have adequate stashes of food and water at airports likely to get flights diverted from big hubs why not have a standing deal with an airport caterer or pizza delivery firm or wal mart to provide food and water to stranded planes why not limit the number of hours passengers are forced to sit in by inches of space why cant the faa allow planes to go to a gate for a bathroom break without losing their place in line for a landing slot at their destination why does going to a gate end a pilots duty day when sitting in a plane parked on the ramp doesnt cant the faa change rules to improve life for passengers ive asked and will let you know when the faa has answers why not acknowledge that airlines like department stores do a lot of business at the holidays and staff accordingly at all levels of the company from airport station managers to top executives you think retailers let their sales people take vacation on christmas eve and why not apologize publicly and meaningfully to all your customers and employees when your airline messes up like this several readers asked whether the dec breakdown at american was the result of the low fare travel market consumers enjoy some airline employees bitter over wage cuts pension cancellations and layoffs suggested that consumers have only themselves to blame by always chasing a cheaper price as always letters have been edited ken mills "perhaps the american flight saga is a sensational example of what happens when the value of something goods service etc is lost when the consumer only seeks the lowest cost when the travel consumer wants to fly for low to no fare sorry you get what you dont pay for " mike brickman "maybe its time we realize that the free market isnt a good fit for such an economic staple as air travel " richard ranger said hes seen a similar pattern in the energy industry with staff cuts taking a vicious toll on quality "the repetitive cycle of staff cuts sends the message that employees are costs not assets leadership attention to reconstituting the workforce as a team is seldom as focused as the attention given to plotting the next round of cuts employees receive the message that inaction is a safer course than action and that individual decisions should be avoided that may present a risk of incurring unapproved costs " that path he added "sets companies up for a fall " personally i dont think this is a low fare issue it is as mr ranger suggests a management issue theres no doubt that layoffs have hurt the ability of some airlines to respond to a disruption and older airlines continue to struggle to adapt to new realities but as travel has rebounded its managements job to keep the airline functioning well this past year we didnt see that happen at several big airlines that have gone through massive cost cutting business is better but baggage handling worsened more flights were late and customer complaints increased besides the northwest airlines seven hour fiasco after a detroit snowstorm was in one of the most profitable years ever for airlines fares were high then but was customer service any better what seems upside down in the airline industry is that low fare airlines often score much higher in customer satisfaction surveys than many bigger competitors with higher ticket prices the low cost carriers have cultures that foster strong customer service employees are friendly helpful and expected to fix customer problems when they arise employees are rewarded for going above and beyond normal procedure coming up with creative solutions or showing compassion that wins customer loyalty southwest airlines makes all employees capitalize the word "customer" in everything they write hokey you bet but it sends a message customers are important lincoln connolly was flying from boston to fort lauderdale on jetblue airways on dec when the flight was delayed three hours by a mechanical problem when passengers finally lined up to board "the jetblue gate agents announced that they were sorry for the delays and gate switch and that wed all be receiving a &# voucher i responded to laughter around me there must be some mistake airlines dont apologize customer service counts and the legacy airlines just dont get it " bob hamel "i had a similar experience with southwest last summer sat in chicago for five hours to go to detroit the difference was southwest sent me two &# vouchers and a letter of apology in this case it wasnt even their fault it was the weather " deborah fickling got stranded in houston on the same day that lots of flights to albuquerque n m were grounded "in my travels from houston to las vegas to phoenix and finally to albuquerque southwest staff took care of me and made sure i was as comfortable as possible despite the long lines and what i was sure had been long hours for them yeah there were a couple of glitches but these were taken care of in a manner that definitely put the customers needs first finally southwest staff never seemed to lose what i consider to be one of the best things about flying southwest a great sense of humor even when they may have been laughing just to keep from crying " have a question about
