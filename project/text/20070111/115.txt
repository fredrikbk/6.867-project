the hardest price in capitalism up " "down" or "sideways" would seem to exhaust the possible range of responses to the inevitable new years question "whither interest rates " but the forthright forecaster has a better answer "havent a clue " hell say you will scan the forbes in vain for the names of the captains of the interest rate forecasting industry the omission speaks volumes just answering correctly the simple question "up" or "down" over a couple of moderately volatile years in the financial futures markets would put a successful forecaster in the way of untold wealth yet try as they might the economists cant seem to get fabulously rich its not for lack of attention to detail "up" or "down" isnt good enough for them they want to tell you what a particular rate will be on a certain date and they want to give it to you to the second decimal place to the right of zero "yields on two year notes the most closely linked to the feds benchmark will fall to percent from percent as of a m in new york today " bloomberg news reported on the first business day of the new year "ten year note yields will end at percent down from percent today " bloomberg was reporting on a new years survey of government bond dealers so called primary dealers because they are licensed to trade with the federal reserve it happens every year journalists call up the dealers and the dealers come to the phone the journalists know that the dealers dont really know nobody could but the dealers pretend the ritual lives on because people crave certainty especially where its inherently unavailable many years ago lee w minton jr a philadelphia bond investor shook his head over these futile exercises in soothsaying "the hardest price in capitalism " he said about the particular interest rate over which he was then puzzling but wisely had no expectation of forecasting predicting the track of interest rates sounds easy enough determine the supply of and demand for lendable funds estimate their rate of change fix the point at which they will intersect that is the future rate of interest of course there are other small considerations including the world wide demand for dollars the inflation rate the unemployment rate the economic growth rate monetary policy and fiscal policy not to mention the vagaries of human perception the phobias and certainties of fixed income investors are forever changing a rise in the cpi for example is compatible with many different government bond yields in a inflation rate provoked a panicked run up to people doubted that the cpi would long remain so well behaved it had reached double digits in the s or that once it flared anew paul a volcker then the fed chairman would have the heart to beat it down again on the other hand a virtually identical inflation rate in october was compatible with a bond yield of only people just knew that inflation was dead but that if by chance it wasnt there was no better man than alan greenspan "the maestro " to bury it again not everyone puts stock in these errant forecasts value investors famously dont they buy or dont buy the security in front of them what may or may not be coming down in the macroeconomic pike is irrelevant to them as protection against the kind of accident that always seems to catch wall street unawares they insist on investing at low prices in the absence of such opportunities they sit on their wallets so the question that a disciple of benjamin graham would ask about interest rates is not "where are they going " but rather "are they high enough to provide a margin of safety if just this once everything in the macroeconomy doesnt go exactly according to plan " the answer is probably no interest rates are low and the premium of risky rates to government rates is tight true long dated u s government bond rates have been much lower than they are today since in fact they have averaged just but up until there was no federal reserve in that halcyon time prices tended to fall in peacetime and rise in wartime or when new gold discoveries augmented the worlds monetary base as they did after since the institution of the fed inflation has been the rule in peace as in war and since when the dollar was cut loose from the last frayed hawsers of the gold standard long term treasury yields have averaged a sizable premium to todays i dont say that bond yields wont go down and i dont say they wont go up they can go anywhere except that is where the consensus of expert opinion insists they will mr grant is the editor of grants interest rate observer
