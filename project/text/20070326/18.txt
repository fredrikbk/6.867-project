citigroup likely to propose cuts of jobs revamp plan may call for charge of &# billion high stakes for prince citigroup inc executives are putting the finishing touches on a restructuring plan that is likely to involve around job cuts and a charge against earnings of more than &# billion according to people familiar with the matter the stakes are high for citigroup chief executive charles prince who announced a cost cutting review of operations late last year and has billed the outcome as critical to rejuvenating the worlds largest financial services company mr prince is facing mounting pressure from both inside and outside the company to reduce citigroups expenses which are rising at a faster rate than revenue to deliver better financial results and to drive up the companys stagnant stock price the review is being spearheaded by chief operating officer robert druskin who is due to report his recommendations internally by the end of the week the company expects to unveil the plan by the time it reports its first quarter results on april the day before citigroups annual meeting while the plan isnt final mr druskin is contemplating a roughly reduction in citigroups world wide work force of according to people familiar with the matter one possibility is to reduce jobs by not replacing some of the to citigroup employees who leave the company each year one such person said a citigroup spokeswoman said the review is continuing and that the company will announce its plans on or before april the cuts could slice broadly through new york based citigroups global banking empire the company which does business in countries has branches and about million clients citigroup operates a global private bank that caters to wealthy customers it also provides advice on some of the worlds biggest acquisition deals competing with the likes of goldman sachs group inc and morgan stanley last year citigroup expanded its banking and consumer finance operations in emerging markets like mexico india and turkey in his effort to revitalize citigroup mr prince must walk a fine line if he cuts too deeply morale could suffer and he could reduce citigroups growth potential for instance he needs enough offices and people to meet the companys goal of expanding international revenue to of total revenue from a current base of about if he is too conservative in his cuts however he risks angering influential shareholders "whats the balance " said lee delaporte portfolio manager at dreman value management a hedge fund that owns citigroup stock "you dont want to go overboard when youre focusing on expenses at the expense of the future growth of the company " under mr princes predecessor sanford i weill an inveterate deal maker citigroup was a must have financial stock roughly doubling from about &# at the start of to about &# at the end of september when mr prince became ceo over the past year citigroups stock has risen while hometown rival j p morgan chase &amp co s shares gained and bank of america corp s have climbed on friday citigroup shares were down cents at &# in p m new york stock exchange composite trading last summer citigroups largest individual shareholder prince alwaleed bin talal demanded that the company take "draconian" steps to reduce expenses mr prince earlier this year traveled to saudi arabia and met with prince alwaleed at his desert camp in riyadh where they discussed citigroups recent performance the prince said in a statement that "our confidence in citigroup is strong " last year citigroup chalked up about &# billion in operating expenses up from that pace eclipsed citigroups revenue growth the higher expenses stemmed largely from citigroups pouring more money into building new branches and upgrading its technology as it aggressively expanded its presence in asia and latin america last year operating expenses at its giant international consumer arm jumped to &# billion other contributors included increased hiring by citigroups investment bank and higher legal expenses beyond attrition mr prince has pointed to excessive layers of management specifically within citigroups investment bank as a target of possible cuts citigroup has hired consulting firm mercer oliver wyman a division of mercer management consulting inc to assist in the cost review according to people familiar with the matter mercer is looking at all layers of management to identify potential cuts the cuts are emerging at a crucial time within the companys executive suite the bank just hired a new chief financial officer gary crittenden and it is likely that the former american express co finance chief will be asked to weigh in on mr druskins plan that could affect the way the cuts are pitched to the companys board and investors citigroup also is in the process of considering whether to bid for dutch bank abn amro holding nv if a potential bid by british bank barclays plc estimated at &# billion falters executives within citigroup are pushing for the bank to make a bid a decision probably would have to be made within the next several weeks but it could take a back seat to mr princes desire to make the expense reductions a success the restructuring plan isnt confined to paring the work force mr prince has described the review as wide ranging saying that mr druskin is examining to areas for possible cuts one such area citigroups sprawling u s consumer businesses which include its retail banking credit card and consumer finance operations these use a mishmash of technology and back office platforms "we dont need separate middle and back offices for each of our consumer businesses in one country " mr prince said in january at an investor conference mr druskin also is likely to advocate efficient use of the companys real estate that may entail moving some jobs from pricey cities like new york to places where property is less expensive that process is under way citigroup is in the midst of selling an story office building in downtown manhattan and it plans to move at least some of the roughly employees who have worked there across the hudson river to jersey city n j when mr prince announced last year that citigroup would embark on a cost cutting campaign it was in part a nod to the operating environment across the banking industry where interest rate pressures are eroding profit margins and with a growing number of consumers expected to default on loans this year bank profits are likely to suffer more that is prompting banks large and small to undergo extensive cost cutting efforts to make up for sluggish revenue the choice of mr druskin to lead the initiative reflected mr princes confidence in his longtime colleague "ive worked with him so long its hard for me to talk about him objectively " mr prince said at citigroups investor day in december describing mr druskin whom he promoted to chief operating officer as of jan as "a good friend " in the week following the december meeting when messrs prince and druskin detailed their cost cutting ambitions citigroups stock rallied about it has since retreated investors and analysts say they expect the company to forecast eventual savings of about &# billion a year as a result of mr druskins review while that would amount to less than of citigroups expense base it would make a big difference in citigroups quest to post revenue growth that eclipses its growth in costs the time frame for cost savings to trickle down to the bottom line may prove "disappointing to investors hoping that cost saves may materially help" earnings this year and next said john mcdonald an analyst at banc of america securities anton schutz of burnham financial services fund said many shareholders are wondering "when are we going to see a return on our investment why are you guys spending so much and are you spending it unwisely " mr schutz said the cost cutting review is "probably the no priority" for investors who expect citigroup to announce "pretty dramatic" plans next month mr schutzs fund doesnt own citigroup shares but he said he would consider buying them if he is impressed by the restructuring strategy one of mr princes biggest challenges has been to fix an ailing u s consumer business despite being the worlds largest bank in terms of market value citigroup ranked fifth as of june in deposit share behind bank of america j p morgan chase wachovia corp and wells fargo &amp co according to research firm snl financial mr prince has told investors he only has to walk down a street in new york to find at least three out of every four corners of an intersection with a bank branch
