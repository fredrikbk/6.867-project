the daily fix after a series of tough tests talented final four emerges online edition back in november they were ranked in the top eight in all major college basketball polls each had scares during the regular season but managed to enter the ncaa tournament as one of the top eight overall seeds and after four rounds of the tournament that featured plenty of close finishes but no major surprises they have emerged as the most formidable and talented final four in at least a decade georgetown ohio state florida and ucla the nbas new age minimum rule stocked ohio state with talented freshmen but the other three teams dont have a single rookie among their top scorers instead returning talent has buoyed them to next saturdays national semifinals the entire starting five from floridas champion team last year is back and uclas seven top contributors all played significant minutes on last years national runner up florida and ucla are the first duo to return to the final four in consecutive seasons since duke and unlv in and in fact each of the semifinalist slates between and turned over entirely and florida is aiming to become the first team since duke in to repeat as champs see dan shanoffs analysis of the final four here yet this quartet advanced not with inevitability but with grit and some luck georgetown and ohio state who face each other in the first game saturday each have twice just barely dodged elimination a questionable no call and an opposing coachs bad decision helped respectively last years two finalists have had easier routes but nonetheless were challenged mightily in each of their last three games the excitement of the sweet and elite eight in which each of the games was competitive until the final minutes yet nearly every favorite won did not suffice for drew sharp the detroit free press columnist laments the lack of an underdog in atlanta "the tournaments heartbeat is the element of surprise providing the electricity that captivates those who arent huge college basketball fans " mr sharp writes "if you dont recognize the name on the front of the jersey you pull for them like you would the little animal trapped among the tall trees in the forest you know the odds of survival are scarce but its that tiny reserve of possibility that keeps you interested when the ncaa tournament doesnt have that it has nothing the dearth of those upsets and dramatic finishes sapped the event of its soul " pat forde doesnt mind perhaps because hes one of more than people to have correctly predicted the final four on espn com "weve got serious talent and sensational matchups geographic diversity and no landslide favorite from here on in " mr forde writes before running through the storylines and si coms luke winn breaks down the matchups meanwhile philadelphia daily news columnist dick jerardi is already looking ahead "saturdays two ncaa national semifinals at the georgia dome could be a preview of the nba all star game in a few years " mr jerardi writes "depending on how the players on the four teams progress there could be as many as a dozen nba types on the floor and certainly a few all stars " north carolina averages nearly points per game georgetown just over so the pace of yesterdays elite eight matchup between the two teams with a combined points scored appeared to favor unc but georgetown is the nations most efficient offensive team wringing points out of each of its grind it out princeton style possessions the hoyas were trailing with just over six minutes left in the second half "they had no way of knowing it but theyd already started playing the most perfect basketball game of their lives " mike vaccaro writes in the new york post from that point on georgetown outscored north carolina en route to a stunning overtime win georgetowns late spurt was the most remarkable turnaround since a game that came two days earlier when north carolina overcame a point deficit to beat usc and advance to the regional final "after a tip in by deon thompson with remaining in regulation carolina missed of shots over before ty lawson hit a meaningless three with seconds left in overtime " jeff jacobs writes in the hartford courant "lets put it this way if they had blindfolded the heels buried them across the street in giants stadium and put jimmy hoffa in the lineup they only would have made one fewer shot in that span " and so the hoyas advanced with john thompson iii at the helm and patrick ewing jr on the court and both their fathers looking on the elder coach thompson and the elder ewing player won a title together at georgetown and lost a couple of championship games including one years ago to north carolina the records ian oconnor wrote before the game about the "uncommon decency" shown by the two coaches after that memorable title game and that legacy made the postgame scene yesterday "surreal " as si coms luke winn writes and "almost perfect" before the addition to the celebration of the younger thompsons college coach and mentor steve politi writes in the newark star ledger all that history is nice for journalists and fans with long memories but dont think it shaped this years hoyas sally jenkins writes in the washington post "these hoyas were no throwback they owed no debt to the past they are their own creation they are a smart unstintingly disciplined team that never panics and never does anything but play the right way the way they were taught by their dapper and self possessed legacy of a head coach " georgetown doesnt have a monopoly on famous final four fathers of floridas four s the quartet of sophomore starters who returned after last years championship two are sons of former pro basketball players and one is the son of an erstwhile french open winner but tony humphrey after watching his son senior lee humphrey hit seven three pointers to help the gators defeat oregon "was about rows up in the gators section " david whitley writes in the orlando sentinel "a forgotten man and not minding it a bit like father like son " florida times union columnist sam borden says the gators sneakers are different colors but they all danced in rhythm after the win "all different all moving together as one " some kentucky fans might have been rooting for an oregon upset so florida coach billy donovan could focus on rumored interest from uk to replace tubby smith as mentioned in fridays fix mr smith will coach minnesota next year "donovan handed his cell phone to his secretary and said he did not want any calls all weekend " rick bozich writes in the louisville courier journal "he got a message to call his friend and mentor university of louisville coach and former kentucky coach rick pitino donovan said hed try to get to it one day this week " mr smith was weighed down by heavy expectations despite winning a championship with a cast recruited by mr pitino yet ucla coach ben howland has brought the bruins to a second consecutive final four and a rematch with florida despite the presence of legendary former ucla coach john wooden at games and in the minds of every bruin fan "take heart wildcats fans " ann killion writes in the san jose mercury news "if it can happen in westwood it can definitely happen in lexington " star freshmen help as they have in ohio state where greg oden and mike conley jr enjoyed a comparatively easy victory over memphis closer than that score suggests after nearly bowing out in the tournaments prior two rounds sportslines gregg doyel wants to see mr oden step up his game a notch saturday against georgetown "imagine greg oden playing with more passion " mr doyel writes "give him tyler hansbroughs motor give him joakim noahs passion if oden could tap into any of those emotions for minutes he wouldnt be as popular as he is he wouldnt be perceived as this sweet humble kid who happens to be a great player he would be seen as a bully as a monster it would be beautiful " found a good column
