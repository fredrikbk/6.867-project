the afternoon report matters of the heart online edition doctors hoped that a powerful combination of drugs that lower the bad kind of cholesterol while raising the good variety would be a promising new option for heart patients but for now that contender is on the ropes facing the imminent end of patent protection for cholesterol fighter lipitor the worlds top selling drug pfizer sought to shield its rainmaker from the onrush of generic competition by marketing it alongside a new compound known as torcetrapib that would increase good cholesterol the idea generated great excitement with patients and it appeared as though it would give the drug giant a new blockbuster cholesterol combination therapy to offset the eclipse of lipitor but in a huge clinical trial the new compound faltered torcetrapib actually raised blood pressure in some patients not a great thing for a heart treatment to do and pfizer was forced to halt its development late last year today a new study rounded out the grim picture in findings presented to the american college of cardiology meeting in new orleans torcetrapib failed to halt the buildup of plaque in patients arteries even as it lifted good cholesterol steven nissen chief of cardiology at the cleveland clinic and the leader of the study said that the findings "demonstrate the great difficulty in developing therapies to interrupt the atherosclerosis process " doctors and patients worried that the failures of torcetrapib were discouraging signs for other drugs like it but other candidates in the class known as cholesteryl ester transfer protein or cetp inhibitors havent shown the same tendency to increase patients blood pressure and dr nissen said torcetrapibs woes werent cause to toss the entire class onto the scrap heap "you dont want to abandon a class where the first drug you studied had unique toxicities " he told dow jones newswires merck which is developing a cetp inhibitor of its own reiterated that its drug wasnt showing any early signs of raising patients blood pressure and that it wouldnt be appropriate to conclude "that the adverse cardiovascular results seen with torcetrapib will also be seen" with its drug roche holding is also working on a good cholesterol booster and the swiss company said it expects to submit it for approval sometime after both drug makers said they would monitor further data on torcetrapib as they pushed ahead with their own medicines pfizer isnt the only company hoping to draw some new revenue from lipitor merck and schering plough said this morning that once the drug comes off of patent in theyll develop a combination of lipitor and their drug zetia it wouldnt be the first time that merck and schering plough have ridden the coattails of a blockbuster cholesterol fighter thats losing patent protection the companies also co market vytorin a combination of zetia and simvastatin the cholesterol buster that became available generically last year and which is sold by merck as zocor generic zocor has already eaten away at sales of lipitor as health insurers steer patients toward cheaper therapies the companies say that they have studied zetia and lipitor together given as separate pills one study found that the two drugs taken together could lower bad cholesterol by to compared to to for patients who took lipitor alone merck said new home sales disappoint the commerce department said new home sales declined in february to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of the slowest pace in almost seven years at the same time prices increased and inventories climbed economists were quick to blame bad weather for the disappointing reading "based on all of the proxies we look at and the anecdotal information from industry contacts we believe that the recent weakness is mostly weather " wrote stephen stanley of rbs greenwich capital in a note to clients all the same he said economists are likely to be debating the point for months as they wait for more numbers to surface meanwhile he thinks that a sharp drop in housing starts last year will start to show up in these data in the near future "it takes on average six months to build a house and housing starts really downshifted substantially around september october " he wrote there were an estimated homes for sale at the end of february representing a months supply at the current sales rate the highest supply since in january housing numbers no shelter for stocks the sorry looking report on new home sales helped to drag stocks lower this morning as the dow jones industrial
