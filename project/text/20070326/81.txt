foreign workers for highly skilled jobs in the u s central to the issue are h b visas which allow u s companies to temporarily hire college educated foreign workers in fields like engineering and the physical sciences the federal government awards of these work permits a year but u s employers are lobbying congress to lift the cap they believe the current system is too restrictive and complain they cant hire the workers they need critics say too many u s engineers and programmers are out of work robert hoffman an oracle corp executive who heads a tech lobbying group debated the issue with outsourcing critic and author ron hira a professor at the rochester institute of technology heres an excerpt mr hoffman begins americas economy grows and jobs are created when the worlds brightest minds are put to work here in the u s but our immigration laws are literally pushing or keeping this great talent offshore more than half of those who will graduate with masters and ph d s from americas leading universities in math science and engineering are foreign born but this years graduates are almost certain to find themselves unable to apply their knowledge here in the u s because america is expected to run out of its allotment of temporary h b visas in april before these future innovators even graduate meanwhile many working under h b visas have been stuck in legal and professional limbo for roughly six years waiting for permanent visas this is good news only for our competitors overseas its time for congress to reform our temporary and permanent visa programs for highly skilled professionals for one simple reason to secure americas innovative position in the global economy mr hira responds i agree with robert that we should "capture" the best and brightest from overseas as immigrants but hes simply wrong in both his diagnosis of the problems and proposed solutions the employers using the overwhelming number of h bs are offshore outsourcing firms that shuttle foreign workers into the u s to get trained so that they can then take that work back home robert implies that all or most h bs are advanced degree holders and thus the best and brightest but about half of the h b holders have just a bachelors degree and according to the latest government statistics the median wage for new h b holders in computer occupations is far below the median wages
