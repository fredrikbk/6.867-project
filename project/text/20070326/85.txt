telecommunications all in one technology companies dream of one device that can do it all now if only we consumers would get on board two months ago steve jobs stood onstage in san francisco and walked the apple faithful through a demonstration of the companys forthcoming iphone he showed off its bright beautiful touch sensitive screen and bag of associated goodies from a cool voicemail system to an attractive web browser it all looked so elegant and easy more important it played to a fantasy that so many companies have long lusted to fulfill the dream of one device what consumer they figure could resist a gadget that can combine the functions of a cellphone personal digital assistant and digital music player well i can and im not alone the idea of one device that can do it all has attracted a lot of hype over the years only to have the candidates run aground on the rocks of consumer indifference remember the rokr cellphone introduced by motorola inc and apple inc in the fall of it was billed as the missing link between ipods and cellphones with motorola chief executive ed zander calling it "the ultimate convergence of mobile communications and music " i never got the chance to try a rokr but reviewers and consumers didnt exactly share mr zanders appraisal looking askance at its slow transfer times for downloading music and song storage capacity it was obviously nowhere near as good a music player as the ipod nano mr jobs unveiled that very same day mr zander protested that the rokr did much more but no one cared and therein was a lesson to succeed the one device better be as good or very very nearly so at everything done by the devices it replaces im not blind to the fact that mobile devices are slowly but surely morphing and merging standalone pdas are disappearing replaced by combination "smart" phones cellphones and pdas can play music and cameras are increasingly standard on cellphones i carry a samsung electronics co a cellphone with a built in camera an ipod mini if im in the mood and a cheap radio if its baseball season a pda would be useful sometimes but i wont carry one because ive seen too many friends turn into blackberry zombies one device to replace all those sounds like a good idea in theory because while i can understand the appeal of a single device that would replace all that especially when im trying to untangle a rats nest of cables in my bag "convergence" sounds better than it is in practice no device be it phone pda tablet pc or anything else marries all these functions well enough to make me want to scrap all my gear for a single all purpose gadget why just think "jack of all trades master of none " in my living room i have a laptop pc and a tivo digital video recorder plugged into my tv both are connected to my apartments computer network i could use either to browse my digital photos pick mps to play through the stereo play games check the weather or buy movie tickets but the only time i use tivo to do those things is when i want to show somebody it can be done i love my tivo and think its user interface is ingenious but its easier to navigate pc functions with a keyboard and a mouse than with a remote control could i make my pc serve as a tv a radio or a telephone of course but my tv radio and telephone do the job better this isnt to say devices dont ever combine functions perfectly well sometimes they do which is why i dont have a calculator or a typewriter anymore but in most cases the trade off between specialized and multipurpose devices is worth making only when space is at a premium thats the secret of the swiss army knife it isnt a first class corkscrew screwdriver scissors or bottle opener but it earns its keep because its a lot easier to carry a swiss army knife than it is to travel with the best corkscrew or a set of screwdrivers but the list of devices generally heralded as "the swiss army knife of x" essentially begins and ends with the swiss army knife all the market opportunity in the world doesnt make convergence an easier riddle to solve take the universal remote which should have taken over the world except that figuring out how to make one remote do the job of four or five is so complicated that few users can ever master one youre better off digging for the right remote than staring helplessly at the lone remote one step toward the swiss army knife model of mobile computing is the camera phone which became wildly popular even when they took pretty lousy pictures why because there are times when its useful or fun to take a picture and the quality of that picture isnt terribly important your boozy friend is doing something entertaining a celebrity is walking by or you need to prove that you were in fact legally parked i keep my camera phone at the ready for late night taxi rides in case the driver refuses to go to brooklyn something im obsessed with despite the fact that it has never happened in years of living in new york still my camera phone hasnt replaced my standalone digital camera in fact we have two of those unless you have a surgeons steady hands the phone takes blurry pictures and im not interested in paying my carrier additional money to upload or send lousy pictures if anything my camera phone is a replacement for those disposable cameras you buy at the drugstore thats not exactly a triumph of convergence meanwhile efforts to get me to do other things with my cellphone have flopped when i got my glossy black samsung i played around with its nonphone functions for a while but soon lost interest trying to put gmail on my phone hasnt worked i have no idea why and frankly its not my job as a consumer to spend an hour figuring that out using it to look at web pages is a horrible experience long waits busted images and cramped fingers and i still struggle with how to send a text message to someone in my contacts list in other words its a cellphone ive come to dislike my a as thoroughly as i disliked the samsung a it replaced or the kyocera i had before that or the motorola startac i started with cellphones are like icebergs with a basic function or two visible and everything else lurking below the waterline and users like me were the ocean liners given all this pain it makes me laugh when i read that cellphone makers are going to produce the one device quick quiz if youre on a call and another call comes in do you a coolly answer the new call then smoothly go back to your original conversation or b panic if you answered b what makes you think the people who built your phone will be able to make navigating and playing thousands of songs easy or anything else for that matter now for the embarrassing confession the iphone is the first convergence product that could make a convert out of me or at least make me more willing to consider abandoning my long held anti one device principles whats different about the iphone for one thing it wasnt made by a cellphone maker apple made the ipod whose operations are nearly intuitive no its not perfect you shut your ipod down by holding down play after all but i think ive looked at an ipod manual twice since i got my first one in you dont need to which is the way it should be apples digital music success isnt guaranteed to translate into phones but it has made me curious of course it helps that the iphone has the same "wow" factor as the now iconic ipod one interactive design blogger called it "lustworthy " as i watched mr jobs do his stuff i wanted the iphone as a cellphone i wanted it as a next generation ipod i was willing to try it as a pda the fact that those functions came in the same device almost seemed beside the point maybe the iphone wont live up to its demo will it really be that fast will it work as advertised will typing on a touchscreen without some tactile feedback drive people nuts but if it lives up to its potential i may have a second product to put on the swiss army knife list and if it doesnt at least maybe ill finally get a cellphone i like mr fry an editor with the online journal in new york writes the weekly "real time" column he can be reached at jason fry wsj com
