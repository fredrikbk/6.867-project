earmark cover up nothing highlighted congresss spending problem in last years election more than earmarks the special projects like alaskas "bridge to nowhere" that members drop into last minute conference reports leaving no opportunity to debate or amend them voters opted for change in congress but on earmarks it looks as if theyll only be getting more smoke and mirrors democrats promised reform and instituted "a moratorium" on all earmarks until the system was cleaned up now the appropriations committees are privately accepting pork barrel requests again but curiously the scorekeeper on earmarks the library of congresss congressional research service crs a publicly funded nonpartisan federal agency has suddenly announced it will no longer respond to requests from members of congress on the size number or background of earmarks "they claim itll be transparent but theyre taking away the very data that lets us know whats really happening " says oklahoma sen tom coburn "im convinced the appropriations committees are flexing their muscles with crs " indeed the shift in crs policy represents a dramatic break with its year practice of supplying members with earmark data "crs will no longer identify earmarks for individual programs activities entities or individuals " stated a private feb directive from crs director daniel mulhollan when sen coburn and sen jim demint of south carolina submitted earmark inquiries recently they were both turned down each then had heated conversations with mr mulhollan the director who declined to be interviewed for this article explained that because the appropriations committees and the white houses office of management and budget omb were now preparing their own lists of earmarks crs should no longer play a role in the process he also noted that both the house and senate are preparing their own definitions of earmarks "it is not appropriate for us to continue our research " his directive states that is sophistry the house rule making earmarks public which was passed in january doesnt apply to earmarks for fiscal year the year mr coburn wanted his report on there is no senate rule and a proposed statute defining earmarks hasnt become law ombs list of earmarks applies only to fiscal year and in any case crs works for congress so it is bizarre for it to claim work being done by the executive branch as a reason to deny members information it was happy to collect and release in the past when i asked a crs official if the new policy stemmed from complaints by appropriations committee members she refused to answer the question citing "confidentiality" concerns but other crs staffers are happy to talk privately about the political pressure members often exert despite mr mulhollans new directive that all employees inform management within hours of any contacts with the media "the director operates out of fear members will get upset " says dennis roth a crs labor economist who is president of a union representing crs workers "the groundhog doesnt want to see his shadow so he stays in the dark hole so he wont " "there is real anxiety members will complain if crs says something is an earmark when the new appropriations committees say it isnt " says another crs staffer he notes crs "caught hell" last year with its report finding that more than of all earmarks in fiscal year bills werent written into law and thus not legally binding the concern now is that free spending appropriations committees will use the new crs gag rule to define earmarks downward "we need crs to continue its reliable reporting so we can save the taxpayers money " says sen demint earmarks arent chump change crs calculated they amounted to &# billion in and in the past theyve often been given out as "sweeteners" to convince members to vote for mega ticket bills staffers tell me mr mulhollan understands all this but isnt willing to take the heat from capitol hill "its not crss job to be the watchdog of congress " sen demint says the director told him but crs is merely being asked to continue providing objective data if it cant do that why do taxpayers shell out &# million a year to employ its researchers indeed taxpayers cant even access its many fine reports which are closely held despite bipartisan efforts by sens john mccain and pat leahy to make its research public crs implausibly argues that release of its reports will somehow compromise the confidentiality of its contacts with congress mr mulhollan has just issued another new directive demanding "prior approval should now be required" before any crs reports "are distributed to members of the public " but there is a way to get crs reports for a large fee at a conference earlier this month i observed gallery watch a legislative tracking service passing out sample crs reports as if they were candy bars and boasting that for &# a year anyone can get complete access to them "how i get them is my trade secret but i get them all " walt seager of gallery watch told the washington post crss independence appears to have declined since gilbert gude a former member of congress from maryland departed as director in mr mulhollan was appointed by the librarian of congress james h billington in early before the republican takeover of congress so far mr billington hasnt spoken out on mr mulhollans new earmark policy today squeeze plays on crs are not uncommon and they have come from both parties in the s gop house majority leader dick armey was so angry with a crs report questioning the workability of a flat tax that he temporarily zeroed out the agencys budget rep henry waxman as a member of a democratic minority demanded and got revisions to crs reports on how prescription drug pricing rules in his bills would work "everyone expects waxman and others to be even more insistent on getting what they want now that hes in the majority " says another crs staffer despite claims they would bring reform congresss new bosses are acting like the old bosses last friday arizona rep jeff flake sought clarification from house appropriations chairman david obey about an incorrect listing of a nasa earmark in the iraq supplemental bill rep obey responded "the fact is that an earmark is something that is requested by an individual member this item was not requested by any individual member it was put in the bill by me " in other words mr obey believes his own earmarks are nothing of the kind sen coburn plans to fight back he says he will attach an amendment to every appropriations bill demanding crs prepare a full report on the earmarks in it "let senators vote for secrecy and prove they dont want a transparent process or let them deliver what they promised " he says "the choice will be theirs and the american people will be watching " mr fund is an opinionjournal com columnist see related letter "letters to the editor nonpartisan agency keeps eye on earmarks" wsj april
