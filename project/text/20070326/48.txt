intel aims to build bigger profile in china chip plant is designed to court local clients government officials san francisco intel corp s plan to build a &# billion chip fabrication plant in china represents a sharp change in the companys manufacturing strategy and a bet that a bigger profile in the fast growing market is worth the risk the plans by the worlds largest chip maker formally announced last night at a news conference in beijing required years of planning and negotiation between intel and officials in china intel also had to satisfy export control agencies in washington d c whose rules restrict the export of technology with potential military applications while intel already has plants in china for packaging and testing chips its selection of the coastal city of dalian for its first chinese fabrication plant is politically significant such costly "fabs " as they are called in the industry create chips by laying down metals and other materials on silicon wafers dalian is in chinas northeast an aging industrial region to which chinese leaders are trying to attract new industries the proposed plant designated by intel as fab is expected to employ about workers when it begins production in the first half of it will occupy a total of million square feet with a square foot "clean room" for processing steps requiring protection against contamination "this is the fastest growing major market anywhere " said chuck mulloy an intel spokesman "we want to invest to participate in it " intel wont use the plant to make its core product line the microprocessors that provide the calculating capability for most computers instead the company plans to build accessory products called chip sets which dont require cutting edge production technology that u s authorities wouldnt likely approve for export to china the santa clara calif company has never built a fab specifically for chip sets before nor has it set up a new production line at anything less than the state of the art instead it typically makes such products in older factories after its flagship microprocessors are shifted to new production lines the dalian investment though a major boon for chinas efforts to develop its technology industry is far less than recent price tags of &# billion to &# billion on intels newest microprocessor plants one reason is that the company can transfer used production tools the biggest expense in such factories from existing factories to the new factory intel expects the dalian factory to cost about the same as using an older plant to make chip sets mr mulloy said but dean mccarron an analyst at mercury research estimated that constructing and outfitting a new factory could cost hundreds of millions of dollars more bringing chip production to a new location also carries risks that include finding sufficient production workers water and electricity intel which makes chips in the u s ireland and israel hasnt built a fab at an entirely new site in years the potential payoff is hard to quantify employees at the plant are likely to be paid somewhat less than at some other intel locations but wages are a relatively small part of the cost of operating a fab mr mulloy said the chinese government provided attractive financial incentives he wouldnt disclose the value but the company could expect similar benefits in other countries instead analysts say intel stands to benefit in more subtle ways by being perceived as a more substantial player in chinas economy that agenda is underscored by the setting of the announcement which chief executive paul otellini made at the great hall of the people a site usually used for government meetings employing more chinese workers could give intel a selling point over rival advanced micro devices inc in negotiating with some chinese chip customers many of the largest of which are connected to the government perhaps more important intel could increase its influence over chinese officials in negotiating about issues such as protection of intellectual property including chip designs starting with chip sets in dalian allows intel to test the climate in china for protecting its chip designs without putting its more valuable microprocessor designs at risk said jim mcgregor an analyst at in stat a market research firm in scottsdale ariz a fab in china also could help intel create localized products if the country adopts special standards for technologies such as wireless communications but the company may be more eager to use its influence to lobby china to use the same technologies as other countries mr mccarron said this underscores the significance of the location intel has chosen rejuvenating chinas northeast an area known as the countrys rust belt is a priority of the current chinese leaders among them the commerce minister bo xilai who was dalians mayor in the s zhou yang and jason dean in beijing contributed to this article
