the morning brief income inequality in american politics online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here overshadowed by headline grabbing policy fights over iraq and other issues the widening income gap between the richest americans and the middle class is nonetheless generating significant attention in washington the main reason is the democratic victory last fall and the rhetoric of president bush and others in his administration has changed accordingly mr bush seldom acknowledged the income gap until this past january when he declared "i know some of our citizens worry about the fact that our dynamic economy is leaving working people behind income inequality is real " the wall street journal reports but he has brought the subject up several times since then current and former administration officials and outsiders in touch with the white house tell the journal mr bushs economic philosophy hasnt changed but that he has been forced to switch tactics by the new political environment the white house still doesnt view a growing share of income going to those at the top as a bad thing but rather as a reflection of the natural accrual of rewards by "societys most skilled and productive members " the journal says by most measures income equality has been growing since the s and its one of the reasons average worker pay has been vastly outpaced by overall economic growth in recent years of americans earned of total income in a postwar record the journal notes even before novembers election some administration allies warned the issue was undermining republican support but republican strategists led by karl rove "largely ignored the findings" and "wanted to avoid blunting one of their few advantages in the campaign the economys broad strength " the journal says now "democrats takeover of congress makes avoiding the issue difficult particularly if the president is to win congressional backing for free trade pacts and for extending his authority to negotiate new ones " the paper adds a related issue on the agenda is paid sick leave the u s is one of the only industrialized nations not to mandate paid sick leave for private sector employees and nearly half of american full time workers dont have it the los angeles times notes thus far opposition from business owners who say such a mandate would add to costs and constrain the way they operate has managed to block a federal sick leave law but labor and family advocacy groups are trying again now that democrats control congress still such democratic ambitions will be restrained by a tight u s budget take another issue democrats hope to provide healthcare coverage for millions of uninsured children because of budget rules aimed at curbing the deficit such spending would have to be offset by tax increases or cuts in programs meaning beneficiaries of a popular medicare program may have to pay for helping to insure the kids the times reports "that could turn what started as a feel good plan to help the children of the working poor into a tricky exercise in shifting generational burdens " the times adds especially at a time when "the bills for supporting baby boomers in retirement are about to start coming due " denied the assisted care they paid for politically tough as they are conflicts over the costs of caring for the most vulnerable americans resonate which is why todays report in the new york times on insurance companies denial of nursing home care to elderly americans who bought such insurance may soon be a subject of hearings on capitol hill a review by the n y times of hundreds of "grievances and lawsuits filed in recent years shows elderly policyholders confronting unnecessary delays and overwhelming bureaucracies " the times says among the examples "in a subsidiary of conseco bankers life and casualty sent an year old woman suffering from dementia the wrong form to fill out according to a lawsuit then denied her claim because of improper paperwork last year according to another pending suit the insurer penn treaty american decided that a year old man had so improved that he should leave his nursing home despite his forgetfulness anxiety and doctors orders to seek continued care " "the bottom line is that insurance companies make money when they dont pay claims " mary beth senkewicz who resigned last year as a senior executive at the national association of insurance commissioners tells the times "theyll do anything to avoid paying because if they wait long enough they know the policyholders will die " in court filings the two companies said the denials had been proper they declined further comment on the cases though bankers life eventually settled for an unspecified amount the times says much ado about iran oil prices shot up above &# a barrel today amid two escalating standoffs between iran and the international community that have ratcheted up tension in the persian gulf tehran is insisting it wont back down in a tussle with the u k and europe over the seizure of british sailors and marines in waters disputed by iraq and iran and it announced a partial suspension of cooperation with the international atomic energy agency following the tighter slate of sanctions approved by the united nations security council on saturday a u s defense official tells the wall street journal that a provocative response from iran was expected in the wake of increased financial and military pressure and that the seizure of the british officers was a sign that coercive steps were working on the negative side more provocative action could come in the weeks ahead the official says iran has curtailed its cooperation with the iaea before which made it harder to assess the countrys nuclear progress the new york times notes david albright a former u n weapons inspector and head of the washington based institute for science and international security tells the times iran may now have an easier time building clandestine means of enriching uranium to weapons grade "to me its a serious retreat " he says "they could build a backup centrifuge facility and not tell the iaea " in theory keeping it safe from attacks by the u s or israel a european diplomat tells the times that while "it sounds tough " in theory it will only make a difference if iran actually chooses to build such plants which currently dont seem to be in the works meanwhile iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki says his government is considering charging the brits with illegally entering iranian waters despite a warning from british prime minister tony blair that the seizure was "unjustified and wrong " and his insistence that the sailors and marines were taken from iraqi waters as the financial times reports the seized sailors and marines part of a u n task force that maintains security in iraqi waters were reportedly outnumbered and outgunned by the iranians who captured them but lt com erik horner second in command of the uss underwood an american frigate thats also part of the task force tells the independent his men would have fired on the iranian forces rather than be captured "i dont want to second guess the british after the fact but our rules of engagement allow a little more latitude " he says "our boarding teams training is a little bit more towards self preservation " citigroup prepares to restructure citigroup under pressure to cut its
