politics &amp economics bird flu vaccine tests economies poor nations aim to secure benefits by sharing cases with medical researchers jakarta indonesia earlier this year indonesias health minister asked a stark question what does her poor country get out of sharing bird flu samples with scientists and vaccine makers this week global and regional health authorities and scientists meeting here will try to hash out an answer among the thorniest issues in the battle to protect the world against a bird flu pandemic is how to ensure that vaccines are available to the people at greatest risk of catching the disease in recent years poorer countries such as indonesia and thailand have given samples of the hn strain of bird flu they collect from sick and dying patients to laboratories and companies in richer countries such as france and the u s to study and to develop life saving vaccines but what they can get in return for sharing the virus has remained unclear even given best case scenarios the worlds current manufacturers could produce only a fraction of the amount of vaccine that would be needed if a pandemic were to break out and because the worlds largest vaccine makers are in rich countries far from asia where nearly all of the deaths have been many have wondered privately whether the supplies would be hoarded at the expense of people closest to the source of the outbreak that is what prompted indonesian minister of health siti fadilah supari to ask her question explicitly and publicly for the first time she stopped sending the samples her government was collecting to the world health organization leaving vaccine makers and laboratories without access to the most recent and potentially useful strains of the virus the move was intended to protest what indonesia felt was a one way exchange with little sign indonesians would benefit from a vaccine made from a virus collected on its soil at the meeting which opens today officials from the who and health ministries in asia along with top influenza scientists will focus on these issues while many similar gatherings often have relatively predetermined outcomes and officials convene merely to ratify an agreement that has already been endorsed both sides agree the jakarta meeting could result in a pact or a continuing conflict nancy cox director of the influenza division at the u s centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta is one of the many attendees the jakarta meeting is "very important " dr cox said "we really need to have more viruses from all the affected countries so we can compare and contrast whats happening so we can be as prepared as possible " in an interview dr supari said "we want a mechanism to ensure access to vaccines to make vaccines more accessible more affordable to all of the countries especially developing ones " david heymann the whos representative for avian influenza said one solution to the issue could involve the who soliciting funding to buy stockpiles of vaccine from manufacturers on behalf of developing countries he said wealthier nations might have a direct incentive to contribute to such purchases as those vaccines could help contain an nascent pandemic if deployed quickly before it could spread "she has raised an issue that had to be addressed " said dr heymann of dr supari but he added that if the meeting doesnt produce a solution "we will have to use our moral authority we will have to begin to talk about this as a threat to public health security " he added "nobody else is withholding viruses shes the only one thats doing this "
