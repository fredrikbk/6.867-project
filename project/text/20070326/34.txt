high power and high heels companies move beyond sports steak and scotch to cultivate new clients no one thought it the least bit silly after all networking over shoe shopping at a manhattan boutique is no different for women than playing golf and sharing cigars after a steak dinner is for men for the shoppers who attended a "shoe event" sponsored by law firm bryan cave llp on a recent tuesday evening all of them female lawyers and their female corporate clients or friends getting to know one another while browsing designer shoes was a refreshing change from being the lone woman at a client dinner or sports event "the shoes were an icebreaker for starting conversations " says elizabeth dasilva managing director global trust services americas at bank of new york she mulled a pair of high heeled evening pumps but quickly turned her attention to the other shoppers "it was the first opportunity id had to talk to lawyers my firm uses about something other than an immediate work assignment " adds ms dasilva she didnt buy any shoes but found the shopping and dinner after at a turkish restaurant relaxing and says she came away feeling more comfortable with attorneys from bryan cave and with names of other executives for her contact list such women only networking events are proliferating at law firms and an array of other companies including ernst &amp young llp merrill lynch &amp co and general electric co there are spa retreats conferences at resorts evenings at art galleries and cooking demonstrations all organized by women who want to network and socialize with clients in their own way at least some of the time the top brass at such companies support the events for several reasons most notably they help to boost the bottom line "were in a relationship business and we have to constantly think of new and different ways to spend time with clients so when ideas pop up that make sense we do them " says dennis fleischmann managing partner of bryan caves new york office still holding women only networking events raises some complicated issues are these single sex events just as exclusionary as the traditional spectator sports events and steak and cigar dinners have been for men what about women who have male clients and vice versa some male executives think ambitious women would be wiser to learn to play golf still a primary way men in business socialize and lay the groundwork for deal making and some women are ambivalent about women only events that may cause them to be viewed as "frivolous " but a growing chorus is saying theres nothing wrong with recognizing that women have different tastes and different interests besides after years of being subtly and not so subtly excluded from male gatherings women say they want their own space "even if women hold or of top jobs well still want to do some things on our own and prefer some activities more than others " says billie williamson americas director of flexibility and gender equity strategy at ernst &amp young "at vice president and higher levels women speak a sort of shorthand and feel an immediate bond around challenges weve faced " including finding mentors and juggling careers and families adds ms williamson one of four women on ernst &amp youngs person americas executive board women only events also are getting a boost from business clients who increasingly want to do business with firms that have diverse leadership about corporations have signed a document called the call to action initiated by sara lee corp s general counsel four years ago agreeing to work only with law firms that have "consistently taken action" to increase the number of women and minority lawyers they hire and retain "when your clients are asking where are the women and minorities in your pipeline theres a lot of impetus to make sure they get help networking in whatever way they feel comfortable" so they can bring in new business and advance says susan saltonstall duncan president of rainmaking oasis in madison conn which advises companies on business development not that everyone supports women only events she notes "there are men who wonder why do women whove said they want to be equal want to separate and there are women who think their male peers will think poorly of them if they spend time with women or whove advanced on their own and dont want to turn around and help other women " says ms duncan but "these resisters are in the minority and they arent going to be in the game for long " she maintains its hard to be a naysayer after all when your ceo supports women only events thats the case at ernst &amp young where ceo james turley speaks at womens leadership conference says ms williamson to encourage mentoring among women ernst &amp young plans a ceo summit in june to which it will invite a score of fortune ceos and their top ranked women each of these senior women will be asked to bring her protege and theyll spend the afternoon together in an all womens session the steps that go into successful networking are the same for women and men when she meets a woman who is a prospective client at a women only event or elsewhere ms williamson says she "keeps in touch continues to ask how things are going with their business and at some point they may say they are looking for help with something " if its something e&amp y can do she asks "will you consider us and let me introduce you to our specialist in this area who is often a man " she notes most women only events are geared to an elite group of top ranked women in may general electric will hold its fifth conference for about senior women and women customers at its crotonville n y training center keynote speakers this year will include karen hughes president bushs adviser and ebay ceo meg whitman "this isnt about being a woman in business its about being a businessperson " says susan peters ges vice president of executive development so why limit it to women ms peters says the conference which ge ceo jeffrey immelt addresses is "inspirational" because attendees get to meet other women who have accomplished a lot and learn from one another the gathering also helps "cement relationships" with some major customers including the growing number of female executives at retailers health care and other companies that buy ge products ms peters adds women only networking events take different forms laura zwak demare a managing director in merrill lynchs global markets and investment banking group last year went rock climbing in jackson hole wyo she was one of about women attending a four day all womens conference she helped to organize with other female executives in her group "i was terrified and would have much preferred to go hiking" after panel discussions about hedge funds and other investment topics she says "but i did what my clients wanted " none of them had ever climbed before and during the three hours they spent harnessed together "staring at and tackling a mountain we got to know each other very well and in a way that couldnt have happened at a spa where wed each be getting our own facials " says ms zwak demare "not everything we do together has to be highbrow but its important that women in business and the professions support one another " says corinne kevorkian president and general manager of the interior design group of f schumacher who attended bryan caves shoe event she first met the partner who invited her years ago in a clothing store "where we were fighting over the same maternity dress " she recalls the women partners at the firm who number compared with men are planning a variety of other events for female clients and prospective clients and for their female associates to give them opportunities to network male partners are networking in new ways too one hatched the idea of a poker tournament that has become an annual event for men and women and family events are being planned that will take place on weekends at a zoo or circus the firm hasnt held any minority only events but participated this month in a meeting of the minority corporate council association an advocacy group for minority attorneys "some people might wonder what does this have to do with law but we work long hours with clients on deals and litigation and everything goes a lot smoother when you know the people youre working with " says hope goldstein a bryan
