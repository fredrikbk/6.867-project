politics &amp economics defiant iran may roil oil market more tehran to partially suspend cooperation with u n agency in response to new sanctions international tensions with iran over its nuclear program and the seizure of british sailors and marines could further roil oil markets this week as tehran insisted it wouldnt back down on either front meanwhile in a move that could escalate tensions further tehran announced that because of new united nations sanctions over its nuclear program it would partially suspend cooperation with u n nuclear watchdogs a u s defense official said that there have been discussions for weeks that iran may respond provocatively to the increased financial and military pressure on the positive side the official said tehrans seizure of the british officers was a sign that the coercive steps taken by the international community were working the downside the official said was that iran and its proxies in the gulf and middle east could take other action in the weeks ahead "theres definitely the possibility that iran could respond in other ways " the official said the iranians "rarely retaliate in conventional ways " oil prices surged to their highest level in three months on friday after iranian gunboats seized british marines and naval personnel with their two dinghies in waters surrounding a disputed border between iran and iraq in the oil rich persian gulf the price increase underscored how sensitive the global economy can be to tensions in the gulf as much as of the worlds daily oil supply passes through the body of water separating saudi arabia and iran the seizure added to a volatile standoff between iran and the west over the nuclear weapons issue and comes amid friction between washington and tehran over accusations of iranian meddling in iraq "it is simply not true that they went into iranian territorial waters and i hope the iranian government understands how fundamental an issue this is for us " united kingdom prime minister tony blair said of the detained british soldiers speaking in berlin u s and european diplomats appealed to iran over the weekend to rejoin nuclear talks after the u n security council on saturday unanimously approved a second round of financial and arms sanctions on tehran over its uranium enrichment program iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki dismissed the new sanctions as "unlawful" and said iran wouldnt suspend its uranium work as a precondition to rejoining talks iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said iran will "adjust" its ties with the u n members behind the measure it calls for countries to ban all arms exports from iran and to freeze the assets of iranian organizations and individuals many of them connected to irans elite revolutionary guard corps the resolution also calls for a freeze on bank sepah one of irans largest and oldest banks iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes but others contend that tehran is pursuing nuclear weapons gholam hossein elham a government spokesman said the iranian cabinet decided to suspend a provision that called on the government to inform the u n s international atomic energy agency of any new steps and decisions made in its atomic program "this will continue until irans nuclear case is referred back to the international atomic energy agency from the u n security council " mr elham told state television the captured british personnel were part of an american led task force put together to secure iraqi territorial waters and protect iraqs oil terminals in a statement friday the u s navy said the british forces were conducting a routine search of a merchant ship a spokesman for the u s fifth fleet based in bahrain said on sunday the british sailors were captured in waters that allied forces have operated in frequently for years and well clear of recognized iranian waters britains ambassador in tehran met iranian officials yesterday morning to ask where the british sailors and marines are being held and to secure consular access according to a spokeswoman for the foreign and commonwealth office the spokeswoman said the u k had received no official offer for a prisoner exchange nor has tehran said where they are being detained the seizure closely mirrored an incident in june when iran arrested six british sailors in the shatt al arab waterway a channel that divides iraq and iran the soldiers were released three days later after suffering mock executions and confessing on iranian television that they had entered iranian waters illegally some iranian officials have in recent years suggested they could disrupt global oil supplies any attempt to bottle up the narrow strait of hormuz at the south end of the gulf would quickly ripple through oil markets but short of holding back its own oil irans ability to hobble oil trade for very long in the gulf is limited its military presence is small compared with the u s forces and the oil industry itself has proven to be extremely flexible in responding to emergencies still even minor military confrontations such as the one friday can have a knock on effect in the oil trade driving up insurance and shipping rates for instance and if tensions between allied and iranian naval forces flare oil tanker captains could be more hesitant to call at iraqs two offshore oil export terminals these installations are nestled in the very northern part of the gulf close to the region where the british personnel were captured marc champion and jay solomon contributed to this article
