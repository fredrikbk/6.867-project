student who had played a varsity sport could not participate in intramural sports ms goestenkors had trouble finding a way to keep in shape gaining about pounds over the course of the year she said it was a mental more than a physical challenge to exercise for fitness rather than to train her body for a sport today she exercises every morning she is single and lives in hillsboro n c about a minute drive from duke the workout exercise is ingrained in ms goestenkors daily routine she wakes up at a m every day and either runs or walks the four mile cross country trail on the duke university campus or works out in the campus gym at the gym she spends between minutes and an hour on the treadmill or elliptical trainer frequently watching game tapes so she can multitask ms goestenkors lifts weights in the off season "i feel the most fit when i combine cardio and lifting but once the season hits its very hard to lift because it would take an hour and a half to complete my cardio and weights " she says practice officially starts for the team at the beginning of october and the season can run until the championship game this year its on april once the season starts there are no weekends off "this is not your typical monday through friday nine to five job " she says "we practice on weekends were in the office five to six hours in addition to that i get home at p m from practice and p m if we have a home game " ms goestenkors says that she loses some muscle mass and tone when she stops lifting she says it takes about six weeks for her to feel like she has her muscle tone back once she starts up again the strength routine takes ms goestenkors about minutes to complete and she does it three times a week she does a circuit of various exercises like a bench press lateral pull down bicep curl and tricep extension completing three sets of repetitions with little rest between exercises "i try to go from one exercise right to the other so i feel like im getting a cardio workout and am winded " she says ms goestenkors tries to focus on the number of repetitions rather than the amount of weight shes lifting saying shes looking to achieve muscle definition on the road the team requires that accommodations have a workout facility so ms goestenkors can work out when she travels to away games she also plays basketball usually four on four once or twice a week for an hour with a group of duke university trainers managers coaches and staff she wont play with the team "id lose their respect if they ever saw me play now " she says "those days are long gone ill play h o r s e with the team occasionally " the diet in the mornings ms goestenkors has a bowl of cereal or oatmeal before working out around a m shell eat a banana if practice is at p m she eats with the team afterwards at around ms goestenkors has the benefit of eating what is served to her players which means she usually has many healthy options for both lunch and dinner shell graze on almonds if shes

facilities her costs are very limited "im easy " she says "ive got a t shirt shorts and a pair of nikes and im good to go " the effort ms goestenkors believes that the year after college is the hardest year for athletes especially college athletes who played a team sport disengaging from being part of a team where days revolve around training and conditioning the body was a big shock for ms goestenkors "you spend your whole life playing sports so when thats gone its hard both mentally and physically " after gaining pounds her first year out of college coach goestenkors slowly began the mental process of motivating herself to exercise not as an athlete but as a normal person "running had never been fun " she explains "it was always disciplined i was always doing it for a reason and had to time myself or go a specific distance because i was in training " ms goestenkors says it took time to decondition herself "i finally just gave myself permission to work out with no specific goal in mind except to get in shape i said ok im going to go for a run and it doesnt matter how far or how fast " it took six months for ms goestenkors to lose the pounds and get back into shape "i felt better after the second week of exercising but the first two weeks were a struggle " she says "the biggest challenge was mentally wanting to do it and getting myself out there initially people do too much too quickly rather than just congratulate themselves for doing anything just give yourself permission to do something as little as walking around the block one time because thats more than you would have done if you went home and sat on the coach with a bag of chips once you start you feel good and can build momentum " the benefit ms goestenkors says exercise is important for both mental and physical health "i feel good about myself when im in shape " she says "my team works so hard every day and i want to feel fit too " during her runs ms goestenkors also strategizes for games "exercise is very peaceful for me and i do some of my best thinking and get some of my most creative thoughts when im working out " she says it also provides a great outlet "my morning workout is my stress relief " she says "i just wake up and get started off on the right foot and feel energized " write to jen murphy at workout wsj com
