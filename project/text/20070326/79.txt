porsche boosts stake clout at vw protective move adds fuel to plan for global thrust piechs latest power play frankfurt at a time when many auto makers in europe and the u s are cutting production and rethinking the virtues of scale tiny german sports car maker porsche ag is making a bet that bigger may be better the stuttgart maker of iconic sports cars announced over the weekend that it was increasing its stake in volkswagen ag to from a porsche spokesman said the company had an option to buy the of vw at a price just under euros &# a share porsche declined to say who the sellers are the move prompted a separate mandatory takeover offer for all of vw under german law porsche said that isnt its aim and emphasized the point by offering just the legal minimum price of euros a vw share that shouldnt tempt shareholders vw shares rose to euros friday instead the move represents the growing ambition and clout of vw chairman and former chief executive officer ferdinand piech mr piech personifies the intimate relationship between the companies he sit on both boards and he and his extended family own of porsches voting stock mr piech has used his influence to push vw in a new strategic direction where former vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder emphasized cost cutting mr piech has long favored making vws cars more technically sophisticated a strategy the company is now pursuing mr piech who played a crucial role in mr pischetsrieders sudden replacement in november wants vw to become a rival worthy of japans toyota motor corp in terms of efficiency and profitability he has been gradually creating an automotive empire stretching from commercial trucks and pedestrian hatchbacks to luxury sports cars meanwhile other industry players are prospering by staying focused on a few core businesses daimlerchrysler ag for example is considering a sale of its unprofitable chrysler division porsches move appeared to be defensive as much as offensive in an interview over the weekend with germanys bild newspaper porsches ceo wendelin wiedeking said his company was concerned that unidentified hedge funds might try to take over and break up vw the influence of hedge funds at large german corporations is politically delicate given the countrys high unemployment rate of around a porsche spokesman confirmed the remarks although porsche said its intention for now is to own of vw it is leaving open the possibility of buying more such a step could become important should the german state of lower saxony one day decide to sell its stake in the auto maker the states current governor christian wulff has in the past denied any intention of selling but his governing coalition includes free market politicians who have advocated such a step in a written statement mr wulff didnt say what his government plans to do with its stake he did say "in light of the global challenges its a blessing that volkswagen has two reliable shareholders in porsche and lower saxony " and that both shareholders have a "common vision for volkswagen " although industry observers have long expected porsche to increase its stake in vw the timing of its move caught many off guard many had expected porsche to wait until the outcome of a long running legal fight between european union regulators and the german government over a law that limits any volkswagen shareholders voting rights to a law crafted to protect lower saxony the law has been criticized by eu regulators who see it as inhibiting the free flow of capital within europe an eu court legal adviser recently concluded the law was "not based on overriding reasons relating to the public interest " porsche is gaining influence at a company that already is one of its most important business partners vw supplies porsche with the body of its cayenne sport utility vehicle and has agreed to help develop porsches new panamera coupe expected to debut in deepening cooperation with vw particularly in engines could become especially important to porsche as eu regulators crack down on the auto industrys greenhouse gas emissions the eus executive policy making arm has vowed to slap the auto industry in europe with new regulations on carbon dioxide emissions from new cars analysts say porsche with its emphasis on horsepower and speed could be at a disadvantage under tougher rules porsches mr wiedeking has denounced the threatened regulations in unusually fierce language saying they could trigger a "business war in europe " in which french and italian car makers which specialize in small fuel efficient cars would benefit at the expense of german manufacturers which tend to produce powerful sedans and sports cars for now however porsches move will strengthen the influence of the hard charging mr piech in an interview with the wall street journal last year mr piech said he expected a spurt in volkswagens sales growth to vault the company ahead of general motors corp and ford motor co in terms of global sales "within a few years " and that volkswagen would eventually rank second in global sales to japans toyota mr piech also said he expected porsches management to play a prominent role in teaching volkswagen how to be more profitable with volkswagen more firmly in mr piechs grip the auto maker has lately returned to a strategy that resembles one mr piech pursued as ceo from until betting on quality improvements and technical innovations to drive higher profits and sales the shift represents a departure from the emphasis on cost cutting under mr pischetsrieder who only a year ago announced plans to cut some jobs mainly in germany and who was steering vw back to its roots as the maker of the affordable "peoples car " how that strategy will work remains to be seen under mr pischetsrieder the company was in the middle of a turnaround posting net profit of billion euros last year compared with billion euros a year earlier partly as a result of his steep cost cuts some industry analysts are fretting over the fact that martin winterkorn mr pischetsrieders successor as chief executive has ordered design changes to several vw models in development including a new version of the flagship golf model aides say the changes are relatively minor refitting a strip of rubber along the golfs window sill to improve its external appearance for example and wont cause delays or significant new costs
