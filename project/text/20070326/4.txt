austin power in quest for cleaner energy texas city touts plug in car mayors unusual plan links wind batteries pitching auto makers austin texas of all the plans cooked up by cities to combat pollution and global warming the one hatched here is among the most ambitious and some say one of the more quixotic mayor will wynn is pushing a new version of the electric car called the plug in which runs almost entirely on electricity and has a big rechargeable battery but thats not all mayor wynn envisions the parked electric cars plugging into a network operated by the citys utility which would then use the powerful car batteries as a big storage system from which to draw power during peak demand roger duncan deputy manager of austin energy the city owned electric utility dreamed up the scheme three years ago after the mayor ordered him to get more electricity from "green" sources especially from wind austin energy already got of its power from wind but wind production peaked at night when electricity demand was low mr duncan needed more clean power during hot days when demand was high if there were enough plug ins around austin mr duncan figured he could buy more wind generated electricity sell it to plug in owners at night then buy some of it back during the day from cars sitting in parking lots equipped with special sockets with concern about climate change on the rise interest in renewable energy sources is moving from the fringe to the mainstream some utilities will buy extra power that their customers produce by home solar panels these days seemingly far fetched plans like austins are drawing a level of support that would have been unlikely just a few years ago austin a city of and the capital of texas is becoming one of the nations biggest promoters of plug ins to give the market a push it has launched a campaign called plug in partners to line up people to buy the cars when they reach the market organizers say theyve secured pledges from individuals and organizations around the country to buy one when theyre introduced the mayors of major cities several environmental groups and hundreds of utilities have endorsed the campaign and many are intrigued by the power storing concept in california the bay area rapid transit system or bart is looking into setting up a similar system for tapping into electric car batteries in commuter parking lots and several large utilities are studying the concept although mr duncans pledges are dwarfed by the million vehicles sold annually in the u s both general motors corp and toyota motor corp have said in recent months that they plan to develop plug ins and bring them to market their intention is to try to tap growing consumer demand for nongasoline powered vehicles not to provide power storage for utilities other car makers also have expressed interest gm spokesman greg martin says mr duncans effort played a part in the decision president bush in his last two state of the union addresses has cited plug in cars as a promising alternative to gas powered ones legislation has been introduced in congress that would provide a tax credit to partially offset the cost of buying the vehicles when they become available big hurdles remain the cars require expensive lithium ion batteries that havent been perfected production of plug ins is at least three to five years off and experts say the cars could cost &# "plug ins will have a niche market " says red cavaney president of the american petroleum institute which represents the oil industry "theyre certainly not going to replace the family car " austins plan to use the plug in batteries as a power storage network also requires additional work mr duncan will have to devise financial incentives such as cheaper parking or discounted power to induce car owners to allow austin energy to buy back extra power from their batteries the city will have to install a computer monitoring system to make sure the utility doesnt leave car owners without enough battery juice mr duncan has found his most enthusiastic backers in the electric utility business shifting some of the nations vehicles from gasoline to electricity these people say would curb pollution and reduce reliance on imported oil and would make utilities more profitable and efficient the electric power research institute an industry group has spent years researching and touting plug ins and supports efforts to use their batteries to store extra power utilities which use thousands of vehicles would likely be the first big buyers of the vehicles the group says the idea of tapping the electricity stored in car batteries called vehicle to grid power or vg originated with willett kempton an electrical engineer and associate professor at the university of delaware he came up with the idea in the late s after he learned that electric cars require large batteries and that most cars sit parked most of the day "i said to myself wait a minute this is a big storage system " dr kempton recalls in a paper he and economist steven letendre detailed how electric cars using computer controlled connections could draw power from the electric grid at times and pump it back into the grid at other times much of the software and hardware needed to do this dr kempton discovered already existed but car makers thought the idea was crazy he says in dr kempton went to san dimas calif where ac propulsion was developing one of a kind prototypes for electric cars including a roadster called the tzero he and alan cocconi the founder of the company conducted an experiment using a two way charging system that mr cocconi had developed the cars special lithium ion battery was drawing power from a wall socket with a laptop computer the two men directed the electricity to move the other way from the car into the power line the cars powerful battery generated more than enough electricity to temporarily meet the modest needs of the small company electric cars first appeared in the s but they were overshadowed within years by gasoline powered cars which were cheaper and had unlimited range in the s concerns about reliance on imported oil and about climate change rekindled interest hybrids such as the toyota prius which married electric drive systems with small gasoline engines but dont have to be plugged in have come to market and proven popular but gm canceled its &# billion drive to market an electric car the ev in after california dropped a regulation requiring auto makers to sell some austin takes pride in both its environmental record and its quirkiness austin energys mr duncan years old once raised money for local antinuclear campaigns by producing concerts starring willie nelson and other local musicians these days austin energy is part owner of a nuclear plant and mr duncan considers such plants part of the solution to global warming because they dont generate the pollutants that coal burning ones do the utility already uses more wind generated power than any other major utility does according to the u s department of energy "this global warming problem is so severe that weve got to use everything we have to fight it " he says mr duncan concluded that plug in vehicles would be especially useful in texas where wind turbine "farms" in the western part of the state now supply the cheapest electricity he figured he could sell the wind energy to plug in owners at night and during the day buy back extra power to help cool homes and office buildings to make the plan work electric cars would have to plug in during the day at parking lots equipped with computer monitored plugs dr kempton and other vg devotees have written about existing technology that can track how much power utilities drain from each battery so that too much isnt removed and car owners can be credited as mr duncan saw it the battery power could supplant dirtier energy generated by coal fired plants and more expensive power from natural gas fueled facilities the bottom line he concluded would be cleaner air for austin and assuming several thousand plug in customers &# million more in annual electricity sales for austin energy but mayor wynn and mr duncan quickly discovered that pushing plug ins wasnt easy hardly anyone knew what they were talking about at the moment only a few hundred plug in vehicles exist some are custom made experimental cars others are conventional hybrids like the toyota prius and honda civic hybrid that have been converted using kits a process that car makers discourage conventional hybrids which average to miles a gallon are propelled by both electric motors and small gasoline engines which also keep the batteries charged plug ins have much bigger batteries and are propelled solely by electric motors with their smaller gasoline engines serving only to recharge batteries that run down on the road because they can run most or all of the day on electric power they can travel more than miles per gallon of gasoline in austins city council launched a public awareness campaign about plug ins more than residents signed petitions calling on auto makers to produce them and local government agencies and businesses signed pledges to buy as many as early on mr duncan met with some car company officials in washington to urge them to make plug ins "i didnt get a no or anything there was just plain silence " he recalls "finally one of them asked me why was austin doing this i explained and there was more silence " in austins city council ponied up &# million to mount a national campaign to drum up support mr duncan hit the road with a powerpoint presentation telling audiences that the cost of driving a plug in car was comparable to paying cents a gallon for gasoline mayor wynn who headed the energy committee of the u s conference of mayors rounded up endorsements from fellow mayors in baltimore boston chicago minneapolis dallas los angeles and san francisco he lobbied the u s head of toyota during a meeting in new york city mr duncan pitched farm groups emphasizing that the plug ins auxiliary motor could be made to run mainly on ethanol or biodiesel fuel some environmental groups have been leery of the campaign worried that utilities would want to use coal fired plants rather than clean energy sources to power plug ins technical challenges need to be overcome developing the plug in battery "is the biggest show stopper if you want to call it that " says ahmad pesaran a battery expert at the energy departments national renewable energy laboratory plug ins need big lithium ion batteries to pound versions of the ones used in many laptop computers the batteries have to store times as much power as conventional car batteries and at least five times as much as batteries in current hybrids batteries for prototype plug ins mr pesaran says run &# to &# apiece plug ins wont be commercially viable he says until the battery costs are cut by a joint government industry research program could help reduce the cost as could economies of scale from mass production he says while plug ins might reduce dependence on imported oil theyd require imported copper nickel and cobalt and lithium ion technology currently dominated by japan south korea and china optimists predict that plug ins will be in showrooms within three to five years its likely to take longer for utilities to be able to tap the extra power stored in plug in batteries mr duncan says hes willing to wait during a four year stint on austins city council he sometimes practiced a tibetan form of buddhism during fights between pro environment and pro business members "he meditates a lot and remains a completely calm person " says jim marston director of the texas office of environmental defense a new york based nonprofit group "i dont think ive ever seen him raise his voice " the vehicle to grid technology that utilities would need is slowly taking shape in california utilities are introducing computer driven "smart meters" that can be set to run appliances such as washing machines at night when rates are lower a plug in family car sitting in the garage could be one of those appliances says sven thesen an engineer who is exploring electric drive systems for pg&amp e corp in san francisco this two way process could be used on the nations electric power grid according to a study released in january by the department of energys pacific northwest national laboratory the national grid has enough spare capacity at night to fuel as many as million electric cars which is equivalent to of the nations current automobile fleet the study says fuel for cars powered by electricity would cost customers only about as much as fuel for gasoline powered cars the study estimates auto makers havent said when plug ins will reach market but mayor wynn says austins city council has already set aside &# million to fund rebates for the first residents to buy plug ins the city intends to change building codes to require plugs in municipal parking lots with internet connections to austin energy after that the mayor explains "well be able to start harvesting parking garages " mike spector contributed to this article
