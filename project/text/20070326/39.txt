gradual ascent burned by last boom boeing curbs its pace it uses new restraint to juggle jet orders avoiding bunny holes seattle after two years of record orders the jet business has never looked better for boeing co thats precisely what worries scott carson head of its commercial airplanes unit he remembers how boeing handled the last jet building boom and vows "weve been there and weve done that and were not going back " in boeing tried to ramp up production so quickly that suppliers were unable to make parts fast enough unfinished planes stacked up at its factories here forcing managers to shut down production for a month to allow the strained supply chain to catch up the colossal stumble led to a rare year end loss and &# billion in charges against earnings over two years this time around the storied jet maker is trying to be more prudent and increase production gradually in the process it knowingly risks alienating some of its longtime best customers its a challenge all industries face determining how much to gear up in good times that might be fleeting the stakes are particularly high for manufacturers of huge and expensive products such as boeing the u s s largest exporter by dollar volume "we really do want to produce as many airplanes as we can but we want to be responsible about it " jim mcnerney boeings chairman and chief executive says in an interview to build even its simplest jetliner the single aisle boeing has to assemble parts from more than suppliers engage thousands of workers across the country and front much of the cost before the customer pays off the &# million average tab during an ordering and production process that can span years the economy and the health of its boom and bust airline clients may undergo radical shifts now a recovery in the airline industry is intensifying a need for quick jet deliveries boeing headquartered in chicago won more than jet orders over the past two years from airlines in fast growing markets such as china india and the middle east without a major jump in production rates it is largely sold out until yet longtime u s and european customers are finally emerging from a slump that followed the sept terror attacks theyre starting to shop seriously for new planes to replace hundreds of aging jetliners though they previously canceled or delayed hundreds of orders these airlines still feel entitled to priority treatment "if boeing or airbus want our business they can ramp up production " says mel fauscett delta air lines managing director of fleet planning and aircraft acquisition amr corp s american airlines has similar expectations it could soon ask boeing to begin turning out as many as airplanes a year with deliveries starting in late or early say people familiar with the situation at europes airbus boeings archrival top executives question mr carsons tough talk "even though it is probably the smart thing to do scott is going to have a tough time proving that boeing is serious about this " says john leahy airbuss chief operating officer for customers by the end of airbus a unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co expects to build as many as five more single aisle planes every month than boeing it has a similar backlog but is under pressure to generate cash as production on its super jumbo jetliner the a has gotten delayed by two years due to manufacturing snafus mr carson says boeing isnt going to play a game of one upmanship just to match its competitor "we wont follow airbus down that bunny hole were going to make decisions about our production that make sense for boeing " he says instead boeing will agree to a jump in production rates only if it can sustain the pace for at least a couple of years the cost of hiring and training new people on the front end only to lay them off a few months later is "too painful to the entire supply chain" to be worthwhile mr carson says so far boeings greater discipline has resulted in a leaner machine that turns out airplanes more quickly using fewer people than ever before operating profit margins at the commercial airplanes unit reached nearly last year whereas margins had hovered around boeing is also in a better position to take a hard line it diversified its customer base internationally in the years that u s and european carriers stayed on the sidelines things werent always that way in the s u s airlines were king and airplane makers had to ride their ups and downs alongside them in boeing won aircraft orders by promising airlines they could have their planes in just a few months over the next months the company hired workers and set about doubling production to airplanes a month by early top managers describe what happened next as a "train wreck " badly needed components were at such a premium that they were rushed to the factories by private jet helicopter and even taxicab "and that was on a good day when there were parts to deliver " recalls jim jamieson a senior boeing engineer who was brought in to help clean up the mess boeing ended up shutting down its and lines for almost a month mr jamieson who now runs all of the companys airplane factories keeps a photograph of a row of unfinished planes sitting forlornly outside as a reminder of the perils of promising too much "i never ever want to go through that again " he says the company also realized during the crisis that its sales force had struck deals to sell hundreds of airplanes at fire sale prices because financial executives hadnt shared information about how much it actually cost to build one this compounded boeings problems when manufacturing costs ballooned the experience left an indelible mark on a generation of middle managers today many of them are running the place including mr carson then chief financial officer of the commercial airplanes unit he helped lead an effort to revamp boeings approach to sales and production the new no rule he says "we dont sell airplanes on the assumption that the factories have infinite ability to produce them " one of boeings first steps in the years that followed was to require approval of major aircraft orders by a committee of high level managers this team which includes engineers and accountants makes sure the factories can handle the work on the promised timetable boeing also keeps in touch with suppliers monitoring their ability to deliver parts just as crucial is to keep a close watch on the customers and their shifting needs so another team at boeing has refined a process to award delivery slots to important or impatient clients in the event that certain customers get in trouble and dont want the planes they had sought jet purchasing is an unusually complex and fluid process customers can put in firm orders but they also can acquire options for jets entitling them to a set delivery date but giving them the ability to cancel or postpone within a year or so of delivery a still more flexible arrangement is called a purchase right which guarantees a price but no fixed delivery date at boeing a so called skyline team manages a detailed bar chart stretching out for years showing the delivery dates of airplanes in the backlog every monday the commitments board that manages the skyline meets to compare notes on the relative health of customers in certain cases boeing has been able to free up delivery slots for new customers by persuading existing ones to convert options into less definite purchase rights for single aisle s for example it has found that existing clients end up postponing or canceling to of their jet delivery slots the team has used this "melt off" as an opportunity to take care of impatient customers without raising the number of planes the factory turns out its not always possible to find new customers for planes in an economic downturn thats what happened after the terror attacks airlines canceled or postponed orders by the dozens over a few months boeing cut its production in half and laid off people with todays unrelenting demand boeings steadier pace is appreciated by suppliers "i think everybody has learned from the last go round" in the s says mark donegan chairman and chief executive of precision castparts inc in portland ore his industry metal forgings and castings was among the first to warn boeing in the s that it had asked for more parts than suppliers could produce these products used for wings landing gear and engines are ordered the earliest adds marshall larsen chairman and chief executive of goodrich corp which makes landing gear engine cowlings and other items "the last thing suppliers want is to ramp up for all time record production and then find out its not going to last very long " since boeing has boosted its jet output by delivering airplanes in this year boeing says deliveries should increase to about and then to around in at the same time it is enforcing strict training standards for new assembly line workers the company requires new mechanics to attend an unpaid day training course and pass a stringent technical test before being allowed to touch a wrench this means mechanics show up for their first day better prepared for the rigors of boeings factories "boeing has finally realized that the absolute wrong place to be training a new guy is in the middle of a busy shop floor " says mark blondin head of the local chapter of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers which represents most of the blue collar workers in boeings seattle area factories the company demonstrated its restraint in when it refused to pile on overtime for workers after it fell behind a monthlong strike by the machinists forced it to miss more than deliveries boeing chose to work the planes into the schedule over a period of a couple of years even though it meant making customers wait mr carson points to this decision as "a good manifestation of the discipline weve been talking about " but this all could get harder in coming months as the market for new jets is expected to put far more pressure on its production lines some analysts estimate for example that boeing delivered fewer airplanes between and than the market could have handled meaning that the manufacturer will have to scramble to catch up and boeing could lose sales opportunities on some of its most promising new products if customers get frustrated at its full pipelines it already has almost orders for its newest airplane the planned dreamliner first deliveries are scheduled for mid and boeing is telling new customers they wont get dreamliners until some skeptics say boeing will ultimately cave to pressure from impatient airlines even before completing assembly of the first dreamliner it is contemplating how soon it can open a second assembly line some customers and suppliers caution that an overly aggressive ramp up could lead to a production breakdown that would hurt both boeing and its customers "boeing has to be very careful not to mess up on the particularly in light of the problems that airbus has had in bringing the a to market " says steven udvar hazy chairman and chief executive of aircraft leasing giant international lease finance corp which has both s and as on order mr carson knows how tempting it can be to promise quick results for important customers before being promoted to run the commercial airplanes unit last september he did a stint as boeings chief airplane salesman he recalls arguing to his bosses "if you can build more of em we can sell more of em " today he says that if boeing had rushed to boost production as he had wanted "we would have broken something " mr carson makes a point of wandering each month through the factories looking for signs that the production system is under stress he keeps an eye on overtime and quality and a key test is simply to count heads a busy factory looks relatively empty even though there may be people in it when people are standing around as they often were during the meltdown it might mean that they arent getting the parts they need and delays could snowball but mr carson knows that at some point the only answer to meeting the unrelenting demand is to find a way to turn out more airplanes "will we be more successful this time around " he asks "i say yes but weve got to prove it " susan carey
