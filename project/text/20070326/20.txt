consumer technology mix it up now even average music fans can create their own sounds mashup anyone the electric guitar inspired a generation to imagine becoming the next chuck berry or buddy holly now new software lets people dream of becoming the next dj sasha an explosion of software for manipulating music has suddenly given average fans tools for remixing songs and creating new ones from samples tools that were once available only to professional sound engineers or djs such as londons popular dj sasha this proliferation of studio quality software is blurring the line between hobbyist and professional and creating a new culture of home brew music flowing over the web and into clubs "what you can now do with a &# program could only be accomplished years ago with hardware that cost thousands of dollars " says glenn barrett an instructor at the scratch dj academy a school for amateur disc jockeys in new york "things have changed just that much " there are a range of software packages catering to every slice of the growing industry from the novice interested in simply tinkering with prerecorded music to the enthusiastic hobbyist who creates mashups in his bedroom combining elements from multiple songs into a new mix even professional producers and musicians have benefited from the freedom that the software offers them during live performances and production the simplest software offers a bundle of prerecorded samples of music excerpts and synthesized instruments that consumers can insert into their favorite tunes costlier software packages allow consumers to re engineer an entire song from adjusting tempo to inserting or extracting instruments and singers online music libraries have added to the growth of the burgeoning industry offering instrumental tracks and remixes by popular djs that people can then use to create new songs the current explosion of software has been a long time in the making for years the process of recording editing and mixing music was the purview of a producer in a studio who relied on magnetic tape splicing blocks and knob laden consoles the first step forward was the minimoog synthesizer introduced in the early s the keyboard and synthesizer combination altered the music production scene by introducing a range of sounds and effects to the producers repertoire the synthesizer also could emulate other instruments opening the door for other electronic devices such as samplers and drum machines in the s computers and software became the key tools of production which brought more options for splicing and rearranging music samples then in the mid s that professional software began trickling down to consumers an early fan favorite was sonic foundry inc s acid which was released in the program which originally cost about &# sparked a wave of user generated remixes and mashups sonic foundrys music software titles were later acquired by sony corp "acid really put a lot of control in the users hands something that was lacking before it " says francis preve a music producer and software consultant a number of trends are driving the current boom in software personal computers have gotten more powerful which has inspired programmers to create applications with richer features at the same time mp players have boosted the popularity of digital music and club djs have added tunes stored on laptops to their stacks of vinyl records "finding the right music used to be hard but its so accessible now with the internet " says adrian roberts who uses ableton ags live software to create party mixes for clubgoers in san francisco "its a lot faster and a lot cheaper to be a producer of music now " while there is a vast array of consumer software available a handful of the programs have emerged as clear favorites introduced in apple inc s garageband software costs about &# as part of apples ilife software package the program is aimed at amateur producers who want a simple tool to create and edit songs it enables a user to make live recordings and to mix music with a built in library of more than music samples if consumers arent familiar with the music making process the software prevents them from making mistakes for example when a user combines a guitar riff with drums the program automatically makes sure the notes are in tune but the software is limited in its mixing and editing capabilities for instance garageband doesnt allow users to alter the tempo of a newly created track midsong or to pull apart and recombine elements of a song on the fly the way other programs can for all its limits garageband has become popular among amateur mixers since its initial release the software has spawned web sites such as macjams com and icompositions com where users have uploaded hundreds of projects to showcase their engineering talent reason from swedens propellerhead software inc offers a more comprehensive set of tools that allows a user to record edit and arrange music reason which retails for about &# recreates the sounds of a virtual orchestra full of instruments allowing users to create their own sophisticated and elaborate music rather than just mixing previously produced tunes for instance the bays an experimental band from london use reason during live shows to record and play samples on the fly "our products are for producers musicians and djs " says ernst nathorst boos co founder of propellerhead software "but dj is an evolving term and one that over the years has become very inclusive a wider range of people are considered djs that wasnt the case some years ago " abletons live software in its sixth version since the initial release in has garnered the most attention from enthusiasts because of its versatility and accessibility the software package which costs about &# has been adopted by a broad range of users amateur and professional alike alternative rocker beck uses the software to produce and compose music while grunge rock band korn uses it during live performances to layer prerecorded sounds and music snippets into the show the software is also an important tool on the dj scene where electronic dance djs john digweed and sasha use it during their shows "we are benefiting from not just interest in djing by the average joe but there is also this leap in computer processing speeds which has helped the professional community" use the software says david hill general manager at ableton based in germany "any macbook can run our program " mr hill says the founders of ableton live stumbled into the music scene after helping to invent a new virtual synthesizer that incorporated other functions gerhard behles and robert henke set out to create a simpler version the duo worked on a software sequencer which is a program that records and plays back user determined sets of music performance commands the original intent was to use ableton live as a tool to help sound engineers during live performances instead djs adopted the program because it gave them greater control over their live performances since introducing the software mr hill says by the end of ableton live had sold seven million copies the privately held company has grown year over year since and it added new employees last year says mr hill bedroom and professional djs represent nearly of the companys customer base "our dj subscribers like us because we are good for experimenting with songs " says mr hill "its pretty much as simple as drop a few songs into the program and start to play with them " the proliferation of music software has coincided with the growth of web sites where consumers can buy instrumental and electronica tracks and then edit the music to their liking jonas temple chief executive and founder of beatport llc denver says a growing number of customers are hobbyists who want to change songs to suit their tastes whether its cutting the length of a hit single or combining multiple songs into a new mix "the digital platform has lowered the barrier of entry for music creation " says mr temple beatport founded in got its start after mr temple became frustrated over not being able to purchase content over the net for his dj gigs before starting beatport mr temple would buy vinyl albums transfer the music to compact disc and finally transfer the music from disc to his laptop the tedious process degraded the quality of the music beatport now has music from about world wide record labels and competitors have popped up in the form of djdownload ltd s djdownload com and dashboard media llcs internetdj com still some on the dj scene have mixed feelings about all these new tools especially as some hobbyists strike into the professional realm taking their act into dance clubs jaiman yun also known as dj jaysmoke an instructor at the scratch dj academy in new york says many of these newly minted pros arent interested in learning the craft and paying their dues mr yun says years ago it took time to build a record collection sprinkled with personal and crowd favorites today a visit to a handful of web sites could result in "someone owning the same amount of music as a guy thats been djing for years " in many cases mr yun says the newcomers production quality isnt up to par and they dont have the technical skill thats needed to corral clubgoers still mr yun says "ive come to accept it nowadays you cannot buck technology it will just blow you over " mr white is a staff reporter in the wall street journals san francisco bureau he can be reached at bobby white wsj
