elsewhere up the highway in san francisco sen clinton enjoys backing from traditional democratic donors like real estate magnate walter shorenstein and susie tompkins buell co founder of clothing

while first lady worry she is too ideological and would govern from the left other local democrats who have met the year old senator say she can be warm and brilliant in person but often appears cold and calculating on tv causing them to question her electability many doubters are gravitating to sen obama but not necessarily for his policy positions in fact sen obama was recently ranked more liberal than sen clinton by the magazine national journal in its annual survey of political ideology sen obamas life story as a bridge between cultures and races is resonating in this global hub of high technology "silicon valley invests in high powered intellects who are effective at bringing big new ideas to market " says frederick baron a lawyer and obama fund raiser who spent two years in the clinton justice department "in the lexicon of high tech barack obama is the next generation solution " sen obama is particularly popular among techies under age a largely untapped market for

old joe green an internet entrepreneur who brought friends to the event and who plans to hold an obama fund raiser featuring young internet executives soon "people around here are apathetic they think technology changes the world not politics obama is the first candidate people are saying wow we should check him out " even pro clinton families in the area are finding their younger generations turning to sen obama justin buell the year old stepson of mrs tompkins buell says he decided to support sen obama the moment the senator declared his presidential exploratory committee in january even though it meant a family schism "i wanted to do everything that i could" for the senator says mr buell a law student who recently co hosted a fund raiser for sen obama while "theres a break in the family and dinners are spirited we my parents and i just have a different idea of what makes the best candidate " sen clinton isnt giving up she raised &# million at two small silicon valley events over the weekend at a gathering in woodside the hosts included ms tompkins buell and mark chandler a senior vice president at cisco systems inc charles phillips president of oracle corp was among the hosts of an event in redwood city although several of her husbands longtime backers in the area remain uncommitted or arent supporting her the candidate is building her own silicon valley network led by the growing ranks of women executives at technology companies supporters say "hillarys been in or near public service for or years that kind of experience is important for running a country " says sheryl sandberg a senior google inc executive and clinton campaign fund raiser who was chief of staff for former treasury secretary lawrence summers sen clinton has some big guns at her disposal earlier this month larry stone one of president clintons earliest and most prolific fund raisers in silicon valley was summoned to a private meeting with the former president mr stone says he told mr clinton he wasnt ready to sign on to sen clintons campaign still as they browsed in a monterey calif bookstore mr clinton pressed his wifes case "he said john edwards and obama are young and good looking but hillary has the experience " says mr stone a local politician and real estate developer he says mr clinton was "persuasive " but mr stone declined to commit because he worries sen clinton isnt electable other democrats with white house ambitions are looking to tap into silicon valley support sen christopher dodd of connecticut addressed a small group of tech executives over lunch

than money in the election software computer and internet companies ranked th among industry sectors as sources of campaign funds lagging far behind for example the legal first and financial fifth industries according to the center for responsive politics in washington but campaign experts say silicon valley offers candidates something unique a place or at least an image on the cutting edge many silicon valley democrats say they had hoped former virginia gov mark warner would enter the race a southern moderate he earned his fortune investing in cellular phone companies but when he and another favored centrist indiana sen evan bayh decided not to run and sen obama went for it "the real movers in political fund raising suddenly rallied to obama " says mr baron the silicon valley lawyer and a veteran political bundler part of sen clintons trouble is the perception here that she is an ideological liberal obama fund raiser wade randlett co founder of technology network a silicon valley trade group says he and other early bill clinton supporters viewed the former first lady as an impediment to their pro business agenda during mr clintons first term on health care tort reform and fiscal policy mr randlett says mrs clinton tried to pull the president to the left "it was the east wing vs the west wing " he says sen obamas supporters acknowledge their candidate is largely untested on policy matters and there is no certainty that he would be more conservative than sen clinton on health care tort reform or fiscal policy it is his persona they say that is generating excitement "no ones calling me about baracks stands on business or tech issues " says john roos the obama point man in silicon valley and chief executive of the law firm wilson sonsini goodrich &amp rosati "this is a phenomenon of a leader of a new generation who has the potential to bring this country together " sen clintons supporters say the attraction is sure to wear thin they also say the former first lady has gotten a bum rap as an old guard liberal "she was far less of a policy person than people think " says david barram a former chief financial officer of apple and senior clinton administration official beyond the contenders it is mr gore a noncandidate who may carry the most political sway in silicon valley these days a part time resident of san francisco where he owns a home and co founded a cable news network mr gore is a paid adviser to google he sits on the board of apple and is an apostle of clean energy the latest fever sweeping venture capital investors many people assume mr gores presence explains why messrs jobs and doerr and google ceo eric schmidt all close friends of the former vice president havent endorsed a candidate associates of those men say mr gore has requested no course of action of them "id like to see some people talking about how we in the tech industry spur innovation in this country " says hewlett packard co ceo mark hurd who hasnt endorsed a presidential candidate "i would sign up for that "
