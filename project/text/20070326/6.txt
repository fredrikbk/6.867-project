blockbuster drug plavix draws pack of rivals anticlotting medicine has had huge growth but weaknesses exist troubles with drug coated stents popular heart devices implanted to prop open clogged coronary arteries are intensifying an emerging battle in the burgeoning &# billion market for a type of medicine that prevents blood clots eli lilly &amp co astrazeneca plc and schering plough corp all have new blood thinning drugs in or nearing late stage development that are poised to take on plavix the blockbuster sold by bristol myers squibb co and sanofi aventis sa plavix is a dominant player in the market for therapies that prevent the platelets cells in the blood responsible for coagulation from clumping together and it ranks as the worlds second best selling drug after pfizer inc s lipitor none of plavixs major potential competitors is yet on the market each is hoping to compete by outdoing plavix in one way or another by more effectively blocking platelets or involving less bleeding or offering a product that flushes out of the body more quickly the challenges to plavix are gathering strength as physicians increasingly use the medication in an effort to prevent the rare but serious risk of blood clots forming in drug coated stents months or years after the devices are implanted while current regulatory recommendations call for use of plavix for three to six months depending on the brand of stent recently issued guidelines from professional societies urge doctors to prescribe the medicine to patients with recently implanted drug coated stents for at least a year and often longer in january plavix prescriptions jumped over year ago numbers says catherine arnold pharmaceutical industry analyst at credit suisse up from growth during the first half of last year "its a big market thats been growing at double digit rates and its been a monopoly " she says in addition to use in stent patients the pill is prescribed for patients with histories of recent heart attacks or strokes poor leg circulation and a group of heart conditions known as acute coronary syndrome some analysts project the market for plavix and drugs like it will nearly double to &# billion by plavix though comes with worrisome issues it can cause excessive bleeding costs up to &# a pill at retail and takes about five days to clear out of the body during which time surgical procedures and dental care can be messy and dangerous yet stopping treatment for up to a week can heighten the risk of clots forming especially in stent patients bristol myers says the drug reduces more significant events like heart attacks than it causes major bleeding "theres a balance that has to be struck between the efficacy and the risk of these drugs and the problem becomes major when you talk about extending therapy from weeks and months to years " says james ferguson a cardiologist at the texas heart institute in houston and an associate professor at baylor university "anything you can do to reduce long term risk would be a real winner if it doesnt compromise efficacy " erin oconnell peiffer of eldersburg md a year old stay at home mother with heart disease has been on plavix and aspirin another anti platelet drug since undergoing a double bypass surgery in she worries about costs she pays &# out of pocket for a day supply but she is especially troubled by frequent nosebleeds bruising that happens if shes "hit by a feather " and concerns about bleeding if she needs surgery after kicking a soccer ball recently with her nine year old daughter she was surprised to see her legs covered with bruises "most were about the size of a quarter and were initially an angry purple or black shade and took about ten days to fade away " she says "if drug companies are looking at something that would give me the same protection without the bleeding id be all for taking it " closest to market among the contenders is lillys prasugrel which investors view as the companys most important pill in development the indianapolis concern which is co developing the drug with daiichi sankyo inc of japan plans to file for u s approval later this year if it gets a green light prasugrel could be on the market as early as the second half of credit suisse estimates prasugrel could eventually realize up to &# billion in annual sales like plavix prasugrel works by binding to a receptor that inhibits platelets clotting function until the body replenishes the platelets about every five days prasugrels potential upside lilly says is that it could act faster than plavix block platelets more effectively and help patients who are resistant to plavix but it may not improve on the bleeding risk that hangs over plavix "with any of the stronger anticlotting drugs we would anticipate a higher bleeding risk " says christopher cannon a cardiologist at brigham and womens hospital boston who led a midstage study of astrazenecas compound that drug called azd is being tested in an patient study that london based astrazeneca hopes will lead to its filing for regulatory approval in the drugs blood thinning properties appear to be reversible in about hours because it detaches from the platelet receptor at low concentrations in the body that would be a boon for instance for patients needing surgery but patients may need to take the pill twice a day to maintain protection against clots schering ploughs compound known as sch works by binding selectively to a different receptor on platelets than the other molecules and the company hopes that will give the drug a bleeding advantage it could also reduce inflammation in the arteries that can cause vessels to become more prone to blockages in early studies the drug was found to work in most patients in one hour much more quickly than some competitors an indication of sch s promise came saturday when researchers presented results of a phase ii or midstage clinical trial at the american college of cardiology conference in new orleans the trial was designed to look at the safety of using the schering drug on top of plavix and aspirin in patients undergoing angioplasty many of whom got drug eluting stents the new agent showed no increase in bleeding while appearing to decrease the number of cardiovascular events in patients treated the drug recently received so called fast track review status at the food and drug administration that will hasten its evaluation once the company files an application the company expects the drug to enter large phase three studies this year putting it on the market as early as fred hassan schering ploughs chairman and chief executive says the product is now the most important in the companys pipeline with over &# billion in sales potential due to the large unmet medical need a novel method of action and the possibility to be administered as a standalone therapy "this is a product were following and nurturing " he said "if this is a transformational opportunity it could be the breakout weve been looking for that has the same impact on this company that the cholesterol business had a few years ago " the u s unit of eisai co of japan and the medicines co parsippany n j are testing new anticlotting drugs as well theres no assurance that these drugs will make it to the market the field is littered with high profile failures that didnt achieve a safe balance between clotting and bleeding moreover plavix is scheduled to lose patent protection as soon as shortly after many of the new medicines are expected to become available and sales were already cannibalized last year by the short term entrance of generic competition to compete with cheaper generic pills drugs like prasugrel will likely have to prove they offer an advantage worth a premium price meanwhile bristol myers and sanofi are not giving up on plavix at the cardiology conference long term data on plavix from two separate patient registries is being presented in hopes of showing longer term outcomes in real world settings bernadette connaughton bristol myerss senior vice president for cardiovascular and metabolics says "theres a lot of work to be done between now and " and the company is confident that the drug will remain competitive because of its broad array of indications and proven record in million patients
