accounting standard setters independent and tough arthur levitt has been a consistent supporter of good accounting standards and he raises many valid issues in his march editorial page commentary "standards deviation " my own involvement in accounting standards setting as chairman of the financial accounting foundation faf is due indirectly to mr levitt persuading me to be a member of the independence standards board in the late s mr levitt is right about the importance of avoiding a constituency orientation in the activities of the financial accounting standards board fasb and the governmental accounting standards board gasb and hes right in calling attention to the need for a long term stable funding source for the gasb of the kind that the fasb now has but in several respects his essay suffers from fighting the last war rather than addressing todays critical issues as a result of the funding mechanism sarbanes oxley created for the fasb this private sector standards setter is no longer vulnerable to funding pressures the faf freed from funding pressures for the fasb has been able to provide the gasb the funds it needs even if some state and local governmental entities oppose some of the gasbs decisions the best proof of the independence and effectiveness of the fasb and the gasb is their accomplishments in the past few years in the fasb in the face of enormous opposition from some corporations and many congressional leaders and with the help of some courageous supporters such as mr levitt adopted a standard requiring options expensing which during the s had been the third rail issue of american accounting the fasb also has dealt successfully with the highly charged issues of putting the full unfunded or overfunded pension and other post employment benefit opeb position on the balance sheet it completed that project in well under a year the fasb shut down the use of special purpose entities and hidden guarantees of the type used by enron to accomplish off balance sheet financing given this record of accomplishment there is no reason to question the fasbs ability to deal fairly with remaining high priority issues on its agenda including the income statement treatment of pensions and accounting for leases in a way that is more meaningful for investors similarly the gasb has been tackling the tough issues making governmental accounting better serve users and imposing substantial new requirements for better financial disclosure by state and local governments gasb statement no will for the first time require governments to recognize annual opeb expense on an accrual basis as government employees earn the benefits and to disclose their unfunded past service liability this is resulting in bringing to light one of the toughest and often most hidden issues of american public finance statement has required governments for the first time to produce government wide full accrual basic financial statements with the reporting of infrastructure assets and the inclusion of an md&amp a section the fasb and gasb both are putting investors and other users at the center of their missions and taking concrete steps to improve user input to the standard setting process in addition to the actions cited by mr levitt the fasb created an investor task force placed two users on the emerging issues task force which plays a critical role in addressing new and time critical accounting issues and involved users in virtually all its working and resource groups in order for the fasbs agenda to be driven significantly by user input the trustees of the faf take very seriously their responsibility to appoint individuals to those boards who will act with full independence to make financial statements better serve the needs of users for clear comparable and meaningful financial information as they demonstrated in standing up to corporate and governmental pressure on options expensing the trustees act to protect the independence of the standards setters when they are attacked by special interest groups seeking to block or reverse the decisions of the boards robert e denham chairman financial accounting foundation norwalk conn
