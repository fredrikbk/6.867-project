funding deals on the cheap grows harder shift in tide challenges firms like blackstone planning their ipos blackstone group is counting on stock investors to gobble up its initial public offering but a different set of investors the people who buy debt could make the task more difficult cheap credit has allowed buyout funds to mint money the past few years by borrowing large sums at low interest rates blackstone group and its competitors have cheaply funded corporate takeovers but some early signs are emerging that credit markets are becoming less forgiving that could mean the fortunes of blackstone and other private equity firms which buy businesses on behalf of their investors and hold them privately before selling them once again may be reaching a plateau amid recent turmoil in global financial markets a handful of bond sales have priced at higher rates than bankers and companies expected trw automotive holdings corp an auto parts supplier bought by blackstone in this month issued part of a &# billion bond sale at an interest rate of higher than the rate bankers targeted freeport mcmoran copper &amp gold inc pulled off a &# billion bond sale but had to pay interest of on some of the debt after seeking or less univision communications inc sold some bonds at half a percentage point higher than planned "i think the debt market is becoming a lot more picky investors now think before they buy and are not just buying anything in sight " says raymond kennedy a junk bond fund manager at pacific investment management co principals at blackstone are acutely aware of the risk pricier debt would alter the economics that have made buyouts so lucrative when it described its initial public offering to potential investors in a filing with the securities and exchange commission last week blackstone group warned that benign conditions in global financial markets may change blackstone said its extensive use of borrowed money to finance its investments was another risk the ipo is expected in a few months in february speeches before news of the blackstone ipo broke both stephen schwarzman co founder of the company and its president hamilton e "tony" james tried to tone down expectations that the golden performance of the past two years could continue indefinitely last year alone blackstone reaped &# billion in net income besides using debt to fund acquisitions buyout shops like blackstone have depended on debt markets to raise money to pay themselves special dividends to reap quick returns on their investments blackstone hasnt yet been able to do so on some of its big bets from last year including the takeovers of chip maker freescale semiconductor inc retailer michaels stores inc and market research company nielsen co some recent buyout deals could face other challenges private equity funds try to increase earnings at the companies they take over and take dividends out of robust cash flows a slower economy could make that more difficult some blackstone partners say they see corporate profit margins beginning to erode last week motorola inc said it expected sales profitability and cash flow to be "substantially below" expectations due to weakness in its mobile devices unit that potentially affects blackstone because of the sales of freescale which it and its partners agreed to buy in september for more than &# billion go to motorola freescales former parent freescales bonds came under pressure after the motorola news chris wood strategist at clsa securities in hong kong warns that aggressive bank lending behind the buyout boom is a "disaster waiting to happen " of course easy credit could continue extending the remarkable run of the entire private equity industry and private equity shops still hold considerable sway on wall street indeed a large volume of debt deals are getting done despite sometimes tougher market conditions last week travelport which blackstone group bought last year raised &# billion in a loan with terms favorable to the buyout shop including a provision allowing it to delay paying interest if times become bad proceeds went to pay blackstone a dividend "credit markets outside subprime mortgages are still operating smoothly " michael feroli a j p morgan securities economist said in a report friday referring to mortgages sold to borrowers with shaky credit histories in the case of trw it was bankers not blackstone who paid the price for tougher markets wall street banks had bid aggressively to manage trws bond offering guaranteeing a low interest rate when the banks couldnt fetch the rates they targeted they had to pay trw &# million to reimburse it for the additional interest expense it will incur blackstone took trw public in and retains a stake spokesmen from the underwriters lehman brothers holdings inc goldman sachs group inc merrill lynch &amp co bank of america corp and deutsche bank ag declined to comment as did a spokesman for trw private equity firms also face the threat of a regulatory backlash in the u s the justice department is investigating the industry for possible collusion in bidding for deals the sec filing also refers to legislative proposals in denmark and germany that would limit the tax benefits of taking on debt which would have an adverse effect on the profitability of investments in those markets blackstones own acquisition plans are another potential clue about its moderating expectations it could use its new publicly listed stock to make acquisitions some blackstone partners think the firm ought to seal an identity as a broad asset management firm by acquiring traditional money managers such as fidelity investments the mutual fund giant such a move would broaden blackstones mandate but dilute its own stellar private equity performance
