americas pension deficit disorder ever since mexican president felipe calderon won election in july with just under of the vote critics and supporters alike have cast doubt on his ability to govern but now it looks like mr calderon who is less than four months into his six year term and lacks a majority in congress may be about to pocket a major legislative victory and on no less an issue than the transformation of the pension system covering federal workers from pay as you go to a fully funded system of individual accounts as such a revolutionary breakthrough in corporatist mexico suggests the deal has implications for the calderon presidency that reach far beyond the matter at hand among other things it is an indication of mr calderons political savvy he seems to understand the importance of early momentum and knows how to engage those outside his party in a constructive agenda his predecessor vicente fox had little political acumen and the resulting gridlock in the area of badly needed liberal economic reform damaged growth under a more effective leader mexico might start to live up to its potential the catalyst for this reform is the grim outlook for mexicos institute of social security for government employees known by its spanish initials as issste and pronounced ee stay which manages the pension accounts and health benefits of some million active and retired federal employees these include bureaucrats doctors nurses health care workers and teachers but not the employees of the state owned oil company pemex issstes pension arm currently provides retirement benefits to individuals and like so many pay as you go systems the agency is operating in the red with an average retirement age of and retirees living longer issste has obligations that far outstrip its income and every year the deficit grows in issstes pension deficit was billion pesos &# million this year the government has set aside billion pesos to fill the gap by the shortfall is forecast to hit billion pesos according to the finance ministry issstes actuarial deficit in pensions is equal to over of mexican gross domestic product issste is a ticking time bomb its not like mr calderon and treasury secretary agustin carstens had to convince union leadership of this reality mexicans have been known to joke that the best workers in the issste system could hope for is to die early before the house of cards collapses still the calderon government did have to win agreement from the union bosses for individual accounts and it also had to find enough votes in congress from the opposition to get it through thats what makes this victory historic the centerpiece of the reform which passed the lower house last week and is expected to pass the senate this week is the establishment of worker owned individual accounts to replace the communal pool at issste there are no changes for those already retired current workers will have the choice of staying with the governments defined benefit plan and accepting gradual increases in the retirement age or migrating to the new individual account defined contribution system the new plan differs from the pension reform for private sector workers carried out in in that it gives those who migrate to the new system a bond which represents their vested rights and which will be rolled over into their new individual account this makes the plan closer to the chilean pension reform than to the previous mexican reform another similarity to chile is the fact that new hires will not have the option of joining the old system through attrition all government employees will eventually be owners of their pensions one of the important but underplayed provisions of the bill is the change in portability under the old system workers who left their government jobs for the private sector before completing years of service lost their acquired pension benefits this created an incentive for dissatisfied employees to stay at their jobs even if they had an opportunity to do something more suitable in the private sector under the new system benefits become portable and employees are free to pursue career changes without penalty to get the plan through the government did have to pony up some serious pesos it agreed to dump an extra eight billion into issstes fund for health benefits throw another two billion into a low cost loan program for employees and increase its regular contributions to worker pension accounts the government will also transfer billion pesos of worker pensions that are now managed by banks to a new arm of issste dubbed pensionissste that will own the monopoly privilege of managing pension assets for both the old system and the new system for three years this is why the reform is not considered a "privatization " pensionissste raises lots of red flags since the monopoly has promised to invest in government projects such as housing and highways such "investment" in mexico over the past four decades has been synonymous with financial ruin one check that may help mitigate management mischief is the fact that the government agency will have to abide by legally binding pension guidelines of portfolio diversification investment grade paper and restrictions on equity positions that already constrain private sector pension managers with proper oversight disaster may be averted finally it is worth noting the political developments surrounding this reform its not surprising that the union leadership seems to have preferred to work with mr calderons national action party pan over the far left revolutionary democratic party prd the prds leader andres manuel lopez obrador knows how to redistribute wealth but he doesnt know how to create it with mexican budgets strained it is pretty clear that the latter is the key to the retirement security for workers but it is the cooperation of the institutional revolutionary party pri along with two smaller parties that made the difference the pension reform suggests that the pri is interested in restoring its image by constructively participating in governance rather than continuing to play the obstructionist role it held during the fox government if the pan under mr calderons leadership is big enough to share the credit mexico might experience more important changes where this one came from write to ogrady wsj com
