politics &amp economics divisions hinder efforts at justice department two differing camps emerge as former chief of staff is set to testify about firings washington justice department efforts to contain the damage from the dismissal of eight u s attorneys are being hampered by two camps with differing loyalties that have emerged within the department loyalists to deputy attorney general paul mcnulty have criticized how attorney general alberto gonzaless staff has handled the political controversy now engulfing the department people familiar with the matter say mr gonzales and his aides meanwhile say that it is mr mcnultys senate testimony that began the fallout for the department these people say some justice officials describe a tension that is unusual even for a department that is no stranger to clashes between attorneys general and their deputies emblematic of the strain is the departments inability to come up with one complete explanation after more than two months of public questions for the dismissal that brought the matter to prominence the firing of bud cummins as u s attorney in little rock ark mr mcnulty stands by his feb senate testimony that while mr cummins was fired for "no cause " the seven other ousted prosecutors were dismissed for performance related reasons justice officials say mr cummins was told in june he was being removed to make way for tim griffin a former assistant to presidential adviser karl rove mr griffin has removed himself from consideration for nomination mr gonzales however believes that mr cummins was among those who were to be let go for poor performance and has told officials he doesnt know whether he would have supported mr cumminss ouster otherwise department officials say tasia scolinos a justice department spokeswoman yesterday acknowledged the different explanations for the cummins firing and said in a statement "the attorney generals reaction to the deputy attorney generals statement described in the email was based on his assumption that the resignations of all eight u s attorneys in question were solely performance based but after that he realized that cumminss departure is different in timing and circumstance from the other seven " she declined to be more specific about what role mr gonzales now believes performance played in mr cumminss removal some internal tension could come to a head on thursday when kyle sampson mr gonzaless former chief of staff who helped coordinate the firings testifies before the senate judiciary committee some department officials are concerned that mr sampsons testimony may cast wider blame for the matter on others including messrs gonzales and mcnulty bradford berenson an attorney for mr sampson said in a statement "the fact that the white house and justice department had been discussing this subject for several years was well known to a number of other senior officials at the department including others who were involved in preparing the departments testimony to congress if this background was not called to mr mcnulty or top justice official william moschellas attention it was not because any of these individuals deliberately withheld it from them but rather because no one focused on it or deemed it important at the time the focus of preparation efforts was on why the u s attorneys had been replaced not how " the first suggestion of tension came in a feb email exchange included in pages of documents the justice department released last week in the exchange brian roehrkasse a justice spokesman says "the attorney general is extremely upset with the stories on the us attys sic this morning he also thought some of the dags deputy attorney general statements were inaccurate " late friday the department released nearly more pages of documents these included for the first time references to a late november meeting where mr gonzales was present to prepare for the prosecutor firings mr gonzales said earlier this month that he left the details of the firings to be handled by mr sampson justice officials say the documents dont contradict mr gonzaless remarks suggesting he had no knowledge of the details of the firings until he signed off on them late in the process mr sampson has since resigned ms scolinos says any split inside the department isnt the result of a personal rift between mr gonzales and his deputy the two men continue to enjoy a "good working relationship " she said to be sure some of the tension is built into the justice departments structure which includes a deputy attorney generals office that historically enjoys free rein in handling day to day affairs and an attorney generals office that acts as the public face of the department there are examples of previous department splits over policy such as former deputy attorney general james comeys disagreement with white house officials over the national security agencys warrantless domestic wiretapping program in last year mr mcnulty got the justice department into hot water after the white house was caught off guard by a federal bureau of investigation search for documents in the office of rep william jefferson a democrat from louisiana mr mcnulty won the support of mr gonzales in a showdown with the white house over whether the department had violated the legal separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of government
