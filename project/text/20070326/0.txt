the right to bear arms does that really mean you ted cruz resorts to obfuscating legalese in his use of the second amendment as justification for private citizens to own firearms "second amendment showdown " editorial page march he studiously avoids citing the amendment in its entirety and selectively quotes only fragments in support of his argument the second amendment to the constitution is presented here in its entirety "a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed " the second amendment was written in the style of the th century and it is therefore not as direct and declarative as our current writing style however the reading public should have little difficulty understanding its meaning private citizens shouldnt use the second amendment as their right to own firearms samuel m ringel tamarac fla mr cruz makes a convincing argument that the second amendment protects individual rights to bear arms but then says that its ok for government to restrict gun ownership but not ban it outright where in the constitution does it say that the second amendment is absolute in its phrasing "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed " it says what it means no infringement not just a little infringement who is mr cruz and the state of texas to argue otherwise the founders provided no exception for felons or the mentally deranged nothing about where you can or cannot take a gun airplanes or schoolhouses for example in fact since "arms" includes weapons other than guns why should citizens be prohibited from owning say a rocket propelled grenade if someone can afford one and someone is willing to sell one as the nra is happy to tell you what this country needs is more guns not less j cortese ph d the woodlands texas mr cruzs commentary referring to the decision by the u s court of appeals rejecting the ninth circuit ban on guns exemplifies the blinders worn by pro gun supporters i agree that the fewer restrictions the better i have no problem with the right to keep and bear arms where i have a problem is when those people who want the right to bear arms show little or no compassion for the people and families who have been killed or injured by the use of guns the people in washington d c have a very serious problem with guns that have been inappropriately used stored or transported should we ignore the people who have lost their right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness if mr cruz does not want guns to be banned he should help find solutions to the problems washington and other areas of our country are tackling there are no easy answers but to demonize gun control only helps to divide our citizens this is a very difficult and complex issue that needs all parties to come together to find solutions we have enough division in this country i would like to challenge mr cruz to become a uniter not a divider barbara h lapham naples fla
