telecommunications whats new in wireless a look at mobile devices and services you can expect in the next year and beyond remember when cellphones were just for calling over the past few years cellphones have evolved from simple communication devices into multimedia powerhouses first came cameras then web surfing then music players now get ready for a host of new features in the next two to three years consumers will be able to get tv broadcasts on their cellphones with better picture quality than current video offerings and a greater range of live programming from major networks like nbc fox abc and comedy central users will also get sophisticated software applications for surfing the mobile web and more services to connect with friends share videos and exchange photos and theyll likely see mobile devices that can roam seamlessly across wi fi hot spots cellular networks and new high speed data networks bringing a much faster and smoother surfing experience and thats just the beginning in the longer term advances in battery display and storage technology could make it possible to squeeze ever more functions onto smaller handsets and cellphones could extend even further beyond the realm of communications to be used as credit cards to pay for groceries and airline tickets id cards to swipe at security checkpoints and data storage devices as is often the case in the wireless industry many of the new services are originating in east asia with carriers in japan and south korea and trickling west to europe and the u s everyone has a stake in innovation cellphone operators in developed markets face slowing subscriber growth as the percentage of consumers who dont own a cellphone shrinks to boost revenue they have to find new ways to integrate mobile devices into peoples lives similarly handset manufacturers have to convince people who already own phones to buy new ones start ups have dreams of going public or being bought out to the tune of billions heres a closer look at some of the areas of mobile that will be busiest in the years to come mobile video mobile video is just beginning to catch on with only about of u s subscribers watching it today consumers can watch short streaming clips of news sports and entertainment pro grams on some major carriers customers of many operators can also sign up for the service offered by mobitv inc of emeryville calif which provides about channels of programming from major tv networks and content providers among other features the service lets you watch a selection of programs at the same time theyre broadcast on television theres a slight delay in the broadcasts and the local commercials are different but otherwise the programs are the same the service costs about &# a month and users must also buy a data plan from their carrier that usually runs &# to &# a month some challengers are betting they can do better mobitvs service runs over the same cellphone networks that carry calls and let users download ringtones which limits its video quality the rivals think they can offer a better picture and quicker channel changing by building dedicated networks for broadcasting tv shows to phones and at least in theory the broadcast networks are more efficient for delivering video and could result in lower costs for consumers mediaflo usa inc a subsidiary of cellular chip maker qualcomm inc already has such a network in place verizon wireless a joint venture of verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc of the u k has started offering mediaflos service to its customers in markets with a bigger deployment coming the service is priced at &# or &# as a package with music and web surfing its available on a samsung phone that costs &# with a two year contract after a &# rebate another phone from lg electronics inc is on the way at&amp t inc formerly called cingular wireless will offer mediaflos service later this year in south korea and japan carriers have been offering these kinds of mobile broadcasts for some time and theyre already having success research firm in stat predicts mobile video revenue in asia will reach &# billion by mobitv whose service has more than two million subscribers has plans of its own the company says it is working toward a future when users will be able to pay one fee to subscribe to tv service and watch it on any internet capable device whether its a mobile phone a pc or a television already the company has struck a deal to have its mobile tv service marketed to at&amp ts dsl customers so they can watch mobitv channels on their pcs the next step would be integrating the service into tv sets "it wont be perfect overnight but the goal is to create a seamless experience where you have access to pretty much any tv you want on any of your devices " says paul scanlan mobitvs co founder and chief operating officer in addition carriers will increasingly integrate user generated video into their services carriers have already made deals with the likes of video sharing sites youtube and revver to make their videos available over cell networks carriers are also likely to develop a greater amount of original programming tailored to mobile phones by partnering with other providers for example gotv networks inc of sherman oaks calif supplies mobile tv programming to u s carriers the company is developing a mobile tv series based on the friendship of four teenage girls centered on a main character named bailey the show called "being bailey " is shown in three to five minute episodes called "mobisodes " gotvs chief executive david bluhm declined to say when the series will launch and on which carriers advertising so far part of what has deterred consumers from using mobile video services is price "the bigger limitation isnt going to be technology the bigger limitation is going to be consumers willingness to pay for it " says jeff glass a venture partner at bain capital wireless carriers often charge consumers as much as &# a month for access to their mobile tv offerings plus additional charges for premium services like mobitv but carriers world wide are beginning to think about lowering the cost of video content as well as mobile web access and other content services by carrying ads vodafone has said it will take that path big carriers in the u s like verizon and sprint nextel corp are said to be considering it too carriers are just beginning to toy with those business models they arent likely to give up video subscription revenue easily especially given the continuing declines theyre seeing in voice revenue but over time many analysts say carriers could come to view advertising as an even greater source of revenue than subscription the logic by lowering prices operators could spur the kind of consumer usage of web and video services that would attract big spending by marketers another factor that might push carriers to the ad model theyre in a strong position to become ad brokers or at least partner with intermediaries that can help sell ads carriers have access to a wealth of information about subscribers that could help marketers better target their ads including what sites customers view what content they download and where they live carriers havent put much of this information to use yet anxious about protecting user privacy but most analysts expect they will eventually take advantage of their unique position the trick for carriers will be to avoid alienating consumers by keeping ads "highly entertaining and relevant " says anil malhotra founder of bango net ltd a u k based firm that helps companies develop mobile web services meanwhile some start up companies including rhythm newmedia inc of mountain view calif are developing the technology to help carriers insert snippets of video advertisements before tv programs britains hutchison g uk ltd has already announced it will use rhythm newmedias system to embed ads in a range of free video content including news comedy and celebrity gossip which it will offer free beginning in april vodafone and deutsche telekom ags t mobile are testing out rhythm newmedias technology video spots would add to the other forms of advertising that have already been tested on mobile web pages including sponsored text links and graphic banners beyond communications cellphones have already evolved into cameras and music and video players now device makers and carriers are eyeing other possible uses for mobile handsets one promising area using phones as credit cards to make small purchases at the dry cleaner movie theater or gas station consumers would hold the phone up to a reader and automatically make a payment using funds they had electronically stored on the device japans ntt docomo inc has already signed up million customers for its mobile credit card service other handset makers like samsung electronics co nokia corp and motorola inc are taking a close look at the idea too in the u s at&amp ts wireless unit is conducting a test of a system called mastercard paypass through partnerships with nokia and citigroup inc another area of interest is beefing up global positioning system services more phones in the u s and abroad are coming with gps chips built in to pinpoint a users location to date that feature has mostly been used for navigation applications it will become more popular analysts say in services that let users track the whereabouts of their friends and family start up carrier helio a los angeles based joint venture of earthlink inc and sk telecom co and sprint nextel subsidiary boost mobile have already launched such buddy finder applications gps could also be used to help people search on phones for their local pizzeria or flower shop without having to type in a zip code as they do on the mobile search applications available now nokia is trying to combine gps and other technologies under a plan called "augmented reality " the idea still a ways off from coming to market is that consumers could point a phone with a built in video camera at a building or person and have relevant information pop up on the screen so pointing a phone at a restaurant down the street for example could bring up a menu and scanning a stadium with the phone could help locate a friend in the nearer term nokia is opening up its gps and mapping information to third party software developers hoping theyll come up with catchy services "which one of them will take off on a big scale nobody knows " says tero ojanpera the handset makers chief technology officer another creative application says richard wong of venture firm accel partners will be letting consumers blog about particular locations as they travel then those blog entries would be automatically tagged with their geographical coordinates so if you were to post photos or blogs from say a scenic rest stop on a long drive others could find the same spot later companies like new york based kamida that offer such "geotagging" services now require people to enter their location manually but are integrating gps to remove that step looking even further down the road researchers are looking at ways to integrate printers into phones that are capable of producing color photo prints a company called zink imaging llc of waltham mass says it has found a way to print color images without ink or ribbons by using special paper with crystals that can be dyed through heat and there are even more ambitious innovations on the drawing board docomo has a promotional video that describes its vision of the future tracking a day in the life of mr kotani a fictional japanese businessman who uses a mobile handset for a variety of functions when he arrives at the office his device communicates with nearby security checkpoints to confirm his arrival and validate his identity at a meeting with a client it stores files that he uses for his presentation and throughout the office it projects holographic images of an assistant helping him to plan his day "all of those functions combined should be provided by a single handset " says masaki yoshikawa president and chief executive of docomos u s unit given all the new services being crammed into phones and the likelihood that consumers will continue demanding the slimmest and smallest devices possible device makers face two huge challenges how do they maintain battery life and create displays that are large enough for consumers to enjoy in japan docomo and no carrier kddi corp are developing small portable fuel cells to provide additional power to cellphones through partnerships with aquafairy co toshiba corp and hitachi ltd theres a potential solution in the works for the display issue as well polymer vision ltd a netherlands based spinoff of philips electronics nv has developed a rollable paper like display technology that consumers would unfold to create a large screen for their small device making it easier to watch movies view maps and surf the web the screen would fold up into the phone when not in use the first product its offering is the readius a pda with data capabilities but without voice capabilities for now it will be available from telecom italia spa sometime this year with mobile phone versions to come later the prices will be set by the carriers better access one of the mobile webs biggest limitations has been access consumers want a high speed connection wherever they go at a decent price cellphone carriers g or third generation networks are good for downloading music and checking sports scores and offer good coverage but they are still too slow to support heavy web surfing all of that is changing in coming years consumers will have multiple ways to access the web at high speeds first theres wi fi most people know wi fi as a way for laptops to get a high speed wireless connection to the web but as wi fi hot spots proliferate handset makers are beginning to include wi fi chips in their phones so the phones can jump back and forth between cellular and wi fi networks not only does that mean faster surfing but you dont use any costly minutes when you roll your regular voice calls onto a wi fi network carriers will likely charge a few dollars a month for such services over cellphones now come with wi fi access built in from manufacturers such as samsung nokia and htc corp apple inc s iphone also includes a wi fi chip still to make these phones useful in the growing number of hot spots manufacturers need to strike agreements with hot spot operators like boingo wireless inc of santa monica calif which oversees more than access points globally and t mobile usa a part of deutsche telekom ag which has that will enable users to take their phone to a starbucks airport or hotel and keep using it without having to go through several logins "its one thing to bolt a wi fi radio into a phone " says sky dayton a technology entrepreneur who founded both helio and boingo "its another to make it a seamless experience for the user thats where the magic is " sony corp for one has already made a deal with a big hot spot provider the companys mylo device a personal media player that enables mobile web surfing instant messaging and multimedia downloads comes with one year of free access to t mobile usa hot spots there are other high speed options on the way cellular carriers are upgrading their existing networks to make them more powerful and some are investing in entirely new ones to make significant jumps in speed in the u s sprint nextel has said it plans to spend up to &# billion to roll out a higher speed network based on a technology called wimax making it available to million americans by the end of the company says the service should initially offer speeds of two megabits to four megabits per second roughly twice as fast as wi fi at prices comparable to those of cable operators which are usually around &# per month sprint nextel chief technology officer barry west predicts speeds will rise to megabits per second in the future and he says that will lead to a big change in the industry with mobile surfing so easy and fast people will want to use mobile devices that are specifically built for surfing rather than making phone calls an example nokias n personal media tablet which has a big screen and easy access to email the internet and chat services "the personal media player is going to be a big part of the wimax world " mr west says later he says video cameras gaming devices and other consumer electronics could be equipped with wimax access in asia operators have similar plans in south korea a technology similar to wimax known as wibro is taking hold in japan docomo is planning for an ambitious upgrade by an ultra high speed wireless network that it says will allow download speeds of up to megabits per second that would put the network on par with the highest end fiber optic landline internet connections mr sharma is a staff reporter in the wall street journals new york bureau he can be reached at amol sharma wsj com
