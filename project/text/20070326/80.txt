technology a special report rethinking the inbox we arent going to give up email but we can be a lot smarter about the way we use it for years experts have been pushing a simple solution for email overload use other programs if your inbox is overflowing they say use more specialized software to talk to your co workers such as a shared online work space where you can chat electronically without generating dozens of emails or just heaven forbid pick up the telephone but most workers havent listened for all its faults email has become as comfortable as an old shoe an easy way to communicate with co workers friends and just about everyone else now a new crop of software is approaching the problem from a fresh angle the programs aim to improve emails usefulness and reduce overload while recognizing that users arent about to abandon the familiarity of their inbox these new products from the leading email providers and some tech upstarts integrate a host of other software tools into the regular email window so you have access to instant messaging discussion groups and a range of other software without leaving your inbox behind "to be successful new collaboration tools need to empower people to share information and work together without requiring them to give up email entirely " says mark levitt vice president for collaborative computing and the enterprise workplace at research company idc electronic mail was invented in but wasnt widely adopted by businesses until the late s with the arrival of lotus notes and other programs since then its use in the corporate world has exploded research firm radicati group inc estimates the average corporate email user sent and received about messages a day last year a number expected to double by attempts to get people to rely less on email have had mixed success many office workers have come to rely on instant messaging for simple communications taking some pressure off the inbox but im still has a relatively small presence inside companies some companies have set up online "work spaces" for collaborating on documents central locations where multiple users can chat edit documents without emailing them back and forth and store calendars and other shared information but these spaces are still only lightly used "its very hard to get people to use a different tool when the one theyre using is comfortable and easy to use " says idcs mr levitt "for the vast majority of users its foreign to them " the newest products aim to change that by integrating a host of new functions into the familiar email window for instance the latest release of microsoft corp s exchange software for servers allows outlook users to view documents tasks or messages stored in microsofts sharepoint collaborative work space without leaving email users can see their sharepoint to do lists and appointments in the outlook tasks list or calendar and can make changes to items in sharepoint from outlook moreover the software allows users to keep up to date with favorite web sites through outlook instead of switching over to a browser users can set up rss feeds which automatically send users new content that is added to a site that show up in an outlook folder the software even promises to integrate phone calls with email allowing users to launch calls or receive voice mail messages within the outlook inbox you must install an internet phone system for this feature to work microsoft is issuing new communication server software that will have built in internet phone technology marquette university in milwaukee is introducing microsoft exchange for its faculty staff and student email accounts as well as its it department the integration with sharepoint was a big selling point the it department uses sharepoint as a common online workplace to manage projects identify whos on call and keep track of uncompleted tasks with the new email system technicians no longer have to log on to the sharepoint site say to add a name to the on call list they can make changes directly from an outlook calendar "it helps to aggregate all this stuff in one place " says danny smith the universitys senior director of it services the next version of international business machines corp s lotus notes known as notes also places email at the center of even more daily activities scheduled for release midyear the software includes built in word processor spreadsheet and presentation software all of which are accessible through tabs at the top of the email window so for instance you wouldnt need to launch another program if you wanted to create a graph notes also links up with lotuss instant messaging software if users need an immediate response to a message they can see whether a contact is online the persons name will appear in green in the notes window with a green button alongside it then users can launch an im session without leaving notes notes also can be set up to include "activities " a way to organize emails documents and appointments around a project notes shows a list of all activities in a separate pane and users can drag an email straight from the inbox into the relevant project everyone on the team will get an email notification of the change if the user tries to send an email with a large attachment to several people notes will suggest putting the document into an activity instead to reduce the strain on email resources notes recently began its public beta test but some users have been testing it since late last year one of them milwaukee based johnson controls inc which makes automotive interior and building control systems has been testing notes with about people in its it department if the trial is successful the company expects to begin rolling the software out to all employees with email by the fall renate tomesch johnson controls manager of global enterprise messaging says that though the test is in its early stages a couple of features promise to make email use less disruptive and more productive for instance the inbox windows will let you know whether someone is the sole recipient of an email or has been copied along with others the feature lets busy executives devote less attention to group messages which are often copied to many people on an "fyi" basis but its ibms promise of "activity centric computing" that has the most appeal "a lot of us spend a lot of time in our email and would like to organize all our information in one spot " says ms tomesch three year old zimbra inc based in san mateo calif is an email newcomer that is bringing the latest web based technologies such as mashups which invisibly pull information from one application into another to the problem of email overload "this is a market thats just ripe for innovation " says scott dietzen zimbras president and chief technology officer "the dominant solutions were designed before the web experience took off " with zimbras search engine similar to those in the other new email programs users can search emails by date by size and by whether or not theres an attachment in addition to hunting by keyword or sender it also makes it possible to save previous searches but what really sets zimbra apart are "zimlets" miniapplications that connect zimbra email with other software applications such as a companys customer relationship management software or a web based service such as yahoo maps for instance nurses at interim healthcare inc a sunrise fla health care staffing company use zimlets to search the companys document database for information on wound management without leaving the email program "this makes zimbra the main portal" for employees says satish movva interims vice president and chief information officer another customer ziprealty inc a residential real estate brokerage company in emeryville calif last year began using zimbra for its more than real estate agents in states and the district of columbia the company uses zimlets in a number of ways for instance when an agent gets an email from a prospective buyer asking to schedule a property tour for say next tuesday the agent can pass the cursor over the words "next tuesday" in the text of the email and call up a calendar to see if the day is available the agent can then schedule the appointment without leaving the note mr totty is a news editor for the journal report in
