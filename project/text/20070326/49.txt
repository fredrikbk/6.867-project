its a small world after all global investors look beyond big cap issues will streak run out international investors are starting to think smaller they should have started earlier small and midsize stocks in europe japan and other corners of the developed world have offered some of the best earnings growth anywhere in recent years these stocks returned a year on average for the five years through december according to morgan stanley capital international like u s small capitalization stocks small cap foreign stocks outperformed large cap foreign stocks for each of the past six years up year to date foreign small stocks are ahead again this year and the small cap stock gains came with fewer ups and downs than stocks in developing countries and with about the same volatility as large foreign or u s stocks in recent months more u s hedge funds and to a lesser degree mutual funds have found other reasons to like these companies with the dollar falling to a two year low against the euro last week investors worry that large european exporters will become less competitive as a strong currency makes their goods more expensive in overseas markets but europes smaller companies which make up about two thirds of international small cap stock indexes sell their products mostly to other european countries so they are less vulnerable to an appreciating euro the recent boom in european mergers and acquisitions has provided another boost to these small cap stocks of the companies acquired last year had stock market values of &# billion or less according to citigroup "that trend is likely to continue for some time " says manolis liodakis at citigroup in london "thats going to help these stocks performance " in other ways the case for these small companies is less compelling earnings growth is slowing smaller stocks have become relatively more expensive than large stocks and any sign that investors are getting nervous about owning riskier securities as when markets around the world nose dived late last month usually hits small stocks harder based on price relative to expected earnings european small cap stocks are now more expensive than large european companies according to citigroup "thats the highest the premium has been in years " mr liodakis says this could be particularly worrisome he adds because these stocks have been hit with more earnings downgrades than large stocks there could be dramatic price swings now that hedge funds and other speculators that often move in and out of stocks quickly are becoming more interested in these companies about of all european small cap stocks have hedge fund ownership of at least according to citigroup just of european large companies are at least owned by hedge funds although small and midsize companies include such well known brands as hugo boss kia motors and adidas stocks with market values of &# billion or less got short shrift during much of the big rally in foreign shares supercharged economic growth in places like china india and russia have attracted record amounts of cash to emerging markets while the stability associated with large companies such as toyota motor or royal dutch shell lured the bulk of international mutual fund money some international stock funds saw record cash inflows in but new money going to small stock funds fell to &# billion last year from an average of &# billion in and according to amg data services "instead of going into foreign small cap stocks that money was probably going to emerging markets " says bob adler amgs president small cap international stocks offer some unique advantages to u s investors they can provide better portfolio diversification than other foreign stock categories returns on small cap foreign stocks were less likely to move in sync with standard &amp poors stock index in the past years than either emerging market stocks or large cap international stocks according to ing investment management analysts say this is because small cap stocks are influenced more by domestic or regional factors than by global factors such as the price of oil or interest rate moves by the u s federal reserve ing also found that foreign small cap stocks have been less volatile over those years than the other hot area in overseas investment emerging market stocks price moves on foreign small cap stocks were roughly the same as large cap foreign and u s stocks "what all this says to me is that if you want to diversify with relatively low volatility foreign small stocks are the way to go " says brian gendreau an investment strategist at ing in new york although the average market capitalization for foreign small stocks is nearly double that of u s small stocks there is much less analyst coverage of international small cap companies bargain "opportunities are greater when theres less analyst coverage " says randy farina who helps to manage the &# billion putnam international capital opportunities fund which invests in foreign small cap stocks but after the gains of the past few years finding those bargains is getting tougher mr farina adds others say there could be a price to pay for the diversification benefits of small cap stocks if investors start to worry about risk again and seek out the perceived safety of larger companies "small cap stocks suffer when theres a flight to quality " says mr liodakis "that would be more true now because of their higher valuations "
