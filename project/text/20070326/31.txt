good irish monday belfast the feeling here heading into a potentially historic week when british unionists and irish nationalists could agree to form a government might be described as one of prerelief relief because there is a sense that things are finally going to go right this time but only a preliminary one because well theyve been down this road before today well learn what it will be this time devolution of a raft of governing powers from london to a local assembly elected march or dissolution of the assembly and an undefined joint custody between britain and the republic of ireland to the south after years of waiting for the provisional irish republican army and its political wing sinn fein to lay down their arms and accept the rule of law all now hinges on the hard line democratic unionist partys agreeing to work with the nationalists over the weekend dup leader ian paisley the protestant minister dubbed "dr no" for his refusal even to speak with sinn fein demanded a six week extension for all the bluster though there is still a decent chance that an arrangement will be made if anyone embodies northern irelands incomplete transition to self rule its gerry adams the sinn fein leader is widely accused of and always denies having ties to the highest levels of the ira either way and right or wrong the fact is that hes become a legitimate actor on the political stage in the eyes of the british that the onus is on mr paisley and the dup to go along with power sharing or risk absorbing the publics outrage for failing to do so goes to show just how much the perception of mr adams and sinn fein has changed the ira remember is blamed for the deaths of some people most of them british security forces during "the troubles" from to the image improvement is something that mr adams says he realized when he visited the former site of the world trade center just two months after while in new york city for a sinn fein fund raiser in his mind the attacks and their aftermath showed the differences not the similarities between those who killed with carbombs in belfast and those who killed with airplanes in manhattan "it struck me " he said in an interview here on wednesday "that for sinn fein to be there at a huge event within the shadow of the twin towers or ground zero was actually how far wed traveled and that people were distinguishing clearly and the u s government also obviously between those who perpetrated that event and what we were about " as for reaching out to unionists mr adams argues that he and his party are doing their part "i may have more in common with a member of the british labour party on the left of the labour party than i would have with conservative unionists " he says "but a conservative unionist has the mandate and the right to be here so i would say i have probably mellowed in terms of coming to terms with where unionisms at " and theres even this once unthinkable take on "irishness" "you know you have to shake down any of the old notions that to be irish was to be irish and catholic the people who live on this island have all sorts of different views and different backgrounds and different attitudes and its the sum total of it that makes us what we are and you know ian paisley is no more or less irish than i am " mr paisleys reluctance to join hands with sinn fein suggests that the feeling isnt necessarily mutual dup officials declined several requests for interviews and theres good reason to be skeptical that the nationalists have truly changed from cab drivers to barmen to ladies lunching in chic eateries there is a belief in belfast that the ira has laid down its weapons yet there is an equal belief that the militants still have the money to rearm at any time a big story here last week concerned a helicopter that had crashed youths sympathetic to or perhaps members of the ira reportedly pelted rescue workers with everything from snowballs to firecrackers so it sounds reasonable when the dup insists that sinn fein still cant be trusted to respect the police forces that nationalists fought in the streets for three decades thats particularly true considering mr adams still believes as he told me that "it was the right thing to both defend the use of armed struggle and for those that engaged in armed struggle i dont think the people had any alternative and they wanted to pursue democratic and irish republican objectives " if politicians like mr adams still seem at least partially unreconstructed divining whether economic changes are authentic or just a veneer is equally problematic at the height of the troubles the local joke was that the only steady work around was for the glaziers who patched up the holes left by the car bombings that regularly rocked belfast today the city boasts near full employment with only jobless and is even attracting migrant workers from eastern europe a new phenomenon for a nation of emigrants the property market is booming yet dig a little deeper and youll find that more than of the local gdp is consumed by the state which has provided many of the new jobs in a city still transitioning from a heavy industry economy to one reliant on services very aware of the success to the south even the left wing mr adams is lobbying for the north to move toward the corporate tax rate that has turned the irish republic into a celtic tiger but the british government is reluctant to allow different tax policies as in the "bad old days" which when spoken with an irish accent sounds a lot like "battle days" business and citizens alike will probably find a way to muddle through even if things fall apart today even if they come together theres no assurance that these parties so fixated on driving one another into the ground will be any good at managing health care and education but a clean resolution was never likely to occur here dont expect northern irelands theatrics to end anytime soon mr wingfield is an
