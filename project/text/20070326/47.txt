in alaska battle a money manager decides to go green fan of hunting fishing fights huge mine project shielding his playground nondalton alaska soaring in his private plane above the pristine tundra here two years ago robert b gillam experienced a conversion the money manager and pro business republican became an impassioned conservationist he took the flight after reading reports that a canadian company planned to build north americas largest open pit gold and copper mine in southwest alaskas bristol bay region the proposed pebble mine would stretch two miles across and be deep enough to swallow the empire state building and it would be scraped from the headwaters of rivers that feed the worlds largest wild salmon fishery so mr gillam whose alaska investment firm holds more than &# billion in mining stocks for clients launched a second career he has become the unlikely front man for a band of native alaskans fishermen hunters environmentalists and business leaders opposing the project mr gillam years old has helped pay for ads lobbyists and polls to convince alaskans that pebble mine could be an environmental disaster "mining is no longer the ideal of a prospector with a pick ax and pan " he says "but a dirty industrial business " to mine proponents mr gillam is a rich man "throwing around his money to kill this project " says steven borell executive director of the alaska miners association "hes only out to protect his playground" namely his square foot log cabin on a peninsula jutting into lake clark about miles from the mine site packed with trophies from hunting trips mr gillam has taken around the world the cabin serves as a remote office and a venue for entertaining clients and power brokers he says his cabin has nothing to do with the fight northern dynasty minerals ltd the vancouver british columbia company that holds mining claims for the land says the pebble mine deposit holds some billion pounds of copper million ounces of gold and more than four billion pounds of molybdenum a metal used to strengthen steel market value more than &# billion based on recent prices as such pebble ranks as one of the worlds largest known metals reserves overall says a spokesman for rio tinto ltd a united kingdom based mining giant that has a stake in northern dynasty pebble which sits on state land designated for mining is years away from obtaining necessary permits but it has already created divides in a state fundamentally supportive of mining native alaskan communities are split many want to preserve their subsistence way of life while others want the jobs in a region starved for employment if the mine goes through "our kids get an opportunity weve never had " says kevin jensen a resident of pedro bay a tiny village that is divided on the mine for years mr gillam has gone to bristol bay to fish and hunt he grew up in alaska so poor that at one point he lived in the warehouse of a liquor store his father operated after earning an undergraduate degree from the university of pennsylvanias wharton school and an m b a from the university of california los angeles he went on to a career in finance in he founded his anchorage based firm mckinley capital management inc where he remains president and chief investment officer he stresses that hes waging his battle against pebble mine as a private citizen not for mckinley until two years ago his only interest in mining lay in the shares of various companies owned by his firm which has about &# billion under management even now hes not anti mining saying for instance that "its just stupid not to drill" for oil in the arctic national wildlife refuge which he considers barren but after that flight over the proposed pebble mine site he came away thinking "i cannot sit by and let this happen to my state " northern dynasty says the mine fish and native culture can coexist "if we cant prove this mine can work safely we wont get permits " says chief operating officer bruce jenkins the company has begun considering an underground mine that would reduce the size of the open pit but mr gillam is opposed to that too bristol bay lies miles southwest of anchorage accessible only by airplane boat or in winter snowmobile roughly the size of washington state the area is home to just people jobs are so rare "theres really no point in looking " says dan salmon who runs a sport fishing operation in the village of igiugig fish underpin the economy last years harvest of some million sockeye salmon from the bristol bay area was one of the largest in a century supplying restaurants and markets across the u s anglers spend upward of &# to fly in on floatplanes and spend a week at lodges casting for salmon that can top pounds northern dynasty estimates the mines construction would create jobs and once in operation the mine would require workers for its to year life those jobs mr jenkins says would range from housekeepers to highly trained technical laborers earning upward of &# the mine would sit about miles from nondalton a village of about native alaskans who live a subsistence life hunting in the fall berry picking after the snow melts and fishing in summer the orange red salmon make it into meals at least three days a week year round locals even have a recipe for a salmon dessert whipping it with lard sugar and whatever berries are available nondaltons elders toured the pebble site last fall and tribal officials say were shocked to find that animals the community hunts and traps wolverines beavers foxes lynxes caribous and others were nowhere to be seen they believe helicopters and test drilling scared animals away "they insist the mine wont impact us " says rick delkittie sr a nondalton tribal council member "but it already is impacting us and theyre not even mining yet " a northern dynasty spokesman says that helicopters must maintain a certain altitude when wildlife is nearby and that the company "is not aware of any impacts on subsistence hunting " nondalton is officially against the mine and has thrown in with mr gillam a shared concern the fate of waterways that drain into bristol bay northern dynasty last year filed a rights application to claim essentially all the water on the upper reaches of the upper talarik creek "you dont have to be particularly smart to know that if you take away the water the fish go away " mr gillam says northern dynasty would also build facilities to hold waste rock and remnants of chemicals needed to leach minerals from stone the largest of the earthen containment dams would stretch miles long and be more than feet high larger than chinas three gorges dam opponents say that could lead to disaster in the event of earthquakes or volcanic eruptions which occasionally jolt the area mr jenkins says northern dynasty claimed the water to short circuit opponents doing the same "the state wouldnt let us take the water if it compromised the salmon " he says the dam he says "is designed to settle and strengthen" in an earthquake northern dynastys research indicates of alaskans support the mine a level that the company calls "phenomenal " but that opponents label a rejection in a state that has never spurned a major mining project after meeting with a biologist at mr gillams cabin alaskas powerful republican sen ted stevens publicly stated that the mines development must be slowed to fight the project mr gillam helped fund the local renewable resources coalition a nonprofit that is behind a statewide campaign of print and tv ads he has enlisted hydrologists geologists and fisheries experts to detail damage the mine would cause and hired polling firms and lobbyists opponents estimate he is spending upward of &# million a year mr gillam will only say hes spent "a significant amount "
