telecommunications whats a cellphone for businesses are finding all sorts of new uses for mobile devices businesses are turning to mobile devices for a lot more than making calls and checking emails a growing number of them for instance are using souped up cellphones for increasingly complex and critical tasks such as accessing patient medical records closing sales managing inventories and dispatching service representatives meanwhile employees can now watch training videos on a blackberry or store a powerpoint presentation on the device and display it via a wireless link to hardware connected to a projector small and large companies alike are finding that customized mobile applications like these can boost worker productivity by enabling employees to access and input data on the go these applications also often eliminate the need for workers to carry around reams of paper or hop from wi fi hot spot to hot spot with clunky laptops the new applications are possible because engineers are packing more features and processing power into small mobile devices that run their own mini operating systems built by companies like microsoft corp and research in motion ltd "even middle of the line mobile devices rival the processing power and storage of a pc of six or seven years ago " says scott horn general manager for microsofts mobile communications business at the same time cellular networks are getting faster making it easier for mobile employees to connect to the web and to remote databases as a result of all this the market for mobile enterprise applications is expected to nearly triple to &# billion in from &# billion in according to market research firm idc of framingham mass mobile applications are gaining particular traction in sales and customer service divisions where employees spend the bulk of their time away from their desks for instance electronics retailing giant best buy co has equipped its mobile "geek squad" computer support task force with smart phones through sprint nextel corp and verizon communications inc some geek squad agents now use the phones to access updated schedules on the fly and to log their hours as they make house calls best buy which builds its own custom applications to work with microsofts windows mobile operating system also has programmed the phones to serve as a diagnostic tool to test clients network connections the retailer also is testing an application that provides turn by turn driving directions for the geek squad mobile technology is helping other companies better manage their inventories or close sales faster pitney bowes inc a stamford conn mail management technology company has found that having its service employees report which parts they use on repair jobs in real time through their blackberrys enabled the company to lower inventory levels by and emergency parts orders by having service agents report on their work in real time also allows the company to optimize their deployment and the ability to accomplish all this with hand held devices has literally lightened the load of the companys field workers "the reality is people dont like lugging around a heavy laptop " says donna dietz vice president of technology planning for pitney bowes "this gives our field service employees the ability to work with something that is small and always on it makes the whole company more responsive " sales representatives at the ing investment management unit of ing groep nv use a custom application built for blackberrys to look up information about brokerage and institutional clients such as records of previous sales calls and information about products the client has purchased from ing competitors in real time representatives can also close sales on the spot sending the information back to a central database where in the case of particularly large orders the transmission triggers a follow up from a senior ing executive almost instantly companies have been turning to mobile technology for years but often only with the aid of pricey custom built devices now new technology and the proliferation of third party developers of mobile software are making it possible for companies to transact a range of business on the same mobile devices they can pick up at any cellphone store price is still something of an issue for mobile software platforms for instance apresta inc of campbell calif charges an installation fee of around &# for its server and setup plus an annual fee of about &# per device iqmax inc a mobile software developer based in charlotte n c that caters to medical professionals charges between &# and &# per year per user but demand for mobile technologies is strong despite the costs in addition to the sales and service sectors health care professionals have been a significant source of that demand doctors and nurses are using mobile devices primarily to access and update patient medical records and to send prescriptions directly to a pharmacy but other features are available or in the works for instance an iqmax program called iqspeak allows doctors to view a list of their patients on a mobile device recite dictation concerning a chosen patient into the phone and send the audio clip over the air to be transcribed iqmax also is developing an application that will give doctors mobile access to extensive treatment advice doctors will be able to tap into advice from pharmaceutical companies academic researchers and published clinical studies employees at lifesource a st paul minn organ donation organization use a custom built blackberry application to save time when an organ becomes available after gaining consent from the donors family and finding a suitable match lifesource employees use the application to find a list of transplant doctors on call the list is constantly updated with the latest information transmitted to users mobile devices wirelessly so there is no time wasted calling doctors who arent available the u s military has begun using mobile devices to help doctors and medics access patient records in the field primarily in iraq and afghanistan instead of sifting through a heavy box of patient files special forces medical professionals are now pulling up and updating wounded soldiers medical records electronically on a proprietary system the government built with microsoft and other industry partners the system is known as the battlefield medical information system tactical or bmist since the first devices were deployed in bmist has helped create more than one million electronic health records for military personnel says tommy morris director of deployment health technologies for the office of the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs some of the devices are in use he says bmist underscores some of the hurdles and concerns related to mobile enterprise applications for one such applications generally depend on reliable access to a wireless connection not always a sure bet bmist compensates by storing patient records on each mobile device so doctors in the field always have information to work with then when the device is linked to a computer with an internet connection a doctor can update a patients record in the central database and have the chip in his own device updated with new information that has been filed on other soldiers in this instance the government initially opted not to transmit information wirelessly for security reasons but it is now testing some wireless versions of the program that draw upon new security technology another hurdle is that some companies are finding that mobile devices no matter how convenient cant fully replace their laptops "there is only so much you are going to be able to do on a screen that is an inch and a half wide " says todd larson vice president and director of application development for boston based eaton vance management a financial services unit of eaton vance corp the company has equipped some sales personnel with blackberrys that can tap into information about previous sales activity and management contact data but it still gives sales reps laptops too so that they are able to complete more complex tasks like drafting memos creating powerpoint presentations and logging their expenses still mobile hardware and software makers expect demand from businesses to continue to grow as the computing capacity of mobile devices expands and their prices fall to encourage that growth microsoft and research in motion are working with application developers to create more enterprise services that work with their operating systems and theyre working to get the word out about the features that already are available "companies just dont understand that this kind of stuff is possible " says jeff mcdowell vice president of global alliances at research in motion ms vascellaro is a staff reporter in the wall street journals new york bureau she can be reached at jessica vascellaro wsj com
