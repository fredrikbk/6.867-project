the evening wrap courage under fire online edition "courage" was the word of the day for heart stent makers after a controversial study on the devices bearing that name was made public but investors in one of the biggest stent companies decided selling was the better part of valor in the closely watched study that has been the subject of most of the buzz at the american college of cardiology conference in new orleans researchers found no benefit in cutting heart attacks and death in patients who received drugs and coronary intervention that is stents versus patients who had received drugs alone stent makers who stand to see a huge market dry up if their devices are shot down by researchers immediately went on the offensive against the study donald baim chief medical officer at stent maker boston scientific said that it was set up to fail because prior studies already showed that stents dont reduce the chance of death and heart attack in a stable patient he said that the devices are intended to reduce chronic pain that diminish a patients quality of life but william boden the leader of the study thinks that the findings could lead to a change in practice over time boston scientific draws a huge portion of its sales from stents and seemed to have the most to lose from the studys findings the companys shares plunged in trading this afternoon by contrast johnson &amp johnson which also has a big stent business but has its fingers in enough other pies that it should survive any stent damage saw its shares fall just slightly boston scientific was in the soup even before the courage study was made available to the public after another study presented at the conference over the weekend showed a new drug eluting stent from abbott laboratories performed as well or better than boston scientifics market leading taxus stent abbotts xience stent had a slightly lower rate of major complications like heart attack the need for a repeat procedure or cardiac death the news wasnt all bad for boston scientific as it will market xience under the brand name promus but analysts are worried that the new stent could cannibalize taxus sales at a time when the market seems to be softening patients had flocked to the devices after they were introduced three years ago and by early they accounted for of all stent sales but after data connected them to a slightly higher risk of blood clots when compared to their bare metal cousins demand started to taper off and now account for about of stent sales abbott shares soared meanwhile another study presented at the conference drove an additional nail into a drug that pfizer had hoped would help offset the loss of patent protection for its blockbuster cholesterol fighter lipitor pfizer had sought to shield its rainmaker from generic competition by marketing it alongside a new compound known as torcetrapib that would boost good cholesterol but in a critical clinical trial the compound faltered torcetrapib actually raised blood pressure in some patients and pfizer was forced to halt its development late last year today a new study rounded out the grim picture showing that torcetrapib failed to halt the buildup of plaque in arteries steven nissen the chief of cardiology at the cleveland clinic and the leader of the study said that the findings "demonstrate the great difficulty in developing therapies to interrupt the atherosclerosis process " but he also cautioned that scientists shouldnt toss aside all drugs designed to boost good cholesterol because of one poor result "you dont want to abandon a class where the first drug you studied had unique toxicities " he said beside pfizer merck and roche holding are also developing good cholesterol boosters stocks do some late digging early on a sorry

appeared to be divided over whether to ease a broad restriction on minimum pricing agreements between manufacturers and retail stores if the court eases the restriction it isnt likely to result in raised prices at large discount retailers which have considerable power over manufacturers to set their own prices but it could make it harder for smaller boutiques to lower prices on specialty or custom goods without the consent of the manufacturer justice stephen breyer seemed reluctant to change a law that has been on the books for nearly years but chief justice john roberts and justice antonin scalia appeared to support the governments argument that pricing agreements sometimes have a competitive impact and should be reviewed on a case by case basis sharing power in northern ireland
