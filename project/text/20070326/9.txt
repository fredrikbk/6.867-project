bush reorients rhetoric acknowledges income gap until january president bush seldom acknowledged the widening gap between the rich and the middle class then in a speech he declared "i know some of our citizens worry about the fact that our dynamic economy is leaving working people behind income inequality is real " he has raised the subject several times since this isnt a sudden change in mr bushs economic philosophy but rather a change in tactics forced by the changing political environment say current and former administration officials and outsiders in touch with the white house top white house economic officials still dont consider todays inequality the growing share of income going to those at the top an inherently bad thing they believe it simply reflects the rising rewards accruing to societys most skilled and productive members nor do they see merit in various democratic proposals to reduce inequality such as ending mr bushs tax cuts on the highest earners raising the minimum wage making it easier to form unions and including labor standards in trade agreements but democrats takeover of congress makes avoiding the issue difficult particularly if the president is to win congressional backing for free trade pacts and for extending his authority to negotiate new ones pushed by treasury secretary henry paulson who raised the inequality issue in his first big speech after taking office the administration is reorienting its rhetoric treasury has framed mr bushs health care proposal as a form of income redistribution because it caps the tax break for employer provided health insurance for more affluent workers in order to finance tax breaks for individuals who buy it on their own in his january speech mr bush cited several education initiatives he thinks are particularly important in addressing inequality making schools more accountable for their performance improving math and science education and making it easier for lower income students to afford college to offset globalizations impact the administration is pondering improvements in trade adjustment assistance a federal program to aid workers hurt by trade that program is up for renewal this year but the administration hasnt yet offered any sweeping proposals to resist the market forces producing inequality and probably wont indeed skeptics say the administration will address inequality only as much as needed to win votes in congress where the widespread public belief that globalization benefits only a small share of americans has become an obstacle to bush backed efforts to liberalize trade and foreign investment the election wasnt "a wake up call" in which the white house discovered " people are worried about wages and we have to get on board " says howard rosen of the peterson institute for international economics who has a longstanding interest in programs to aid dislocated workers rather he says the white house realized " we have a new congress and it will be harder to get our agenda through " top administration officials however play down the election result as a factor in their new rhetoric income inequality by most measures has been growing since the s and is one reason the typical workers pay has grown only adjusted for inflation since the expansion began at the end of while the economy has grown the share of total income going to the richest of americans rose to a postwar record of in according to economist emmanuel saez of the university of california at berkeley and the premium employers paid to hire the most educated workers has grown until recently talking about inequality was considered almost taboo among administration officials even raising the issue was seen as handing democrats an advantage when bush advisers discussed inequality it was often to play down negative connotations "the term income inequality is a bit misleading because it suggests in a somewhat pejorative way that the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor " edward lazear a stanford university labor economist who is now chairman of mr bushs council of economic advisers said last may while its a concern that some people are being left behind he said "there is some good news most of the inequality reflects an increase in returns to investing in skills " mr lazear has nurtured his relationship with mr bush his office is decorated with photos of the two mountain biking when he gave mr bush a copy of the economic report of the president this year mr bush gave him a bear hug and kissed the top of his bald head according to people who were present some economists question mr lazears assertion that for instance raising taxes on higher wage earners will reduce individuals incentive to acquire new skills lawrence katz a harvard university labor economist who served in the clinton labor department says theres "not a shred of evidence" lower taxes boost educational attainment "thats first order goofball " even before republicans november defeat at the polls some administration allies were warning that economic insecurity was eroding republican support a business coalition hired pollster david winston to figure out why voters remained so dissatisfied with the economy his focus groups of middle income voters in cincinnati and pittsburgh found voters going deeper into debt to keep up with rising costs of health care and energy executive compensation "is getting to the point where its obscene " said one focus group participant the more politicians talked about how good the economy was the worse these voters felt "its almost as if these folks are floating around in the ocean watching the yachts and speedboats go by thinking hey im here someone notice me " says dirk van dongen a co chairman of the coalition and president of the national association of wholesaler distributors mr winston advised republicans "our message should be that while the economy is getting back on track we need to do more to help people with the cost of living " but republican strategists largely ignored the findings led by karl rove they wanted to avoid blunting one of their few advantages in the campaign the economys broad strength one adviser adds that iraq would have overshadowed any new economic proposals mr rove notes the president did talk about health care college and other pocketbook issues during the campaign over the past several months debate inside the administration has shifted some when he ran goldman sachs group inc mr paulson had invited former clinton aides gene sperling and princeton university labor economist alan krueger to brief him on the impact of globalization on wages and inequality at a staff meeting soon after taking the treasury post in july he expressed puzzlement about the administrations opposition to raising the minimum wage a person familiar with the meeting says he has dispatched undersecretary robert steel another goldman alumnus to scout for ideas to boost the lower middle class other officials including white house international economics aide david mccormick and matthew slaughter until recently a member of mr lazears council argued internally that addressing inequality was needed to damp protectionist sentiment fueled by voters who believe they are hurt not helped by globalization insiders say mr bushs acknowledgment that inequality is widening and the renewed focus on health care and revamping aid to dislocated workers suggest the administration appreciates the issues political potency "voters perceptions of economic health are very different than they used to be " said mark mckinnon mr bushs former media adviser and now an adviser to sen john mccain the arizona republican seeking to succeed mr bush "the old indicators that we reliably counted on unemployment the stock market dont seem to matter much anymore and other things do health care and pensions " adds former treasury secretary john snow now chairman of private equity buyout firm cerberus capital management "the democrats sense they have an issue here and are going to try to push it and the republicans are going to have to have an answer "
