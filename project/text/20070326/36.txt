ibm to unveil fast chip with optical connections international business machines corp scientists plan to unveil a prototype chip today that uses optical connections to increase the speed of moving data among chips to eight times that of previous technologies the chips speed clocked at billion bits of data a second would allow a high definition movie to be transmitted over a short distance in a fraction of a second compared with the half hour it takes over home broadband connections ibm said the technology could pave the way for devices that almost instantly transmit a digital x ray to a doctors hand held screen a seismic analysis to an oil engineers workstation or movies around home networks analysts briefed on the technology said it represents a breakthrough in combining traditional semiconductor technology with optical transmission of bits of light called photons which are faster and more energy efficient than electrons the new chip was developed by a team of scientists at ibms t j watson research center in yorktown heights n y the scientists will present their work at the optical fiber conference in anaheim calif bernard meyerson chief technology officer for ibms hardware group said that as semiconductor chips have packed more transistors into the same space "data handling to move data on and off chips has become a bottleneck in terms of power consumption and area " todays chips have copper wires leading off them onto printed circuit boards the new chip has optical transceivers leading to optical pathways on printed circuit boards mr meyerson said products using the technology are likely to appear within three years he said the technology might be incorporated into large chips used in servers such as ibm mainframes or it might be used in giant communications switches and routers he declined to say how ibm plans to market the technology richard doherty research director of envisioneering group seaford n y who was briefed on the project said "its an amazing use of" traditional semiconductor technology noting that the research was funded by the defense advanced research projects agency he added that "this isnt some blue sky" lab demonstration based on past experience he said he expects ibm to have some commercial products using the technology in to months among places the technology is likely to emerge first are supercomputers in which thousands of microprocessors work on problems simultaneously and blade servers in which hundreds of servers work in racks in corporate data centers the optical connections could sharply reduce the power and air conditioning needed for such systems dave lammers director of wesrch com a web site for semiconductor engineers who was briefed on the announcement said "its a big deal because they worked on ways to hold down costs " by using traditional semiconductor technology "optical is the way to go but optical has been so expensive" it has blocked widespread adoption he said
