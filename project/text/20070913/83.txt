politics &amp economics iraq testimony appears to have won no converts white house congress seem headed for clash over troop drawdown washington top democrats heightened calls for the president to revamp his war strategy a move that portends a renewed round of congressional debate through the fall the calls come after congress grilled president bushs top officials in iraq gen david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker their two days of testimony which raised the prospect of a longer term u s commitment to the region appears to have damped congressional support for the surge that had emerged even from some democrats during the august recess in iowa yesterday democratic senator and presidential contender barack obama of illinois used a campaign speech to lay out his most specific plan since january to pull all u s combat troops from iraq by the end of next year most of his rivals are calling for a faster pullout while his chief opponent new york sen hillary clinton is urging a swift drawdown but has given fewer specifics senate majority leader harry reid of nevada said the party planned to push ahead next week on legislation that could compel the president to bring u s troops back from iraq more swiftly than is currently planned similar attempts this year failed to gain support of enough republicans to get the votes needed to override a presidential veto "i call on the senate republicans not to walk in lockstep with the president as they have for years " mr reid said democrats have little ability to rewrite the administrations war strategy because republicans can still muster enough votes to stop congress overriding a presidential veto even though some republicans worry that sticking to the current course could cost the party at the next elections mr bush will elaborate on his iraq plans tonight in a white house speech that will seek to make the case for maintaining a strong u s presence in iraq while promising a gradual drawdown of u s troops through next spring white house spokesman tony snow suggested that an even more substantial drawdown is possible later if conditions in iraq improve sufficiently military officials say the number of troops in iraq could fall to as low as by late from now mr obamas speech to an audience in clinton iowa encapsulated nearly all the democratic criticisms of mr bushs latest iraq strategy that the surge of troops into the country earlier this year has led to no political progress in iraq that the security gains so far are unsustainable and that the u s military is too strained to maintain even a reduced posture in iraq through all of next year mr obama and other democrats argue that an immediate move to withdraw is the only way to apply pressure on iraqs leaders to form a unity government many on the left are also calling for a united nations led effort to form a new unity government in baghdad mr obama proposed an international convention that wouldnt end until iraqs factions overcame their differences largely left out of the democratic proposals is what the u s should do if an abrupt withdrawal fuels mass chaos and violence in iraq as many experts on the region predict mr obama says he would keep combat troops in the area only to protect "american diplomatic and military personnel " were a genocide to break out he says the u s "would reserve the right to intervene " sen clinton said in a letter to president bush yesterday that his plans to pull troops out by next summer "is simply too little too late and unacceptable to this congress " she urged mr bush "to greatly accelerate the redeployment of u s forces from iraq " other democratic candidates including sen chris dodd of connecticut have blasted sens obama and clinton for not demanding a firm timetable for the pullout of all u s forces mr obama leaves open the need to maintain some troop presence in iraq for the foreseeable future republican presidential candidates continue to stand firm for president bush and for keeping the troops in iraq campaigning in iowa sen john mccain of arizona said that mr obamas withdrawal plans were "dangerous for the future of the country " he also vowed to do whatever he could to block any vote on legislation that would fix a withdrawal date john d mckinnon contributed to this article
