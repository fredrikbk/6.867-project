politics &amp economics volcker panel urges change for world bank unit washington the world banks antigraft unit given a prominent role by former bank chief paul wolfowitz is marred by "serious operational issues" and should be revamped according to a panel led by former federal reserve chairman paul volcker the committees report recommended several changes to improve the operations of the banks institutional integrity department they include informing country representatives of investigations earlier in the process strengthening the rights of bank employees investigated for graft making clear how the bank will handle the results of investigations and setting up an oversight board nearly all of the recommendations were quickly endorsed by the banks current president robert zoellick who is trying to use the report to quell an acrimonious battle within the bank over anticorruption efforts the volcker panel was formed earlier this year to review those efforts following complaints from bank staffers the integrity department "has achieved notable successes " mr zoellick said "but we can do better and need to integrate its work into our operations more effectively " for decades the world bank largely ignored corruption figuring that some graft was the price of doing business in poor countries in addition given the rapid economic growth of countries with notoriously corrupt governments such as china and indonesia some development experts doubted that graft was one of the critical obstacles to economic growth starting in however former world bank president james wolfensohn focused more attention on corruption issues in he started the integrity department which made little headway during his tenure the departments stature was elevated under his successor mr wolfowitz who made fighting corruption a priority a stance that further divided the bank bank employees complained that the department was heavy handed and secretive a "gulag " one staffer dubbed it its defenders dismissed those who complained as either unconcerned about graft or in some cases complicit when mr wolfowitz came under fire earlier this year over alleged favoritism to his girlfriend a bank employee the anticorruption agenda became even more politicized some developing nations dismissed the banks efforts as hypocritical the result of the battles the panel said was "growing mutual distrust undermining what progress has been made" on the issue the integrity departments head suzanne folsom has been a particular lightning rod for criticism her supporters say critics are trying to hound her out of office because of her longstanding ties to the republican party and her close alliance with mr wolfowitz who resigned from the bank under fire mr volcker said he gave ms folsom "high marks on the professionalism of the operation " but he argued that her role should change currently she runs the department and is also counselor to the world bank president her critics have charged that the two jobs running the antigraft unit and dispensing political advice are incompatible ms folsom has said the two jobs helped give her "the ear of the president " the volcker panel urged that the department be headed by a bank vice president who should focus on running it that would help eliminate concern that the department chiefs role as an independent investigator "might be compromised " mr zoellick said he would retain ms folsom as a department head who would report to him but he would likely end her dual role as counselor he didnt commit to making her a vice president a higher rank than she now holds "suzanne has done very very good work in a very tough job " mr zoellick said ms folsom said she intended to stay at her job and hopes the bank "embraces the findings" of the volcker panel
