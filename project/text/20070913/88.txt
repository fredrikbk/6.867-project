politics &amp economics lights out for old bulbs u s plans a switch to all fluorescents for efficiencys sake washington the house and senate are working on legislation that over the next seven years would phase out the conventional light bulb a move aimed at saving energy and reducing man made emissions believed linked to climate change general electric co philips electronics nv of the netherlands and other manufacturers have been meeting with conservation and environmental groups and say they are close to agreement on the general terms of a phaseout bipartisan coalitions in congress are likely to add these terms to a broad energy bill expected to be voted on next month while manufacturers voiced some concerns about producing enough bulbs to meet the new deadlines they emphasized that they want prompt federal legislation that would prevent states from setting their own standards creating a patchwork of differing requirements nevada has already set its own standard and california is considering one paul waide a policy analyst with the international energy agency based in paris told the senate energy committee yesterday that the european union canada and australia are planning similar phaseouts of conventional incandescent bulbs and china is beginning to consider one "it is not inconceivable that over the next to years that maybe all incandescent lights will be removed from the global market " he said if that happened he added the resulting reduction in carbon dioxide emissions might equal almost three fourths of the reductions that industrial nations have promised under the kyoto protocol to curb global warming the u s which has four billion electric lights using such bulbs represents about a third of the world market installing more efficient incandescent or compact fluorescent bulbs would save consumers about &# billion a year in energy costs said jeffrey harris a vice president of the alliance to save energy a nonprofit group based in washington common incandescent bulbs which have been around for more than years are able to convert only of the electricity they use into visible light the rest is lost as heat under the timetable proposed in both house and senate versions incandescent bulbs would begin to disappear from u s markets beginning in with watt bulbs going first then watt bulbs a year later and then the more popular and watt bulbs by they would be replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs and more efficient incandescent lamps which can cut energy use from to by both bills call for lighting standards that can only be met by the compact fluorescents or other technologies that can match their efficiency manufacturers hope to use a few different technologies to meet the proposed standards but they say it will be a challenge getting new lamps out by the proposed starting date the manufacturers also had initially been looking for a longer phaseout period of five years instead of three randy moorehead vice president of government relations for philips electronics north america said the industry mostly supports the phase in period but has problems with the proposed standards mr moorehead said congress should wait to set a standard to see where the technology is headed he said manufacturers will have to scrap new multimillion dollar investments in equipment and employees to meet standards ge had announced a new energy efficient incandescent lamp that will be more efficient by ge plans to roll out the first version in ge indicated the bulb would likely be comparable to a watt or watt bulb osram sylvania a unit of siemens ag is also introducing an energy efficient incandescent bulb philips is unveiling a halogen light this fall that will be markedly more efficient and three times longer lasting than incandescent bulbs but will also be more expensive initially than compact and incandescent bulbs ge and the two other big light bulb makers philips and osram sylvania also are looking at light emitting diodes or leds as new sources of residential lighting "well certainly fill in any gaps with other technologies " says earl jones senior counsel for ges consumer and industrial unit nearly all compact fluorescent bulbs are made in china although they cost more than conventional bulbs the energy savings over their longer lifetimes are substantial noting that only of bulbs sold in the u s are compact fluorescents kyle pitsor vice president of the national electrical manufacturers association said the industry will mount a public education campaign to push the more efficient bulbs
