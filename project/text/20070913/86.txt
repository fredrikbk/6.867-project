politics &amp economics the wall street journal nbc news poll public gives bush slight reprieve u s war dissatisfaction eases a bit but opinion favors democrats washington public discontent with the iraq war has eased slightly a new wall street journal nbc news poll shows suggesting president bush may have a little more maneuvering room at a critical point in debates over war costs and troop levels as mr bush prepares to follow congressional testimony by the top general in iraq david petraeus with a televised speech to the nation tonight the poll shows an uptick in support for the presidents handling of the war as well as a small increase in the proportion of americans who believe the troop surge is helping and that victory remains possible those shifts in public opinion remain modest solid majorities continue to disapprove of the presidents performance and say victory in iraq isnt possible and that the war hasnt been worth its human and financial costs "theres been no surge from the american people " said democratic pollster peter hart who conducts the journal nbc poll with republican counterpart neil newhouse yet only one in four americans say troops should leave now regardless of conditions on the ground the publics "heads and hearts are going in two different directions " mr newhouse said "they want the troops to come home but think we cant just leave " the slight improvement in iraq sentiment followed extensive news coverage anticipating the testimony of gen petraeus and u s ambassador to iraq ryan crocker the telephone survey of adults was conducted sept with most interviews completed before their monday testimony the surveys margin of error is percentage points however modest the gains come as welcome news for the white house as it seeks to hold enough republican congressional support to sustain mr bushs iraq policy through the end of his term mr bush has been buffeted by republican dissent from such party stalwarts as sens richard lugar of indiana and pete domenici of new mexico but democrats havent yet come close to amassing the two thirds votes needed in the house and senate to override a presidential veto of a measure that would force an accelerated withdrawal beyond the gradual drawdown of the "surge" troops that mr bush is expected to announce tonight the journal nbc poll suggests they arent gaining on that goal as the war drags on the proportion of americans who say the war remains winnable has edged up to from in july while the majority who say it isnt has diminished to from the proportion saying the troop surge is helping the situation on the ground has risen to from in july and in april mr bushs approval rating on iraq still is paltry at but that is up from in july while approval for his handling of the economy remained unchanged at the change in his iraq approval rating driven by improved marks among republicans independents and men pushed mr bushs overall approval rating up to from in july the poll shows that american sentiment about the war is complex asked about possible outcomes just say u s troops should leave only after iraq becomes a stable democracy yet just say troops should start leaving now regardless of conditions on the ground a plurality says some troops should remain in the region long term to prevent violence from spreading just say u s troops should remain in iraq so long as military progress is being made but remain open to "continuing in the same direction" if iraq makes political progress of which mr crocker concedes there has been little some say staying the course makes no sense under any circumstances some democratic congressional leaders already are shifting the debate in reaction to indications that mr bush has stemmed his slide moving it away from withdrawal timelines and toward their contention that the administration is pursuing an open ended commitment to american involvement that represents a political challenge for republican candidates in even if mr bush is able to sustain his policy the poll shows mr bushs party still faces an uphill fight in by to americans say they want democrats rather the republicans to win control of congress next year and by to americans say they want a democrat elected to succeed mr bush in in the fight for the republican presidential nomination former new york mayor rudy giuliani continues to lead with but his margin over former sen fred thompson of tennessee who formally entered the race last week has narrowed to six percentage points from points in july drawing strong support from republican conservatives mr thompson has moved clearly into second place with compared with for sen john mccain of arizona and for former massachusetts gov mitt romney in the democratic contest sen hillary clinton of new york retains a to advantage over sen barack obama of illinois former sen john edwards of north carolina remains the only other democrat in double figures nationally with the poll suggests that whoever wins the democratic nomination may hold an initial advantage over the republican partys choice in potential november matchups mrs clinton leads mr giuliani by to mr thompson by
