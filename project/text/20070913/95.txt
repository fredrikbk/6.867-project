sacco and vanzetti perpetually on trial with dismay i read robert k landerss accusatory review of my book "sacco &amp vanzetti the men the murders and the judgment of mankind" books pursuits aug taking me to task for not openly embracing saccos guilt mr landers accuses me of trying to convince myself that sacco was innocent in fact at no time anywhere in the book did i ever pass judgment on the men instead allowing readers to be the jury i presented all the evidence i could find for both sides in that same spirit i dedicated my book to "all those struggling to maintain a danutless spirit and an open mind " mr landerss spirit may be dauntless but his mind is anything but open like most of massachusetts in he just keeps repeating the molehill of evidence against sacco while utterly ignoring the mountain of evidence suggesting his and vanzettis innocence unlike mr landers who seems thoroughly familiar with decades old narratives of the case but not to have read much of my book i cannot offer a verdict "doubts that will not down " as walter lippmann wrote in continue to haunt anyone eager to pronounce the men either guilty or innocent and doubt reasonable and well documented is what usually amounts to either acquittal or to the new trial sacco and vanzetti deserved in my epilogue i present a series of "what if" questions for both verdicts leaving the possibility of either verdict wide open as it deserves to be sacco and vanzetti are still on trial and probably always will be the least they deserve is to be judged on all the evidence not sentenced again in rushes to judgment based on partisan politics have we learned nothing from their case bruce watson leverett mass
