supplementing social security today american families are working harder than they used to and making less and at the same time even as they grow older many americans are socking less away in savings than they once did both trends might keep us up at night but with the baby boomers set to begin retiring next year we cannot afford to ignore the second challenge the problem is clear this isnt a nation of savers in the past two years americas personal savings rate reached its lowest level since the great depression and in comparison to other industrialized countries the united states ranked second to last in personal savings most people intuitively understand the importance of saving as a way to finance education or a dignified retirement but the benefits to the overall economy are also important an increase in savings enlarges the pool of capital available for businesses to invest create jobs and improve our standard of living every american who works ought to have the chance to save but today too many dont an estimated million working americans nearly half the work force lack access to an employer sponsored savings plan that helps put away money for retirement at the same time too many who have access to a savings plan contribute too little or dont participate at all in addition americans dont start saving early enough the typical american starts working at age but on average most do not begin to participate in an employer savings plan until age losing years of savings over the past years we have offered a blizzard of tax initiatives to encourage individuals to save for their retirement last year we spent &# billion in tax subsidies to encourage retirement savings yet the national savings rate has plummeted that reminds me of the old adage "when you find yourself in a hole stop digging " in the last congress i proposed legislation that took a different approach instead of offering a new tax subsidy my proposal helped companies automatically enroll employees in their k plans rather than relying on workers to fill out the forms necessary to participate in a plan the pension protection act of signed into law included my proposal and it is working according to a recent survey conducted by hewitt associates it is likely that one out of every two companies that offer a k or similar plan will automatically enroll new employees if we make saving simple by limiting the amount of time effort and decisions that people have to make we can dramatically increase the number of people who save in short simplicity trumps choice making saving easy is half the battle the next step is to make saving universal democrats and republicans have embraced these goals but in different ways i believe now is the time to combine the best of what both parties have put forward in order to make saving easy and universal republicans have long advanced the idea of personal accounts inside of social security an accounts based system that supplements not supplants social security can work democrats have argued that k s and personal savings are important supplements to social security but we should ensure that fees are low and that lower income americans have the same opportunity to save that upper income americans enjoy building on the principles of personal accounts universal savings and the desire in the marketplace for simplicity i believe we should create universal savings accounts like k s the accounts would supplement social security employers and employees would contribute of paychecks on a tax deductible basis additional contributions could be made to the accounts at the discretion of the company or individual worker to ensure low management fees these accounts would be managed by the private sector but overseen by a quasi public board that would be given fiduciary responsibility for the types of investment options that workers could select this system is used by the successful federal k program or thrift savings plan where the annual management fees have averaged cents for every &# invested by comparison the typical mutual fund charges &# per &# invested with this approach americans will know that money put away for retirement will be available for retirement to help achieve universal participation and simplicity employers would automatically enroll their employees in these accounts allowing employees to opt out if they decided that they did not want to participate amounts contributed could be automatically increased and account balances invested in "lifecycle funds " ensuring that individuals are making appropriate investment decisions based on their age since low income workers have the hardest time saving for retirement we should provide an additional incentive to participate by strengthening the savers credit a federal tax credit that matches savings put into retirement accounts i believe that this type of approach one that combines the goals of personal accounts universal savings and the consumers desire for simplicity is a necessary pre condition to reforming social security both president clinton and president bush have waded into the social security reform debate and have nothing to show for their efforts in part because they put the cart before the horse the lesson that should be drawn from their experience is twofold americans are anxious about their financial future and the american people like the security that comes with social security in order for us to tackle the problems of social security washington must provide solutions that make the american people feel more financially secure if this anxiety is not addressed first neither party will be given the opportunity to constructively address the challenges facing social security my approach protects the sanctity of the social security system as a secure foundation for retirement it also expands individual savings opportunities outside of social security in order to provide all working americans with an easy way to make their retirement more secure strengthening social security for the long term will take a sustained commitment to fiscal discipline and bipartisanship commodities that can become scarce as we head into the presidential election season but while americans wait for long term answers on social security we should act now to give them more ways to start building retirement savings of their own mr emanuel d ill is chairman of the house democratic caucus see related letters "letters to the editor a democrat proposes social security reform caution is
