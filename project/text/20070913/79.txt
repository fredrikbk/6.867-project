new limits debated for organ donation transplant group proposes barring donors who have certain health problems balancing risk vs need for years surgeons and patient advocates have battled over whether new protections are needed for people who give away a kidney or a portion of liver now a sweeping set of proposed guidelines on living organ donation hopes to take a step in that direction but transplant surgeons across the country are balking the voluntary guidelines which aim to better screen potential living donors and limit who can become a donor have already been watered down and it is unclear if they will be approved at all the debate reflects a tension between the need for organ donors and concerns that doctors may be lowering standards for living donors too far or failing to catch problems that could put the donor at unacceptable risk many transplant programs now allow people to donate who would have been screened out a few years ago including those who are obese or have high blood pressure or diabetes often marginally qualified donors demand to be approved contending the choice is their own to accept the risk when someone they love needs a transplant transplant surgeons have also loosened standards for deceased donors accepting for instance organs from much older dead donors than ever before the new guidelines from the united network for organ sharing the private organization that runs the nations transplant network include four pieces of which the most contentious are two sets of voluntary guidelines the first aims to ensure that potential donors are properly screened both medically and psychologically that afterward they are followed to ensure no problems develop and that people who are at increased risk never make it to the operating room the second lays out recommendations to ensure donors give their informed consent but some surgeons worry that insurance companies or juries will use the guidelines to penalize doctors who dont follow them moreover critics say that unos shouldnt be telling doctors how to practice medicine "guidelines should be quite broad to make sure donors are protected but the specifics of it may have to be left up to the center " says peter stock a transplant surgeon at the university of california san francisco and chairman of the unos kidney committee what if a father wants to donate to his desperately ill infant child but is a little too fat he asks should the transplant program turn him down "dictating the practice of medicine and surgery is not the role of unos let alone in the best interests of patients " said a letter from the american society of transplant surgeons protesting the proposals the unos board of directors will consider all the proposals at its meeting next week in los angeles the two other proposals set mandatory standards for programs that want to perform kidney and liver transplants with live donors such as how much training surgeons must have some in the transplant community believe that surgeons should take greater care in accepting living donors "its troubling " says david cronin a transplant surgeon at yale university where he says doctors have dropped their standards for donor blood pressure weight and diabetes he argues that even if donors fully consent to overly risky operations doctors shouldnt do them otherwise "youve just abdicated your responsibility as a health care provider " still dr cronin doesnt believe unos should be setting guidelines for medical practice "this is an external agency practicing medicine " he said "you dont see my patient and you dont see my donor and youre going to tell me who i can and cant use " unos has taken little action over the years to ensure donor safety even as the number of living organ donors has grown to rival and in some years exceed the number of deceased donors last year the department of health and human services directed the organization to develop policies governing living as well as deceased donation the guidelines under consideration are part of the groups response donor advocates say unos has an obligation to ensure that donors are protected and that it has waited too long to act most donors do well during and after surgery but some have short and long term medical and other problems the complication rate is high for liver donors particularly those who give away the larger half of their liver some kidney donors report problems too the original version of the proposals put out for public comment in july suggested potential kidney donors undergo a thorough medical and psychosocial evaluation including a long list of tests before being approved it directed centers to follow donors for two years after surgery and it said certain people should be ruled out including those who are obese or have high blood pressure or diabetes children under and those with illnesses such as hiv or hepatitis these conditions were labeled "absolute exclusion criteria " the proposals were written by the organizations living donor committee after reviewing transplant programs across the country the review revealed "wide variation" in standards with some centers lacking any formal standards the committee said the reaction from transplant surgeons was largely negative of the regions just four voted to approve the guidelines with several regions saying they were strongly opposed in response the living donor committee made changes aimed at mollifying critics it renamed the "absolute exclusion criteria" as "exclusion criteria " it removed the requirement to follow donors for two years post donation deleted mention of certain specific tests and changed the wording in the proposals title from "guidelines" to "recommendations " to make clear that they were voluntary the committee also made signification modifications to its guidelines for informed consent which received just two yes votes among the regions it dropped a detailed section on independent donor advocates who are meant to help potential donors make a decision about donating because this area was covered elsewhere and it dropped a section on follow up care for donors "were trying to be less prescriptive so we can get something passed " said tom falsy a member of the committee and the unos board who donated a kidney to a stranger after learning he wasnt a medical match to donate to his ill nephew his wife also donated to a stranger and after the surgery he said she developed pancreatitis and had to have her gall bladder removed "we definitely need to have some guidelines " he said "theyre long overdue and theyre needed " even the new vice chairman of the committee drawing up the guidelines opposes them andrew klein a surgeon at cedars sinai medical center in los angeles and vice chairman of the living donor committee says his committee isnt qualified to set out medical guidelines its members include representatives of the general public former donors and other nonsurgeons "their intentions were correct but in some cases the expertise wasnt there for them to have the same valued opinion as someone who practices this for a living and has the patients interests at heart " he said in an interview robert brown a surgeon at columbia university medical center who is chairman of the living donor committee said if anyone disagrees with one of the recommendations they should suggest a change "the fact that people disagree with various elements does not in my mind justify throwing out the baby with the bathwater " he said the proposals the united network for organ sharing is considering proposals to protect living donors they would create voluntary guidelines for screening of potential donors create voluntary guidelines for informing donors of risks involved set minimum criteria for hospitals that wish to perform living kidney transplants set minimum criteria for hospitals that wish to perform living liver transplants
