style on style shunning the runway at fashion week elie tahari eschews the glitz under the tents but at a cost marc jacobss shock value while the lines of the fashion frenzied snaked through the fashion tents at new yorks bryant park this week elie tahari remained above the fray the designer whose tailored suits and dresses are a staple of many professional womens closets served champagne and white wine to several hundred editors and retailer fashion directors in a quiet showroom across the street mr tahari has eschewed fashions runway shows for more than years opting instead to host so called presentations where his collections are displayed on mannequins and live models for several hours these presentations used by many emerging designers allow fashion editors to get a close look at the clothes still for mr tahari this is an increasingly risky strategy he hopes to double his companys &# million in annual revenue over the next five or so years to do so he says he may need to give in to the pressure to do a runway show since mr tahari embarked on this strategy the fashion business has changed fashion shows are no longer about displaying clothes that could actually be sold in stores instead they have become major marketing events aimed at generating buzz and establishing images not producing a runway collection makes it harder for mr tahari to get his clothes into the all important fashion and entertainment magazines key to his goal of doubling his sales "if wed done a show would we have gotten a magazine cover " he wonders but should mr tahari begin holding runway shows he would need to fundamentally alter his business since runway models are very very thin mr tahari who designs for real women would need to cut another set of patterns to fit six foot tall size women and that would change the way he designs "if i were to do a show our entire fit would have to change " he told me this week "it would affect the whole psychology of how i do business " mr tahari has a loyal following among professional women that style comes from mr taharis own interests his wife rory for instance is a highly organized working woman herself and serves as vice chairman and creative director of the company mr tahari professes to be attracted to women who have curves and "look like women " with the collection that will hit stores next spring mr tahari has once again managed to produce a broad line up of detailed clothing for women who want to look feminine without appearing like little girls there are graceful dresses and flowing wide legged high waisted pants that are forgiving of the imperfections of many womens figures he has also introduced shoes and handbags including one attractive bag shaped to hold files without looking like a briefcase these are the sorts of details that sell his clothes in saks and bloomingdales but these arent clothes in the outrageous spirit of runway collections these days the publicity savvy marc jacobs could be the poster child for the theatrical modern runway show the habitually late designers p m show in new york monday kicked off after p m he crammed guests into the aisles while a charity hawked t shirts to actor heath ledger and others for &# donations the crowd including victoria beckham vincent gallo and michael stipe was there to be part of an "it" moment the collection that the exuberant mr jacobs showed was dali esque heels protruding horizontally from the sole at the ball of the foot strips of fabric draped over satiny lingerie that evoked the s rather than todays engineered brassieres it was romantic artful and thought provoking but exactly the sort of thing that would scream "fashion victim" if worn on the street asked backstage if his clothes werent inaccessible to most consumers the ones who have made him rich and famous mr jacobs said "theyre supposed to be nothing is for everyone " yet the collection did its job its shock value received admiring reviews and the glam attendees and after party generated big publicity for the marc jacobs label the grand tour of fashion shows in new york london milan and paris grew out of discreet atelier affairs once held for th and early th century clients later they came to serve as industry trade shows but today the shows no longer cater to people who are directly filling stores or closets runway collections tend to be responsible for or less of a designers sales for the season most sales come from less expensive so called precollections which were wrapped up for spring long before the shows began this week some designers started selling precollections to retailers as early as last may "im not actually going to any shows " toby lerner womens contemporary buyer for boyds in philadelphia told me last week rather than working retail events fashion shows she noted have become "great theater " increasingly the new york fashion shows have become events not just for fashion companies but for those hoping to be associated with the glamour of fashion this week american express erected a skybox with a white shag rug and leather couches in the rafters atop bryant parks tents a select few customers paid &# to see a fashion show there while nibbling petrossian caviar the event was added to amexs catalog of opportunities for its elite card members including hopping on a zero gravity aircraft flight "weve been making an investment in fashion " said simon kahn vice president for platinum and centurion card product management amex also arranged for donatella versace last week to allow a group of elite credit card holders to buy pieces from her current fall collection before it is available in stores but one amex customer who bought skybox tickets epitomized the relationship between the runways and the average consumer who seeks something beyond performance art susan rubin a compliance official with a new york hedge fund struggled to find anything she thought she might wear from marc bouwers slinky collection as rail thin models pranced in high heels and bathing suits she suggested "some of these things you could wear if youre skinny " email christina binkley wsj com
