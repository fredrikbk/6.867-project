educating offending at the same time egyptian campaign against harassment raises awareness ire cairo earlier this year ad agency co owner mohamed el sawy launched a public awareness campaign against sexual harassment on the streets of egypt a problem that is drawing increasing attention here through a cultural center he founded mr el sawy put up signs along the streets of cairo and nearby giza the ads warned men that if they didnt take action to prevent harassment their mother sister or daughter could be the next victim mobile phone operator mobinil provided funding and in june the ads began running in about lighted boxes such boxes essentially small scale billboards are used frequently by advertisers here the ads in bright red and black lettering on a yellow background played with four variations on a theme if men dont put an end to street harassment women in their own families could be next the phrasing in arabic was the same in all four versions except for one change "your mother " "your sister " "your daughter" or "your wife " but the warning that ones female relatives might be targeted was deemed too provocative by some one version in particular pushed the envelope it translated "your mother refrain and stop others before its her turn " in egypt as in the u s "your mother" can have different connotations some seen as inappropriate for public advertising particularly in much of the middle east where a mans honor can be tied to the reputation of his mother and other women in his family the words can be said in more than one way in arabic and the particular phrase used in the signs omak can also be associated with an insult as it can be in english a columnist for daily newspaper al akhbar blasted the campaign saying the reference was offensive and warning that the signs might give tourists the impression that cairos streets were unsafe cairo officials ordered the ads removed an employee of the governorate of cairo says the city received complaints from ordinary egyptians offended by the phrasing of the ads mr el sawy pulled all the ads he says officials in giza didnt order the ads removed but he took those down too the controversy over the campaign underscores the challenges involved in navigating sometimes competing cultural sensitivities in a place like egypt the arab worlds most populous country it is a pop culture and media hub for the rest of the region but it remains socially conservative and religious harassment from catcalls and lewd remarks to indecent exposure and groping is a troubling urban social ill here a few recent high profile cases have drawn more attention to the problem activists have accused the government of not doing enough to crack down on offenders "the message has to be provocative " mr el sawy says "it is a serious issue " he says some women came up to him to thank him for the campaign but antiharassment campaigners need to tread lightly says nehad abolkomsan who heads the egyptian center for womens rights a nonprofit group based in cairo many egyptians feel issues like sexual harassment arent pressing enough to warrant much attention in a country that suffers from poverty and unemployment she says elham abu el fateh the al akhbar columnist who wrote about the el sawy campaign says that while the campaigns creators meant well it failed to accommodate the sensitivities of the audience "were a religious society and we hold the mother in high esteem " she says "you feel a stab in the heart" when reading the "mother" sign ms abu el fateh wrote in a column the campaign could scare women away from public places and give tourists a bad impression about the country she wrote "have the streets of cairo been transformed into a jungle of sick people harassing women " she wrote "of course not " hala el khatib a spokeswoman for egypts ministry of tourism says it is the harassment not campaigns against it that could hurt tourism but she is no fan of the wording of mr el sawys "mother" ads either "its a bit shocking " she says mobinil the sponsor whose name appeared on the ads didnt return calls for comment mr el sawys center has spearheaded other public interest campaigns against smoking wasting water and honking horns unnecessarily but he wasnt expecting the reaction he got with the antiharassment messages still he says he is determined to carry on he wants to produce antiharassment tv spots to air on egyptian and arab satellite channels he worries that the black eye the campaign suffered may scare away potential sponsors but says that wont deter him "it is not smart to hide our problems " he says "they wont be solved unless theyre exposed " ad notes wal mart kicks off new campaign with new tagline wal mart stores inc s newest ad campaign which begins
