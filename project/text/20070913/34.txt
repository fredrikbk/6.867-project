fumes add risk to heart patient fitness associated press people with heart disease may want to steer clear of traffic when exercising or take their workouts indoors to avoid breathing polluted air exercising in areas with high levels of diesel exhaust and microscopic soot particles is especially risky for people with heart disease according to the first study in which heart patients were directly exposed to pollution european researchers found that brief exposure to diluted diesel exhaust during exercise reduced an important anticlotting substance in the blood and worsened exercise induced ischemia or insufficient flow of blood and oxygen to the heart such changes can trigger a heart attack and even death "we now have evidence that being exposed to diesel fuel exhaust during exercise will cause cardiac ischemia and that if you have heart disease it can only make things worse " said dr abraham sanders a lung specialist at new york presbyterian hospital who wasnt involved in the study the results have big implications about million americans have heart disease according to the american heart association in addition people with asthma bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also should use caution and avoid polluted air when exercising dr sanders recommended heart and respiratory patients should keep exercising regularly however because it is so beneficial to overall health doctors say numerous studies have shown a link between short term and long term exposure to air pollution and higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths because of poor blood supply to the heart abnormal heart rhythms gradual heart failure and stroke this study adds to the knowledge about how air pollution harms people and it aims to show what pollution is doing in the body that information might eventually give clues for preventing such problems said dr howard m kipen director of clinical research at rutgers universitys environmental and occupational health sciences institute "its quite amazing what they found " but not a surprise he said still "most doctors arent aware that little bits of pollution can cause heart attacks " the european study was reported in todays new england journal of medicine researchers in sweden and the united kingdom tested men aged about who had survived a heart attack at least six months earlier had blockages cleared and propped open with a stent and were getting treatment to prevent a second heart attack the researchers noted they tested only men with stable heart disease and good tolerance for exercise and they monitored each closely to ensure none suffered health problems on two separate occasions each man was put in an enclosed chamber for an hour and exposed to either diluted diesel exhaust or clean filtered air they rode an exercise bike for two minute periods and rested in between the men had electrodes attached to their bodies to monitor the hearts electrical activity while exercising and exposed to diesel exhaust the men experienced drops in the hearts electrical activity two to six times greater than when they were breathing filtered air those reductions indicated the heart muscles werent getting enough blood while diesel exhaust contains many harmful chemicals the researchers said they believe particulates in the exhaust are the main harm to the heart patients
