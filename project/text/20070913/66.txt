likelihood of a recession is given better odds economists debate if job outlook is as bad as feared economic forecasters are boosting the odds of a recession over the next months as the housing slump deepens and the credit crisis continues but there is sharp disagreement over the likelihood of a contraction with some arguing it is all but inevitable and others insisting the economy will skirt a downturn economists in the latest wsj com survey pegged the risk of a recession at on average up from a month earlier fifty five economists took part in the survey and answered the question about the likelihood of a recession the survey was conducted after last fridays report on august employment which showed the first monthly jobs decline in four years the survey showed a divergence of views about the economic outlook with the chances of a recession put at to eleven economists said there was at least a chance on the other end economists said the chance of recession was lower than the range highlights an intense argument over whether the housing and financial problems will infect the broader economy will the tightening credit conditions damp business investment and hiring are consumers set to reduce their spending if so is the global economy and its appetite for american goods robust enough to make up for any drop in demand in the u s according to the survey the most likely course for the economy is a substantial slowdown in growth not an outright recession on average the economists surveyed predicted that the gross domestic product would rise at a annual rate in the fourth quarter well below the rate estimated a month earlier they see growth at a rate in the first quarter of down from an earlier estimate of economists in the recession camp say that drops in employment and housing declines of the current magnitude rarely occur outside of periods around recessions in addition the housing market decline is reducing household wealth and hurting consumers ability to tap home equity also the credit market turmoil could exacerbate the housing problems and curb consumers opportunities to borrow the result they say slower consumer spending which accounts for of economic activity "the economy has been juiced by this rapid credit expansion and i think thats over " said steve east chief economist at friedman billings ramsey &amp co inc who predicts a chance of recession "thats the message of the credit market turmoil the economy is not going to have as much high octane fuel to run on " alliance bernstein economist joseph carson who puts the chance of a recession at just said consumers already have adjusted their spending as a result of the housing correction and a precipitous consumption drop isnt likely and even though employment fell last month overall incomes are growing "we think the spending trends are still pointing to modest growth in the u s not a recession " mr carson said one of the biggest sources of dispute is the employment outlook the dip in employment last month stunned wall street because the labor market has remained strong throughout the year damping concerns about rising energy prices tighter credit and declines in housing some economists think the employment drop was an aberration contradicted by private surveys that show little change in businesses hiring activity and plans a slight dip in jobs if reversed in coming months ultimately could have little impact on the economy "i dont think the consumer rolls over because i think the labor market will remain decent and income growth will remain supportive for consumer spending " said conrad dequadros senior economist at bear stearns which puts the possibility of a recession at still few analysts say they believe the housing market has reached its low point home prices are expected to drop sales are expected to slow and construction activity is set to decline further through at least the next year and only one out of eight economists in the wsj com survey say the credit crisis with related market turmoil has mostly run its course about say it is about half over with the rest saying it is in the early stages recessions generally include at least two consecutive quarters of declining output accompanied by rising unemployment and shrinking profits the national bureau of economic research the nonprofit organization that is the official arbiter of when recessions begin and end bases its assessment on numerous economic indicators and defines a recession as a "significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months " economists often dont know a recession has started until well after the fact sometimes leading to rosy outlooks even after a downturn is already under way the last recession began in march but nber didnt identify its starting point until november which it later designated as the end point of the recession a key factor influencing whether a recession hits is whether the housing slump crimps consumer spending over time or "if it comes all in a big rush " said michael mussa a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics with a modest consumer spending slowdown "if we have a recession its likely to be a relatively brief and mild one " mr mussa said the possibility of a protracted downturn is driving the debate over the federal reserves next move fed actions in changing interest rates tend to affect the economy with a lag that could hit after other problems become apparent "the economy is now being hit by big shocks" from housing the credit crisis and energy prices said desmond lachman a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute who puts the likelihood of a recession at and says a series of rate cuts are needed "whether its a deeper recession or not vs depends on what the policy response is " in the wsj com survey three out of four economists responding said the fed helped cause the latest credit market turmoil by setting interest rates too low for too long this decade the forecasters gave fed chairman ben bernanke a grade of out of for his performance leading the central bank almost two thirds said his response time to market turmoil during his tenure was "about right " while a third said he has been too slow to respond two thirds also said his predecessor alan greenspan had in terms of timing responded appropriately to market turmoil but of respondents said mr greenspan was too quick to respond
