putin shake up aims to preserve policies influence aides shuffle fuels succession intrigue ahead of march vote moscow vladimir putin fired his cabinet and named an obscure bureaucrat as prime minister moving to ensure that his influence and his strategy for rebuilding russias clout continue after his term expires the russian president appointed viktor zubkov the year old head of russias anti money laundering agency as prime minister succeeding mikhail fradkov the announcement surprised political analysts who have been watching the kremlin for clues about whom mr putin will back to succeed to the presidency when he steps down in the spring as the constitution requires yesterdays upheaval does little to clarify the succession race that scramble is unfolding in the halls of the kremlin far out of public view kremlinologists say mr zubkovs age and low profile make him a highly unlikely successor but the zubkov appointment may achieve a more immediate aim installing a man without an independent power base will leave the year old mr putin even more room to maneuver the president is unlikely to anoint a favorite until late this year kremlin officials have said in order to keep a grip on power for as long as possible mr putin already has helped cement his policies by filling the government and major state companies with longtime allies and supporters many of them fellow veterans of the kgb the former soviet security and intelligence agency "this is about preserving the continuity of vladimir putins policies and about preserving the entire political team " said sergei markov a political analyst who has worked for the kremlin "the main task for russia now is to ensure continuity of the course that has been implemented over the last few years " said konstantin kosachev a senior legislator from the pro kremlin party in parliament it "will allow the country to get through the perturbations" of the elections " he told russian journalists sergei ivanenko deputy head of the yabloko opposition party saw it differently "he could name anyone he wants as prime minister as long as he has the confidence of the president " he said "the system is trying as hard as it can to adapt to the unpleasant reality of elections which are painful for any authoritarian regime " mr zubkov worked on mr putins staff in the mayors office in st petersburg in the early s a time when the future president bonded with many of his closest allies he is a longtime putin ally who has carefully avoided siding with any factions within the kremlin analysts said money laundering prosecutions have risen sharply since he set up the agency and russia has earned removal from the international blacklist of money laundering countries mr zubkov has rarely spoken in public he did however make headlines in when he warned that his agency had a list of banks that might be closed because of money laundering violations helping to trigger a crisis of confidence in the banking system opinion polls show most russians support mr putin and his policies putting the presidents approval rating above since he took office in russias economy has boomed for the first time in more than a decade lifting tens of millions of russians out of poverty on a wave of prosperity driven in large part by high world oil prices mr putins kremlin has steadily tightened its grip on the political system making important posts appointed instead of elected and marginalizing opposition parties through tight state control over elections and major media emboldened by its huge oil wealth the kremlin has become a more assertive player on the world stage in recent years vying with western countries for influence in the rest of the former soviet union and the middle east in particular moves such as the cutoff of gas supplies to ukraine in a pricing dispute have triggered accusations moscow is using its vast energy resources as a political lever while last years poisoning death of a prominent kremlin critic in london for which british authorities have charged a former russian security agent have contributed to an increase in tensions with moscow inside russia where kremlin controlled national television is a major tool for forming public opinion the aggressive policy line is popular investors too have cheered mr putins years in office pumping money into financial markets and industrial projects even as the kremlin has renationalized critical sectors of the economy and squeezed some foreign investors the shake up also gives the kremlin a chance to deflect popular discontent with some of its policies such as overhauls in state funded health care and education by replacing the ministers responsible for those areas mr putin praised the departing government for its economic results in his brief public comments on the changes he cited the need to restructure the government "to prepare the country for the period after the elections " he didnt elaborate flying off to central russia for a meeting with school officials to discuss education overhaul mr fradkov later told the cabinet the move was part of the presidents "plan of action" aimed at ensuring continuity the two officials widely seen as likely candidates for the presidency first deputy prime ministers sergei ivanov and dmitry medvedev have enjoyed lavish coverage on state television for more than a year both are loyal members of mr putins team they have actively supported his drive to centralize power over politics and the economy and to conduct a more assertive foreign policy mr ivanov was defense minister for most of mr putins term while mr medvedev is chairman of state gas titan oao gazprom neither man will acknowledge harboring presidential ambitions however russian media had reported this week that mr ivanov who has been shown on state tv together with mr putin most often in recent months would be named prime minister as a springboard to the presidency in a lengthy meeting with visiting foreign analysts and journalists yesterday mr ivanov described the government shake up as a routine event participants said he seemed confident rejecting the idea that he was disappointed not to have been named prime minister himself "everything told me that at gut level this guy felt things are going his way " one participant said mr ivanov devoted most of the time to describing how the government planned to spend the countrys oil wealth in the decades ahead "officially mr putin hasnt chosen anyone as a successor though perhaps de facto he has " said igor bunin head of the center for political technologies a moscow political consultancy "he doesnt want to tie his hands " mr bunin said mr zubkov might even be elected president and serve for a short time before giving up the office to mr putin who isnt barred from running again later that scenario isnt considered likely however mr putins appointment of the departing prime minister mr fradkov to the job in was a similar surprise mr fradkov had been an unknown trade official and had no links to the various competing factions in the kremlin at the time making him a loyal executive for mr putin who kept tight control over policy decisions but mr fradkov in recent months had increasingly become a player in the intense maneuvering between factions within the kremlin over the succession said christopher granville editor at trusted sources an emerging markets analytical service in london "he became a de facto candidate of one of the factions " mr granville said potentially complicating mr putins ability to make the choice himself mr putin praised mr fradkovs performance and asked him and the rest of the cabinet to stay on until successors are confirmed over the next few weeks
