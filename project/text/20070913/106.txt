taxes what is fair what is middle class rep charles b rangels sept letter to the editor regarding the economy is short on substance but long on undefined terms such as "fairness" and "middle class " it also fails to directly challenge any points made in the editorial what would be more helpful is if rep rangel were to write a full op ed piece in which he lays out with actual numbers what he thinks constitutes an equitable tax code specifically i would be interested to know what percentage of the total tax burden should the top bear the top the top also i think it would be helpful if rep rangel actually defined who is middle class further i would appreciate it if he could please explain why tax revenue continues to increase while the deficit shrinks under the bush tax cuts when all we heard a couple years ago was how the "bush tax cuts for the rich" were not affordable i imagine we will not be seeing this sort of disclosure any time soon but rather will have to settle for the democrats standard tax plan outline more taxes timothy o corkery boston rep rangel talks about making the tax code more "fair" and "equitable " does he not realize that according to the irs in the top of income earners in the u s paid of all income taxes while earning of all income the bottom paid only of income taxes and made of all income how much more "equitable" does he want to make it he also has railed against the alternative mininum tax when in fact it was liberals like him who devised the amt tax to try to soak the few dozen "rich" who were legally paying no income tax hold on to your wallets when a liberal talks about making things more "fair" by soaking the rich because inevitably he will be coming after you j d koerner omaha neb
