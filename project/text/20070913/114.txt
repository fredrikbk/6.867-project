business day sign up for the e mail here all in one day oil prices reached a new record car makers at the frankfurt auto show jostled to display their most fuel efficient models and a federal judge in vermont endorsed for the first time new state rules that would reduce emissions and by extension increase fuel efficiency in cars on american roads gm daimlerchrysler the alliance of automobile manufacturers and a group of vermont car dealers had banded together to sue that state over rules that would require a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks by the group argued that the rules would force them to redesign their vehicles which would drive up car prices and drive down sales lawyers have pointed out that the industry must "take into account safety performance and cargo space in combination with improvements in fuel economy " as the washington post writes alan weverstad executive director of environment and energy for gm told the court that compliance would cost his company &# billion and by it would still be seven miles per gallon short of the mpg target the detroit news reports however an expert for vermont contended the new rules would add &# to the cost of a vehicle far less than the auto makers estimate of as much as &# judge william sessions rejected a host of industry arguments including that the rules would limit consumer choice create economic hardship for car makers increase unemployment undermine safety and allow states to usurp federal authority as the new york times reports "it is improbable " he wrote according to the times "that an industry that prides itself on its modernity flexibility and innovativeness will be unable to meet the requirements of the regulation especially with the range of technological possibilities and alternatives currently before it " vermonts rules like those adopted by other states are a copy of californias and altogether about a third of the nations auto market is at issue the wall street journal reports "california has special dispensation under federal law to enact emissions rules that are tougher than the federal governments a nod to californias record of dirty air " the journal writes adding that other states can replicate californias standards as vermonts effort is an extension of californias and california is waiting for its latest federal waiver the vermont court decision could still be rendered irrelevant "congress has essentially designated california as a proving ground for innovation in emissions control regulations " judge sessions wrote according to the sacramento bee "history suggests that the ingenuity of the auto industry once put in gear responds admirably to most technological challenges " the detroit free press writes that "the industrys best hope for stopping the rules lies with the u s environmental protection agency " but the paper notes that the epa has never turned down californias request for a waiver to enact emissions rules and california has said it will sue the epa if it does the journal says the ruling may actually encourage the auto industry to soften its stance against tougher federal fuel efficiency rules because "a potential patchwork of differing state rules bearing on fuel economy could prove even costlier for the industry" than one set of rules enforced by congress the governors of states might have had that in mind after the ruling yesterday when they sent a letter to gm ford chrysler toyota honda and nissan urging them to drop their legal challenges to the state laws as the free press reports "we do not believe it is productive for your industry to continue to fight state implementation of clean tailpipe standards " the governors wrote "we would prefer to follow a path that encourages innovation not litigation " meanwhile innovation in the clean tailpipe department was on full display across the atlantic as green credentials and fuel economy gasoline powered diesel powered and gasoline electric powered took center stage at the auto show in frankfurt germany prompting even bentley to post fuel consumption and co emission data as the journal reports perhaps more significantly for the move toward fuel efficiency the price of oil surged above &# a barrel yesterday before landing at the record settlement price of &# "powerful shifts in the markets clearly are at work " businessweek writes in explaining why opec took the surprise decision this week to increase global crude oil output jeffrey currie an analyst at goldman sachs tells the magazine that the cartel simply doesnt have enough oil to influence long term prices as production outside the gulf becomes more and more expensive mr currie says a bear market for oil is no longer &# a barrel but &# while a bull market is &# and now we are heading into a bull market just as the whole pricing structure has shifted upward businessweek writes "it is a potent combination we havent seen before " mr currie says financial efficiency drive also gaining momentum and on other automobile fronts united auto workers president ron gettelfinger is willing to agree in principle to the creation of a multibillion dollar union controlled health care trust fund to allow detroits big three to shed &# billion in retiree costs people familiar with the matter tell the wall street journal the sides are in talks over a new labor contract and they must still close a gap over how much money the auto makers would put into the fund a gap "still well into the several billion dollars range" but narrowing these people tell the journal one obstacle is mr gettelfingers desire to take less money initially and have the manufacturers agree to put more money in later if health care costs rise quickly or the trusts investments dont earn as much as expected the auto makers are split on this idea a deal could free up money to help the big three turn around their ailing north american operations the journal says gm is believed to owe about &# billion in future retiree costs ford about &# billion and chrysler around &# billion fleeing from not to the dollar it is no coincidence businessweek writes that the u s dollar is hitting new lows just as oil prices hit new highs the dollars decline benefits some resource firms like oil producers and mining companies but the fact that the currency can buy fewer commodities puts pressure on u s consumers and other businesses yesterday the dollar traded at its lowest level against the euro and with investors anticipating an interest rate cut by the u s federal reserve and therefore likely to move their funds into a currency whose yield isnt expected to decline more pressure on the greenback is likely businessweek sees "an irony in the dollars recent hard times in times of global financial panic the u s is often seen as a safe haven a place to flee from risk " but the credit crisis that is currently scaring investors "is largely an american creation and it appears u s growth may slow as a result investors are finding other places to protect their money " the magazine writes businessweek sees three possible scenarios going forward one the dollar continues its slow steady decline two the u s slowdown spreads overseas prompting european interest rate cuts that encourage the dollar to recover or three the drop in the dollar accelerates also of note financial times a clear divide between the worlds leading central banks over how best to respond to the credit squeeze emerged after mervyn king bank of england governor warned that efforts by his counterparts to shore up the financial system could sow "the seeds of a future financial crisis " los angeles times home prices fell in most southern california neighborhoods and the number of sales tumbled to a year low for
