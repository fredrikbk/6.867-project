capital banks new credit austerity to help set economys path the outlook for the u s economy turns on two factors one is how much worse the nations housing market gets that may be hard to predict but its easy to understand the other is how much of the continuing disturbance in financial markets infects the rest of the economy thats neither easy to predict nor easy to understand the key is what banks will do and how much impact it will have theres irony in that because a salient feature of st century finance is that banks have become increasingly less important players in the old days banks made loans carefully because they got burned if the borrower didnt repay think of this as wooden baseball bat finance today banks make loans turn many of them into securities and sell them to investors pocketing the fees someone else gets burned if the borrower defaults think of this as composite metal baseball bat finance the game is quicker the ball goes farther but it turns out banks may not have unloaded as much of the risk as they thought and thats the rub wall street firms and commercial banks according to citigroup estimates hold about &# billion in bridge loans made to finance acquisitions loans they intended to lay off in markets that are no longer quite so interested in them the banks may be stuck with those merger loans "diminished demand for loans and bonds to finance highly leverage transactions has increased some banks concerns that they may have to bring significant quantities of these instruments onto their balance sheets " fed chairman ben bernanke said a couple of weeks ago at the kansas city feds symposium in jackson hole wyo then theres the mushrooming problem one hardly anyone saw coming of entities called structured investment vehicles and conduits many of them hold subprime mortgages and related securities and counted on selling more than &# trillion in short term ious called commercial paper to finance their holdings investors no longer want that commercial paper so what do these entities do now they turn to u s and european banks some of which sponsored the conduits and remind them of the commitments the banks made to provide credit if the commercial paper market dried up goodbye metal bats hello old fashioned wooden bat style banking suddenly banks find themselves with all sorts of unanticipated loans on their books so what in the antiseptic language of central bankers mr bernanke explained "these banks" the ones stuck with merger loans they didnt intend to hold and those providing backup lines of credit to conduits "have become more protective of their liquidity and balance sheet capacity " they are hoarding cash or buying short term treasurys and that means making fewer new loans the result as citigroups steven wieting puts it more bluntly "higher debt costs and reduced access to credit for borrowers " saddled with loans to finance mergers or back stop conduits that cant sell commercial paper banks are likely to be less willing to lend to ordinary consumers and businesses or at the very least will be charging more for those loans so consumers and businesses are likely to borrow a little less and spend a little less and a financial disturbance could be transmitted through the banking system to the rest of the economy no wonder theres growing worry the u s is going to slide into recession in short even though banks are financially sturdy compared with past bouts of turmoil there are constraints on how much unwanted lending they will do without curtailing ordinary lending some of those constraints are due to the intricacies of minimum capital standards and liquidity ratios and others involve the general tendency to be cautious during times of uncertainty as if that wasnt enough theres another layer everyone knows banks have a lot of loans on their books that theyd like to sell but cant or wont at todays prices so some deep pocketed speculators the ones who buy when prices plummet and then help bring them back up are waiting for prices to fall further and that increases the risk of a prolonged period of financial market turmoil which in turn increases the risks to the rest of the economy which in turn makes bankers understandably a little more wary about lending the issue isnt whether all this is happening it is the issue is how big an impact banks behavior will have on the economy some analysts say its a sideshow compared with the housing slump others say its the most important factor in whether the markets and the economy bounce back as quickly as they did in and no doubt it will be one of the big issues on the table when mr bernanke and his colleagues meet next week to ponder how much to cut interest rates to offset the markets tightening of the credit spigot
