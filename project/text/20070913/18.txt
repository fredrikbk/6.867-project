court roils auto rules debate vermont wins right to limit emissions nationwide ripples a federal judges ruling that vermont can limit greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks will have national implications in the intensifying debate over fuel economy and global warming federal district judge william k sessions iii rejected auto makers arguments that vermonts auto emissions law amounts to a backdoor state attempt to regulate automotive fuel economy a power that under federal law is reserved for washington the judges reasoning the vermont laws impact goes beyond fuel economy to cover other areas making it more than a fuel economy mandate the ruling could have repercussions nationally but is likely to draw an industry appeal california a national environmental bellwether is in similar litigation over its attempt to require cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles sold there the ruling in the federal district of vermont would appear to give california momentum judge sessions wrote he "remains unconvinced automakers cannot meet the challenges of vermonts and californias" greenhouse gas rules still a federal judge in california could decide that case differently california gov arnold schwarzenegger said the vermont ruling "marks another important victory in the fight against global warming california and other states that want to take aggressive action will no longer be blocked by those who stand in our way " more broadly the ruling is likely to increase pressure on congress to toughen federal fuel efficiency rules known as the corporate average fuel economy or cafe standards and to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from sectors beyond autos the auto industry argues against sharp changes in those rules saying they would hurt the industry but a potential patchwork of differing state rules bearing on fuel economy could prove even costlier for the industry and could push it to soften its stance in washington california has special dispensation under federal law to enact emissions rules that are tougher than the federal governments a nod to californias record of dirty air other states can replicate californias standards but california first must get a federal waiver and its latest request is pending because vermonts effort is an extension of californias the vermont court decision could be rendered moot if california doesnt get its waiver meanwhile other states are hoping to follow californias lead all told about a third of the nations auto market auto makers argue that overly aggressive mileage rules would force them to build smaller vehicles that consumers wont buy the industry is considering appealing the vermont decision said dave mccurdy head of the alliance of automobile manufacturers the industrys main washington lobbying group "federal law is designed to ensure a consistent fuel economy program across the country " kevin holewinski a lawyer at jones day in washington who defends companies in global warming suits but isnt involved in the auto related litigation took issue with the ruling and predicted the industry will appeal it "the states overstepping its authority " he said agreeing with the auto makers argument that the vermont law amounts to a state fuel economy mandate even if it also has other environmental effects "suggesting that there are these collateral consequences i think quite frankly is wholly beside the point " he said a spokeswoman for the white house council on environmental quality said the bush administrations "relevant agencies are reviewing this decision " she cited recent moves by the administration to curb automotive gasoline use matt pawa a lawyer for environmental groups that joined vermont in defending against the industrys lawsuit said the ruling represented a "great victory for global warming vermont the planet california and the auto industry " governors of states that plan to implement the california greenhouse gas rules issued a letter yesterday to the chief executives of the top six auto makers by sales in the u s calling on them to stop suing to block regulations the vermont regulations would increase mileage steeper and faster than measures that are being considered in congress regulating tailpipe emissions effectively forces auto makers to improve mileage since greenhouse gases are produced when vehicles burn fossil fuels such as gasoline congress meanwhile is considering legislation that would force auto makers to achieve an average of miles a gallon for their fleets of cars and trucks over the next decade or so as much as a increase over current standards but less aggressive than the rules states are pursuing the bush administration is fast tracking similar new rules for year end at the heart of the vermont and california disputes is whether a state law limiting greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles is tantamount to a fuel economy standard judge sessions ruled that though carbon dioxide which is produced by burning fuel "represents the bulk" of greenhouse gas emissions from autos vermonts rules "embrace much more than a simple requirement to improve fuel economy cloaked in the rhetoric of reducing carbon dioxide emissions " he explained that automotive air conditioners also produce greenhouse gases that would be regulated by the vermont law he also rejected auto makers arguments that the vermont law would cost too much "history suggests that the ingenuity of the industry once put in gear responds admirably to most technological challenges " he wrote
