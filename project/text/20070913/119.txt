the ride choice a texas city ponders buses arlington texas truck driver mark soliz began walking his five mile commute to his companys offices this summer because he couldnt afford the high cost of gasoline tired of hoofing it in degree heat he applied to a local charity for a donated bicycle and now cycles the distance "anything to get there anything other than walking " he says climbing gasoline prices have hit low income workers as never before and that is particularly evident in this city sandwiched between dallas and fort worth though mr soliz owns a car for him and many other cash strapped residents here high gas prices have made driving a last resort and taking a bus or train isnt an option arlington population holds the distinction of being the largest city in the u s without public transportation according to the american public transportation association in washington that could begin changing soon the arlington city council is mulling proposals to go into a partnership with neighboring fort worth for buses to ferry commuters between the two cities during rush hour if the cities can work out the details arlington officials hope to begin a six month trial of the service sometime next year in some parts of the country commuters have begun relying more on public transportation as gasoline prices have climbed national public transit usage has jumped since says rose sheridan vice president of the american public transportation association but southern cities were designed for cheap gasoline urban sprawl here developed around a car and freeway system rather than subway and train mass transit arlington residents have voted down a public bus system three times in the last years worried about big buses lumbering down their quiet suburban streets as well as the cost of a service that many believe would benefit only a few but advocates say the citys growing population coupled with the pain of higher gasoline prices make buses an easier sell now today more than half of arlington workers commute to jobs outside the city according to city data when the united way polled community leaders in asking them to name the citys greatest needs public transportation topped the list though the routes for the busses havent been determined yet and the stops in arlington would likely be limited "its at least a beginning " says arlington mayor robert cluck oil futures prices rose sharply yesterday briefly climbing above &# a barrel and reaching an all time high gasoline prices have doubled in recent years peaking in may at an average &# a gallon

that dont have convenient public transportation typically compensate in various ways they can switch to a more fuel efficient vehicle telecommute or cut back on luxuries such as restaurants and movies "they leave their suburban at home and take their prius " says dan sperling director of the institute of transportation studies at the university of california los angeles low paid workers have fewer options as they are already living on a shoestring cutbacks can mean going without groceries and utilities they also often drive older less fuel efficient cars mr sperling says melinda daniel drives a cadillac el dorado that gets very low gas mileage after breaking up with her boyfriend in fort worth she could no longer afford the gas to commute to her job in customer service at alliance funding in arlington and she temporarily moved into a salvation army shelter while looking for an apartment nearer where she worked "in arlington if you dont have a car youre really stuck as far as trying to find a decent job and make a decent living " ms daniel said yet opposition to public transit has remained intense in arlington some opponents argue the city isnt big enough to justify public transportation while others worry it would mainly serve to subsidize the poor attracting a less affluent population to the city "a mass transit system should not be a charitable operation " says warren norred the president of norred sales and engineering in arlington who helped spearhead the campaign that defeated the most recent bus system at the polls in bill eastland a local tax accountant and bus opponent who lost a bid for a city council seat earlier this year doubts the new proposed arlington fort worth bus routes will see much use he describes public transit as "high cost and low

"its a public service " mr worth said arlingtons latest bus proposal will face fewer hurdles than more ambitious plans in the past though the city may hold public hearings on the plan it doesnt require a vote because of the programs narrow scope and more modest &# price tag a fraction of the cost of a full city bus program partly because the routes will be limited in the meantime some
