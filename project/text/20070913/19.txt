credit crunch zions looks to ease fears even before they emerge zions bancorp has lent financial support to a commercial paper "conduit" in a way that may have helped the vehicle avoid formally seeking help the salt lake city based bank holding company provided funding to the conduit an off balance sheet vehicle used to sell commercial paper by having its affiliate banks purchase some of the vehicles ious as they came due in recent weeks zions disclosed in materials accompanying a presentation yesterday by chief executive harris simmons at a banking conference that allowed the conduit known as lockhart funding to roll over its commercial paper at a time when many similar vehicles have had difficulty reselling their ious or as investors have demanded higher yields before buying the notes if lockhart which has about &# billion in assets couldnt sell its paper the conduit could have been forced to tap zions for special funding help through what is known as a liquidity backstop agreement with the bank given the current jitters in the commercial paper market formally calling on zions for funds could have made it more difficult for the conduit to sell its notes it also may have spooked the banks own shareholders there is nothing improper with zions move and other banks are believed to be doing the same zions also has fully disclosed the tactic one of the few banks to do so yet this shows the unprecedented steps banks are taking in reaction to the credit crunch in his presentation at the lehman brothers banking conference in new york mr simmons noted that zions affiliate banks would be able to purchase as much as about &# billion in lockhart notes if needed under legal lending limits but the affiliate banks havent bought the conduits paper in recent days and earlier this week the vehicle had more than enough buyers to roll over its notes "were finding that this market is thawing out a bit although it is still very volatile " mr simmons said a spokesman for the banking group said there was a difference between the affiliated banks which are owned by zions purchasing lockharts commercial paper and the group itself providing liquidity to the vehicle by buying some of its assets "our banks may buy commercial paper from this or other conduits its different from holding the assets owned by that conduit " he added for zions shareholders the end result is pretty much the same whether the groups affiliate banks buy lockharts paper or zions itself provides liquidity either way zions has provided funds to the conduit and essentially brought some of the vehicles assets onto its own balance sheet technically if zions bank affiliates buy paper from lockhart the notes which are underpinned by the conduits assets are on their books and they are subsequently consolidated on zions balance sheet if lockhart was to trigger the liquidity backstop agreement with zions the group would purchase assets directly out of the conduit and record them on its books "the affiliated banks are the parents subsidiaries so it looks like they are funding these liquidity commitments " said pri de silva an analyst at research firm creditsights the zions spokesman acknowledged that the purchase of the conduits paper "is the same in the sense that it provides financial support to lockhart but from an accounting perspective it is a different transaction for both lockhart and zions " he added that if the liquidity backstop arrangement is triggered and zions buys assets from the conduit lockhart hasnt any obligation to buy them back in the future "if you buy commercial paper overnight from them its an overnight transaction " he said zions investors are sensitive to its conduit exposure because it is relatively large as a percentage of assets compared with other banks the total &# billion in liquidity that zions could be forced to provide in a worst case scenario is equal to about of the banks assets according to a report from bank of america analysts
