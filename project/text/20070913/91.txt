putinology vladimir putin dissolved the russian government yesterday and tapped viktor zubkov to lead the next cabinet the new generation of kremlinologists a soviet era species thats thriving anew in the age of putin is flummoxed with half a year to go before president putin must step aside under the constitution a new prime minister was supposed to claim the inside track for the top job but no one predicted this appointment so is mr zubkov really the heir apparent and who is viktor zubkov mr zubkov who turns saturday heads the federal financial monitoring service charged with fighting money laundering until yesterday afternoon political gossip sheets tipped him to win a seat from omsk in decembers parliamentary elections dig further on his resume and the fog fades a little he hails from mr putins hometown of st petersburg where in the early s he worked under mr putin in the mayors office he stood for governor of st petersburg province in placing fourth with of the vote before returning to the state bureaucracy mr putin subsequently canceled direct elections for governor little known beyond the walls of the kremlin mr zubkov is a member of the presidents small inner circle in he was one of the few people invited to mr putins birthday party and even helped blow out the candles according to profil a russian publication hes close to putin allies boris gryzlov the parliament speaker and viktor ivanov who heads aeroflot mr zubkovs daughter is married to defense minister anatoly serdyukov such tight clan and family links are the keys to power in todays russia if this surprise pick is the first step in the succession then it follows established precedent russian presidents are appointed not elected boris yeltsin made mr putin a political nonentity prime minister four months before handing him his job mr putin never ran for public office before winning the elections one man alone knows who will rule the kremlin come spring and hes not telling by the rules of president putins "managed democracy " the people wont have much of a say perhaps mr putin wants a loyal cipher to let him pull the strings from behind the scenes after leaving office if so mr zubkov would seem to fit the bill another scenario sees an incompetent candidate take over then willingly resign after a short while and hand power back to mr putin who then wouldnt fall afoul of the constitutions prohibition of two terms in succession cue mr zubkov again or maybe mr putin likes to keep the men who are said to be quietly trying to get his blessing ahead of march elections deputy prime ministers sergei ivanov and dmitry medvedev in suspense a little longer who knows but heres what can be said with near absolute certainty kremlinologists will have to keep on guessing whats on mr putins mind
