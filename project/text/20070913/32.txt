helped stall the stock market this year and president vladimir putins surprise firing his cabinet and naming of an obscure bureaucrat viktor zubkov as prime minister wednesday highlights the

terrorist attacks in germany will come from homegrown extremists following last weeks arrests of two ethnic german converts to islam and a turkish national and longtime german resident on charges of planning a massive bomb attack in germany police are looking for at least seven people with whom the initial suspects communicated by telephone and email about half the suspects sought are of turkish
