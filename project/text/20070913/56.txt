its the fees not the profits private equity firms make far more charging investors says a study private equity firms say they are experts at wringing profits out of flagging businesses it turns out they are almost twice as good at wringing fees out of their investors this finding part of a study by two professors at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school upends one of the deepest held notions about the buyout business the bulk of the average private equity firms earnings come from profitably refashioning and reselling the businesses it buys the study shows that on average leveraged buyout funds can expect to collect &# in management fees for every &# they manage in comparison slightly more than half as much &# for every &# comes from carried interest carried interest represents the cut of any profit that buyout firms retain for themselves after auctioning off a company getting dividends from a portfolio company or selling all or some of a company in an initial public offering of stock the wharton study draws from a unique trove of data the actual performance records of a large institutional investor in private equity funds that investor shared data from separate buyout funds from to with authors andrew metrick and ayako yasuda both wharton professors of finance using a model that takes into account various structures used in private equity funds the authors embarked on the study to determine how private equity firms could maximize their revenue streams it is one of the first times this industrys wealth has been so closely scrutinized the studys conclusions put the buyout industry in an agonizing spot while the data could buttress efforts to resist a congressional push for greater taxation of some private equity profits they also could anger the industrys investors who have been griping about what they say are high fees for years in the s fledgling private equity firms with funds rarely topping a few hundred million dollars charged investors a fee of to of cash under management the fees were to "keep on the lights" to pay the rent and hire assistants before their funds generated any profit since then multibillion dollar funds have become common and that management fee has evolved into a lucrative source of revenue a &# billion fund can generate &# million a year for a private equity firm just in management fees "the stunning thing is that the terms stayed the same even as the funds got bigger " said john leclaire chairman of the private equity group at the boston law firm goodwin procter llp private equity firms are able to command the same fees they charged two decades ago largely because they consistently outperform the public markets sometimes by a wide margin investors occasionally balk but in the end have little recourse but to cough up the annual charges or risk being squeezed out of the fund the studys findings apply to an "average" firm top performing firms will buck that trend given the lucrative profit the top performers generate from their deals they take in far more in total dollars in carried interest than in fees the wharton report could influence the capitol hill debate over private equity firms taxes some lawmakers have accused private equity firms of dodging taxes by classifying their carried interest revenue as capital gains which is taxed at a rate rather than as income which is taxed at not surprisingly the public pension systems and university endowments that invest huge sums in private equity funds &# billion in alone have awakened to the disparity between fee revenue and carried interest revenue they have pressed firms to reduce their management fees saying fund managers could lose the motivation to do good deals if they collect so much money in fees some firms reduce management fees in the later years of a funds life typically lasting for roughly years and give what amounts to a volume discount via co investment funds this is additional money a funds investors are allowed to put into a specific transaction without paying extra fees investors have had little luck in winning broad changes in the fee structure some of all buyout firms continue to charge a management fee with another charging to of assets according to the private equity analyst terms &amp conditions report which is published by dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal "they make so much money in management fees " said chris wagner senior investment officer of the &# billion los angeles county employees retirement association "you have to wonder if theyre going to be as focused on their deals " the pace of private equity deal making slowed almost to a halt in august according to data tracker dealogic with their funds sitting stagnant private equity firms could reduce the size of their existing and future funds much as venture capital firms did early this decade the lure of billions of dollars in management fees suggests that wont be the case buyout firms are more likely to continue to deploy high levels of capital and pursue deals that dont rely so heavily on the sale of debt for financing typically for of the purchase price of course that would only bring down carried interest returns making management fees an even bigger percentage of total income for the funds
