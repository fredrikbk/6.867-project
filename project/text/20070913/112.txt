the greenspan myth what would the maestro do " as nervous markets hang on every word of federal reserve chairman ben bernanke trying to divine whether he will lower interest rates in response to the current turmoil in credit markets comparisons to his illustrious predecessor alan greenspan are inevitable such comparisons can also be invidious and shouldnt influence what mr bernanke does now mr greenspan is fondly remembered for his role in stewarding markets through the stock crash of the long term capital management crisis of the collapse of the tech bubble in early and the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september today he enjoys a reputation for having moved swiftly and decisively "pre emptively" it is often said now to help the markets out of those crises but the truth is quite different mr greenspan is fortunate indeed to be remembered as such a decisive leader because in fact his reactions to some of those crises were quite tardy and were seen by most market participants at the time as being too little too late lets look at the long term capital management crisis of an event in many ways analogous to todays situation then the markets were thrown into turmoil by emerging market currency devaluations and russias default on its sovereign debt much as markets have recently been rocked by defaults in subprime mortgages as a consequence then as now the solvency of hedge funds and the investment banks that sponsored them were threatened by the time ltcm had collapsed and had to be bailed out by a private consortium of banks brought together by the new york feds william mcdonough not mr greenspan the s&amp p had already fallen by almost and staged a modest recovery from there mr greenspan had done precisely nothing with interest rates the federal open market committee made a basis point rate cut the day after the ltcm bailout was announced in late september markets were not impressed credit markets remained frozen much as they have been in the current crisis and stocks fell to new lows over the first days of october laurence meyer a federal reserve board governor at the time recalls in his book "a term at the fed " that "rather than calming the markets the small size of the rate cut raised doubts that the fed appreciated the severity of the problem greenspan was now under attack " in mid october mr greenspan cut rates another basis points in a surprise inter meeting move according to bob woodward in his greenspan biography "maestro " mr greenspan was reluctant to make that move but was pressured by mr mcdonough and then fed vice chairman alice rivlin by the end of there was another basis point cut at a regular fomc meeting the market turmoil passed and mr greenspan ended up on the cover of time as chairman of the "committee to save the world " thats how hes remembered today mr greenspan is also remembered for cutting interest rates aggressively as the tech bubble burst in early starting on jan with a surprise inter meeting cut of basis points in his book mr meyer writes that mr greenspan "had decided that the fed should be seen making a deliberately anticipatory move one that would not be viewed as a late response to a rapidly deteriorating situation " alan greenspan got his wish in terms of how history would remember him but the reality is that the economy had already rolled over by the time mr greenspan made his "anticipatory" cut the s&amp p had already fallen almost from its highs the previous september and when the cut was announced the relief in the markets was fleeting stocks stabilized for several weeks but fell to new lows in mid february they were destined to fall nearly an additional from there despite no less than more rate cuts with even more to come after stocks bottomed in late so much for "anticipatory " mr greenspan indeed did cut rates quickly in the aftermath of the stock crash of and the terrorist attacks of september thats because both those extraordinary and highly public events were seen by the fed as being very likely to depress overall economic activity not because distressed markets themselves needed to be bailed out to help the markets in those crises the fed opened its checkbook to provide the liquidity necessary for transactions to clear and credit to endure despite the chaos thats precisely what mr bernanke has already done in the present turmoil both through a very high volume of ordinary open market transactions and a liberalized discount window lending policy in that sense mr bernanke has already acted more pre emptively than mr greenspan did in and similarly to the way mr greenspan did in and september and he has done so despite the fact that judging by the stock markets sturdy performance through the current turmoil now down only about from all time highs todays crisis is less threatening than those earlier ones its noteworthy that the enormous volume of fed open market operations in the fed funds markets over the last month has been completed at the current rate target of this suggests that no lower rate is required to meet the needs of the banking system and the discount window has scarcely been used at all which suggests that the system is not in quite the state of distress that has been advertised so why would mr bernanke cut the fed funds rate unless he became convinced that the overall economy was highly likely to be damaged by the present market turmoil that was the call mr greenspan made quickly after the crash and the attacks and slowly in and early wheres the evidence to support mr bernanke making such a call today almost all the evidence is that the economy is remarkably robust credit crisis or no credit crisis housing slowdown or no housing slowdown yes weve had one disappointing jobs report but with jobs at a level historically regarded as "full employment " must we hurry to cut rates by historical standards rates are already low since the s no easing cycle and no recession has ever begun when the real funds rate was as low as it is today yet mr bernanke remains under tremendous pressure from markets to cut rates the prices observed in short term fixed income and interest rate futures markets clearly imply that the markets expect a cut and the balance of pundit commentary is calling for one if the principled case can be made that a robust economy is significantly at risk then mr bernanke should do what the markets and the pundits demand provided that he sees a rate cut as consistent with his mission to preserve price stability but the idea that he must act immediately in order to be seen as a worthy successor to the "maestro " is unfair to mr bernanke and too generous to mr greenspan the current fed chief deserves our admiration for having acted quickly and appropriately so far and resisted the temptation to over react mr luskin is chief investment officer of trend macrolytics llc
