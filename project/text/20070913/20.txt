concerns since tanner &amp haley resorts a former big player filed for bankruptcy protection last year tanner &amp haleys former members stand to lose much of their original deposits which ranged from &# to &# million the collapse of tanner &amp haley called into question the viability of the destination club industry tanner failed in part because it hadnt bought enough property especially in its most popular destinations the company couldnt keep up with demand so resorted to renting property at great expense particularly during holiday periods in order make good on its promises to customers todays clubs are eager to demonstrate that they follow a more sound business model owning enough real estate to meet demand and possessing enough capital to return deposits if a member decides to leave "its still an emerging business " says richard keith president and chief executive of private escapes "theres obviously a need for the consumer to feel good about the club theyre joining " to that end the industry is embracing consolidation and regulation ultimate resort bought tanner &amp haleys real estate assets for &# million last year quintess and dream catcher retreats two colorado

has a large plasma screen and computers with high speed internet the properties also have staffs that provide all of the services offered in a hotel like housekeeping and concierge indeed destination club members are often lured by the opportunity to bounce around to dozens of different luxury properties while forgoing the responsibility that comes with maintaining a second or third home "i couldnt stand one more night staying in a hotel with two twin beds " says laurie richter an ultimate resort member who joined so her family which includes two teenage boys would have more room while on vacation jim zaharis an ex tanner &amp haley member who has joined ultimate resort said he has visited hawaii nevis in the caribbean and deer valley utah mr zaharis a retiree in mesa ariz says the
