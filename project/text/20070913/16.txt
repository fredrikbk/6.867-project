boss talk keeping nascars pedal to the metal as racing circuit matures ceo france looks for ways to maintain strong growth charlotte n c many executives might run their grandmothers into the wall at miles per hour to wield the kind of power that brian france exerts over nascar following in the footsteps of his grandfather and father at the head of nascar mr france maintains a business that for years has been described as a benevolent dictatorship closely held and union free nascar has become the largest richest sanctioning body in u s motor sports under the france familys watch the year old mr france has authored fundamental changes in stock car racing since taking over as chairman and chief executive in a transition to a new more regulated racecar for teams in the nextel cup series nascars highest level is meant to keep costs down while improving competition and safety though racing teams have complained it strips the sport of engineering creativity a race playoff known as the chase for the cup which begins sunday in loudon n h has also received mixed reviews nascar can hardly be said to be hurting it is in the first year of an eight year &# billion set of tv deals and nascar and its independent racing teams count more than of the nations richest companies as sponsors still after years of vigorous growth it is showing signs of slowing for the second straight year tv ratings and attendance are down slightly merchandising has plateaued the costs to start a team are soaring and nascar continues to wrestle with balancing its ambitions to expand with the risk of alienating longtime fans speaking in nascars offices here mr france discussed the challenges facing his sport excerpts wsj whats your response to people who say nascar is plateauing mr france well its more mature than it was five years ago were driven more than any other sport on energy prices our fans tend to drive a lot further to our events tend to drive rvs so theres some sensitivity to that theres some price sensitivity that comes with that too of course with less money in their pocket but listen were talking about instead of having people attend a race were talking about or something like that its a very small drop off wsj as nascar has moved into less traditional markets many worry it has gotten away from core fans in the south how much do you need to keep those fans mr france thats a tricky issue for us because we always need to deliver on the promise to the core fan which really is our brand of racing close competitive side by side the drivers really mixing it up on the other hand we need a more diverse audience we are going into more urban markets and have been for the last years the answer is youve got to do both wsj as youre sniffing around new york and seattle for possible new tracks how do you tell longtime fans not to worry about their track losing races mr france we tell them that our business model is based on the preference of not moving dates around without a very very good reason to do so for obvious reasons we want to build historically important events its always disappointing when it happens because somebody loses something that theyve had for a long time somebody gains something hopefully the gain is better than the loss our preference is not to do that without a series of very very compelling reasons wsj how do you respond to an antitrust suit in kentucky that suggests a racetrack there was passed over for a nextel cup event in favor of one at a track owned by international speedway corp whose president is your sister and nascar vice president lesa france kennedy mr france i think hes wrong theyre just very selfish about that we have about as free a market in our situation as you can have they built a facility in our view in the wrong place they built the facility in a market thats pretty heavily saturated with nascar events were happy to run there with some of our other things when we have space and availability but theyre taking a position that somebody owes them something its no different than me and you building a car dealership and saying hey toyota i think i could do a nice job ive got a really nice dealership everything looks good ill take a franchise things dont work that way in our system its hard to say consumers are harmed in any way all the stakeholders from stockholders to drivers teams anybody in between have done nothing but benefit from our business model wsj what are nascars greatest areas of potential growth mr france if you narrow it down to one area it has to be diversity for us thats why we say you cant fancy yourself a good marketer and miss a whole market its nothing to do necessarily with morally whats right or wrong of course that enters into it but we want to track everybody to be nascar fans hispanics thats an audience thats there for us in particular in different parts of the country texas phoenix los angeles miami huge hispanic populations so were working pretty hard at that and we think that will pay dividends down the road wsj can you gauge what effect the arrival of colombian driver juan pablo montoya this season has had abroad mr france we distribute our television rights in many places in latin america were getting better programming were getting on a better channel i think hes probably showed some international drivers the road forward if you want to be in nascar you can come in what we believe is the most competitive forum and have success i know there are several very prominent drivers that are taking a very serious look that this could be the place for them wsj you recently went to china to study the marketplace and explore broadcast opportunities there what did you learn mr france its going to be a huge market depending on what product and service youre pushing it may be one day for us but were not in a position to take advantage of the china opportunity at this stage of the game one of the biggest things thats happening there is the automobile is coming online in record numbers most of the people years ago didnt drive a car in china that includes beijing that is changing fast the car is a status symbol its a coveted thing for people that live in china the freedom of driving its a thing we take for granted here that will come into play wsj has ownership grown too expensive in nascar how much does the loss of smaller teams in favor of those running three or four cars concern you mr france it concerns me and a lot of people our preference is to have as many different owners that also have more diverse views of things to bring to the table but thats the free market we live in wsj how much do the economic woes of the big three u s auto companies worry you mr france we know its one of their most important marketing assets they have a lot of equity and decades of time invested in nascar their products are showcased as part of the sport you couldnt duplicate that no matter what opportunity was available so wed like to think that as they have to re juggle their priorities that we would be one of the last things theyd want to consider not participating in thats been true so far wsj toyotas first year in the nextel cup has been bumpy what can be learned from it mr france i dont think its all that surprising i think its very difficult there are established teams and you have to establish your team and break in all together as a rookie manufacturing and team owners its a very tall mountain to climb theyll ultimately get there wsj early in the season there was a lot of complaining from the drivers about the new more tightly regulated racecar looking back would you have done anything differently in introducing the "car of tomorrow" mr france its not surprising that some drivers who were having success with the old car and werent doing as well with the new car would be disgruntled but most of the teams and drivers can now see all the benefits that we had originally promised lower cost to compete which helps new ownership to compete by the way because it lowers the barrier to entry and safety hopefully we wont test that but most people think those improvements are there finally competitively its good we try to anticipate where all the criticisms are going to come sometimes were wrong if the ideas right then the criticisms will ultimately slow down if were wrong on a particular thing and we have been wrong before then well have to change it but were right on this and the industry is better off for this wsj the chase for the cup has also been criticized as straying from the sports roots do you need to take further steps to try to win fans mr france i dont think you can or you need to i think it organically grows and makes sense to people they like it or theyll tell you if they dont youll still have some people if you change something who wont like it we always list a series of promises that we hope will come out of something and benefits if they dont were in a little bit of a situation where we may have to adjust back but in this case like the car of tomorrow most of the benefits they came out closer standings more teams with a chance to win late in the season all of the things the chase was supposed to do its done
