ahead of the tape bottom line faces squeeze from china while theyve drawn howls from u s workers the influx of low priced goods from china has been a boon for wall street helping to keep inflation at bay and profit margins at u s companies fat but the party may be ending in july prices for imports from china were above year earlier levels according to the labor department thats a modest gain in comparison to the gain in overall u s consumer prices over the same period but its a big change from february when chinese import prices were below year earlier prices the combination of federal reserve interest rate cuts and product safety concerns could make them rise even more in the months to come the increase in prices is partly due to the rising value of the yuan which the chinese government has allowed to appreciate by against the dollar since mid and higher raw materials costs but rising wages in china also appear to be a factor while chinas rural population represents a massive amount of untapped labor skilled workers are in short supply migrant workers from rural areas have become better informed according to the world banks recent quarterly update on china and are flocking toward better paying regions and sectors thats creating shortages in lower paying jobs thereby forcing wages higher across the board wages of migrant workers are rising by more than a year says ubs the recent rash of recalls for china made products may be emblematic of how severe the cost pressures on chinese manufacturers have become paint with high levels of lead for instance is considerably less expensive than paint with low lead levels with both chinese and u s regulators promising to step up safety oversight such unscrupulous cost cutting practices may fall by the wayside and lead to higher prices even with those assurances more u s consumers may choose to buy higher priced goods made outside of china if as widely expected the fed cuts rates on tuesday prices for chinese goods could face more upward pressure china pegs its currency to a basket of currencies that is dominated by the u s dollar as a result when the federal reserve eases its stance that eases the stance of chinese monetary policy unchecked that would lead to more wage and other cost pressures and higher prices for chinese goods in the u s one way for china to counteract an easier stance by the fed would be to allow the yuan to appreciate against the dollar by even more that would lower commodity costs for chinese companies and lower the costs of imported goods for chinese consumers but it would also raise the prices for china made goods in the u s if companies pass on the higher prices theyre getting for chinese goods to u s consumers that could help push inflation higher thats not exactly what the fed would want to see as it moves to steady the economy but u s consumers have a long habit of refusing to accept price increases and theyre unlikely to lose in todays uncertain economy that means that companies may end eating the cost increases and seeing profits suffer send comments to justin lahart wsj com
