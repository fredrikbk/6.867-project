the emerging markets achilles heel spending vulnerability in downturn are issues going strong so far after a heroic comeback from this summers financial turbulence emerging markets are outperforming those in the u s and europe that was vindication for investors who argued that these markets have stronger fundamentals than before and better growth prospects than the developed markets yet while most emerging markets are on far sounder footing than in the past not all are in financial shape some have problems that recall the emerging markets of old and as in the days of old they could leave naive investors with losses countries on the watch list include turkey and hungary which spend more than they save venezuela and argentina because of their controversial economic policies and even mexico and israel with huge export industries that would be vulnerable to a slowdown in the u s economy emerging markets generally defined as countries that have modest incomes but are growing fast often after decades of government control have delivered handsome rewards this year with a large dose of volatility a benchmark for these stocks the morgan stanley capital international emerging markets index was up in u s dollar terms from the start of the year through tuesday despite plunging during a three week period this summer morgan stanleys index of developed markets outside the u s and canada meanwhile is up just through yesterday and the dow jones industrial average is ahead such good returns have attracted investors world wide this year through july &# billion in new cash flowed into funds that focus on stocks in emerging markets while funds that focus on u s shares had outflows of &# billion according to boston based emerging portfolio fund research no one is predicting an imminent crisis but todays unsettled environment means it pays to differentiate among these markets some such as brazil and russia have amassed impressive piles of reserves and reduced their overseas borrowing radically improving their ability to weather further instability "if you feel that the risks of a more significant downturn and a potential liquidity squeeze are rising " its worth trying to diminish your exposure to countries that would be most affected says allan conway who manages &# billion in emerging market stocks for schroders in london he says this reasoning was behind a decision to reduce his position in turkey a couple of weeks ago last week standard &amp poors identified turkey bulgaria latvia and romania as among the countries most vulnerable if liquidity drops and investor jitters increase besides turkey and hungary the list of emerging markets that spend significantly more than they save includes south africa lebanon and several states in eastern europe "this is not a storm in a teacup that will just blow away " says moritz kraemer a managing director at s&amp p who authored the report "we believe the pricing of risk has changed and that requires increased vigilance " bond giant pacific investment management co or pimco a unit of allianz that manages &# billion in emerging markets says it is avoiding bonds in countries with large financing needs like hungary and turkey or with controversial economic policies like venezuela and argentina "in an environment of abundant liquidity where yield was king those performed well " says michael gomez co head of emerging markets at pimco now he says hes asking "how often do they have to access the markets in what size what will market conditions be " some countries could have pockets of vulnerability in their private sectors which took advantage of easy borrowing conditions to load up on overseas debt in kazakhstan for instance the banking sector has been "borrowing hand over fist " says michael conelius who manages a portfolio of emerging market bonds for t rowe price in the first six months of this year alone the kazakh financial sector borrowed nearly &# billion in international markets more than in all of according to data from dealogic a larger question is the potential impact of a significant slowdown in the u s some economists believe demand from local consumers and other developing markets would buffer any drop in demand from the u s others disagree noting that the u s remains a significant customer especially in latin america and asia mexico israel and colombia are among those particularly vulnerable to a downturn in demand from the u s which was the destination for more than a third of their exports last year according to the international monetary fund mexico is by far the most exposed as of its exports went to the u s according to a recent report from ubs a slowdown in u s import growth would shear off some of the economic growth in asian markets especially malaysia taiwan and thailand individual stocks also are susceptible morgan stanley analyzed the largest stocks in its benchmark emerging market index and concluded that eight relied on the u s market for more than of their revenue indias infosys technologies and reliance industries israels teva pharmaceutical industries taiwan semiconductor manufacturing and hon hai precision industry of taiwan mexicos cemex samsung electronics of korea and petroleo brasileiro of brazil companies that get more than of their sales from the u s says citigroup include embraer of brazil southern copper of peru and gruma of mexico if concerns mount that the u s will pull down the pace of growth world wide commodities could be another source of weakness countries like chile peru and argentina rely on commodities for more than half of their exports emerging markets "have been benefiting handsomely from global growth " says david hensley an economist at j p morgan "if people sour on global growth prospects theyll expect lower demand for commodities and prices will fall "
