ghosn defends his dual role a difficult year for nissan and renault fails to shake ceos resolve frankfurt this has been a tough year for carlos ghosn chief executive of renault sa and nissan motor co accustomed to accolades for his bold approach to corporate turnarounds mr ghosn of late has endured criticism for slumping profits at both companies sliding u s sales at nissan and persistent doubts that even a man of his prodigious energy can run two sprawling auto companies mr ghosn however is showing that while he will adapt for instance by ceding leadership of nissans north american operation he isnt ready to concede any significant ground to his detractors instead he is gearing up to take the offensive accelerating moves at both nissan and renault to cut costs and expand the presences of his allied companies in booming new markets outside western europe and the u s in an interview yesterday mr ghosn defended his decision to continue running the two car makers "if i didnt think it was valuable" to do both jobs "i wouldnt do it " he said noting recent moves by nissan and renault to jointly develop engines and to expand car production in emerging markets mr ghosn added "all these synergies are facilitated by having a common ceo " mr ghosn has made changes in his management style as pressure has mounted on renault and nissans finances in march mr ghosn announced he would cede responsibility for nissans north american operations to devote more time to his dual duties as ceo of renault and nissan last week nissan announced it would fill its chief financial officer position a job that had been open for four years with mr ghosn in charge of its finance functions for much of that period with a veteran renault executive in april nissan reported its first full year drop in net profit in seven years and pushed back one of its key long term sales goals as a result of flagging sales in the u s the company has been slower than most japanese car makers in developing gasoline electric hybrid cars and sales of its biggest most fuel thirsty vehicles have fallen as a result of higher gasoline prices meanwhile at renault mr ghosns effort to boost global sales volumes by by is looking increasingly tough while rivals such as toyota motor corp and fiat spa are growing and grabbing market share in europe renaults sales in the region are down through the first half as a result of an aging model lineup although some industry analysts have questioned his decision to try to lead two car companies simultaneously mr ghosn said wednesday that he didnt see any reason to give up either job noting that a motion supporting his continued tenure as nissans ceo passed overwhelmingly at the companys shareholder meeting over the summer with a spate of new models coming from renault and nissan over the next few months however mr ghosn is increasingly drawing on his skills as a showman to boost investor confidence earlier this month he gave journalists hours notice to meet him in tangiers morocco where he announced plans to invest as much as much as billion euros &# billion to erect one of the largest auto production facilities on the african continent designed to feed low cost cars and trucks to showrooms in europe asia and north america this month at the frankfurt auto show mr ghosn is trying to draw attention to a new version of the laguna sedan a model widely seen as a bellwether of his efforts to boost renaults quality to industry leading levels to underscore its confidence in the cars reliability renault is offering buyers a three year guarantee compared with only two years by many of its competitors mr ghosn cites recent favorable reviews in the german press as reason for optimism that the model can contribute strongly to his goal of selling more renault cars in than the company sold in although many analysts think mr ghosn will deliver on his commitment to increase renaults operating margin to by some question whether that level is sustainable amid rising competition in europe from asian auto makers like toyota mr ghosn acknowledged that utilization rates at renaults western european factories are "not far" from well below the threshold that many industry analysts consider ideal for ensuring profitability mr ghosn noted however that the french company as a whole remains profitable and predicted that as renaults european sales rise over the next year utilization rates at its western european factories will exceed by the end of in a nod to concerns raised by french labor leaders about his growth strategy for renault mr ghosn also said he doesnt intend to turn renault into a "logan driven company " a reference to the no frills five seat car made by its dacia affiliate in romania that has sold briskly in emerging markets and some parts of western europe but he defended recent moves to expand manufacturing engineering and other jobs at renault and nissan to low cost countries saying that skyrocketing demand for cars in markets like china and india requires the company to add jobs there earlier this month renault and nissan announced they will open a business center in chennai india in early that will support the companies facilities around the world by providing product and manufacturing engineering purchasing design cost management and information systems development services "the markets are growing in the emerging" countries mr ghosn said "if you dont go there you can forget about having any sustainable hope for the future " david gauthier villars in paris norihiko shirouzu in detroit and amy chozick in tokyo
