stores like whole foods they can find an even wider range of products online we ordered from cherrybrook kitchen divvies ener g gaks snacks and allergy grocer for all but one company we ordered several different items to see if they were tasty enough to tempt our somewhat finicky toddler who is allergic to eggs and peanuts overall the extra effort and in some cases the higher price tag paid
