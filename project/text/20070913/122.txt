will imbibing this cafe brew kill us or keep us going in their attempted refutation of the union of concerned scientists study on job growth and fuel economy robert crandall and hal singer "dont drink the cafe kool aid " editorial page sept invoke vague economic generalities instead of addressing the studys specific findings on the real world benefits of increased fuel economy the study analyzed how reduced spending on gasoline would affect job growth in several economic sectors the study projects that a fleet wide fuel economy increase of miles per gallon by would in save consumers &# billion at the pump slash oil consumption by million barrels per day and cut global warming pollution by the equivalent of taking some million of todays average cars and trucks off the road according to the economic model used in the study &# billion of the &# billion would be shifted to the auto industry to build more fuel efficient cars and trucks creating nearly new auto industry jobs the remaining &# billion would be spent in areas of the economy that are significantly more productive for the u s than the oil industry including the agriculture manufacturing retail and service industries as a result oil industry employment would decline by by but total u s employment would grow by new jobs messrs crandall and singer are correct when they say that there is virtually no opposition to increased fuel economy the president the senate and most house members support increased standards the reason is clear real world facts hold more sway than misleading rhetoric from the auto industry and their advisers david j friedman research director clean vehicles program union of concerned scientists washington higher government fuel economy standards for vehicles arent only a royal waste of money theyre also a killer regulation literally current cafe standards increase traffic deaths by restricting the production of larger more crash worthy cars according to a national research council study cafe contributes to about deaths per year this toll will get even worse if these standards are made more stringent but while proponents drone on endlessly about how raising cafe would reinvigorate the auto industry and save the planet they never once mention the fact that it would make driving more dangerous in short cafe is a blood for oil regulatory war waged on civilians sam kazman general counsel competitive enterprise institute washington messrs crandall and singer seem to think that on the subject of fuel efficiency there isnt much missing from private calculations of costs and benefits or at least that such missing elements dont play a significant role in the usual discussions on the subject probably not as regards the second point but this debate ignores a very large elephant in the living room low fuel efficiency incurs an enormous social cost specifically the cost of defending the country from its declared enemies the persistence of low fuel efficiency keeps sending arms via the price of oil to the bad guys on the international scene and that in turn needs to be countered as we have discovered lately by multi hundred billion dollar outlays on national defense plus the sacrifice of many lives sidney schoeffler concord n h messrs crandall and singer omitted a key problem of the cafe rules specifically when a good becomes cheaper economic theory and common sense both conclude that more of that good will be used here unless one believes that total miles driven will be constant the appropriate "good" to be measured is distance by increasing fuel efficiency distance becomes cheaper and so more miles are ultimately consumed and potentially even more fuel than would be otherwise the authors of the cafe rules have confused cause and effect a common consequence of an increase in fuel prices is the purchase of more fuel efficient cars here the cart has been placed before the horse and apparently believe in a static world a belief that led to the failure of five year plans soon after implementation a carbon tax is a targeted and useful approach to reduce both emissions and dependence on fossil fuels without overly interfering with or directing the economic decisions of americans paul hong new york
