a calm voice in a heated debate cool it by bjorn lomborg knopf pages &# in this world of republicans and democrats meat eaters and vegetarians dog lovers and cat lovers we have a new divide on one side are global warming believers theyve heard al gores inconvenient truths and along with the staff of time magazine feel "worried very worried " humanity faces no greater threat than a warming earth they say and government must drastically curb carbon dioxide emissions on the other side are those who dont think that the earth is warming and even if it is they dont think that man is causing it and even if man is to blame it isnt clear that global warming is bad and even if it is efforts to fix it will cost too much and may in the end do more harm than good standing in the practical middle is bjorn lomborg the free thinking dane who in "the skeptical environmentalist" challenged the belief that the environment is going to pieces mr lomborg is now back with "cool it " a book brimming with useful facts and common sense mr lomborg "liberal vegetarian a former member of greenpeace " as he describes himself is hard to fit into any pigeonhole he believes that global warming is happening that man has caused it and that national governments need to act yet he also believes that al gore is bordering on hysteria that some global warming science has been distorted and hyped and that the kyoto protocol and other carbon reduction schemes are a terrible waste of money the world needs to think more rationally he says about how to tackle this challenge mr lomborg starts by doing what he does best presenting a calm analysis of what todays best science tells us about global warming and its risks relying primarily on official statistics he ticks through the many supposed calamities that will result from a hotter planet extreme hurricanes flooding rivers malaria heat deaths starvation water shortages it turns out that when these problems are looked at from all sides and stripped of the spin they arent as worrisome as global warming alarmists would suggest in some cases they even have an upside take flooding after the floods of prague and dresden tony blair jacques chirac and gerhard schroeder all argued that the floods proved the need for western governments to commit themselves to kyoto mr lomborg agrees that global warming increases precipitation yet to the extent that more precipitation has already increased river flows it has done so largely in the fall when rivers are at low levels and there is little risk of flood truly bad floods have historically accompanied colder climates since plentiful snow and a late thaw produce ice jams that block rivers and produce high water levels these sorts of floods have in fact decreased in the th century at least in part because of global warming the picture is the same for other "disasters " yes sea levels will rise probably about a foot over this century but they have already risen a foot since and the world has coped yes more people will die from heat but significantly more people will not die from cold yes glaciers will melt but theyd be melting to some degree in any event and in the meantime this melting provides extra water for some of the worlds poorest people the himalayan glaciers on the tibetan plateau the biggest ice mass outside the antarctic and greenland are the source of rivers that reach of the worlds population such a nuanced look at the good and bad of global warming gives mr lomborg a chance to pursue his bigger theme anti warming policies like those of the kyoto protocol that require energy taxes or other checks on economic dynamism are inefficient and even harmful they serve as short term ways of dealing with what is a complex and long term problem they cost a lot now and yet do little to reduce global temperatures in years time better says mr lomborg for todays world to manage the effects of global warming and devote its resources to problems it can fix thus putting the entire globe in a better position to solve the underlying problem in the future an example while weve had fewer floods in the th century the floods we do have get more attention because of the huge economic losses that now accompany them the losses have nothing to do with global warming and everything to do with the ever growing numbers of people who migrate to flood prone areas mr lomborg cites studies showing that by implementing kyoto at a cost of trillions of dollars we might be able to achieve a reduction in fluvial and coastal flooding damages if we instead adopted smart flood policies e g an end to public subsidies that encourage people to settle in flood plains a shrewder use of levees we could achieve a reduction in damages at a fraction of the kyoto cost as for the long term mr lomborg argues that governments do have a role to play but he presents a real inconvenient truth the world has been dependent on fossil fuels for generations and it is ludicrous to believe that it will end that dependency in a few decades yet only a drastic reduction in fossil fuel use will cut carbon dioxide emissions enough to stop or significantly slow climate change rather than governments imposing costly energy taxes to little benefit mr lomborg argues they should fund research programs aimed at finding breakthrough technologies mr lomborgs cost benefit approach wont sit well with leftists who see global warming programs as a proxy for other goals say reducing "materialism" and his calls for taxpayer funded r&amp d investments wont sit well with small government conservatives who may be skeptical of global warming in the first place but his analysis is smart and refreshing and it may bridge at least one divide in our too divided culture the dog and cat lovers will never
