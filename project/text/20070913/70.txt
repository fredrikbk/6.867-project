mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q i have a dell dimension that is six or seven years old recently the following message appears every time we start the computer "warning dells monitoring system has detected that drive on the primary eide controller is operating outside of normal specifications it is advisable to immediately back up your data and replace your hard disk drive " when we hit f the computer boots normally and functions fine all our data is backed up on an external drive what is going on is it time to bite the bullet and get a new computer a i dont know exactly whats going on but you should take the warning very seriously its good that your data is backed up but if your hard disk fails you wont be able to use the computer six or seven years is a long time to keep a computer and hard disks do go bad just because it continues to work doesnt mean it isnt on the verge of sudden failure at the very least have dell or a local technician diagnose the hard disk to see if it is a serious problem or one that can be easily fixed if the disk is failing and you are otherwise perfectly satisfied with the computer you can get a new drive that is much larger for a reasonable sum you should also seriously consider buying a new computer simply because everything else on your machine is also out of date and as time goes on you may find that more and more software and web sites wont work well with it q does either parallels desktop or vmware fusion support multiple virtual machines installed on a macintosh for instance one running windows xp and one running windows vista a yes both of them allow you to create multiple virtual computers running windows xp or vista older versions of windows or linux as long as your mac has sufficient hard disk space q my toshiba satellite runs windows xp home and it takes more than four minutes when starting up before i can open any programs is my computer running too many programs at startup if so how can i view them and shut down the unnecessary ones a that certainly could be one cause of the problem its a common situation to see what programs are set to run when you start up your computer and to turn off unwanted ones you can use a somewhat geeky built in program from microsoft or simpler ones available from outside software vendors to run the built in program go to the start menu click "run " and in the blank box that appears type in "msconfig " this utility will let you turn on and off invisible startup programs go to the tab marked "startup" and check off any you dont want but be conservative dont turn off anything you dont recognize and know is unneeded a better solution easier to use and with more information is an &# utility from pc magazine called startup cop pro you can get it at www pcmag com article asp there are a number of similar programs that may work just as well but unlike startup cop i havent tested them and so cant recommend them
