for u s now &# oil may be tough to bear with pit traders screaming "go go go" and economists sounding alarms the world oil benchmark price briefly topped &# a barrel yesterday for the first time last year when crude was at similar levels prices retreated and the economy stayed resilient but this year there are some significant differences triggering concerns that prices could be headed higher and that the economy could be vulnerable one main distinction this time around the economy isnt looking quite as healthy amid concerns about the weakened housing market and mortgage defaults in addition in oil inventories were higher because of market incentives to store oil which meant energy buyers had a stockpile by contrast today different market incentives have led to much lower oil inventories in key regions thats troublesome because the lack of a stockpile cushion means that any supply crunch could lead buyers oil refiners and speculators alike to quickly bid up crude oil prices beyond &# a barrel just as the economy appears vulnerable to recession indeed oil stockpiles have continued to drain quickly as prices for "spot " or todays price oil far outpace prices for delivery a few months from now yesterday the energy information administration reported a higher than expected reduction in crude inventories last week yesterday after hitting &# in intraday trading the new york mercantile exchanges crude futures contract settled at &# up &# or while that is an exchange record oil has been higher in inflation adjusted terms the inflation adjusted record is &# hit in april news yesterday that the houston ship channel which serves five refineries and multiple chemical plants closed ahead of tropical storm humberto also helped propel prices but clues that oil could touch &# surfaced the day before when markets rallied even after an announced production boost from the organization of petroleum exporting countries many observers perceived the barrel a day rise as stingy in the face of growing demand "the idea of opec bringing on just barrels a day and not until november is like ben bernanke saying maybe we should lower interest rates th of it has no relevance " said matt simmons of simmons &amp co an energy investment bank in houston and author of a controversial book contending saudi oil reserves are less prolific than claimed in addition it takes an estimated two months for extra tankers to reach the u s from the middle east "we believe the door to &# and beyond remains open and beckons " said barclays energy analysts paul horsnell and kevin norrish in a note yesterday the big question is what impact &# oil prices will have on the economy some oil field services stocks rallied but other stocks sank including airlines that get socked by higher jet fuel prices even refiners could get hurt the barclays analysts pointed out gasoline inventories are within a hair of their lowest levels since and profits from converting oil to fuel shrink with higher crude prices if the federal reserve lowers interest rates as it is expected to do next week that could weaken the dollar and give oil producing organizations further excuses to try to keep prices high since they will be getting paid in less valuable dollars argues larry goldstein director of the energy policy research foundation an industry funded nonprofit research organization canadian oil producers could be winners if oil prices stay high and the u s needs more crude quickly heavy oil sands projects are profitable at todays oil prices and producers could ship more down to the midwest as more refineries start to retool their plants to process the heavy stuff but the u s cant absorb and use this heavy crude all that quickly because there still are limited pipelines that can get it to the gulf coast refining centers and many refineries both in the midwest and near the gulf still cant take it other commodity markets provide ominous clues copper markets for example have typically been sensitive to u s recessions and housing slowdowns because the metal is used in housing products electric supplies and electronics but such a large percentage of consumption has shifted to asia that analysts are suggesting copper inventories are likely to start dropping again after a seasonal slowdown whether or not the u s is using more of it and prices could rise oil may do the same thing in other commodity markets natural gas futures shot up driven by fears that atlantic tropical storms could disrupt gulf of mexico energy production near month october natural gas on the nymex rose cents to &# a million british thermal units soybeans futures at the chicago board of trade rose on supportive crop production data pushing prices to their highest level since nearby september soybeans gained cents to &# wheat cbot prices fell with some contracts falling to the daily price limit of cents nearby september fell cents to &# a bushel because the contract is in delivery price limits were removed
