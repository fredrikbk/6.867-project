roadblock tuesdays senate vote to block funding for a federal pilot program to monitor the safety of mexican trucks entering the u s is yet another sign that protectionists in washington are growing more bold a similar measure has already passed the house the teamsters and their capitol hill allies no doubt expect that if the bill becomes law mexican trucks will be kept out of the u s for at least another year under the nafta accord mexican trucking companies should have been delivering their loads to u s destinations for more than a decade by now but since the clinton administration banned mexican trucks in they have had to offload their cargo at the border and transfer it to teamster trucks raising costs for u s consumers in a nafta arbitration panel ruled the u s ban on mexican trucks violated the treaty and granted mexico the right to retaliate the bush administration crafted the pilot program to open the market and at the same time address safety concerns the program would allow limited cross border trucking in both directions with inspections required the teamsters sued but even the ninth circuit court of appeals denied their request for a stay so the teamsters turned to congress which is now obliging under the whip of north dakota protectionist byron dorgan as a legal matter were told it isnt clear that congress can stop the department of transportation from granting operating authority to mexican competitors but president bush should veto this attempt in any case washington might also keep in mind that mexico is not without its own remedies under nafta retaliation could come in the form of punitive tariffs on u s agricultural exports starting say with goods from north dakota
