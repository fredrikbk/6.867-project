style tricks of the trade the dilemma of creative black tie once formal events were simple for men a ball or gala meant a tuxedo and bow tie nowadays party invitations can say anything including "creative black tie" to "black tie optional " such invitations can faze even a pro like simon kneen creative design director at brooks brothers who says he gets a lot of them "black tie optional is really difficult " he says "you have to judge the event whos going to be going you dont want to look overdressed or underdressed " usually mr kneen plays it safe wearing a black suit and a necktie if the invite says "creative black tie" or "festive black tie " mr kneen says he would interpret that as a call to have more fun "tartan would be a nice way to do creative " he says "a tartan blazer with brass buttons " another option is making the accessories ties cuff links pocket squares more playful for example by wearing a solid colored blazer with a colorful bow tie or a tartan tie or a whimsical pair of cuff links if you do that though he advises keeping the blazer a dark color to tone the outfit down another way he will sometimes do "creative black tie" especially if its a fashion event or fashion crowd is wearing the tuxedo shirt open at the top and putting on a silk scarf he either ties it around the neck or leaves it untied and tucks it into the front collar when it comes to "cocktail attire " mr kneen reads that as "sort of business attire navy blue or black suit " he suggests making sure that the tie is a dark color which is more appropriate with a dark suit for the evening a brighter color necktie makes it look more appropriate for a business meeting he says the bottom line he says is that "you have to use your judgment festive means that there is some sort of celebration so wear something a little eccentric but you should always err on the side of caution and play it conservatively these are formal events there needs to be some formal attire "
