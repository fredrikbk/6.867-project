mining takes the plunge new technologies open the seas to the harvesting of precious metals the age old hunt for gold copper and other precious minerals is shifting to a new frontier the ocean floor mining companies have long known the worlds oceans and seas cover vast troves of metals including zinc silver and other commodities currently in high demand however unlike oil and gas companies which have operated offshore for decades miners lacked the technology to haul their ocean bounty to the surface now the global boom in commodity prices has encouraged mining companies to take another look at undersea mining leading the effort is nautilus minerals inc a vancouver british columbia based outfit backed by some of the biggest names in mining including large shareholders such as united kingdom based anglo american plc and barrick gold corp of canada one of the worlds largest gold miners nautilus is using complex underwater robotic vehicles to search mineral deposits a mile or more below the surface in waters off the coast of papua new guinea near indonesia so far nautilus has focused its efforts on deposits left over from "black smokers " or chimney shaped structures that form after underground magma pushes mineral laden fluids through cracks in the sea floor when the heated liquid comes into contact with cold salt water its minerals coalesce into deposits of gold silver copper and other metallic elements once the best sites are identified nautilus plans to use remote operated vehicles that will move slowly across the ocean floor grinding up metric tons of rock an hour and then sucking it into a pipe to be pumped to daylight another start up london based neptune minerals plc has launched its own deep sea minerals project off the coast of new zealand and other offshore ventures may follow although a few mining companies have extracted diamonds and other minerals from shallow waters along shorelines mining experts say the latest efforts would be the first to mine significant quantities from deep waters their common goal is a future in which underwater robots and other equipment prowl the ocean floors cracking open new sources of minerals that can be used to make cars mobile phones and other consumer products "were doing this to start a whole new industry just like the offshore oil and gas industry " says david heydon chief executive officer of nautilus some mining industry veterans are skeptical and they worry that the latest aquatic adventures could reflect an expanding market bubble with investors pouring millions into high risk projects that could fail if raw material prices fall because the practice is new and unproven it is unclear what price levels would be needed for offshore mining to be profitable a similar &# million effort by other major resource companies to raise manganese from the ocean floor in the s collapsed amid technical difficulties among other problems deep sea mining also faces criticism from environmental activists who question whether it is worth the ecological cost to tear up areas rich in aquatic life "ive got major concerns" about the nautilus project says techa beaumont an analyst at the mineral policy institute an australia based mining watchdog group she says she attended a sustainable development forum in papua new guinea recently at which numerous local residents raised complaints about the project "theres no real accountability beyond them saying its all going to be great " she says of nautilus mr heydon acknowledges that deep sea mining will cause some environmental damage but he argues the impact will be less than with larger on land operations consumers have to get resources from somewhere and taking them from the sea could mean less interference with local populations he says research institutions such as the australian governments commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization have studied minerals on the sea floor near papua new guinea and elsewhere for more than a decade in part to get a better understanding of the way mineral deposits in general are formed nautilus had hoped to mine offshore deposits since the s "people said we will mine the sea floor someday and i just said whats stopping us today " recalls mr heydon who joined after the company was founded nautilus negotiated with the governments of papua new guinea fiji tonga and the solomon islands to secure exploration rights to an offshore area the size of the u k it also listed on the toronto stock exchange and the alternative investment market of the london stock exchange to date it has raised &# million through stock sales working from a command ship some miles off the papua new guinea coast nautilus uses a number of underwater exploration tools to determine which areas would be most profitable they include a so called autonomous underwater vehicle or auv that looks like a torpedo fitted with a computer and propeller system that can be programmed to guide the vehicle to specific areas to collect data for sites that need closer scrutiny nautilus sends down a more powerful remotely operated vehicle or rov which is connected to the ship by a cable and includes cameras and "hands" that can be manipulated by staff on the ship to pick up and move rocks and even drill into the sea floor to collect samples nautilus says it has identified enough minerals to mine metric tons of copper per year and ounces of gold with production beginning in mr heydon estimates the underwater rock is to copper compared with or less at comparable sites on shore which means vehicles would need to dig up a small fraction of the dirt they would have to turn over on land of course all that could depend on where commodity prices go although copper the key revenue source at nautiluss first project currently trades at about &# per metric ton on the london metal exchange up dramatically from levels it has fallen about from its recent peak in may
