his s bernard shor though no one ever called him bernard except his mother and even that for just a short time left his native south philadelphia for manhattan his uncle legend has it had called him a bum and tootsie the name was coined by an aunt when he was a toddler with long curls or toots as he came to be called when he got older decided he was going to new york to prove him wrong he was planning on being lucky he made it in the last years of prohibition toots was an "inside bouncer" at a speakeasy that by happy coincidence was frequented by writer damon runyon and many of the celebrities and low lifes runyon ran with it was tootss introduction to the new york demimonde in the words of frank gifford "toots knew all the mob guys and he liked them they made him toots shor " when toots opened his famous saloon at w st st several years later they followed him there and by the time he died in he had also gained the friendship of heavyweight champions movie stars nobel prize winning authors supreme court justices and five u s presidents ms jacobson mr shors granddaughter has used film and tv clips still photographs and personal interviews with mr talese walter cronkite mike wallace nicholas pileggi pete hamill whitey ford and others including family members to create an endearing portrait of the man his saloon his city and an era a scene from the quintessential new york noir film "sweet smell of success" says it all when predatory publicist sidney falco tony curtis wants to schmooze with a u s senator and new yorks most influential gossip columnist j j hunsecker burt lancaster he goes to toots shors the saloon was a place where a salesman from iowa could rub elbows with the most famous athletes in america from joe dimaggio to frank gifford to sugar ray robinson and bump into frank sinatra or ernest hemingway on the way to the restroom and maybe have to step over jackie gleason to get there it was also a place the famous went to meet each other when toots introduced hemingway to yogi berra as "an important writer " yogi said "good to meet you what paper are you with ernie " the atmosphere was so congenial that one remarkable evening frank costello the head of the new york mob smiled across the dining room nodded and tipped a glass to supreme court chief justice earl warren who smiled and tipped his glass in return what was it about toots shors that attracted the famous and the accomplished from all walks of life "ive asked myself that same question for years " says ms jacobson from her soho office "ive often wondered what toots a man of practically no education except street smarts had in common with such successful people i think ultimately his saloons place in history was the result of a perfect confluence of person place and time new york at that time was just emerging as the capital of the world and the kinds of people who made up the clientele in his saloon were a lot like my grandfather for the most part they were children of tough immigrant parents who came to new york looking for a better life they understood each other " toots knew exactly how to handle his famous guests "if he insulted someone " david halberstam wrote in "summer of " "that person was welcome he was particularly skillful at using the technique with some of his most serious celebrities it allowed them to shed some of the burden of their fame and relax while being treated as vips shor was surprisingly nimble indeed most delicate in knowing how far to go and when to stop " he suffered no mans insolence no matter how famous or powerful when hollywood mogul louis b mayer complained about having to wait for a table and huffed "i trust the food will be worth all the waiting " toots shot back "itll be better than some of your crummy pictures i stood in line to see " occasionally though toots did not know when to stop when joe dimaggio was shaken by the sight of his wife marilyn monroes skirt billowing up around her waist as she stood over a subway grating in the famous scene in "the seven year itch " toots tried to console joe with a disparaging remark about ms monroe "dimaggio never forgave him and never came back to the restaurant again " says ms jacobson "but he remained loyal to joe no one ever heard him say a bad word about joe dimaggio " "there couldnt be a place like toots shors today " says bert randolph sugar sports historian and former editor of the ring magazine "today the cult of celebrity is too strong the famous are super rich and go to private clubs and parties " at a reception for "toots" last sunday night at the tribeca grill tom brokaw pinpointed yet another difference between celebrity culture now and half a century ago "you could go in there and see americas great football player frank gifford and new yorks biggest star toots hanging out at the bar together there werent a thousand paparazzi trying to photograph him getting into a suv life in his saloon was like life on the streets of new york " in toots sold the lease for his famous saloon and in he opened a bigger restaurant at w nd st but to the old crowd it was never quite the same as the s went on he began to seem like an anachronism "the times passed him by " says mr sugar "the new breed of celebrity athlete like joe namath was making times what frank gifford had made just or years earlier and some of them could afford to open their own restaurants " in toots shors restaurant was closed for good by federal state and city officials for back taxes still in debt toots died of cancer at age "a lot of his old friends expressed regret that they couldnt do more to help him " says ms jacobson "but its hard for me to believe that he didnt die a happy man he always said i dont want to be a millionaire i just want to live like one i think he achieved that " mr barra writes about sports and entertainment for the journal
