medical maze legal loophole ensnares breast cancer patients shirley loewe chooses the wrong clinic and starts long ordeal longview texas in june shirley loewe went to good shepherd medical center here with a softball size lump in her breast and was diagnosed with a rare form of breast cancer she didnt know it but she had just made a big mistake ms loewe was uninsured under federal law she could have gotten medicaid coverage and saved herself a lot of hardship if shed gone to a different clinic less than a half mile away but by walking through good shepherds doors ms loewe unwittingly let that opportunity slip and embarked on a four year journey through the byzantine u s health care system it was an odyssey that would take her to five hospitals two clinics two charitable organizations and two nursing homes in two states she was denied assistance or care at least six times along the way for reasons that ranged from not being poor enough to not being sick enough ms loewe eventually got treatment but at personal cost and great aggravation to qualify for charity assistance she had to reduce her &# a year income as a hairdresser by cutting back on her working hours and giving up her home later she lucked into first class care thanks to a serendipitous encounter at a little league game ms loewe is one of thousands of women who get caught in a loophole in the breast and cervical cancer prevention and treatment act each year under the little known law passed by congress in uninsured women under age who are diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer can have their treatment covered by medicaid the government funded health program for the poor even if they dont meet all of its eligibility criteria but the law gives states an escape hatch rather than provide coverage to all comers states can choose to cover only those diagnosed at clinics that get funding from a federal cancer detection program texas chose the more restrictive option after cancer activist groups lobbied its legislature texas recently changed its version of the law to cover women diagnosed by any health provider starting sept but states continue to exclude patients diagnosed outside the federal cancer detection program the treatment act loophole is just one of a number of cracks in the patchwork of laws and regulations that govern the u s health care system crafted by lawmakers to save money these coverage gaps can turn the quest for care into a daunting obstacle course for the countrys million uninsured when serious illness strikes perhaps nowhere is the problem as stark as in texas where one in four residents lacks health insurance the highest proportion of uninsured in the nation a california native ms loewe was a free spirit in the s she lived in a cabin in the sierra nevada mountains with her husband and her two children a boy and a girl tragedy befell the family when the boy died from croup a respiratory illness that afflicts young children ms loewe later divorced and moved to east texas settling in this small working class city she worked long hours at todays cuts a local hair salon to make ends meet like many uninsured americans she went without health insurance because her employer didnt offer any and she couldnt afford it on her own ms loewe first noticed a nickel sized mass in her left breast in early according to her medical records but she was distracted by the death of her father that spring her lack of insurance combined with the fear and denial experienced by many cancer patients also made her put off a doctor visit by the time she showed up in late june at the emergency room at good shepherd one of two hospitals in longview the mass had grown to nearly four inches in diameter ms loewe earned too much to get medicaid in texas the regular way but she would have qualified for it under the treatment act had she been diagnosed by the wellness center a nearby clinic that participates in the federal cancer detection program good shepherd could have referred her there but instead it sent her to byron cook a staff surgeon dr cook diagnosed ms loewe with inflammatory breast cancer a rare and aggressive cancer that is often fatal and referred her to a local oncology clinic the longview cancer center a good shepherd executive says the hospital didnt know about the treatment act a spokesman for the texas department of state health services says it relies on participating clinics to get the word out "i dont want to get into a game of finger pointing because thats not useful to anyone " the texas spokesman says michelle trich the wellness centers executive director says the clinic does community outreach but doesnt know of any specific effort to get neighboring good shepherd to refer patients to the clinic with no means to pay for medical bills ms loewe went to her countys indigent clinic the only assets she listed were &# in cash and &# in a checking account but her application was rejected her most recent paycheck showed she had earned &# in the first months of the year that translated into an annual income far higher than the &# a year limit imposed by the countys charity guidelines for a single adult so ms loewe cut back her hours to reduce her income no longer able to afford her rent of &# a month she moved out of her apartment and rented a travel trailer from a friend for &# a month meanwhile lewis duncan an oncologist at the longview cancer center started ms loewe on a classic treatment regimen of chemotherapy drugs provided free by the drug makers patient assistance programs on aug she reapplied for charity assistance at the county clinic with her lower wages ms loewe was approved and the county began to pay for her treatment the county also agreed to pay for an antidepressant family members say ms loewe felt helpless and afraid her daughter niko ferguson who lives in denver says her mother would often cry when they talked on the phone ms loewes sister tonna day who lives in the neighboring town of gladewater says ms loewe desperately wanted to be treated at the m d anderson cancer center the world renowned cancer hospital in houston mrs day says ms loewe thought she would stand a better chance there she may have been right last year m d anderson opened the worlds first dedicated clinic for inflammatory breast cancer the hospitals five year survival rate for the disease is over the national five year survival rate is a little above ms loewe called m d anderson but was told she needed a referral from her oncologist she asked dr duncan for the referral but he refused mrs day says dr duncan says he knew from experience that m d anderson didnt take charity case referrals unless the patients diagnosis was unusual and the treatment couldnt be handled locally contacting it about ms loewe "would have been a waste of time " he says a spokesman for m d anderson says the cancer hospital does accept in state referrals of charity cases regardless of the type of diagnosis had ms loewe been covered by medicaid she would have stood an even better chance of admission m d anderson treats medicaid patients no differently than those who are covered by private insurance frustrated and confused ms loewe searched on the internet and contacted an advocacy group called native american cancer research which fights cancer among indian tribes from her mother ms loewe had inherited membership in the oklahoma based chickasaw tribe linda burhansstipanov nacrs president says she first tried to requalify ms loewe for medicaid through the treatment act by suggesting she get screened at a program clinic for cervical cancer but the effort was rejected by the texas health department the department spokesman says that would be tantamount to medicaid fraud later as nacr was trying other avenues of help ms loewe phoned in tears because the county indigent clinic suspended its assistance alleging she had ramped up her working hours ms burhansstipanov says nacr intervened and got her reinstated a supervisor at the county clinic says theres no record of ms loewe being dropped from the county welfare rolls during that time mrs day recalls visiting her sister around this time and being shocked by ms loewes living conditions the foot trailer was leaking gas and ms loewe was complaining about a violent headache which mrs day figured was caused by the leak "i told her for petes sake come live with us " mrs day remembers at first ms loewe wouldnt hear of it but she wept relented and moved in with her sister and brother in law that night after four months of chemotherapy ms loewes tumor had shrunk by half but wouldnt get any smaller her doctors decided it was time for a mastectomy dr cooks office repeatedly asked ms loewe how the operation would be paid for according to mrs day and ms burhansstipanov he finally scheduled the surgery in early november after receiving a consent fax from the county saying it would cover the costs ms loewes daughter mrs ferguson flew in from colorado to be with her mother for the operation mrs ferguson who works as a nurse noticed her mother and the surgeon werent getting along and became alarmed when dr cook referred to removing the wrong breast the day before the surgery dr cook says he doesnt remember the incident he says ms loewe got first rate care and that she simply waited too long before getting the lump in her breast checked out "she didnt exactly seek what you call early attention " he says the surgery went smoothly ms loewe underwent radiation therapy for five months until april when she went into remission she returned to work full time at todays cuts and moved back into an apartment next to the one she had once lived in the reprieve was short lived three months later mrs ferguson noticed her mother was having trouble talking when they were on the phone mrs day took her sister back to good shepherd the news wasnt good ms loewes cancer had returned and metastasized to the brain where it had spawned a tumor the hospital gave ms loewe only a few months to live convinced ms loewe wasnt receiving top quality care mrs ferguson decided to bring her mother to denver ms loewe moved in with her daughters family in a denver suburb she slept on a donated mattress on the floor of her grandsons room but the move brought new complications ms loewe applied for medicaid coverage in colorado but she was told the process could take as long as a year because she needed to establish residency in the state her daughter and ms burhansstipanov say a spokeswoman for the colorado department of healthcare policy and financing which administers the states medicaid program says she has no idea why ms loewe was told that states are required by federal law to act on a patients application within days and there is no time delay to establish residency through her contacts in the denver medical community mrs ferguson found a neurosurgeon j d day who was willing to operate on her mother free but the hospital where dr day performed his surgeries swedish medical center refused to make its facilities available unless ms loewe or her family paid &# up front mrs ferguson says mrs ferguson and her husband who is also a nurse had only a few thousand dollars in the bank dr day who is now an associate professor of neurosurgery at the university of texas health science center at san antonio confirms mrs fergusons account a spokeswoman at swedish medical center says the hospital has no record of ms loewe seeking admission "its not consistent with the way we handle these cases every day " she says dr days office referred mrs ferguson to the colorado neurological institute a charity organization for patients with brain illnesses that has a partnership with swedish medical center while talking on the phone to a social worker at the institute mrs ferguson remembers expressing frustration over her mothers situation she says the social worker replied "people die every day waiting for the system to catch up why is your mother any different " mrs ferguson says she broke down in tears luanne williams the institutes executive director says what the social worker told mrs ferguson is "unfortunately a true statement but i agree that it was an insensitive thing to say to a person in that situation " mrs ferguson next tried the denver health medical center a county hospital that provides charity care to numerous uninsured patients she was told that her mother couldnt qualify for indigent care there because her house was located in a different county mrs ferguson then contacted the university of colorado hospital and argued that her mothers case was an emergency she says the university hospital told her it was under no obligation to admit ms loewe because her brain tumor resulted from a pre existing condition breast cancer and therefore didnt qualify as an "emergency medical condition " unwilling to take no for an answer mrs ferguson recalls putting the following scenario to the hospital what if her mother stopped taking her antiseizure medication and went into a coma wouldnt it have to treat her then mrs ferguson says the hospital replied that in such a scenario it would stabilize ms loewe and then discharge her a spokeswoman at the university of colorado hospital says illnesses like cancer arent considered emergency conditions under the strict sense of federal statutes against patient dumping "we frankly do not have the financial resources to provide care to medically indigent patients whose conditions are not immediately life or limb threatening " she added in an emailed statement mrs ferguson who is personally opposed to universal health care because she thinks it would lower the quality of care was discouraged "i remember thinking how can they let her die just because she doesnt have health insurance in this state " she says in early august mrs ferguson brought ms loewe who could no longer be left alone to one of her sons little league games the mother of a teammate kelly fulton noticed ms loewe on the sidelines mrs fulton was the former administrative director of a neurosurgery group at another denver hospital st anthony central her husband matt fulton used to be the hospitals chief executive officer the fultons put mrs ferguson in touch with john nichols a neurosurgeon at st anthony central dr nichols agreed to see ms loewe right away his prognosis was much more upbeat than the one she had been given in texas and unlike swedish medical center st anthony agreed to take ms loewe on free on aug dr nichols operated on her and removed most of the tumor on oct nearly three months after she applied colorado granted ms loewe medicaid coverage and covered the costs of the surgery retroactively the following month she returned to st anthony for treatment under a gamma knife a machine that emits powerful gamma rays to dissolve what was left of the tumor the procedure was a success over the following months ms loewe had several recurrences of cancer in her chest but she went into remission after more rounds of chemotherapy and radiation in may body and brain scans came back clear once unable to talk ms loewe fully recovered her speech and was able to function autonomously tired of the cold rocky mountain weather and missing her friends ms loewe persuaded her daughter to let her move back to texas she rented an apartment in gladewater near her sisters house and went back to work at todays cuts ms loewes daughter bought her a used chevy cavalier ms loewe reapplied for medicaid coverage in texas and this time got it promptly life went back to normal but last spring the cancer came back with a vengeance an mri showed numerous tumors in ms loewes brain and she went into steep neurological decline this time no surgery would make a difference ms loewes battle with the health care bureaucracy wasnt quite over though she underwent radiation in tyler texas to ease her pain and after days was transferred to a gladewater nursing home medicaid covered the gladewater nursing home but wouldnt pay for tyler medicare the federal program for the elderly that also provides coverage to disabled people would pay for only the first days in tyler mrs loewes daughter wound up paying for the extra day &# medicaid eventually reimbursed her for most of it on a late june morning ms loewe lay in bed emaciated and writhing in pain her left arm and hand were swollen to three times their size from lymphedema a side effect of her breast surgery embarrassed by her appearance she hid the huge black scar left on the top of her head by her brain surgery under a grey beret she reacted little when told that her ordeal could have been avoided had she gone to a different clinic back in "its very complicated when you dont have health insurance " she whispered "i really dont understand it much " ms loewe died on june at age her daughter sold her car to pay for her cremation
