the playoffs dodgers fans also have given up on the postseason judging from the number of no shows last night in a crucial game against the padres and the shows lack of enthusiasm "listen the place should be packed " steve dilbeck writes in the los angeles daily news "should be turning people away should be vibrating with energy and passion instead there were rows upon rows of empty seats and those who were there mostly sat on their hands like they didnt want to offend the padres or were too busy navigating that fake cheese in their nachos the crowd showed some life when james loney hit a two run homer in the fourth and when the dodgers added two more in the sixth they reacted fine but needed prodding by the team it should be the other way around particularly now particularly in a stretch drive " at least tens of thousands of dodgers fans are showing up in a distant place a thousand miles from the nearest nl playoff race about fans turned out in the degree heat for a day game
