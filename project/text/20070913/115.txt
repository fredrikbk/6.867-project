the world according to univision john edwards has not taken a definitive position on abortion hillary clintons position on the issue is that "she will fight for the defense of children " and barack obama wants taxes to be "as low as possible " each of these statements is misleading at best mr edwards and mrs clinton support "a womans right to choose" and mr obama wants to repeal the bush tax cuts but on univision a spanish language tv network with an average prime time audience of about million viewers these and other slanted statements about the presidential candidates are commonplace these statements appeared on univisions web site but like much of the networks reporting were missed by the mainstream media because they appeared only in spanish i have taken an extensive look at univision and found that these are a tiny fraction of the biased views of american politics regularly presented by the network this is something all of us need to be concerned about earlier this week democrats participated in a univision sponsored presidential debate held in south florida the candidates used the forum to reach out to hispanic voters and many democrats have noted that only one republican sen john mccain has agreed to participate in a similar debate for gop candidates originally scheduled for this coming sunday their aim is to portray republicans as biased against hispanics but context matters faced with an onslaught of biased reporting republicans are right to have reservations about univision they should however engage the network as it is far too important to be ignored late last month nielsen began comparing univision to other broadcast networks in a single viewer sample and found that it is the most watched tv network ahead of fox abc cbs and nbc for viewers if their views were presented fairly its likely that republicans would connect with hispanic voters that may be why the networks news coverage often downplays issues that make hispanics dislike democrats abortion same sex marriage taxes and sensationalizes the immigration issue as a way of demonizing republicans even those who are not anti immigrant rudy giuliani who is attacked by some for making new york a "sanctuary city" for illegal immigrants during his time as mayor was blasted as anti inmigrante in a recent op ed by star reporter maria elena salinas on univisions web site apparently the mayor earned the label because he was tough on crime and supports border security notwithstanding the fact that he carried of new york citys hispanic vote a bloc that tends to be heavily democratic when he ran for re election in republicans must engage and demand fairness from univision rather than let it propagandize the most conservative segment of the hispanic population the who may speak english but who are "spanish dominant" and consume their news in their native language according to a july study of previous elections by the new democratic network english speaking hispanics are more reliably democratic and "the movement towards bush has come from the spanish dominant as they have gone from clinton dole in to kerry bush " univision isnt alone bias is a problem throughout spanish media in south carolina rep bob inglis a republican and supporter of the failed comprehensive immigration reform bill was surprised to see a december headline in el periodico latino that when translated read "bad news for immigrants congressman inglis will support president bushs position on immigration " of course the bush plan was the most pro immigration proposal on the table univision is the largest and most important part of the spanish language media yet it features some of the most unbalanced political news coverage on television and it continues its leftward drift marcela salazar a former staffer for house speaker nancy pelosi was hired recently as the producer on univisions new political show "al punto " which is hosted by two left wing journalists a democratic friend of mine who works as a strategist for a democratic presidential campaign told me last week "shell do us a lot of good there " as a group latinos are more pro life and more supportive of traditional family values than non hispanic whites less likely to divorce and three times as likely to have started a business in the past decade given that all of these are strong republican identifiers gop strategists are asking themselves why they vote so lopsidedly democratic the answer rests in part in the bias in the spanish language media republicans should counteract that by participating in univisions debate if only so they can speak over the heads of biased reporters and directly to the networks audience ms sanchez director of the white house initiative on hispanic education from is author of "los republicanos why hispanics and republicans need each other" palgrave macmillan
