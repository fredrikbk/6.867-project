a cultural conversation with rory stewart start with how things actually are new york looking at rory stewarts spare deceptively waifish profile you wonder what the marsh arabs of iraq he administered virtually a million of them for a year made of this very distinctive product of the british tradition eton oxford the british army the foreign service he should be a clear enough type yet in person mr stewart is a strangely elusive estranged figure with his accumulated fame and celebrated achievements amplified by his two books about exploits in afghanistan and then in iraq one expects to meet someone fully revealed familiar even but mr stewart belongs to the more complicated tradition of british heroism still single at slightly haunted and solitary seeming even when happily dazzling a female fan he gives you an inkling of how it might have felt to meet the likes of t e lawrence epic adventurers with an urge to self publicize who exude a sense of internal exile mr stewart gives off a kind of quiet complex discomfort as would anyone who unites in himself the multiple strands of britains questing sensibility the soldier with the artistic temperament the colonial officer with the austere probity of a missionary who tells harsh truths simultaneously about his own side and the other one senses the self exacting conscience just beneath the surface that must cut across both ambition and convention of the allied efforts in iraq he has said "were like an inadequate antibiotic we are sufficiently strong to have turned what might have been a conventional civil war into a highly unconventional neighborhood conflict but were not strong enough to eliminate it entirely at the same time i fear that without intending to we have discredited democracy in the eyes of many iraqis " but equally he is capable of writing in the most unvarnished and un p c terms of the locals he meets such as many afghans whom he found "greedy idle stupid hypocritical insensitive mendacious ignorant and cruel" though he goes on to say that many "indulged fed nursed and protected" him mr stewart was born in hong kong and grew up partly in the far east and southeast asia including malaysia where his father served as a postwar colonial officer in one of the few successful counterinsurgency campaigns against communist guerrillas of modern times though mr stewart now resides in kabul the family is scottish and lives in a significant house on its large private estate in perthshire mr stewart likes to point out that a lot of bloody and dramatic events of scottish history took place not far away making the point that we in the west have little cause to feel superior or smug in relation to others after oxford mr stewart worked as a diplomat in indonesia and kosovo before he set off on a solitary walk across various asian countries including turkey iran pakistan and india his risky january trek through a snowy afghanistan from herat to kabul just after the taliban collapsed became his first book "the places in between" his next adventure became his second book "the prince of the marshes" where he chronicles the time he spent in iraq administering troubled regions between the tigris and euphrates rivers in soon after the allied invasion he was at the time the books generated flurries of praise and awards in both adventures mr stewart survived various degrees of danger to his life most explicitly in iraq where he organized the defense of his compound against a days long siege of incessant shelling by the mehdi army mr stewarts accounts of such extremes are never overexcited never other than taut and level eyed as a result one trusts his conclusions during the siege he repeatedly blames the italian military contingent for not lifting a finger to scare off the mehdi insurgents the italians dont protect the compound and their incompetence is in turn protected by pr imperatives silvio berlusconi italys prime minister at the time must not be humiliated which might force him to withdraw his countrys participation at the same time the iraqis whom mr stewart has nominated to work with him on a governing council come off as cowardly bullying unprincipled janus faced likely as not to smile and profess friendship and later try to kill you "nothing personal " says one amiably mr stewart shows that too many moving often conflicting parts on the allied military administrative side overlay an equally atomized iraqi social mix the prognosis is bleak and distinctly pre petraeus mr stewart and i met and talked in new york during his visit to raise money for the turquoise mountain foundation the charity he runs in kabul that works to preserve afghan crafts and monuments in particular the old town at the center of the city mr stewart had returned to afghanistan late in to follow up a proposal by prince charles whose children he had tutored one summer that he start a vocational training school in kabul to help re employ plumbers fitters and the like he had by then plenty of experience in iraq at launching such initiatives "i was disgusted by the mountains of garbage in kabul " he said to me "and horrified that bulldozers were about to destroy the old buildings also i felt it would be more helpful long term to revive traditional crafts and skills to stop destruction and restore some beauty to the environment so i refashioned the proposal " as we chatted i told mr stewart that he seemed always to be both loyalist and outsider acting both within and against convention he agreed and began by explaining the treks that led to his first book "id had a chattering life very social school university and foreign office work i wanted to get out of secondhand experiences perhaps learn to survive alone i felt a bit of a fraud the scots have a long heritage of being abroad and they often have a hardheaded unsentimental view of what they see my grandfather and father worked in india and in the colonial service but my father was often impatient with whitehall bureaucracy and yes men who were clueless about real events on the ground in a foreign country thats perhaps why i had the urge to see countries on foot and at the village level "when it came to writing the book id always been beguiled and irritated by the long tradition of travel writing from robert byron to bruce chatwin i found their approach to be in some ways dishonest because after days and days of boredom which is never recorded they would suddenly romanticize the entire experience based on one encounter with a ruin they would romanticize the local people as embodiments of grand history i wanted the book to reflect the real experience at least mine when you ask people the way or where to find food or the history of a place mostly your questions dont get answered rather than being in a mystical trance im usually just irritated instead of alexander the greats footprints everywhere one is likely to see cheap cookie wrappers littering the ground the locals arent steeped in their own grand history they usually reject it " i asked mr stewart if this dystopian view of things when applied to war zones gave him a more realistic perspective with a more practical sense of what to do he said "you have to start with how things actually are and work from there in afghanistan for example its no good telling an opium farmer suddenly to stop in rural areas you earn &# per day for a wheat harvest and &# to &# for opium it adds up to half the national economy neither the populace nor the leadership considers it a priority to eradicate it its useless to demand or impose western standards from afar "we also have illusions about the kind of government they should have afghanistan is a country run from the countryside which is a highly varied population ranging from mullahs to warlords its not possible to run things from the center in a clean transparent efficient western way toppling or changing regional power by fiat only creates chaos in afghanistan in my view you have a center versus region problem rather than a karzai versus taliban problem "in iraq similarly we should focus on the doable our mere presence creates a provocation or irritant and it has the effect of infantilizing iraqi political life inducing a dependency on us which they resent and a postponement of true compromise among themselves we should pick concrete limited projects such as building bridges and schools gain credibility and work from there the greater middle east project of containing iran and syria can be done in other ways such as threatening to destabilize iran regionally " stewarts current project of the foundation in kabul fulfills his own gradualist criteria it started with defined goals and grew manageably "in the old city we have removed truckloads of garbage while renovating buildings in the craft center we have masters and pupils working in traditional ceramics architecture and the like we have an exhibition of afghan calligraphy touring the mideast and weve just sold a complete wooden room to the connaught hotel in london were revitalizing the old heart of kabul and the old souk after four years we plan to hand it all over to the municipality with supporting funds and some to personnel then perhaps i will go back and find a life in the u k " mr kaylan writes about culture for the journal
