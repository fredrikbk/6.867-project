japan resumes elusive search for leadership tokyo with prime minister shinzo abe stepping down japan faces further backsliding from the economic changes of popular leader junichiro koizumi that carried the nation out of a decadelong slump the danger now another procession of weak leaders japan the first major economic power in recent memory to suffer a natural decline in population fears a fall in living standards and retreat on the world stage as china advances for japan mr koizumi was a once in a generation politician with the ability to impose his vision for retooling the country "we have a bunch of candidates who want to change this and undo that in reform policy " said heizo takenaka a former government minister who helped mr koizumi overhaul the banking system and privatize the post office "there would be a huge negative impact on the economy if reform loses momentum " mr abe who announced his resignation yesterday lasted less than a year after succeeding mr koizumi while public opinion favored another tough leader mr abe appeared indecisive and was bogged down by a scandal plagued cabinet the leading candidate to succeed him is taro aso secretary general of the ruling liberal democratic party the veteran politician is seen as more effective but he faces a split parliament where the ruling coalition controls only one house some analysts think japan could slide back into an era of pork barrel spending and the next prime minister might hand out more money to please discontented voters a move that would worsen japans huge government debt and slow the drive toward higher productivity robert feldman chief japan economist at morgan stanley said the next administration might seek approval for an extra budget of around two trillion yen or about &# billion he called the overall situation a "nightmare " mr abe years old was chosen to succeed mr koizumi because he shared his ideas of small government deregulation and an assertive foreign policy but mr abe didnt know how to put them into practice that led to a disastrous election for the ruling party six weeks ago his coalition lost control of japans upper house a spokesman said thursday morning that mr abe was examined in a hospital because he felt unwell he didnt release details saying results werent yet available stocks were slightly down yesterday as the prospect of a leadership vacuum outweighed hopes surrounding a replacement for mr abe the most prominent scandal that led to mr abes downfall was the discovery that the government had lost million national pension records that heightened worries among many japanese about their post retirement security mr abes point man on tax policy resigned after being caught living with a mistress in a government subsidized apartment while a farm minister under fire over misused political funds hanged himself until the early s when japans economy was growing quickly strong political leadership wasnt such an issue but after a stock and property bubble popped the country spent about a decade mired in troubles related to bad loans at banks and falling asset prices now japans economic system needs retooling so that fewer workers can generate more output to support the growing elderly population mr koizumi was just what the country wanted at the time an aggressive leader with a clear vision for an open economy he took office in vowing to transform the nation then fixed the banks bad loan problems and slashed public spending mr abe alienated voters when he said the pension problem would be looked into without providing vigorous reassurances his final weeks in office were typical of his indecision at first he said he would carry on after the election defeat and he unveiled a new cabinet of veteran lawmakers on aug he pledged to fight for renewal of a law that enables japan to supply u s led forces fighting in afghanistan then before debate on the law began in earnest he quit the law "was a central pillar of the assertive foreign policy that i support " he said "japan must continue its fight against terrorism under a new prime minister " the liberal democratic party will choose a new leader over the next week or so the favorite is mr aso a former foreign minister who supports strengthening japans military alliance with the u s "even children know that if you cannot protect yourself its wise to get along well with someone strong " he wrote in a book published in june he also said japan shouldnt go overboard in trying to redress a growing rich poor gap "if making an effort doesnt generate differences in wealth fewer people will make an effort " he wrote mr aso is a big fan of japanese "manga" comic books which he believes can be a big way for japan to influence the world mr koizumi has said he has no intention of making a comeback as prime minister it is unlikely that the change at the top will hurt the economy in the short run the economy has been growing at about a year since the bigger risk to growth would be a slowdown in the u s which japan still relies upon as a market for exports the housing downturn could affect u s demand for japanese cars electronics and other goods the big long term question is how japans next leaders will prepare for life with a shrinking population mr takenaka the former minister who is now an economics professor at keio university said japan needs proactive steps to prepare its economy for the future for example he said tokyos two international airports should be allowed to remain open around the clock he said japan should let an independent agency manage its vast foreign currency reserves and privatize big public universities like tokyo university "to implement these steps we need a leader who has a strong ability to conceptualize and implement " he said but he added "its very hard to find someone like that right now " in the july election the main opposition party exploited concerns about japans wealth disparity and lagging rural economy it promised measures such as income support for farmers since then some ruling party leaders have suggested they agree with that direction "the situation of smaller businesses and the regions isnt so good so we need to think what to do about this " finance minister fukushiro nukaga said in an interview last week some foreign businesspeople accuse japan of backsliding on opening up its economy new rules were drawn up earlier this month to restrict investment in defense related companies including producers of steel and batteries "these measures are far too broad reaching and restrictive to be aimed solely at monitoring sensitive industries " says kirby daley a strategist at societe generales fimat broker division mr daley says the change in attitude has driven many of his clients out of japan to places like singapore and hong kong financial services minister yoshimi watanabe hinted in a recent speech that some activist hedge funds targeting japanese companies shouldnt be allowed to operate "we want the japanese market to be a pond that attracts fish from around the world " mr watanabe said "however we have to take out piranhas if they happen to come " mr abes rapid rise and fall make a sad tale of a man who was born to lead but didnt have the gumption for high level politics the grandson of nobusuke kishi a prime minister in the late s he entered politics by working as an aide to his father former foreign minister shintaro abe after his father died mr abe in took over his seat in parliament he later took up the cause of families whose relatives had been abducted from japanese beaches by north korean agents and forced to live in the north under mr koizumi he helped engineer the return of some of these abductees to japan building his popularity and preparing the way for his ascent to prime minister yuka hayashi and andrew morse contributed to this article
