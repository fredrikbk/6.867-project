world bank reckoning since were talking about the worlds second most out of control international bureaucracy no prizes for guessing the first we shouldnt get our hopes up but in the past week some prominent outsiders have been forcing the world bank to reckon with the alien concept of accountability now its up to new bank president robert zoellick to see that their efforts bear fruit first up is former federal reserve chairman paul volcker for the past five months mr volcker and a panel of international experts have been conducting an independent review of the department of institutional integrity the banks anticorruption unit known internally as the int their report which readers can find on opinionjournal com is being released to the public today in sober and measured terms mr volckers report provides a devastating indictment of what it calls the banks "ambivalence" toward both corruption and its own anticorruption unit "there was then and remains now resistance among important parts of the bank staff and some of its leadership to the work of int " the report says our emphasis it goes on to say that "some resistance is more parochial there is a natural discomfort among some line staff who are generally encouraged by the pay and performance evaluation system to make loans for promising projects to have those projects investigated ex post exposed as rife with corruption creating an awkward problem in relations with borrowing clients " to put it more plainly the report is saying that every incentive at the bank is to push more money out the door and bank employees hate the anticorruption effort because it interferes with that imperative the report endorses the work of the int which was created a mere six years ago and which has been under what it calls a "particularly strong" institutional attack ever since the int the volcker panel says "is staffed by competent and dedicated investigators who work hard and long hours with professionalism" and deploy "advanced investigative methods to detect and substantiate allegations of fraud and corruption " and it goes on to recommend that the anticorruption crusaders "should be nurtured and maintained as an exemplary investigative organization" within the bank in a phone interview yesterday mr volcker added that he gives "high marks" to current int director suzanne rich folsom mr volckers endorsement should stop cold the recent attempts by some in the banks entrenched bureaucracy to run ms folsom out of the bank as they did paul wolfowitz the bank is also being put on notice by the u s senate through provisions in its foreign operations appropriations bill the provision threatens to withhold of u s funds to the banks international development association arm which provides interest free loans to the worlds poorest countries until it is assured that the bank "has adequately staffed and sufficiently funded the department of institutional integrity " the bill also demands that the bank provide "financial disclosure forms of all senior world bank personnel " now that will get the bureaucracys attention notably its a democrat evan bayh of indiana whos taken the lead on this issue mr bayh has ordered a government accountability office report on the effectiveness of ida loans and their susceptibility to corruption the banks procurement procedures as well as the legendary pay packages enjoyed by its senior management "theres a tendency at the bank to say just give us the money and go away " the senator told us by phone yesterday "until there are some tangible consequences they wont take us seriously we shouldnt let that happen " thats good advice and not just for the bank secretary of treasury hank paulson who was absent without leave during the wolfowitz fiasco also needs to step up to his oversight responsibilities one particularly useful step he could take is to insist on a probe into the leaking of confidential bank documents to the government accountability project which ran a "parallel" review of the int mainly in order to undermine mr volckers efforts as we reported saturday there is evidence the leaker is managing director graeme wheeler the banks no who also happens to be ms folsoms no institutional enemy mr wheeler denies hes the leaker but his name appeared on an email posted on the gap web site before it mysteriously disappeared whatever the outcome of that affair theres no question that mr volcker and mr bayh have set some useful benchmarks for the world bank to clean up its long history of turning a blind eye to corruption now its up to mr zoellick to follow through not least by saying goodbye to those in the bank "leadership" who want to continue business as usual
