weekend journal review theater shes the one that youll want grease brooks atkinson theatre w th st &# &# a midsummer nights dream public theater delacorte theater central park new york free closes sept new york kathleen marshall needs no gimmicks to make a show a hit her revivals of "wonderful town" and "the pajama game" put her solidly in the running for the title of broadways hottest choreographer director why then did she sign up to stage the broadway revival of "grease" mounted by the creators of "youre the one that i want " the snooze inducing reality tv series that let its viewers choose the leads of this production m o n e y i assume nevertheless im pleased and relieved to report that ms marshall has emptied her bag of theatrical tricks onto the stage of the brooks atkinson theatre "grease" may not be much of a show but this revival is still fun to see despite the limitations of one of its audience anointed stars as a musical "grease" is strictly from the recycling bin the songs four of which were written for the film version of the original stage show are ersatz school of brylcreem rock while the tough guy meets nice girl book is an exercise in banality whose parodic touches are toothless and tedious but even the most uninteresting material can be enlivened if not ennobled by imaginative staging and thats what happens here ms marshall unlike most of the people making dances for broadway nowadays is a full fledged choreographer who knows how to fill every square foot of a stage with movement that is both lively and theatrically meaningful and since the slender book of "grease" is nothing more than a pretext for its songs she has near unlimited opportunities to raise the rafters i loathe s rock yet time and again i was carried away in spite of myself would that the sock hops of my youth had been one quarter as frisky what about the year old stars well laura osnes is definitely a charmer and though i wouldnt care to guess what shed make of a more demanding part shes more than equal to the modest task of playing sandy dumbrowski the sweet young catholic maiden who falls hard for a boy from the wrong side of the socioeconomic line her singing is exciting her dancing very good ms marshall has cast robyn hurder lindsay menez jenny powers and kirsten wyatt as her best friends and it says a lot about ms osness natural gifts that she appears to be entirely at ease with this case hardened band of gypsies all of whom give keenly characterized performances as for max crumm hes likable enough as danny zuko the greaser with a secret heart of mush but he doesnt have the projection necessary to stand out on stage a problem that was somewhat less evident on the small screen ms marshall who is nobodys fool has shrewdly directed his numbers in such a way as to allow him to fade into the ensemble whenever possible thus helping to paper over his lack of star quality a deficiency that in any case went unnoticed by the shrieking fans who cheered his every entrance at the preview i saw in all other ways "grease" is a thoroughly professional job derek mclanes comic book sets are funny and pointed the eight piece onstage rock band showily conducted by kimberly grisby does its noisy thing with booty shaking elan i wouldnt dream of trying to persuade you that the end product is anything more than a slick tourist trap for tv viewers but if youre looking for an undemandingly good time on broadway you could do a whole lot worse it takes a scene or two for daniel sullivans shakespeare in the park production of "a midsummer nights dream" to get off the mark but once it starts moving it quickly picks up comic speed and turns into a show thats very much worth seeing except for ann hould wards costumes which are a mostly victorian mishmash that never quite coheres the production sticks fairly close to the mainstream of contemporary shakespearean style the scenes set in the athenian court are a bit too broadly staged for my taste but mr sullivan has done well by the forest fairies and the "rude mechanicals" who put on "the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of pyramus and thisbe " the play within the play in which shakespeare spoofs a troupe of incompetent strolling players three members of the cast give performances deserving of special mention martha plimpton lately of "the coast of utopia " is commandingly hot blooded as helena the spurned lover laila robins who made a powerful impression on me three years ago in bryony laverys "frozen " gives a breathtakingly sensual performance as titania queen of the fairies as for jesse tyler ferguson who played the hapless leaf coneybear in the original production of "the th annual putnam county spelling bee " hes been cast as flute the cross dressing member of the rude mechanicals in which capacity he brings off the near unprecedented feat of stealing the show from bottom jay o sanders who is nonetheless excellent dan moses schreier wrote the luminous incidental music scored for a small instrumental ensemble dominated by harp and accordion an offbeat pairing that couldnt be prettier to compose new music for a classic play that has previously been set by felix mendelssohn and benjamin britten takes a lot of nerve but mr schreiers moonlit score whose climax is a choral finale sung by the entire cast ends up being one of the best things about this agreeable production mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
