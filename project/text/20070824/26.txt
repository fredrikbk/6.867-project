deep well how a gulf petro state invests its oil riches kuwaits mr al saad likes asian real estate but is cool to treasurys kuwait city kuwait is a world away from new haven conn but when a government investment fund here got a new chief in one of the first things he did was commission a study of the sophisticated ways yale university invests its endowment it was a sign that bader al saad intended to shake things up at the huge but sleepy kuwait investment authority the investments he has since pursued put his fund at the forefront of far reaching change in how the oil wealth of the persian gulf is deployed instead of mostly u s treasury securities kuwait now invests in things like higher yielding bonds chinese office buildings and asian private equity funds and in a move with implications for the strength of the u s s currency and economy the kuwait fund is de emphasizing holdings priced in dollars the gulf petro states control a vast hoard of investable funds one that is sure to grow vaster combined government investment arms in kuwait saudi arabia dubai abu dhabi and qatar hold an estimated &# trillion that gives them the potential to sway the course of broad global financial markets including exchange and interest rates the now slowed buyout boom and the global credit dislocations stemming from u s subprime mortgages yet for the most part the operations of these funds are opaque in the case of kuwait it is possible to glimpse the workings of one of the government investment arms which are known as sovereign wealth funds although kuwait has an emir it also has a parliament whose members often question the investment authoritys executives about their holdings and in mr al saad the kuwait authority has a manager whos keenly attuned to western practices as he runs a fund of &# billion that makes it almost as big as the mammoth california pension fund known as calpers a lanky former basketball player mr al saad was managing a local investment firm when kuwaits finance minister approached him in late about running the government fund he understood the challenges though the kuwait fund had once been among the most savvy in the region taking big stakes in daimler benz in and later in british petroleum the gulf war and the late s fall in oil prices had left the kuwait government struggling to balance its budgets by its investment authority had fallen into a torpor slowed by bureaucracy and buffeted by turmoil in the region after the sept terrorist attacks "there was no clear vision of what we should do and no clear objectives " says mahmoud al nouri then finance minister he saw mr al saad a member of a prominent kuwait family as the solution mr al saad now years old was used to challenges as a college basketball player he recalls he once had to square off against future boston celtics star kevin mchale in the university games in mexico city in "do not ask the score " he says his switch from a private fund to the bureaucratic kuwait investment authority was a cultural jolt the authority was like kuwait itself a collection of fiefs "we had evolved by default not design " says gururaj rao a financial adviser who is one of the few expatriates on the staff though mr al saad has hacked away at the authoritys hierarchy which includes civil service levels he bemoans rules that still force staff members including managers juggling billions of dollars to sign attendance sheets twice a day despite the desert heat the air conditioning in the funds drab offices shuts off at p m quitting time for government employees anyone who would stay on such as to monitor the market open in another time zone cant do so for long the parking garage is locked at mr al saad can work late only because he has a car and driver a battery powered appliance wards off the heat in his office after before starting mr al saad commissioned a study comparing the authoritys cautious investing practices with those of the yale and harvard endowments regarded as pioneers of institutional investing the endowments which have some of the same flexibility as kuwait to take a long term view had achieved strong returns despite the bursting of the tech bubble by investing in things like emerging market stocks real estate hedge funds and private equity funds mr al saad learned that yale was in stocks in private equity funds and in real estate at the time kuwait was in real estate and in private equity funds the bulk of its money was in u s treasurys despite that hoard the fund had enough losses elsewhere that its returns were negative in and mr al saad says he hired mercer investment consulting which drafted an ambitious program involving an array of investments entailing higher risk but the potential for better returns to improve the morale of employees who earn less than their counterparts at investment banks he cut his salary in half and used the money for staff bonuses some staff members say still more change is needed "we should have a more entrepreneurial mindset " says osama al ayoub who oversees private equity investment for the fund the fund has managed to hire back some managers who had defected to the private sector in the halls of its kuwait city offices men in western suits mix with others in flowing white middle eastern robes a number of women are in positions of authority helping with morale in addition to the bonuses and other moves to professionalize the staff was an avalanche of cash thanks to oil prices that began rising about the time mr al saad joined a kuwait law directs a minimum of of the nations oil revenue to the government investment authority that law is one of several ways kuwaits investment fund is more formal and structured than others in gulf states which often must bargain with a ruling family for money and are never sure how much theyll get mr al saad says the fund returned in and in its benchmark the msci world index rose and in those years the comparison isnt perfect as the msci is all stocks the portion of the kuwait fund devoted to stocks while way up is still only about "we must deploy the money in a way to keep kuwait going when the oil is gone " mr al saad says "we dont have the cheap labor of china or the services of switzerland or the efficiency of singapore " he has the luxury of not needing to cater to impatient investors monitoring short term results but he has had to get used to grillings by kuwaiti politicians these range from thoughtful probing to confused questions about how private equity works and questions about why he invests in hotels that serve alcohol "i am a technocrat and like to operate behind closed doors " the fund manager says "democracy in kuwait is still very young compared to the western world " with so much cash to deploy he has no need to borrow to make leveraged bets yet he remains indirectly affected by the credit markets because of investment partnerships the kuwait fund has &# million invested alongside u s buyout firms kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co and tpg in their effort to acquire texas utility txu corp a bid that entails a lot of borrowing "we did more private equity in the last two years than in the previous " says alia al tameemi who worked at the kuwait fund left for the private sector and recently returned other gulf sovereign wealth funds have also been getting involved in buyout firms the abu dhabi investment authority bought about of a quasi public listing of shares in apollo management a new york private equity fund when fortress investment group llc went public in the u s early this year persian gulf government investment authorities were among the first prospective investors fortress executives visited to market it dubais various government investment arms have stakes in british banks hsbc plc and standard chartered plc and in the owner of airbus eads some in the middle east felt their money was unwelcome in the west after the resistance a dubai company faced last year when it bought the operator of u s ports but the state holding company that owns dubais business projects including its investment arms has just agreed to sink &# billion into mgm mirage and one of the hotel casino companys projects gulf sovereign wealth funds might even become competitors of the buyout firms in the future since the government funds neednt borrow to wield large sums of cash in a deal qatars investment fund last month bid &# billion to acquire british supermarket chain j sainsbury plc after bidding but losing in a &# billion auction for u k utility thames water the gulf investors are wary that corporate deal making may have crested in the u s and europe mr al saad says that even before current credit problems he was concerned that the buyout boom was becoming "more about financial engineering than corporate restructuring " he is shifting assets toward smaller and middle market private equity firms in developed markets and toward asian regional funds the recent troubles in u s and european financial markets confirmed him in his view that emerging markets especially in asia hold greater promise he has made some big investments in china including &# million in industrial &amp commercial bank of china in "baders approach to private equity investment is different than most large institutional investors he is targeting areas where there is less efficiency more economic growth and lower levels of investment by other large institutions " says monte brem whose stepstone group consulting firm in la jolla calif advises the kuwait investment authority the middle easts government investment arms are at the fulcrum of a longer term shift in global financial flows from the wests developed markets to the faster growing economies of india china southeast asia and turkey places where many middle easterners see their fortunes lying in the future mr al saad is cutting the portion of the portfolio invested in the u s and europe to less than from about "why invest in growth economies when you can invest in growth economies " he asks that shift might lower the appetite for low yielding investments such as the bonds the u s government must sell in large numbers to finance its budget and trade deficits all else being equal reduced buying of treasurys and other u s securities would tend to weaken the dollar and make u s exports more competitive globally but also burden businesses and consumers in the u s by pushing up interest rates as mr al saad moves away from assets priced in dollars the euro and the pound sterling he is moving toward the south korean won malaysian ringgit and indian rupee the yen is his least favorite currency though because its so volatile when he was a young banker he says he used to get up at a m and trade the japanese currency "i dont remember a day i made money trading yen " he says "this currency made my hair white " meanwhile kuwaits central bank also has less need to buy u s dollars in june kuwait stopped pegging its dinar to the dollar so kuwait no longer needs to buy dollars to keep its currency from rising when cash pours in to pay for oil exports the dinar has appreciated about against the dollar since the link was cut while mr al saad is increasing his allocation to real estate hes selling in markets he regards as too expensive the fund recently unloaded an office building at park avenue in new york it had owned for several years it is looking to buy where growth is higher such as in small chinese cities still mr al saad says he sees some opportunities in u s and european markets in recent weeks the kuwait funds managers have been looking for bargains in debt securities that seem solid but have fallen along with more questionable bonds all such calculations mark a change in how the fund is run "in the past " says mr rao the expatriate financial adviser at the fund "we all thought we couldnt do anything bader shook up our mindset "
