politics &amp economics romneys federal prescription health plan relies on tax incentives not massachusettss mandates mitt romney succeeded in significantly expanding access to health insurance in massachusetts today he lays out his plan for achieving that same goal nationwide but as the former governor of the liberal state aims to win the republican presidential nomination with conservative votes he is altering sharply his approach to the issue in a speech before the florida medical association in hollywood fla mr romney will present a program that wont include new government mandates for individuals or companies to buy coverage policies long considered anathema by many conservatives and that were features of the program enacted in massachusetts instead mr romney plans to focus on tax breaks and streamlining regulations policies his advisers say would essentially create a new freer market for health insurance driving down costs and providing incentives for individuals to buy their own plans it is an approach president bush and many republican economists have embraced in todays speech mr romney will nod to his success in the northeastern democratic stronghold aides say but he will also aim to reassure conservatives by saying that a "one size fits all" solution isnt right for the states as for why he would use a different philosophy as president than as governor they say he would have greater powers in the white house "massachusetts didnt have the federal tax code to play with " said glenn hubbard a former bush administration chief economist now advising the romney campaign mr romney follows rival rudy giuliani in announcing a plan to expand coverage for the nearly million americans now lacking health insurance and his approach has some common ground with the former new york mayors the fact that expanding coverage is even an issue in a republican presidential primary is testimony to how much political momentum has developed behind the cause amid widespread voter concerns about economic insecurity in the latest wall street journal nbc news poll taken last month "the cost of health care" ranked as the biggest economic concern facing the country well above jobs going overseas or housing costs but democrats and republicans come at the problem from different angles two of the leading democratic presidential candidates john edwards and barack obama have offered plans that rely heavily on new taxes and spending and government requirements front runner hillary rodham clinton is expected to follow with her own comprehensive plan soon yesterday in new hampshire she gave a speech touching on some of her proposals including increasing federal subsidies for teaching hospitals and universities and focusing them on providing doctors and nurses incentives to advance their skills and creating a consumer database of providers performance records at dartmouth hitchcock medical center where as first lady she campaigned for her ill fated effort to overhaul health care more than a decade ago the new york senator addressed about health professionals many of them in their white medical coats mr romneys delicate dance on health care is part of his more general political tack to the right on issues from abortion to immigration to gay rights the former private equity investor is trying to position himself as a conservative alternative to mr giuliani who was also a successful republican leader in a democratic stronghold where success required balancing on a political high wire that didnt lean too far to the right on health care reform the bipartisan support mr romney garnered in massachusetts isnt likely to help him with republican primary voters the same way it might in a general election where attracting independent voters is important among the democrats who backed mr romneys massachusetts reforms sen edward kennedy long an ideological bogeymen for the right the massachusetts plan requires businesses to provide insurance for workers or help fund care for the uninsured and it requires all residents to have some form of health insurance it offers individuals without access to employer sponsored plans government insurance or subsidies to purchase coverage now mr romney is proposing an approach many republicans in recent years have embraced changing the tax code to spur more people to buy their own private health insurance in the individual market he will propose allowing more individuals to deduct their health care premiums co pays and out of pocket expenses that is aimed at altering the current system where the cost of employer sponsored group health insurance isnt considered taxable income resulting in a break for companies and workers that many republicans say skews the system toward group coverage and undermines the individual market overall the plan draws heavily on a book "healthy wealthy and wise five steps to a better health care system " that was co written by mr hubbard now dean of columbia business school the books ideas have been praised by many conservatives "compared to what gov romney did in massachusetts that would be a dramatic improvement " said michael f cannon director of health policy studies at the libertarian cato institute which has blasted mr romney for the state plan "if its geared toward getting government out of peoples health care decisions by reforming the tax code wow thats fantastic " mr romney will also propose shaking up government funding of health care and giving states more flexibility to design their own plans for covering more of the uninsured the plan envisions covering millions more low income people without new spending or taxes by redirecting existing funds including if states choose their allotments from the medicaid program for the poor medicaid is funded jointly by the federal government and the states and it is an open ended program in which federal spending grows as costs rise and more people join mr romney calls for replacing the current federal funding with a block grant an idea that is sure to prompt criticism from democrats who fought a similar republican plan in the s mr romneys advisers say he would also encourage states to reform their health insurance regulatory agencies the romney campaign blames over regulation at the state level for the wide swings in the cost of insurance premiums from state to state from an average of &# a year in california to &# a year in new jersey the campaign says jackie calmes contributed to this article
