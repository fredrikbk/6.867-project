wish you werent here having determined that nearly every feature of modern human existence is bad for the environment driving eating meat turning on the lights having children exhaling the greens have followed the argument to its logical limit the problem is human existence that at least is the message of this summers surprise eco hit "the world without us " science writer alan weisman explores how nature would respond if homo sapiens abruptly went extinct though the book continues to climb the bestseller lists it isnt exactly beach reading cities and towns in a few decades would be reclaimed by wilderness our dogs will be killed off quickly by natural predators but without pesticides the new world will be good for mosquitoes for the most part mr weisman intends to show the enduring harm of well us in a world voided of human activity he estimates it will take years or more for atmospheric co to revert to pre industrial levels plastic will be our ozmandias the last artifact of civilization and so forth its not hard to see the appeal of such a macabre thought experiment for the most uncompromising environmentalists who often seem to favor "the earth" over people but what draws normal book buyers curiosity no doubt perhaps also its the seam of apocalyptic pessimism that runs through a lot of environmental advocacy from malthus to gore besides if one is wrestling with apocalypse there isnt much point in considering actual costs or policy consequences which in "without us" would appear rather extreme unto dust well return of course and the planet indeed will go on without us even so if were intent on reducing our "ecological footprint " it would be nice to envision a world where there are still footprints
