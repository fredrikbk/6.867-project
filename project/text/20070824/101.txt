weekend journal sports on sports the king of string u s open racket tech works for amateurs too mr manns &# fix youd have a tough time getting lance armstrongs mechanic to tune up your trek or skier bode millers wax man to sharpen your rossignols but tennis is different as the u s open kicks off monday racket technician roman prokes will be spending hours a day at the billie jean king tennis center in queens n y tuning frames and stretching strings for star clients like maria sharapova and andy roddick mr prokes is part of a small clique of top end racket technicians who also do business outside the professional ranks for &# to &# they will consult with recreational players and make specific modifications to their rackets to help them improve most amateurs of course choose a racket by swinging it for five minutes at the sports authority whats unusual about this is that top athletes in most sports tend to lock up their coaches and equipment tuners to prevent them from working for competitors and thus the general public as well the tradition in tennis is that so long as their racket needs are met elite players are content to share after hearing about mr prokess shop rpny tennis in manhattan alan mann a year old insurance broker who plays four or five times a week signed up for a personal consultation mr prokes helped mr mann sort through the hundreds of frames on the market and after trying a handful settled on the wilson ncode mr prokes then began modifying the racket to fit mr manns game precisely using lead tape lead pellets and a digital scale to make sure the grips weight and balance of each of the rackets he bought were identical mr mann says the service and the advice which cost about &# helped immensely "until i met roman i thought i knew what i was doing " he says there are several other racket techs who work for both pros and weekend warriors most of whom will ship orders by mail nate ferguson who counts roger federer and novak djokovic among his clients does work for amateurs through his company priority one in tampa fla warren bosworth of bosworth tennis in boca raton fla builds frames for martina navratilova in addition to handling amateurs prices are in general in line with most tennis shops anywhere from &# to &# for a stringing job to as much as &# for more radical tweaks like balancing and grip modifications for amateur clients who make up of his business mr prokes says he tries to take on the role of a sommelier explaining the menu of adjustments everything from changing string tension to altering the rackets length and how they interact to affect the way a racket performs alison hashmall a former varsity player for princeton university whos now in law school says mr prokes was invaluable after wilson decided to discontinue the racket she had been using for years "i hit the ball really flat so if anything is off slightly and i can feel it if the strings are a pound off it affects my game in a big way " she says mr prokes advised her to switch to a babolat racket to help improve her serve he then strung it with a mixture of gut and polyester strings to help her better control the ball when she played in england for cambridge university he strung her rackets specifically for the soggy english climate with ms hashmalls mother carrying them over during visits "im not a pro " ms hashmall says "but the right racket and the right string job make a huge difference " about three years ago at the suggestion of his teaching pro todd ehren a year old electrical supplies salesman visited mr prokes to see whether the racket tech could help him add power to his shots mr ehren an amateur who is nationally ranked by the u s tennis association in the and over age group says he expected mr prokes to loosen his string tension and make the frame a bit heavier but mr prokes surprised him by advising that he switch from synthetic gut strings to stiffer grippier luxilon to help him harness his power by generating more topspin mr ehren says he spends about &# a year on various services from mr prokes "if it improves your game thats tremendous value " he says "you get what you pay for " for his pro clients mr prokes says the usual challenge isnt to help them decide what sort of racket they need but to craft one that complements their playing style more closely while meeting their exacting standards three years ago reigning u s open champion maria sharapova decided to change her racket to compensate for the extra power shed been generating she asked mr prokes who had been working with her for years to help her find a new racket after consulting with prince her sponsor mr prokes prepared about a dozen rackets for a field test on the court ms sharapova rejected model after model hitting a few balls with each before zeroing in on a flaw then she picked up a heavier prince white whacked a few balls and declared "thats it " the difference between ms sharapovas choice and the also rans "maybe two grams " mr prokes says "there are variables with every racket and if of them are the same a player like sharapova will zero in on the one thats just a little bit different " early this week as the u s open players began arriving at the national tennis center mr prokes and the dozen stringers hes handpicked are hard at work at the stringing center wilson is running at the tournament with an ipod playing classic rock just above a whisper the room is filled with the sounds of stringing the clicks of rackets being mounted and the sounds of gut being pulled through the plastic grommets of a frame when a racket is finished the techs slip it into a plastic bar coded bag and seal it with a rubber band during the open mr prokess team will string rackets at a cost to each player of &# each plus the cost of the string unlike recreational players who often wait until a string breaks to get a racket restrung professional tennis players will use a freshly strung racket for each half hour practice session and then send it back for a fresh set during a match many players will change rackets with every nine game ball change with the slightly tighter racket offering better control of the livelier balls they tend to switch when their opponent is serving so that theyll have the time to get used to the tighter strings before they have to serve when he first began running the stringing center mr prokes says it was located in a windowless basement it has since been moved to a former child care area near the players lounge here stringers toil at identical work stations with wilson stringing machines that are calibrated every morning to within a fraction of a pound since the center serves all tournament players the goal is to treat everyone equally rackets from french open champ rafael nadal get the same treatment as rackets for low ranked qualifiers "theres no secret formula " mr prokes says "but if the tension is a pound off players can tell if theres too much ink on the stencil players can tell " when it comes to the pros who are also his private clients the list includes mr roddick ms sharapova and the now retired andre agassi the consultations are usually short most of these players know exactly what they want in a racket and arent interested in experimenting a pro who is used to playing with a white sweat absorbing overgrip may not want to use a blue one for fear the color might change the "feel" of the racket mr prokes says his job is to make his work all but invisible "you cant be thinking about your racket in the middle of a match " he says nonetheless pros do sometimes lean on his expertise at the u s open monday morning ivan ljubicic of croatia the worlds no ranked player and a client of mr prokess stops by for a prepractice consultation he mimics reaching wide for a backhand "when i stretch for my slice the racket doesnt help me " he explains mr prokes suggests a three point plan to increase power and control by using a hybrid string pattern that combines supple and springy natural gut with a stiff polyester to add more "trampoline effect" and compensate for the muggy august air by lowering the string tension by about two pounds and to add some weight to the frame by applying three grams of lead tape after arranging to meet mr ljubicic on the practice court at noon for a testing session mr prokes puts aside a racket he had started for andy roddick to focus on the rush order "i cant afford to have a favorite racket " mr ljubicic says explaining his unusual tendency to tweak "theres too much money at stake "
