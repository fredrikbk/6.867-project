iraq surge yields mixed results intelligence report finds some gains in security but little political progress washington a new intelligence assessment sees some security improvements from the recent military surge in central iraq but little political progress giving fodder to both parties as they head into a pivotal month on the iraq debate "there have been measurable but uneven improvements in iraqs security situation " says the report which comes eight months after the last such assessment that meshes with other anecdotal evidence suggesting some areas of iraq have become less violent in recent weeks especially sunni areas west of baghdad a case republicans have been pushing strongly about troops have been added in recent months the assessment of political disarray and sectarian strife in iraq echoes a theme democrats have used in seeking a u s troop withdrawal the report stated "iraqs political leaders remain unable to govern effectively " that the countrys sectarian divisions remain "unreconciled " and that the current government of prime minister nouri al maliki "will become more precarious over the next six to months" because of deep internal divisions for the bush administration the risk is that the shaky political situation overshadows military progress in the coming debate in congress over funding current troop levels sen john warner of virginia the top republican on the armed services committee brushed aside reports of military progress yesterday in arguing that the slow pace of political reforms is one reason to get out he called on the president to start bringing large numbers of u s troops back by the end of the year "i say to the president respectfully pick whatever number you wish " mr warner told reporters "you do not want to lose the momentum but certainly in plus say could begin to redeploy and be home to their families and loved ones no later than christmas of this year " the senator who has been skeptical of the surge but has held off openly challenging the bush administration on it said his announcement would send a "sharp and clear" message to the iraqi government that u s patience is running out democratic critics of the war jumped on the report to buttress their arguments for a withdrawal the report "underscores the fundamental truth that we cannot continue to substitute the bravery of our troops for a true commitment from the iraqi government to resolve the grievances at the heart of their civil war " said democratic sen barack obama of illinois in a statement in a sign of how contentious the next months debate will be house minority leader john boehner r ohio said in a statement that "the fact that democratic leaders continue to push for precipitous withdrawal despite the significant progress our troops are making shows just how deeply invested they are in failure " ultimately the outcome lies with the views of wavering lawmakers whose sentiments arent yet clear conservative democrats from areas where support for the war remains relatively high and moderate republicans whose doubts havent convinced them to break with president bush some conservative democrats unlike their leaders in the house and senate have suggested in recent days that security improvements might be enough to tip them toward supporting present troop levels into next year at the same time lawmakers across the spectrum agree troop levels are virtually certain to start declining in the first half of as troop rotations require that some forces come home yesterdays estimate which represents the combined judgment of all u s intelligence agencies comes weeks before a report to congress from gen david petraeus the top u s commander in iraq and the u s ambassador ryan crocker their highly anticipated report also is expected to give a mixed review of progress in iraq it will play a big role in determining how long the surge lasts commanders in iraq including gen petraeus likely will recommend that the surge continue through winter or spring the army then must reduce the size of its force to pre surge levels of about troops or extend army tours beyond months to maintain current levels administration officials have committed to not extending soldiers tours beyond the current months besides reporting some progress by u s troops in improving safety and security yesterdays report concludes iraqi security forces "have performed adequately" but "have not improved enough to conduct major operations" without the assistance of u s forces overall the estimate largely tiptoes around making any political judgments or wading too deeply into the political debate republican lawmakers said the report offered further evidence that the surge was working and should continue and that backing away could be disastrous to the region the estimate says any move to shift u s forces away from counterinsurgency and stabilization to focus on fighting terrorists a move many democrats and other war critics support "would erode security gains achieved thus far " the report largely reflects both the hopes and frustrations of senior officers in baghdad many of them say the surge has been effective in reducing the violence but cant succeed unless iraqs political leaders are willing and able to take advantage of the lull in violence and begin to reconcile brig gen vincent brooks who oversees governance and economic development for the baghdad based st cavalry division said it was too soon to tell whether iraqi politicians would seize the opportunities provided by the surge "the next days will determine the course that could go naturally in the direction we want it to go or it will go in a direction we are not satisfied with " gen brooks said
