weekend journal taste houses of worship a religious split susan rosenfelds marriage wasnt what youd call romantic she was thrown up against a wall doused with a bucket of cold water in bed and toward the end became her husbands punching bag "since i wear long sleeves no one really knew " she says looking back ms rosenfeld regrets keeping the abuse a secret but "in the jewish community you dont call the police on your husband " in her mid s ms rosenfeld hopes to remarry and build a new life for herself but as an orthodox jew a civil divorce is not sufficient for ms rosenfeld to be officially released from her vows her husband has to grant her a jewish bill of divorce called a get the document which certifies the termination of the marriage the aramaic text declares "you are hereby permitted to marry any man" not only allows women to remarry but ensures that future children will not be deemed mamzerim bastards able to marry only other mamzerim two years have passed and ariel hacohen ms rosenfelds husband has refused to grant her the get this makes ms rosenfeld an aguna literally an anchored woman trapped in a dead marriage in the th century a rabbinic court might have sentenced mr hacohen to flogging while according to jewish law the get must be given without coercion the jewish philosopher maimonides justified flogging as merely beating the evil inclination out of the recalcitrant husband reminding him of his own desire to do the right thing procuring a get used to be easier than it is today rabbi mendel epstein a legal advocate in new york rabbinic courts explains that in th century europe if a man refused to comply the pressures of social ostracism would overwhelm him "today he can just pick himself up and move to another community " not only was there less mobility in the tight knit communities but divorce almost never occurred women became agunot most often as a result of husbands who went to gather firewood and never came back today in israel where there is no distinction between civil and religious divorce law advocates estimate that there are cases of women refused divorces but in the u s orthodoxy has no centralized legal body so the number of agunot is impossible to calculate but its clear that the problem is acute every advocacy organization i spoke to had a backlog of dozens of cases disputes rage over who can fairly be classified as an aguna what methods are appropriate when dealing with recalcitrant husbands and most significantly when and if orthodox rabbis will reform this broken system dr susan aranoff a prominent advocate on behalf of agunot and a professor of economics at kingsborough community college argues that the refusal to change betrays the spirit of judaism "i think in general the orthodox rabbinate today is insecure and they have a fear of creativity in jewish law " there is a way around the get trap annulment rabbi michael broyde a law professor at emory university and a member of the beit din of america one of the largest rabbinic courts argues that cases where annulment is appropriate are extremely rare and include sexual incapacity "the more core the defect is to a marital relationship the easier it is to prove annulment " says rabbi broyde the challenge is proving that the defect was present at the time of marriage and that "had one party or another known about it they wouldnt have entered into the marriage " he says ms rosenfeld can get her marriage annulled on the grounds that she didnt know about her husbands violent temper when they were married but few orthodox men would be willing to date a woman with an annulled marriage still there arent many other options at this point four months of trying to convince the rabbi who performed ms rosenfelds marriage to persuade her husband to grant her a divorce went nowhere ms rosenfeld is more than willing to go to rabbinic court where a panel of three rabbis would hear the case she spent months trying to get her husband to appear at such a hearing but while there are many reputable rabbinic courts the only one her husband will go to is notorious for allowing extortion josh ross who heads the organization for the resolution of agunot which has held several rallies on behalf of ms rosenfeld tells me that in these rabbinic courts "the wife has to give up almost everything she is really entitled to in order to obtain the get " while ms rosenfeld is held hostage mr hacohen can go about his life as usual he can even remarry another woman without giving ms rosenfeld the get and his children would not be deemed mamzerim ms rosenfeld remains committed to god and judaism "even the thought of not eating kosher wouldnt enter into my mind because this is who i am " but she has lost faith with the rabbinate "i can fill the room with hundreds and hundreds of rabbis who will all say were so sorry but theres nothing we can do " ms weiss was a robert l bartley fellow at the journal this summer see related letters "letters to the editor ties that bind orthodox women to despair" wsj sept
