the subprime lending lesson buyer beware i find it hard to sympathize with the montes family home security one familys journey into a subprime trap aug they are at risk of losing the house they "bought" two years ago but they have never paid a penny in equity either at the time of purchase or in subsequent mortgage payments that doesnt say "bought" to me that says "rented " what they are calling a disaster is the possibility that they might have to walk away from something in which they have invested nothing and go back to renting something more affordable granted there are plenty of villains here including a ridiculously inflated home market that would ever make that tiny house worth close to &# a taxing authority that cashes in on that inflation to the tune of &# in property taxes a year and a lending industry that is willing to make loans to people on houses they clearly cannot afford the monteses were paying about of their gross income to start with and it could only get worse in two years who seriously believes that a family making &# a year with no savings can afford a &# house still the monteses didnt have to be financial geniuses to know what they were getting into i suspect their attitude two years ago was lets give it a shot and hope housing inflation bails us out and if not we can always walk away and go back to where we were what they are calling a disaster is wishful thinking not coming true glen hoffing shamong n j i feel bad for the monteses these people and many others were sold a pretty package and had no clue what they were getting into sadly there will be a lot more of these stories john hamel foxborough mass if i understand the situation highlighted in the article correctly the monteses knew enough about the loan to be concerned and apprehensive about the potential increase in monthly payments at the time of the readjustment but now they imply that the broker misled them about the terms and assured them they could refinance as tough as it is on the individuals involved at what point do we require people to take responsibility for their actions and decisions the worst thing that can happen is any type of government bailout that will just increase peoples belief that they can make risky decisions and not have to face the consequences i relate it to the government going in and paying for replenishing beaches and repairing homes on the coast after a storm hits why wouldnt people continue to build right on the shore if they believe the government will pay for any damage the market will continue to work to find a proper balance between risks and rewards as will individuals if the government does not step in to try to force a "solution" with unintended consequences john buckley lincroft n j twenty one years ago i bought a five room suburban house for &# with an income of &# because i did not qualify for a fixed rate i obtained a one year adjustable loan and put down &# with proceeds from a previous house sale at the time the bank would qualify me for a maximum of of my income for the monthly payment i had no car loan or outstanding debt and knew i could make the payments even when my rate increased the following two years no matter what we buy in this society we are always encouraged to "spend more" by the salesperson it is the responsibility of the buyers to understand their own finances and what they can and cannot afford paula alley boston see related letter "letters to the editor a buyer beware form for mortgage borrowers" wsj sept
