politics &amp economics musharraf rivals circle near election amid new u s demands pakistans president finds his hold on power slipping the next month should determine whether pakistans president gen pervez musharraf a key ally in the u s s war on terror can hang on to power or will be swept aside by the forces arraying against him gen musharraf is trying to win another five year term as president despite his plummeting popularity in pakistan early negotiations over a power sharing agreement with a chief rival former prime minister benazir bhutto appear to have stalled and the u s wants bolder action against islamic militants in return for its billions of dollars in military and economic aid even though any decline in american support could doom gen musharrafs government "making policy regarding musharrafs pakistan is like open heart surgery while the patient is still conscious " says stephen p cohen of the washington based brookings institution and an author of "the idea of pakistan " "it will have to be done with great care and delicacy qualities that have not characterized u s policy towards him in the past " gen musharraf years old must call presidential elections between sept and oct according to the constitution a senior government official says the third week of september is likely the presidential vote is taken by an electoral college comprising national parliamentarians and state legislators that vote also sets the stage for general parliamentary elections later this year or early in the party that wins the most seats chooses the prime minister only a few months ago gen musharraf was expected to win the presidential election easily his main source of political support the pakistan muslim league quaid e azam claims it still has enough votes to re elect him "we dont see any problem in his re election " says mohammed ali durrani federal minister for information but new snags have surfaced that threaten his political authority just yesterday pakistans supreme court ruled that former prime minister nawaz sharif a musharraf foe could return home mr sharif ousted by a military coup led by gen musharraf in october was sent to exile in saudi arabia in ahsan iqbal a spokesman for mr sharifs political party says mr sharif will return to pakistan soon before the presidential vote the supreme court is also expected to weigh in on several petitions challenging gen musharrafs legal right to campaign for president while serving as head of the army these petitions filed by political opponents contend that the constitution bars this dual role the supreme court backed an amendment to the constitution that allowed gen musharraf to hold both posts during his current term he has said he plans to hold both posts if he is re elected "uniform has a legal force " gen musharraf told some members of parliament last week but some predict the supreme court will now disagree "the law is very clear on this issue and there is absolutely no possibility of a court ruling in his favor " said iqbal haider a former federal law minister indeed relations between the president and the top court have deteriorated sharply in the past year while many of the supreme courts judges earlier provided legal cover for gen musharrafs dual role as army chief and president the court recently has struck a much more independent stance it has ordered the release of dozens of people detained by intelligence services for years without trial and accepted a case investigating possible graft around the privatization of a steel company in march gen musharraf tried ultimately without success to oust the courts chief justice if the supreme court says he cant serve in both roles in a new term gen musharraf may face a catch relinquish army control and undermine his own standing as pakistans strongman or impose martial law and risk massive protests gen musharraf flirted with the less draconian state of emergency this month before deciding against it according to senior cabinet ministers who declined to be named also weighing on gen musharraf the armys own declining popularity for its heavy handed role in both politics and business "ultimately an agreement will have to be reached between the army and whatever civilian leadership will emerge " says frederic grare a visiting scholar at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington "this is what is really at stake at the moment " in a sign of how sentiment toward the army has turned initial praise for dislodging militants from an islamabad mosque in july has given way to questions as to how mr musharrafs government allowed a seminary in pakistans capital to become a bunker for islamic militants a recent poll conducted by dawn news a private pakistani television network showed that more than of the respondents across pakistan thought it was time for gen musharraf to go against who wanted him to stay a year ago gen musharraf enjoyed approval ratings as high as as the nation rode rapid economic growth thanks to increased foreign investment and a government privatization program in the year ended june the country received a record &# billion in foreign direct investment the failed attempt to dismiss the chief justice isnt all thats hurting gen musharraf many pakistanis complain about deteriorating law and order a rise in islamic militancy in the northwest frontier province and in urban areas and a failure to improve education and health to counter criticism gen musharraf is taking his case to the people in a weekly television program in which he addresses political economic and social questions from audience members in a recent episode he conceded his support has fallen he also said that the political uncertainty was slowing foreign investment in the country if the presidential election is held and gen musharraf wins a second term he will have gained an endorsement of sorts but he may not be home free one challenge is getting the public to accept a vote in which the president remains army chief another is dealing with the potential return of two political foes ms bhutto and mr sharif their two opposition parties both hope to make gains in the parliamentary elections the power sharing negotiations between gen musharraf and ms bhutto are over a deal that could take effect if ms bhuttos party wins the most parliamentary seats putting her in line to become prime minister say senior officials in gen musharrafs government
