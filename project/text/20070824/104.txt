weekend journal taste prof in a box youve seen their ads many times particularly if you read any serious political or cultural magazines you cant miss the boldface come ons "witness the glory of shakespeare " in national review "follow the story of lost christianities " in the wilson quarterly "enrich your music listening skills and learn the language of music " in the new republic a recent economist featured a full page ad for "whos who in the evolution of western medicine " other typical subjects range from "particle physics for non physicists" to "the art of the northern renaissance " the source of these promises and of the dvds audio cds and tapes created to deliver on them is the teaching company of chantilly va an outfit begun years ago by a capitol hill attorney named thomas rollins after some rocky early years the company has grown steadily to become the colossus of its field the countrys leading publisher of proprietary university level courses for home use with more than courses already available and new ones being added almost daily now including a line of courses directed at high school and homeschooled students and with all of them taught by reputable and often quite talented lecturers the teaching company has become a serious force in american education such was evidently the opinion of brentwood associates a well heeled private equity investment firm in los angeles which acquired the company last october for an undisclosed but presumably handsome sum clearly mr rollins deserves enormous credit for having the vision and fortitude to make such a success but something else was needed a business innovation succeeds by serving needs that existing institutions fail to address in this case the needs were simple but profound ordinary americans deeply felt love of learning and earnest desire for self improvement h l mencken liked to jibe that "no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american people " but the teaching companys success offers evidence for the opposite proposition that one can build a successful business by appealing to the intelligence of the american people but are the courses any good the teaching company counts among its customers the likes of bill gates orrin hatch bruce hornsby and well me yes i and members of my family have been using its products for at least five years now listening to lectures in roman history while driving to work exploring the new testament or james joyces "ulysses" while walking the dogs redressing my woefully deficient knowledge of the history of art by viewing entertaining and lavishly illustrated lectures after dinner ive even taken a busmans holiday with the teaching company watching tapes of master teachers giving lectures in my own field in order to improve my own classroom performance so these courses offer a constructive way to fill up the empty times of commuting exercising and the like but there is more to their appeal than that as the generations of post s college graduates grow older they will come to understand that their expensive formal education with its trendiness and lack of breadth or rigor or enduring substance quite simply failed them by failing to connect them to the riches of their own civilization not all of them will be content to leave matters at that and so the market for the teaching companys products will only continue to expand but are such products and the copycat courses and lectures increasingly being offered by universities such as berkeley and stanford not to mention the various forms of "distance learning" used to extend the reach of educational institutions really a substitute for the classroom isnt something important lost by the absence of the institution and the teacher call me self interested for saying so but of course there is it explains why many of the same people who love teaching company products also when their schedules permit go back to school i often see such older "returning" students in night classes at my university and count it a privilege to work with them unlike the younger students they are not there because they have to be their unfeigned passion for knowledge and self improvement their heightened stake in the material under study are inspiring and infectious they come with motives deeper and more complicated than a mere desire to acquire organized and accredited knowledge about a subject if that were all education was about then yes dvds and distance learning would soon supplant the classroom but they want something more intangible than that they come to school seeking some kind of renewal hoping for a chance to better themselves to pursue their deferred dream or their unexplored interests or just to move beyond the constraints of their current lives and perhaps learn what they didnt pick up the first time around thats what the university represents for them and it reflects a very american faith in human possibility and one of the chief things that they come to class for is something that a tape or a tv or even the best virtual connection cannot ever provide the bodily presence of others it is one thing to listen alone to a videotaped lecture it is quite another to hear the same subject expounded by a flesh and blood human being standing there before you someone responsive to your questions attentive to your particular concerns capable of cracking jokes about the events of the day someone with the full range of human quirks and oddities and yet also someone for whom the subject forms a living and present reality and with whom you can have a personal relationship there is an electricity in the sheer human presence that draws us in as every theatergoer or churchgoer knows in ways that can be only remotely approximated by televised or online content that electricity is generated not merely by ones teacher but also by the presence of ones fellow students whose company makes the classroom into a community of sorts that experience of connection with others in the disinterested pursuit of knowledge is one of lifes great pleasures and it is a considerable part of what students are searching for when they return i only wish that they found it more often than they do all honor then to the teaching company for doing what it does providing americans with things that they do not get elsewhere let traditional educational institutions take respectful note of their new competitors success and learn the right lessons from it rather than sneer they should instead respond intelligently to the challenge acknowledging that higher education has served its clientele poorly rather than imitate the teaching company by seeking to digitize and standardize and commodify ever more of their own offerings colleges and universities should instead build on their comparative advantages and focus on the humanizing effects that they uniquely can impart and work to impart them better mr mcclay is a
