win lose for the nyse thain meets some goals but stocks slide stings volatility hurts so good these should be the best of times for nyse euronext recent market volatility has people trading in record numbers on the new york stock exchange the combination of the big board and euronext has given the company a foothold in europe making it the envy of other exchange operators longtime rival nasdaqs quest for the london stock exchange has been a flop yet nyse euronext stock is down during the past three months and this year shares of the company and its predecessor archipelago holdings inc performed strongly in and but have trailed stocks of other exchange operators this year the chicago board options exchanges index of publicly traded u s exchange operators has declined only during the past three months and has risen so far this year the nyses stock price slide is a bitter pill for chief executive john thain the former goldman sachs executive who took over the exchange in and has overhauled the firms operations under his leadership the nyse has expanded into europe and pushed into faster growing products such as futures contracts and stock options mr thain has also been praised for spinning off a chunk of the nyses regulatory apparatus which allows it to focus almost exclusively on its trading operations and he has made it clear he wants to buy a u s derivatives exchange which would complement operations by adding a u s futures business to euronexts liffe derivatives market the problem for mr thain is that these initiatives are expensive and some investors are nervous about the short term pain required to achieve these lofty goals "we are building the business for the long term " said nelson chai the nyses chief financial officer analysts see the gap "theres a disparity" at nyse says edward ditmire an analyst at boutique brokerage firm fox pitt kelton while mr ditmire applauds mr thains strategic moves he says "sometimes what makes for a stronger company doesnt make for a stronger stock " of the analysts who cover the nyse he is one of nine with a "hold" rating on the stock according to thomson financial also weighing on mr thain is that the nyse has seen a market share decline in trading of u s stocks one of its core businesses because of increased electronic competition and new securities rules that aid upstarts compounding this are investor worries that rapid trading hedge funds that rely heavily on computer models might trade less after suffering losses in recent weeks the nyse is watching this carefully as even giants like goldman sachs groups global alpha fund and renaissance technologies corp have been stung in the recent credit crunch that has driven the stock market lower for now though the turmoil in the markets has been a boon during the past two months average trading activity on its u s stock systems approached a record three billion shares a day this month the nyse is on pace to beat that record as its average daily trading activity has been above four billion shares that has helped raise analysts earnings estimates to cents a share from cents a share two months ago nyse makes much of its revenue on tiny transaction fees charged on each share or contract traded "the volatility in the marketplace has been good for us " mr chai said "we get paid on volume and recently weve seen record volume " the best case scenario for nyse including its often overlooked european stock and derivatives business would be for continued volatility but if there is a protracted bear market nyse could see a volume decline because investors tend to flee markets and cut back on their trading when times get tough according to nyse data average daily trading volume has declined in four years since and and all those years followed rough periods for stocks the other big concern for nyse stock is that it will pay too much to grow bigger in the u s derivatives market a goal of mr thains nyse has held discussions in recent weeks with nymex holdings inc operator of the big energy and metals market the new york mercantile exchange while most investors understand the strategy of buying nymex they might not like the price tag recently waddell &amp reed portfolio manager ryan caldwell visited nyse president duncan niederauer who asked mr caldwell why he thought nyse stock was suffering according to mr caldwell mr caldwell said he was concerned about both the nyses ability to hit earnings targets and a potentially pricey deal nyse shares rose seven cents yesterday to &# an nyse spokesman declined to comment saying he couldnt reach mr niederauer
