weekend journal the wealth report living large while being green rich buy offsets for wasteful ways noble or guilt fee its not easy being green especially if youre rich with their growing fleets of yachts jets and cars and their sprawling estates todays outsized wealthy have also become outsized polluters there are now private jets swarming american skies all burning more than times as much fuel per passenger as commercial planes the summer seas are increasingly crowded with megayachts swallowing up to gallons of fuel an hour yet with the green movement in vogue the rich are looking for ways to compensate for their carbon dioxide generation which is linked to global warming without crimping their style some are buying carbon "offsets" for their private jet flights which help fund alternate energy technologies such as windmills or carbon dioxide eating greenery such as trees others are installing ocean monitoring equipment on their yachts and a few are building green certified mansions complete with solar heated indoor swimming pools some people say the measures are a noble effort on the part of the wealthy to improve the environment eric carlson executive director and founder of the carbon fund a nonprofit that works with companies and individuals to offset emissions says the wealthy are taking the lead in alternative energy markets such as solar technologies just as they take the lead in consumer markets "obviously these people have different lifestyles from yours or mine " mr carlson says "at the same time theyre not obligated to do anything we praise those who are doing things were trying to get to a market where the superwealthy are leaders in reducing their carbon dioxide footprint and playing a major role in changing this market " others say the efforts are little more than window dressing designed to ease the guilt of the wealthy or boost their status among an increasingly green elite environmentalists say that if the rich really wanted to help the environment they would stop flying on private jets live in smaller homes and buy kayaks instead of yachts "carbon offsets and these other things are feel good solutions " says lester brown founder and president of the earth policy institute "im always interested in people who buy a carbon offset for their jet to fly between their four big homes these kinds of programs postpone more meaningful action " either way an increasing number of companies are launching programs designed to help the rich live large while staying green jets com a private jet service plans to start a program in early september in partnership with the carbon fund after they take a trip customers will get a statement on their bills telling them how much carbon dioxide their flight emitted and what it would cost to buy offsets from the fund the offsets are a bargain compared with the flights a round trip private jet flight between fort lauderdale fla and boston costs about &# the offsets for the metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted would cost about &# the company says v jets international a jet charter company rolled out its "green card" program that it says accentuates "the positive effect your flight emissions will have on the environment " the company calculates the total emissions from the trip and then buys a carbon offset from the carbon fund "from a jet perspective we have a responsibility to look after the damage that these planes do " says andrew zarrow vs president the company also has created technologies designed to make flights more efficient by selling seats on "deadleg" trips flights that are returning empty from one way trips yacht companies also are getting into the act trinity yachts a gulfport miss builder this month announced it will pay for part of the cost of installing special oceanographic and atmospheric monitoring systems in all of its new boats the system called the seakeeper measures water temperatures and salinity as well as air temperature and wind speed the data are sent to scientists who monitor the earths oceans trinitys program is in partnership with international sea keepers a nonprofit marine conservation group founded by a group of yacht owners concerned about the environment "the caliber of client we have is very aware of whats going on in the environment " says william s smith iii vice president of trinity yachts still the system doesnt reduce emissions from the yachts themselves which can burn hundreds of gallons of fuel a day some wealthy people are going green with their houses too the u s green building council has certified at least three mansions for being leaders in environmental design including one owned by ted turners daughter laura turner seydel and her husband rutherford in atlanta the square foot plus house called ecomanor is equipped with photovoltaic panels on the roof rainwater collecting tanks for supplying toilet water and "gray water" systems that use water from the showers and sinks for the lawn and gardens the top of the house is insulated with a soy based foam that is more efficient than fiberglass the home has energy monitors and a switch near the door that turns off every light in the house before the family leaves mr seydel says the couples energy bill is about half that of comparable homes while he acknowledges they could have built a slightly smaller house he said all the space is well used between kids and visiting friends and in laws "the wealthy have always been the early adapters to technology " he says "im hoping that we can pave the way and show that you can have something thats luxurious that also makes a lot of sense from an energy and convenience point of view "
