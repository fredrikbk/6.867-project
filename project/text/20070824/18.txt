at least six years according to people familiar with the situation the agreement announced late wednesday creates an alliance that analysts say should allow countrywide to cope with a credit crunch that has made it hard for countrywide and other mortgage lenders to raise short term funds it also puts bank of america in position to draw on countrywides expertise as the nations biggest mortgage

suggesting a measure of calm is returning to the markets the stock market began the day higher on the news that bank of america would buy a big countrywide stake the deal was widely viewed as a move to boost the confidence of stock and bond investors fretting about the financial health of countrywide which makes or funds about one of every six u s home mortgages then both countrywide chief executive officer angelo mozilo and thornburg mortgage inc president larry goldstone told cnbc they fear a recession stocks fell on the news then rallied late in the afternoon amid continuing hopes that the federal reserve will cut interest rates on or before its sept policy meeting short term treasury bills whose prices had soared as panicky investors flocked to their relative safety last week and early this week continued their retreat as investors gradually unwound moves that had cut their risk exposure countrywide has been struggling the past few weeks to persuade investors that it can weather a crisis of confidence in the credit markets that has left it and other mortgage lenders scrambling for short term funding for bank of america the deal cements its emergence in the top tier of u s banks along with having the most branches and customers the charlotte n c bank has attained a prominence alongside its traditional new york rivals in other ways such as its current role in helping to steady the financial system bank of america agreed to acquire shares of countrywides preferred stock that is convertible to about million common shares at &# apiece for a stake of to the preferred stock carries an annual dividend yield of a hefty return for bank of america that is more than double the yield of to on convertible countrywide securities sold to investors three months ago before anxiety over the financial health of mortgage lenders reached a fever pitch said frederick cannon an analyst at keefe bruyette &amp woods based on yesterdays closing price for countrywide stock band of america has a paper profit of about &# million or on its &# billion investment the high yielding preferred stock is an expensive source of capital for countrywide said howard shapiro an analyst at fox pitt kelton ltd but bank of america is a "credible partner" that was able to act fast "there arent too many people who can write a check for &# billion" after a few days of talks he said adding "this keeps countrywide in the game over the long term " although countrywide didnt formally go door to door seeking an investment the mortgage company had a number of discussions with its lenders in recent weeks "everyone was talking to them and it was clear that they were receptive to ideas " said one person with knowledge of the situation the investment will allow countrywide "to get through the immediate crisis " said paul j miller an analyst at friedman billings ramsey &amp co in a research note but he said the calabasas calif company still will have to slash its lending in the face of a retreat by investors from loans considered risky and that will cause earnings to plunge in the near term mr miller said countrywide may have to recognize losses of &# billion to &# billion in the value of loans in its pipeline that it aims to sell to investors once market conditions improve mr mozilo said in an interview late wednesday that the two companies had no plan to merge but would pursue possible collaboration in the mortgage business countrywide has roughly employees nearly branch offices for mortgage loans and a stock market value of about &# billion bank of america has nearly employees branches and a market capitalization of &# billion second only to citigroup inc among banks bank of america chairman and chief executive officer kenneth d lewis flew to california in the past week to visit with mr mozilo according to people familiar with their talks bank of america executives had been looking through countrywides books but hadnt had a chance to do the full "due diligence" research they would for a normal deal in the interview with cnbc yesterday mr mozilo said bank of america contacted countrywide and "said they would like to help " mr lewis had first talked to mr mozilo about possible cooperation roughly six years ago shortly after mr lewis became ceo according to mike mcmahon a private investor and former investment analyst who has known mr mozilo more than years mr mcmahon said he has been told that mr lewis sought advice from mr mozilo on bank of americas mortgage business and that mr mozilo suggested "outsourcing" the back office functions of making and servicing home loans to countrywide while using bank of americas name and branch network to market those loans to the public though those talks didnt produce an agreement mr mcmahon said such an outsourcing deal would still make sense the home mortgage business lurches from boom to bust every few years requiring lenders to boost staffing quickly for good times and lay off people amid tougher periods a balancing act that can be tough for a company such as bank of america that isnt focused on mortgages countrywides computer technology also is considered a big plus in holding down loan origination and servicing costs bank of america and countrywide have talked occasionally since that early ceo contact according to people familiar with the relationship among other things they say countrywide has approached bank of america several times about the possibility of taking over that banks mortgage servicing business which involves collecting payments handling foreclosures and other administrative tasks one of the most serious discussions came last year when alvaro g de molina bank of americas chief financial officer at the time flew out to meet with mr mozilo the two sides discussed a joint venture perhaps using countrywides loan processing technology in bank of americas branches though the discussions didnt get far rumors spread to the market in january when word of the talks was reported by the financial times late that month countrywide was trading at around &# a share mr lewis was annoyed by the persistent rumors and played down the likelihood of any deal in answer to a countrywide related question at a january citigroup conference he told investors he had never been in a successful joint venture and described an earlier agreement with securities firm dean witter as "an unmitigated disaster " mr lewis also said he likes the mortgage product but not the business which involves selling a competitive commodity product and managing tricky relationships with a variety of partners in originating processing and selling loans mr lewis said he would rather sell more mortgages through bank of america branches to draw customers and get them to do more business with his bank bank of america grew to its size by aggressively taking over competitors mr lewis went to work just out of college at what was then north carolina national bank commonly known as ncnb and went on to help lead more than takeovers in a culture that fed on beating out the other guy now that bank of america has become a top retail bank though mr lewis has become increasingly aware of his role in setting the tone for u s business he saw countrywide as a victim of irrational fear as banks growing reluctance to extend credit to weakened mortgage companies rapidly threatened their ability to remain in business he also saw an opportunity to make money and the bank had ready cash &# billion amounts to roughly three weeks of its earnings still mr lewis is fiercely competitive and eager to best his rivals in announcing the deal wednesday bank of america one upped competitors citigroup j p morgan chase &amp co and wachovia corp which had joined his bank in jointly announcing they would bolster the mortgage market by borrowing from the federal reserves discount window mr lewis has often said bank of america doesnt get the respect it deserves and bristles that wall street still views citigroup and j p morgan as the stalwarts of u s banking bank of america gets first right of refusal if countrywide is ever put up for sale according to a regulatory filing by the latter company yesterday bank of america could also add two members to countrywides board if that company misses six consecutive dividend payments though that is considered unlikely at this point the deal left investors guessing whether the stake was a first step toward buying countrywide bank of america reached its scale by scooping up banks many of them in hardship predecessor ncnb kicked off the growth spree with the purchase of the remnants of firstrepublic bank of dallas what was once one of texass largest banks at the urging of federal regulators that deal gave it a backdoor to expansion in texas and thus interstate banking mr lewis then a rising star moved to texas to run the bank ncnb later made a &# million strategic investment in mnc financial inc of baltimore and quickly bought the distressed bank extending its reach up the east coast bank of america has made strategic investments in three international banks during mr lewiss tenure but has made no move to acquire them outright in a rare joint agreement it is trying a credit card venture with china construction bank of chinas big four lenders in which bank of america holds a stake perhaps the best model for the countrywide deal might be bank of americas agreement with checkfree holdings corp in bank of america then an also ran in online banking and bill paying took a stake in checkfree in exchange for checkfree taking over its online bill processing the deal guaranteed checkfree &# million of annual revenue and bolstered its position as a leading online bill processor bank of america sold its stake over time and has gradually been taking more of its processing in house checkfree is in the process of being acquired by fiserv inc but bank of america could use countrywides back office functions and technology if the companies reached an oft discussed joint agreement damian paletta and robin sidel contributed to this article
