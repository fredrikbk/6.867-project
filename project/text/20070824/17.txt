thing deborah wahl meyer never had to worry about the quality of the product but the year old detroit area native faces a much different challenge now that she is moving to chrysler like its detroit rivals general motors and ford motor chrysler has improved in quality but is struggling to overcome consumer perceptions that its vehicles arent as reliable as import brands "she has a wonderful background and toyota and lexus are great brands " says joe straub president of the straub chrysler jeep and straub dodge dealerships in bethlehem pa "the big concern is she isnt selling toyotas and lexuses so will her skills translate to our brands we have great products but were not known for great products " ms meyer will join chrysler on tuesday as chief marketing officer she follows george murphy who left his position as senior vice president of marketing at the end of may she is the second senior executive brought in at the auto maker since the company was acquired by cerberus capital management this month cerberus installed robert nardelli the former chief executive of home depot as chryslers ceo ms meyer says she plans to "look at our customer needs listen to our dealers and work with the team to focus our marketing approach" in hopes of building up chryslers three brands the aim to reach customers who typically dont consider the brands such as people who look to imports over domestic car brands her main challenge will be crafting a clear identity for the chrysler brand the jeep and dodge nameplates she says "have a lot of strength and equity in the market " dodges bold image and jeeps rugged reputation have made them the brands with the strongest identities in chryslers portfolio jeep has recently expanded its lineup beyond the traditional off roading models such as the wrangler to smaller sport utility vehicles such as the compass and patriot jeep also has a new campaign and tagline "have fun out there jeep" the first work from the brands new creative agency san francisco based cutwater a unit of omnicom group the auto maker has been trying to move chrysler to a more premium image but company officials have found that kind of change takes time to help in the effort chrysler recently launched a new marketing campaign with the tagline "engineered beautifully " ms meyers experience in the luxury field plays into that as well at lexus ms meyer recently led efforts to extend the luxury brands upscale image into the superluxury range with the launch of the redesigned ls flagship sedan and a new hybrid ls lexuss first model priced above &# she was in charge of a team that studied the super rich to see how they lived and what they wanted in a luxury vehicle chryslers marketing has faced other challenges last year its advertising was criticized by some dealers who felt that tv commercials didnt focus enough on product features especially for new models such as the dodge nitro suv dealers were also upset because of a production push that led to bloated inventory joe eberhardt chryslers former head of sales and marketing left the company in december since then chryslers former ceo and current president tom lasorda and steve landry executive vice president of sales and marketing have been working to repair relationships with dealers earlier this year chrysler reinstituted a large portion of the ad funding that was cut from a program known as the "california initiative " created in to help dealers win over customers in that crucial market chrysler also assigned a person from the creative team at omnicom groups bbdo chryslers main ad agency to work with california dealers on specific advertising for that region last year mr eberhardt had cut most of the funding for the california program clay james owner of huntington beach dodge in southern california says ms meyers experience with import brands and understanding of markets where imports dominate like california will help her at chrysler "sometimes people in detroit only see what is going on around them but she has a different perspective " mr james says ms meyer says one of the major lessons she learned at toyota and lexus was the importance of a solid partnership with dealers and she sees that as a priority at chrysler as well "my job is to help make them profitable " she says "good things happen after that " while at lexus ms meyer tripled the number of marketing events it held and tied the brand to other luxury names such as neiman marcus among the events a fashion show with vogue magazine at the pebble beach concours delegance classic car show in california and "taste of lexus" parties with gourmet cooking and test drives of lexus vehicles ms meyer says she will also look at nontraditional mediums for chryslers brands adding that jeep is already a "favorite with the younger generations who arent influenced by the same media as baby boomers " allen moznett general manager of the lexus dealership in newport beach calif says ms meyer brought a different perspective to lexus and helped elevate the brand when it came to nontraditional marketing "we followed suit and tried to do less traditional advertising and hold more events " mr moznett says that helped boost sales he says "so she was a big asset " ms meyer was part of the team at toyota that in developed a campaign built around the tagline "moving forward " which is still used today
