dont undersell geeks when it comes to american competitiveness regarding chester e finn jr and diane ravitchs op ed "not by geeks alone " aug the authors state the problem correctly elevating the importance of science technology engineering and math "stem" subjects above subjects like history and literature does american students no favors but the authors rationale is suspect at best and flat out wrong at worst they claim that only by ingesting heavy doses of the liberal arts can students become competitive enough in the global marketplace the liberal arts education they argue develops creative thinking which is a necessary ingredient of success the implication math "geeks" are going to miss out because they cannot think outside the box i couldnt disagree more taught properly math and science are bound to unlock the same potential for creativity that the authors see accessible only to those educated in the liberal arts the key of course is rewarding students not for bubbling in the right oval on a test sheet but for showing the steps they take to arrive at the answer use more essays fewer multiple choice exams tell students that getting the correct answer is not really important and tell them that their analysis is critical in other words reward thinking rather than guess work and rote memorization creativity will follow dennis murashko chicago the authors point out well the danger of overemphasizing education in technology engineering and math at the expense of the liberal arts in addition to "literature art music history civics and geography " they could and should have given more emphasis to the need for more education in the philosophical foundations of successful western societies just including "civics" among the liberal arts does not express that need strongly enough far too few students today are exposed to the thinking of montesquieu voltaire john locke adam smith john stuart mill the federalist papers and how the institutions of freedom private property and the market economy optimize the well being of both the individual and society donald marsh bainbridge island wash the piece by mr finn and ms ravitch exemplifies everything that is wrong with a liberal arts education that neglects exposure to stem subjects it is long on creative arguments and very short on facts here are a few of the facts our country has lagged all other industrialized nations in math and science proficiency for decades the u s continues to graduate three times as many liberal arts majors as we do stem majors even though stem majors have starting salaries higher the shortage of stem graduates is so acute that our nations technology companies have pleaded with congress for years to increase the number of hb visas so they can fill positions here rather than open new research and development centers abroad given these facts does it sound like we need to put more educational resources behind history and art or science and math what this country must have are the worlds best and brightest scientists and engineers researching developing and patenting tomorrows technologies something that will not be possible if we continue to delude ourselves that "liberal arts will make us competitive in the ways that matter most " nathan b rex norwalk conn any graduate of a liberal arts program in the last years knows full well that the overwhelming majority of liberal arts educators view capitalism as an evil globalism as a plutocratic conspiracy and the pursuit of business success as perverse selfish and base whatever you learn in your four years studying history literature political science or art it is certain not to be how to apply a liberal arts education to productive work in business the notion that students come out of college more able to "question authority" is also laughable if anything the ideological monolith that is humanities education attempts to teach students to obey the authority of the professor accept what theyre told without question and to appreciate the consequences of falling out of line which can include being called racist sexist even fascist brian t fox chatham n j kudos to mr finn and ms ravitch american culture has always strived for success our success however lies in playing to our strengths which are and have always been creativity versatility imagination restlessness energy ambition and problem solving prowess from the view of colleges the critical strengths needed are instilled and nurtured by a broad curriculum that focuses not only on math and science but also on skills in reading interpreting writing speaking and thinking clearly and critically in short these strengths are the result of a liberal arts based education real innovation arises from minds that can see where technical expertise needs to be applied in order to find creative new solutions and markets are captured by those who understand the power of words and have the ability to craft clear and effective communication robert badal president jamestown college jamestown n d will someone please tell mr finn and ms ravitch that the sky will not fall just because president bush signed into law the america competes act an education bill that increases funding for science technology engineering and math the idea that creativity in a scientific field requires a background liberally salted with expertise in world history art music or medieval french poetry finds support only in the faculty lounge of the humanities building moreover the authors conclusion that only children of the wealthy will benefit in the future from a liberal arts curriculum as if parents in the lower and middle socioeconomic classes are too dense to recognize its value is the kind of shoddy reasoning that gives a bad name to "soft" subjects paul bloustein cincinnati
