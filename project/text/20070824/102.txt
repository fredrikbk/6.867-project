weekend journal taste de gustibus packing for camp leave the whites go in light smithfield maine if you come to maine and stay in a house by a lake you are in a camp your house is not a house or a cottage it is a camp and unless your camp is isolated its in a camp ours on a dirt road on the eastern shore of north pond is fitzgerald camp a name going back generations there are camps in our camp as do most camps it has a camp association with dues and bylaws and officers to administer the water pump road maintenance conservation measures and trouble though there is seldom trouble so you see being in camp or as the mainers say being "down to camp" is not like "camping out " an arduous undertaking involving pitching a tent making a fire and doing your euphemisms in the woods and its not like "making camp " associated with armies on the march cowboys sleeping under the stars and inevitably cattle rustlers "look there duke you can see where they made camp before heading off into big pine country" there are other kinds of camps in maine too there are the famed summer camps for boys and girls and there are "fishing camps " perhaps youd best start taking notes at this point your camp by the lake and the fishing camps have a loosely associated history that probably explains why lakeside summer houses are called camps in the th century gentlemen anglers formed clubs and built lodges some of them impressively large and architecturally beautiful in the fish bountiful lakes and rivers of maine among them was the artist winslow homer an avid fisherman in "winslow homer artist and angler" by patricia junker with sarah burns homers gentle watercolors of maine fishing scenes and portraits of trout are excellently reproduced in addition to scholarly explications of homers fishing art the text also gives a brief history of the fraternal lodge building era in those days gentlemen who fished wore coats vests and neckties along with their anglers hats and waders included in this book is a photograph of winslow and his beloved brother charles so attired each posing with a rod and a string of fish as time progressed some of the old lodges became commercial sporting establishments and by the s commercial "fishing camps " inspired by the famous lodges were built in maine as lodge hotels hearty meals included with docks boats and guides the locations were still remote and usually involved hard journeys of hiking and portaging by the s maine fishing camps had become well known among dedicated anglers and men and some women from boston and new york made the trip by train or car following directions or better still following a guide they traveled until the road ended from that point they humped knapsacks of gear and tackle through the woods to a river where they boarded a canoe or two and paddled to the camp if it was especially remote the men had to carry the canoe overland to the next river on such expeditions it was best "to go in light" planning ones needs so that the very minimum of clothing and equipment is carried in john taintor footes hilarious fly fishing stories of the s and s various characters speak of this strategy especially wall streeter george potter baldwin who takes his bewildered bride isabelle on a rugged torturous honeymoon to a maine fishing camp our familys camp in fact was originally a "honeymoon camp " an uninsulated shack built in the s with woodburning stove and interior walls that didnt reach the ceiling apparently honeymooners in those days needed only the beauty of north pond and each other as for isabelle when george tells her before the honeymoon that theyre going in light she has no idea what he is talking about so she ignores him as he bursts into their room at the camps main lodge to prepare her for a fishing trip he finds her sitting traumatized among heaps of evening dresses and shoes petticoats handbags and hats when he searches desperately for the gear hes bought her trousers boots waders shirts rod and reel she tells him she didnt have room for them my wife kay and i were similarly naive on our first trip together to maine in the year of our marriage conditioned by having been guests at summer places near manhattan we went in heavy flowered dresses straw hats blazers white trousers and white bucks our camp neighbors still recall that visit with glee "we thought maybe you were going somewhere else after you stayed here a few days " we had the old shack renovated and modernized about now my entire maine wardrobe comprises about six ensembles of fishing gear and they are stored in camp over the winter so these days on the trip from manhattan to maine i go in light three boating bags of this and that and the clothes im wearing kay brings maybe a couple of more bags than i do nevertheless on the initial trip in june the back of our rover and the roof carrier are filled to capacity with our daughters things camp or no camp however you define it teenage young ladies dont go in light anywhere mr crabb is the journals letters editor
