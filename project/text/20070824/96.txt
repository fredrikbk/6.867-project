weekend journal review books thats not what i meant to say um slips stumbles and verbal blunders and what they mean by michael erard pantheon pages &# the other day my nine year old daughter was telling me a story and at one point she couldnt decide whether to say billions or bunches so out popped a portmanteau word "ive got binches " she said then giggled at her mistake to the casual observer that blooper is cute but to michael erard a journalist who specializes in writing about language it is fodder for analysis in "um " his first book which he describes as "a work of applied blunderology " he argues that verbal blundering is natural meaningful and "integral to language " mr erards enthusiasm for his subject is infectious he gets you wondering about blundering while youre reading "um " and perhaps for a long while after youll be on the qui vive for others slips and painfully aware of your own which mr erard informs us constitute a whopping to of the words you utter every day there are two main categories of blunders slips of the tongue and "speech disfluencies " a slip is "a momentary loss of control over speaking" a disfluency is "one of the blurps and interruptions in what we think should be smoothly flowing talk " recounting the research of linguists and cognitive scientists in easygoing anecdotal prose mr erard shows how "slips result from a mental plan gone awry while disfluencies represent a delay or interruption in planning itself " while we tend to notice slips of the tongue and often make fun of them we tend to ignore disfluencies especially our own unless they are salient or habitual well known slips include the malapropism named after the character mrs malaprop in richard brinsley sheridans "the rivals " and the spoonerism named after the rev william archibald spooner the famously soapy tongued warden of new college oxford a spoonerism is a reversal of the initial letters or syllables of words as when spooner reputedly toasted queen victoria "heres to our queer old dean " my favorite spoonerism is an intentional one attributed to dorothy parker "id rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy " a malapropism is a humorous confusion of words that sound alike as when curly of the three stooges says "i resemble that remark " one special type of malapropism is the eggcorn a word someone uses incorrectly but believes to be correct "a sort of ossified slip of the tongue" based on mishearing or mispronunciation for all intensive purposes when all is set and done "eggcorn" itself is an eggcorn for acorn among the other common but lesser known slips linguists have documented as many as kinds are the "anticipation " or "forward error" a leading list for a reading list the "perseveration " or "backward error" black bloxes for black boxes and the inadvertent blend my daughters binches the speech disfluencies which are "far more frequent " says mr erard comprise a host of "unsmooth moments" pause fillers uh and um repeated words "will will you marry me " repeated sounds "b b but i just cant" prolonged vowels or syllables and restarted or "repaired" sentences i wish mr erard had added one more type to his list verbal tics yknow like basically i mean given the annoying frequency of such words and phrases the omission is especially disappointing in a chapter on freud and his eponymous slip we learn that the man to whom a cigar was never just a cigar had a formidable intellectual rival a viennese philologist named rudolf meringer who painstakingly collected thousands of slips and in published a treatise about them that linguists today consider a seminal work to freud whose opinions on slips first appeared in an article published in any blunder "however seemingly innocuous hid a secret intention that could be unburied through investigation " but to meringer a slip didnt emanate from "some repressed psychic material " his research led him to conclude that slips werent random that they adhered to the basic rules of language and that their source lay not in the speaker but in "the utterance contaminating itself " this dichotomy still lies at the heart of the debate about slips and disfluencies do they have "a mysterious individual cause" or are they chiefly mechanical occurring as "the brain shifts from planning to executing" "um " is filled with toothsome factlets for example tying down a persons arm induces blunders while gesturing apparently reduces them people talking on the phone and people with their hands in their pockets are more likely to be disfluent in a chapter on presidential blundering in which president dubya of course figures prominently we discover that thomas jefferson was "a verbal bungler with a lisp" and that calvin coolidge was "the first president with a policy against being quoted verbatim " though mr erard covers the spectrum of slips and stumbles with authority he is less successful at telling us what they mean this is not entirely his fault because we still dont know enough about how the brain works and all too often the blunderologists cant seem to agree "um " is well researched and at times penetrating but it falls short of being definitive we are still left wondering whether our slips reveal something profound about our nature and the nature of language or whether they are merely subliminal glitches potholes that the brain runs over as it guides the tongue down the treacherous communication highway one thing about blunders is certain though misspeaking mr erard shows persuasively is normal and "a verbal blunder is an indelible mark of humanness " mr elster is the author of "the big book of beastly mispronunciations " "what in the word " and other books on language
