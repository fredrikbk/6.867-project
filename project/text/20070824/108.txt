gospel mr lovett introduced his swinging countrified version of classic s style ensembles with his album "lyle lovett and his large band" and has toured both with the band and solo on stripped down acoustic shows the group often throws in a classic big band number this album kicks off with "tickle toe " a s piece by lester young the albums songs maintain mr lovetts swinging sound but some of them such as the spiritual tinged "i will rise up" and a plaintive version of the traditional "aint no more cane " have a slightly more mournful tone than many of his earlier efforts the compilation
