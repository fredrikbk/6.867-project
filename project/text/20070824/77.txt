promising crop jatropha plant gains steam in global race for biofuels hardy shrub is tapped for energy rich seeds indian farmers big bet hiriyur india until recently b k nagendrappa didnt care much at all about jatropha an ugly wild green shrub that thrives in india now the coconut grower hopes to plant as many as acres of the stuff on his land near bangalore v venkateswarao is also raising the plants on a dried up stretch of dirt east of hyderabad so too is o p singh a horticulturist for indias ministry of railways in a quiet garden by an old airport in new delhi "this plant will save humanity i tell you " mr singh proclaims as he points to foot tall jatropha shrubs nearby someday "every house will have jatropha " with oil trading at roughly &# a barrel this lowly forest plant is suddenly an unlikely star on the worlds alternative energy stage the seeds from jatrophas golf ball size fruit contain a yellowish liquid similar to palm oil that can be made into biodiesel an increasingly important renewable fuel used in europe the u s and elsewhere but unlike other biodiesel crops jatropha can be grown almost anywhere including deserts trash dumps and rock piles it doesnt need much water or fertilizer and it isnt edible that means environmentalists and policymakers dont have to worry about whether jatropha diverts resources away from crops that could be used to feed people these qualities are crucial at a time of intensifying concern over the environmental and social consequences of a global alternative energy boom it takes huge quantities of land water and chemicals to grow crops to make ethanol and biodiesel and as more governments set targets for their consumption fears are rising that the world wont be able to meet the demand without significant environmental damage goldman sachs recently cited jatropha as one of the best candidates for future biodiesel production a bear stearns analysis last year found that u s farmers only have the capacity to replace about of the countrys gasoline with corn based ethanol despite a new federal renewable fuels target of by to reach that goal the u s would likely have to find a lot more land india by contrast has millions of acres of wasteland that arent fully utilized due to low water tables and infertile soil jatropha advocates figure the crop can cover much of that area without causing environmental distress in late june oil giant bp plc said it will invest &# million in a joint venture with u k based d oils plc a biofuels start up thats developing jatropha in india and elsewhere another company australia based mission biofuels ltd has raised more than &# million from investors and has representatives fanning out across the indian subcontinent to sign up growers it has roughly acres under cultivation already and expects to hit by other countries including the u s may have similar bounties of untapped land for jatropha and farmers are already rushing to plant the crop in thailand the philippines swaziland and even saudi arabia the enthusiasm for jatropha and its ilk highlights how quickly investors are shifting gears as the shortcomings of other renewable fuels become more apparent it also illustrates the risks of newer approaches since its still far from clear whether jatropha and its peers are economically viable on a large scale by some estimates the per barrel cost to produce biofuel using jatropha about &# is about half that of corn and roughly one third that of rapeseed two other leading materials for alternative energy at those prices jatropha biodiesel would be competitive with fuel made from crude oil without significant government subsidies but such calculations are based on limited experience with the crop agronomists hardly studied it in the past because it was considered to be mostly worthless until recently jatropha was best known in india and elsewhere as a hedge to keep wild animals from wandering onto farms even some of jatrophas biggest advocates concede the plants oil output is unpredictable and often lower than expected although it can grow without water it tends to do much better when water is added raising its cost of production and mitigating some of the perceived benefits some farmers have already reported financial losses from jatropha plantations after their crops yielded less oil than expected or buyers failed to pay sufficient prices in a worst case scenario some rural development experts fear small indian farmers could wind up serving as guinea pigs for an untested industry leaving them in debt if the boom fizzles "everybody is so excited but is jatropha really happening im not so sure " says amit sachdev a new delhi area based representative for the u s grains council which represents the interests of one of jatrophas competitors american corn more research is needed "instead of hype " adds manfred zeller a rural development expert at the university of hohenheim in stuttgart germany any ecological downsides such as the draining of water resources to accelerate plant growth are thus far unknown still jatrophas allure is undeniable planting more palm oil corn or other crops to make ethanol or biodiesel isnt really an option due to land shortages and other constraints water tables are falling across india and production of some key commodities like rice has already flattened out in recent years the country could have trouble meeting its own food needs even without a biofuel boom first cultivated in south america jatropha was brought to india long ago by portuguese traders villagers used it as a hedge crop and some extracted oil and latex from the plants to make soap or fuel for lamps many indians recall using the latex from jatropha to blow bubbles when they were children the indian government started getting excited about jatropha a decade ago officials were already worried about indias energy security and asked a private nonprofit research outfit called the energy and resources institute to look into jatrophas potential as a fuel source researchers at teri studied the plant in a lab on the sixth floor of their new delhi offices and were encouraged "you can put it in any kind of soil and it will grow " says p p bhojvaid a senior fellow at teri if cared for properly the plants can live up to years as teri made progress other indian leaders jumped on the bandwagon former president a p j abdul kalam planted jatropha in his peacock filled gardens in new delhi and touted the plant in speeches to the nation the state railway ministry began using jatropha last year to fuel some of its locomotives and planted million jatropha plants along its tracks the government ordered state run oil companies to buy jatropha made biodiesel at a minimum price of about rupees a liter or about &# a gallon several of indias local governments began handing out free saplings all this set the stage for companies like australias mission to move in founded by a malaysian born businessman in it aimed to capitalize on the new biofuel boom by building a palm oil biodiesel refinery on the coast of malaysia but mission officials wanted a backup raw material in case palm oil prices shot up as they have since after some research they settled on jatropha in part because its inedible and therefore unaffected by demand from food buyers the use of food crops to make fuel "will only push up the price of food and food has to win otherwise the world will go into starvation " says nathan mahalingam missions managing director "we want to stay clear of that and thats why were moving into jatropha " mr mahalingam estimates that each acre of jatropha planted will produce about one ton of oil with yields hopefully improving over time to seed a network of growers the company recruited people like k chalapathy reddy a year old plant breeder now as a mission senior scientist he spends much of his time touring the indian countryside helping convince farmers to take up the crop and looking for ways to boost their yields his mobile phone rings constantly with calls from farmers seeking advice on how to prune their plants or when to apply water in towns such as hiriyur about a three hours drive across the dusty flatlands outside bangalore mr reddy relies on local agents who talk up jatropha at agricultural fairs and town meetings they hand out mission brochures that feature drawings of a car pulling up to a smiling tree labeled "biodiesel " typically missions agents sign up farmers to contracts that commit them to sell all their jatropha to the company for years it charges farmers three rupees per plant but mission says it often forgoes payment until after the plants start producing significant quantities of oil a process that usually takes two to three years mr reddy acknowledges jatropha promoters have come and gone and that sometimes farmers are skeptical "theres nothing like hide and seek here were not fooling the farmers " mr reddy says "we get nothing unless the crop comes in " among missions growers is year old k nagaraj who says he used to grow groundnut on a small plot of land near hiriyur but the soil conditions werent ideal and after water and fertilizer expenses it wasnt possible to make much of a profit he says mission offered a guaranteed price of five rupees per kilogram for his oil bearing jatropha seed which he reckons should translate into a profit of about rupees or about &# an acre "initially i was a bit skeptical " he says of jatropha "but when we got more information and the president was telling people about it we gained confidence " other farmers in the area are also giving jatropha a go without even knowing who theyll sell it to one of mr nagarajs neighbors a former politician named h ramaiah says he made his living in recent years from coconuts but his trees are dying from insufficient water so he now hopes to have better luck with jatropha on a recent visit his jatropha plants were hardly distinguishable from other weeds on the property jatropha "takes very little water so maybe it will work " mr ramaiah said hopefully when asked who might buy his future oil harvest he was uncertain "whoever is giving the most profit " he said tariq engineer in mumbai and binny sabharwal in new delhi contributed to this article
