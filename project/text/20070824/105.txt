weekend journal the drivers seat saturn vue european genes juice up saturns vue if you bought a saturn a few years ago and havent been by the dealership since its unlikely youll recognize the place maybe the building but the shiny new vehicles out front no way of saturns nameplates astra aura outlook sky and vue the only one that existed prior to the model year is the vue and now that model has been so thoroughly redesigned as to draw its lineage into question indeed paternity testing reveals that saturns new compact sport utility vehicle is born of gms european operations a "badge engineered" opel antara though the saturn version is assembled in mexico this is the new modus operandi for saturn whose lineup now consists entirely of vehicles borrowed from other gm brands perhaps this will allow saturn to focus its resources on what it does best its famous touchy feely no haggle salesmanship then again maybe it will turn gms "different kind of car company" into yet another purveyor of detroit snake oil i wont be wagering on the outcome but displacing the quirkiness of saturns plastic car from tennessee roots with cool german steel seems like a good move from afar case in point the vue the vues looks are now as contemporary as hondas latest version of the cr v as much the class standout as any compact suv on the market the cr v has become more of a small sleek station wagon and while the saturn doesnt stray quite as far from the suv look what with its taller stance and luggage rack its just as attractive certainly the sculpted wheel arches and brightwork of the vue make it more pleasing to the eye than its other chief competitor toyotas unstunning rav better still you no longer see the gaps around the doors from across the street like you could with the vues predecessor a byproduct of its plastic body panels in fact nearly all the despicable qualities of the old vue and there were plenty have been neatly addressed interior trim pieces have lost their cheap and fragile looks and the new vue is a much quieter vehicle which adds to the overall impression of quality all models are better equipped with safety features like antilock brakes stability control and head curtain air bags now standard even the old vues off putting electric steering has been jettisoned from the v models in favor of a hydraulic system that actually feels well connected to the road with the exception of the vue green line hybrid which doesnt go on sale until october the vue also has an entirely new lineup of engines a liter horsepower in line four cylinder propels the base model which is available only in a front wheel drive configuration with a four speed automatic transmission the epa rates it at miles per gallon in combined city highway driving which isnt great but comparable with the cr v with a base price of &# including destination charge gm predicts the four cylinder model will be the best selling vue thats something of a misnomer however as the company also expects of vues to come with one of two available v engines this is where the desirability of the euro cute ute comes speeding to a halt like a pound vehicle on the sled in a crash test lab with the all wheel drive vue topping two tons heavier than the ford edge or the lexus rx both substantially bigger midsize suvs gm powertrain had to stuff some pretty big engines under the prow the smaller of the two is a liter v from the full size chevy impala sedan that puts out horsepower the saturn outlook suv a three row eight passenger leviathan donates the other a liter horsepower v with dual overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder why gm needs two vs for the vue when toyota offers just one in the rav and honda refuses to fit anything other than a four cylinder in the cr v is a complicated question with a simple answer cost to hit its pricing targets for the vue gm offers its "old school" liter v a less expensive engine due to its pushrod design and cast iron block thus the liter vue can be had starting at &# including all wheel drive while the version with the all aluminum liter engine ups the price to &# with all wheel drive running an additional &# despite deploying a six speed automatic transmission both v motors cause the vues fuel economy to plummet the best case scenario would be to get a front wheel drive vue with the liter engine which is rated at mpg combined all wheel drive models incur a further fuel penalty with the liter v managing just mpg choosing the liter v with all wheel drive actually improves that number to which is the same rating achieved by the much much larger outlook go figure gm says compact suvs are becoming a "destination" for car shoppers which implies that people are buying them without regard for the traditional value proposition of the segment reasonable fuel economy and more interior space than a compact sedan for not that much more money if saturn can disabuse consumers of this notion and sell them loaded vues priced well over &# that get lousy fuel economy perhaps it does have the best sales organization in the business otherwise maybe it ought to be pushing more of those four bangers contact me at jeff
