continued enthusiasm by individual investors but also highlighting the risks of a painful bust the shanghai composite index ended at a gain in the session of the record close put the benchmark index about five times higher than it was in july when the market bottomed out at an eight year low the index holds an gain for the year so far making it the worlds best performing major market chinas gains have come on a surge of enthusiasm from millions of individual investors who appear to fear missing the bull run more than the potential for losing money investors have also appeared to defy government efforts to cool buying by such means as for example this weeks interest rate increase nor has chinas ascent been slowed by the collapse in the u s subprime mortgage market that has rocked financial systems elsewhere while the speed of the gains has raised analyst concerns authorities dont have an easy way of cooling the temperature "the problem is how to deflate the bubble just a little keep prices high and not get blamed if the bubble bursts " donald straszheim vice chairman of california based roth capital partners wrote in a report an interest rate increase announced tuesday by the peoples bank of china the fourth this year has done little to damp stock buying enthusiasm the central bank lifted deposit rates by a wider margin than it raised lending rates which was seen as an attempt to encourage chinese savers to leave their money in banks instead of funneling it into stocks investors in china have played down fundamentals that suggest stocks are vulnerable to a correction after such a tremendous rise and have instead maintained a widespread belief that stocks will remain supported in coming months more than a million new investor accounts have been opened so far this month and individuals continue to say they will buy after any fall in prices doubts that the government intends to stop the market are widespread "if the government really wanted to prevent the market from going up it wouldnt have let the market cross the level let alone " said xu yinghui an analyst at guotai junan securities meanwhile capital control rules make it difficult for the subprime turmoil that has churned stocks bonds and currencies elsewhere around the world to directly affect chinas financial markets though chinas export base is considered at risk if u s consumer

chinese companies that trade in overseas markets most notably hong kong prices for those same chinese companies when quoted in shanghai are often as much as more than in hong kong some investors in china say the price in hong kong could ultimately rise near the shanghai level and hopes for the hong kong market are running high following a policy change that gives chinese investors more access to
