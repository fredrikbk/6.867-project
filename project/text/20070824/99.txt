weekend journal review film jacksons a hit but champ has a glass chin laughs get neglected in nanny diaries a dreary dedication heres the deal were going to lay out most of the boxing metaphors right here in the first paragraph samuel l jackson is a knock out as a broken down boozed up former boxer in the fact based "resurrecting the champ " the movie itself which deals not very interestingly with the issue of journalistic integrity and very predictably with father son relationships doesnt pack much of a wallop erik kernan josh hartnett trying hard if futilely not to be bland is a denver newspaper sports reporter whose motto seems to be "dont get it right get it written" and whose beat consists of second string competitions routinely consigned to the papers back pages his tough minded editor the very good alan alda characterizes eriks work as typing rather than writing and oooh twist that knife says he forgets it even as hes reading it the appraisal is all the more painful given that eriks estranged wife joyce kathryn morris is one of the papers star reporters and that his late father who decamped when erik was a toddler was a celebrated radio boxing commentator hailed for a rich use of language to raise his profile improve his standing with joyce and honor his famous name but mostly to be a big deal to his adorable year old son whos already heard plenty of palaver about daddys close friendship with denver broncos quarterback john elway who makes a cameo appearance erik needs a big story he finds it in the form of a reedy voiced vagrant who calls himself "champ" mr jackson and claims to be bombardier bob satterfield a heavyweight boxer known in his heyday for aggressive punching and a glass jaw champ now a pitiful punch drunk goliath plies a shopping cart filled with his worldly goods around the mean streets of the mile high city and is on the losing end of fisticuffs with cops and hoodlums yes but once upon a time hed been a contender could have been no he tells erik hed broken rocky marcianos nose and done some damage to raging bull jake lamotta bingo thinks erik who for the record has the news gathering skills of sally field in "absence of malice" and the ethics of the title character in "shattered glass " he buys the beer and clicks on the tape recorder sucker punch thinks champ as he gulps down the brew and spins his yarn "resurrecting the champ " which is never short of mesmerizing when mr jackson is on screen in fairness hes got all the good lines loses power when by dint of a plot twist attention turns to the none too compelling erik the result is a sentimental by the numbers tale of paternal shame and redemption that could be called "resurrecting the daddy " the nanny diaries when in the s and s young women came to new york seeking fame and fortune or at the very least a little bit of excitement before settling down to raise a family see "the best of everything " "valley of the dolls " "return to peyton place" inevitably they were faced with the classic perils of the big city men vile predatory men ah those were the good old days theres a whole new hazard out there now for young women looking to make something of themselves in the big city their vile female bosses witness "the devil wears prada " an execrable novel turned highly entertaining movie and witness "the nanny diaries " a clever satiric novel turned dull witted movie co written and directed by shari springer berman and robert pulcini the pair behind the dazzling "american splendor " with the framing device of an anthropological field guide to the upper east side of manhattan the one smart touch here "the nanny diaries" chronicles the travails of annie braddock scarlett johansson who displays no flair for light comedy uncertain about her career path she flubs her interview for an investment bank training program annie stumbles into a job as caregiver for a year old boy nicholas reese art who has everything but the attention of his parents mr and mrs x its a nomenclatural joke that worked just fine in the book but like the mishearing of annie as nanny seems forced on screen when the stunningly self centered high handed mrs x the terrific laura linney isnt shopping shes just back from shopping controlling nannys social life or making pronouncements about the evils of nonorganic food the subway and manhattans west side and when mr x the barely there paul giamatti isnt making deals hes making whoopee with a colleague in the chicago office "the nanny diaries" is so tightly constructed of cliches stereotypes and chick lit tropes that its inert no fresh air can blow in the humor the notion of french lessons for toddlers and a white glove service that arranges play dates dates back to "baby boom " what never gets explored and would certainly have given the film some much needed texture and complexity is the idea that nanny is almost as much sinning as sinned against barely five minutes into the job shes steeping in a bubble bath later when her charge is running a temperature shes clueless you just cant find decent help these days noxious feel good endings like the one in "the nanny diaries" of those there is a plentiful supply dedication childrens book author henry roth the mannered billy crudup has a problem you me and everyone we know to hear his frequently uttered and banal cri de coeur "life is nothing but the occasional burst of laughter rising above the interminable wail of grief" is to wonder how he ever got a publishing contract let alone a cadre of eager readers even if their average age is he has a host of tics and eccentricities among them wearing a crash helmet in a car and sleeping on the floor a pile of books pressed against his chest and is given to splenetic obscene outbursts the targets are many women in general his illustrator and best friend of years tom wilkinson his publisher bob balaban and during a book signing for the best seller "marty the beaver " a sweet little girl why is the guy such a pill who can begin to explain the tiresome pretentious "dedication" doesnt even try when circumstances require henry to find a new collaborator his publisher sets him up with an untried talent mandy moore who despite a loony mother dianne wiest is remarkably grounded and warm hearted but whose gifts as an artist must be taken on faith not a single one of her illustrations is put on display you can see where all this is going author meets illustrator crazy person meets sane person withholding person meets giving person but there isnt one interesting thing about the journey dvd tip in the haunting "anastasia" a crafty businessman attempts to pass off a beautiful impostor ingrid bergman as the only member of the russian royal family to survive the bolshevik massacre but the young woman is so convincing that even doubting dowager empress marie helen hayes anastasias grandmother buys her story joe morgenstern is on vacation
