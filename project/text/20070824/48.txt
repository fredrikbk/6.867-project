how to raise revenue the congressional budget office reported yesterday that the famously fearsome budget deficit is plummeting almost as fast as congresss approval ratings the deficit this fiscal year is expected to be &# billion a meager of gdp since the bush tax cuts of the budget deficit has fallen by &# billion mostly because of a continuing torrid pace of revenue growth quite a success story but one that isnt likely to be embraced by house ways and means committee chairman charles rangel of new york last week he gave a sneak preview of his tax strategy for this fall by announcing he wants to put "more equity into the system " mr rangel then provided the translation its time he says to "take a look at the upper marginal tax rate to see if there can be a more equitable distribution of the tax " ok lets talk equity its almost an article of faith on capitol hill these days that the bush tax cuts tilted the income tax system in favor of the rich if this were true it would be reflected in the actual data on the distribution of the income tax for the bush tax cuts to have been a give away to the rich people paying the higher marginal tax rates would have to be carrying a smaller share of the income tax load but the irs data indicate that they are not paying less instead they are paying more lots more more surprisingly the richest and of the taxpayers are shouldering a larger percentage of the income tax burden at the federal level than the tax estimators said they would had the bush tax cuts never materialized the data nearby tell the story the preliminary data just released from the treasury department show more of the same the amount of tax paid by those earning more than &# million a year increased to &# billion in up from &# billion in the year of the tax cut this was a increase in taxes paid by millionaire households another indication of the expanded tax base is that after the tax cuts there were more millionaires for uncle sam to tax in about americans declared gross income of &# million or more in the number of millionaire households leapt to the number of americans with declared income of &# million or more doubled to from in the years after the tax rate cuts this is a "problem" only if democrats have come to believe that earning money is an ignoble pursuit the boom in the stock and housing markets clearly had a lot to do with the expansion in the number of millionaires in america but lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends also caused a huge jump in reported income the national bureau of economic research found an "unprecedented surge in regular dividend payments after the " bush tax cut likewise the lowering of the capital gains tax was followed by a increase in the amount of capital gains unlocked by the tax rate lower tax rates expanded the tax base we hope that before "putting more equity into the system" mr rangel also takes a look at the longer term picture on revenues and tax rates because it shows that raising tax rates may not be a wise strategy with a few exceptions tax rates in america have been steadily falling for the past years starting with the reagan tax cuts of when ronald reagan entered the oval office in the highest tax rates on income capital gains and dividends were roughly twice as high as today the top marginal income tax rate in for example was compared to today these tax rate reductions havent meant that the rich have escaped paying their "fair share" of taxes or that the burden has shifted to the middle class the opposite has occurred over the past years tax payments by the wealthy have continually risen almost in inverse proportion to the tax rates as shown by the surprising results below the real bite on the middle class comes from payroll and state taxes include them and their tax share rises relative to the wealthy so yes cut those taxes too the supply side revenue effects on the rich are remarkable tax rates on higher incomes have been halved but the federal tax share of the top has nearly doubled and the budget deficit has fallen thats what happens when tax policy gets the incentives right see related letter "letters to the editor economy causes americans to feel doubts insecurity" wsj sept correction a transposed number in a chart in yesterdays editorial "how to raise revenue " incorrectly listed the percentage of federal income taxes paid in by the top of taxpayers measured by share of income the correct number is wsj aug
