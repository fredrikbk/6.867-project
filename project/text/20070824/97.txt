weekend journal review television as europeans see us in "the anti americans " a gleeful but alarming documentary monday p m edt on pbs check local listings the producers psychoanalyze our conflicted relationships with some of our historical allies in europe resentment mingles with admiration envy and co dependence in those regarding us from afar but a good portion of this hour long film part of the "america at a crossroads" series is devoted to old fashioned ill informed chauvinism mostly of the gallic variety some of the criticism is richly deserved we are fat we dont learn foreign languages and we do export cultural trash we are more often busy than reflective a black mark in societies where introspection is revered some americans might feel offended by the opinions solicited perhaps selectively by the filmmakers but the diatribes here range from good natured satire by those who do love us deep down to hilarious misconceptions by those who dont really know us at all american food is "worthless " spits a camembert nationaliste another frenchwoman thinks all americans are racist except in new york has she been to new york one wonders a pole riffs on american backsides spacious enough to provide a ride across a parking lot to ones gas guzzler and in ironic tribute to our insane entertainment culture an englishman explains why he composed "jerry springer the opera " a loquacious british mp one of the many public figures intellectuals and cab driving philosophers who provide comment calls this sort of disparagement a form of "adolescent self definition " by which the european teenagers throw stones at a gauche but all powerful parent in this analysis they look to us as an example from which to distance themselves reinforcing their own cultural identity while collecting their allowance and taking us for granted in britain american culture is devoured but at a fashionable london dinner party the guests horrified fascination takes a snooty turn over wine and doubtless organic fare a blonde in cleavage enhancing pearls worries about the "idiot" masses electing our politicians who in turn trespass haplessly on their side of the trans atlantic chasm in much of europe citizens feel that they should have a say in american affairs due to our exceptional impact abroad the message is not lost on their children pupils at an elite french elementary school sons and daughters of the intelligentsia produce drawings of illiterate americans bush "massacring the planet " and a yank with "a machine gun that hes killing someone with " french and other politicians are adept at using anti americanism to win votes we learn though even jacques chirac himself loves america his successor monsieur sarkozy does as well also at work in the european psyche is a kind of transference in which each nation loves or hates us or both in a way that reflects its own history and its own unresolved traumas more than it reflects say the objective facts of mcdonalds hollywood or the iraq war just as some resent us for the long shadow that makes them feel inadequate or endangered others look to us as a preferable alternative to the bad relationship theyre in some french rappers representing the disenfranchised outskirts of charming cities covet big cars and thick chains and iraq notwithstanding they admire bush as "a guy who succeeds at doing his own thing " one rapper boasts that he was the first in france to affix diamonds to his teeth poland after being in the custody of an abusive parent the old soviet union is willing to overlook our flaws many poles still view us as part of an axis of benevolence that included ronald reagan pope john paul ii and lech walesa singing cowboys imitate our music and attract fans at a polish country music festival notably some of those fans seem to have taken on american dietary habits unlike the french a substantial percentage of poles have first hand experience of america they travel back and forth for work and indeed seem to be far less critical of the war in iraq than they are of our immigration policies which allow the america hating french to visit our shores sans visa but force poles to line up for abuse at consulates for an extortionate fee with no visa guaranteed as in love each country brings its own baggage to the relationship and sometimes struggles to fathom the heart and mind of its counterpart we fight beside you in iraq a pole complains with an air of resignation and give you our hearts in return you treat us "like a woman that you beat " an idealistic young teacher is trying to win hearts and minds in her own sixth grade classroom in "the education of ms groves" tuesday through friday p m on sundance channel a documentary miniseries that chronicles her metamorphosis from bright eyed rookie straight out of "teach for america" into a more seasoned and empathetic realist her love affair with the children is punishing in her early months of imparting "language arts" to a disruptive underprivileged brood in an atlanta school monica grovess temper and decibel level ascend as she begs for silence and threatens detentions soon she is beside herself with fatigue and frustration and we think maybe she should opt for law school "i am officially going through a tyrant phase " she admits we are relieved and impressed when learning from mentors and her own failed strategies she starts to discern the outside forces influencing the kids misbehavior gently drawing from them tales of incarcerated dads unpaid bills and onerous responsibilities at home an african american from an elite background who was indelibly inspired by her own first grade teacher ms groves knows shes a role model she sticks with it and holds
