the evening wrap bhuttos risky return online edition associated press benazir bhuttos return to pakistan today was marred by a bombing that killed dozens in a parade in karachi adding a layer of violence to an already tense political situation the twin blasts which killed at least according to the occurred near a truck carrying the former prime minister as part of a celebration of her arrival in the country after eight years in exile first a small explosion went off then a large blast was detonated a few feet in front of the truck carrying ms bhutto it shattered the trucks windows and set a police vehicle alight but bhutto lawyer sen babar awan said that the former premier was safe and had been rushed from the scene to her house in the port city threats to her life had come from jihadists partly because of her condemnation of terrorism and authorities had urged her to use helicopters to reduce the risk of attack during her travels even before the blasts tonight pakistani politics was full of pitfalls ms bhuttos return came after a series of negotiations with gen pervez musharraf pakistans increasingly unpopular president resulted in a deal that eliminated the corruption charges that hung over her head during her exile ms bhutto is expected to make a bid for an unprecedented third premiership perhaps as part of a political partnership with gen musharraf he could use an alliance with ms bhutto to help shore up his support which has flagged since his attempt in march to unseat the chief justice of the countrys top court prompted pro democracy protests and while the general easily won an oct vote by lawmakers giving him a new five year presidential term his rule remains uncertain because the supreme court has said the vote cant be made official until justices rule on legal challenges to his re election the court expects to make that ruling in to days and now come todays bombings "does this change the dynamics well it adds one more element to the confusion " said teresita schaffer director of the south asia program at the center for strategic and international studies she notes that it could boost ms bhuttos standing in the public mind and depending on how she conducts herself in the coming days it could affect her bid for the premiership since it may make her more cautious or "get her adrenaline going " ms schaffer said one thing is for certain unless the culprits are identified immediately and definitively there will be plenty of speculation about who is responsible for the attack ms schaffer said conspiracy theories can gain quite a bit of traction as such she expects fingers will be pointing at gen musharraf islamic militants and even members of ms bhuttos own party regardless of who is responsible attacks by islamic militants have become increasingly brazen in pakistan since the standoff at islamabads red mosque and dealing with them will have to be a priority for whoever wields power in pakistan ms schaffer said
