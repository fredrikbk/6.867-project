the new ways we fight cancer this week the national cancer institute in conjunction with other organizations that track cancers reported that the death rate from cancer declined from by an average of per year this is an improvement over the annual declines from and is very good news indeed each decline represents people living rather than dying and of course this figure is compounded each year while some part of the declining death rate from cancer is the consequence of screening much is the result of greatly improved treatments and we believe that the successes achieved to date are only the modest beginning of a revolution in the research into and treatment of cancer during the last half of the th century almost all treatments of cancers involved forms of chemotherapy in which cancerous and normal tissues were bombarded with nonselective cytoxic drugs these drugs killed all cells healthy as well as malignant worse they did not kill all cancer cells so the cancer progressed leading to the pessimism dominant in peoples minds today a reflection of years of articles and opinion pieces in the popular press expressing the view that "the war on cancer" has been waged incorrectly if not lost now however new therapeutic modes are in play based on better understandings of cancers and great advances in technologies scientists are at last on the right track and making progress along three fronts first many cancers will be turned into chronic illnesses each treated with far less toxic drugs with far fewer and less severe side effects so that a patient can live a normal life span with a near normal quality of life a loose analogy would be to diabetics these treatments are probably closer to being realized than most people would guess second the prevention of entire types of cancers will occur through vaccinations an approach already in clinical use third cancers already growing in individuals will be eradicated here is just a partial list of the new approaches vaccines today a newly developed vaccine is being administered to females ages that prevents cervical cancer and anal cancer the vaccine targets a certain virus human papillomavirus hpv which is the cause of most cervical cancers cervical cancer kills women annually in the u s and world wide it is thought that infection with viruses or bacteria play a role in the development of other cancers e g lymphoma and stomach cancer and research is focused on vaccines and antibiotics to prevent these and to eradicate those cancers already in existence in individuals another area of vaccine research is hepatitis c virus hcv infection which causes most liver cancer in the western world and hepatitis b virus hbv which causes liver cancer in asia it should be noted that only in a very small percentage of people who have the infections do the viruses cause liver cancer researchers are looking into the possible implications for humans of laboratory results which show that mammary breast cancer can be caused in mice by introduction of a virus a virus which is normally passed from one mouse to another in the past success in stimulating the human immune system to attack cancer cells has been elusive but three novel research projects are underway aimed at highly lethal metastatic melanoma the first approach involves t cells a group of white blood cells that play a critical role in immunity which have a particular receptor on their surface known as "tcr" that activates the immune system the process extracts t cells from a patients blood sample and in a laboratory activates their tcr to turn the t cells into killers of the patients melanoma cells and not healthy cells when reinjected into the patient the second approach involves genetic modification of a patients white blood cells in a laboratory the cells then produce a protein that enables the modified white cells to be detected and counted in tumors anywhere and everywhere in the patients body using a noninvasive pet scan a sophisticated x ray technology in the third method certain t cells which are derived from blood forming stem cells are genetically manipulated to target and attack melanoma cells these killer cells replicate in the body in response to the presence of melanoma tumors and attack the cancerous cells and because stem cells are long lived a large supply of the cancer killing cells develop in the patients body for as long as they are needed i e as long as there are melanoma cells there epigenetics cancers are caused by mutations in dna and abnormal control of genetic expressions epigenetic therapy involves correcting and reversing abnormal cancer causing gene expressions through the use of drugs designed to target specific proteins involved in gene control in a drug removing the abnormal protein causing acute promyelocytic leukemia apl was first successfully used since then the cure rate for apl has gone to and lives have been saved world wide in the past three years the fda has approved three epigenetic drugs that can change the behavior of malignant genes by acting on the proteins that control them they act on cutaneous lymphoma acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome a common form of blood cancer the most difficult to treat cancers involve many mutations involving many gene "switches" that turn on or off the flow of information passed from one gene to another in our high speed information age we are moving to the point where we can keep up with them and thus "edit" and control them in specific selective ways targeted therapies the use of personalized malignant gene expression profiles has advanced from research to therapy in patients e g in breast cancer research is advancing in targeting specific mutations in some lymphomas lung cancer and leukemia progress is also well underway in learning to control abnormal genes which signal normal genes to aid in the nurturing of cancers or in metastases of cancers for example doctors now have drugs that are able to curtail the production of new blood vessels which cancer cells need and cause to be produced thus depriving the cancers of nourishment thereby killing them drugs have been designed to block abnormal signals from an individual patients cancer and are in use or development biomarkers to detect ongoing cancers are another fruitful area of research an example of a biomarker now being used clinically is an overabundance of a protein called her neu which is associated with many breast cancers such personalized molecular profiles lead to the use of specific highly selective treatments with minimal toxicity cancer "stem cells " intensive continuing research has identified a type of cancer cells found in small numbers that are more capable of producing cancers and are more difficult to eradicate than ordinary cancer cells in the last five years knowledge has greatly advanced regarding how these types of cancer stem cells operate at the genetic level work is also well underway in the specific targeting through the rapid expansion of computer data bases of the genetic signatures of stem cells of different cancers to inhibit or cancel their ability to communicate information that causes cancer growth dormancy and metastasis this is but a very incomplete account of new and increasingly productive research in understanding and defeating cancers in all there is a st century cancer treatment revolution unfolding defeating cancers involves incremental time consuming processes along many avenues and we are advancing on all of them the danger is that misconceived pessimism might result in a loss of popular moral support for the revolutionary new approaches to cancer research and treatment this in turn could lead to diminishing private and governmental funds for research at the very least pessimism about taming and ultimately eliminating cancers turns the minds of millions from what should be justified hope to needless despair dr waxman
