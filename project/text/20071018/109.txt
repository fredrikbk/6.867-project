as after the stock fell significantly it appears to have lost money on the investment mr elmasrys experience may well reinforce negative investor sentiment toward the newspaper industry which is seeing readers and advertisers flee to the web but it also highlights the obstacles for outside shareholders in winning change at family controlled publishing companies analysts say "trying to be an activist shareholder in the nyt is a futile effort period " said edward atorino a media analyst at benchmark co assessing the impact of morgan stanleys sale is difficult though it is not known who bought the block of stock and it is possible it fell into the hands of a buyer friendly to the ochs sulzberger family control it is also possible that times chairman arthur sulzberger jr will pursue corporate governance changes at a more measured pace now that a high profile critic has taken himself out of play the sale has also led some investors to question whether the times can sustain itself
