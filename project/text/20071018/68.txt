j p morgans time to grin vindication for dimon as banks quarter outshines citigroups when citigroup inc reported dismal earnings this week investors debated whether the problem was the man at the top or the business model yesterday j p morgan chase &amp co s record third quarter earnings showed that the financial conglomerate strategy can work a three year crusade by j p morgan chief executive james dimon to relentlessly slash costs and invest heavily in technology and core businesses appeared to pay off amid a global credit crunch that has roiled wall street j p morgans strong performance in which net income rose to &# billion was a contrast to citigroups earlier this week citigroup reported that earnings fell in the third quarter triggering a fresh round of investor calls for the departure of ceo charles prince j p morgans financial results underscored the potential of the so called universal bank a model that mr dimon helped create under the wing of legendary deal maker sanford weill at citigroup yet it also shows how the corporate strategy in which assorted financial businesses are brought under one roof to balance out a banks performance in tough times requires a strong and nimble management in order to prosper indeed j p morgans strong results raise even more concerns among investors and analysts about citigroups recent performance while some believe that citigroup should break apart its conglomerate model others say that the problem lies with the banks leadership and that mr prince should step down speculation that mr princes resignation was imminent swirled in markets yesterday prompting the bank to take the unusual step of publicly denying the rumor "when mr dimon takes a similar business and does extremely well that makes mr prince look really bad " said william smith senior portfolio manager at sam advisors llc who has been a critic of mr prince the money management firm holds about shares of citigroup and approximately shares of j p morgan mr prince said earlier in the week that he is confident the bank is pursuing the right strategy to be sure the two banks arent exactly alike unlike j p morgan citigroup has a u s brokerage arm in the smith barney brand and a big consumer business overseas j p morgan meanwhile has a far bigger branch banking presence in the u s than does citigroup for mr dimon years old the performance further helps to vindicate his determination to claw his way back into wall streets upper echelon after being fired from citigroup by his mentor mr weill a decade ago "many of the cylinders are firing quite nicely around here " said michael cavanagh j p morgans chief financial officer in a conference call with reporters yesterday although its investment bank reported weak results from the credit crunch as had been expected j p morgan also reported double digit earnings growth in its credit card and commercial banking units j p morgans results reinforce mr dimons reputation as a hard charging and outspoken executive who regularly zeros in on minute details of the banks balance sheet in meetings with his staff over the past few months he has been intimately involved in fallout from the credit crunch from rallying other banks to borrow from the federal reserve to jumping into tense negotiations when a j p morgan financed deal to sell a home depot inc unit to a group of leveraged buyout firms was on the brink of collapse since taking the reins of j p morgan two years ago mr dimon the son of a stockbroker has pumped new momentum into the storied bank by plowing billions of dollars into branches and computer systems expanding into lucrative areas like commodities trading and stuffing the upper ranks with former colleagues from citigroup j p morgans chief financial officer hails from citigroup as does the head of its retail business treasury and security services operations and one of two co heads of its investment bank eager to increase returns in the banks massive credit card operations mr dimon recently wooed a top executive from american express co the credit card company whose results are the envy of the industry by contrast citigroup has been struggling for much of the year to cut expenses and pump up revenue mr prince who was a longtime lawyer at the bank before taking the reins four years ago from mr weill has never run any of the banks operations citigroup also snatched a well regarded american express executive earlier this year installing gary crittenden into the crucial position of chief financial officer at the same time mr prince has repeatedly shuffled members of the banks core business last week the bank shook up the ranks of its major trading operations resulting in the departure of thomas maheras a well regarded citigroup veteran yesterday mr dimon defended the banks decision to join citigroup and bank of america corp in forming a massive investment fund that is aimed at shoring up sputtering credit markets j p morgan doesnt own any of the structured investment vehicles that are in trouble leading some analysts to question why it is participating in a rescue plan "its very reasonable for j p morgan to play a role in trying to help the system and thats what this is " he said in a conference call the bank posted net income of &# billion or cents a share compared with &# billion or cents a share a year earlier revenue rose to &# billion j p morgans critical investment bank posted weak results as profit fell to &# million while revenue slumped to &# billion the bank also took &# billion in write
