dollar and credit woes top g s busy agenda washington when finance ministers and central bankers from the group of seven leading nations gather tomorrow the financial landscape will be starkly different than when they last met five months ago in germany the dollar has fallen to historic lows against the euro the subprime mortgage market has melted down triggering global financial unrest and clouding the economic outlook particularly in the u s central banks have stopped raising interest rates the rise of government controlled investment has emerged as a major preoccupation the world bank and the international monetary fund have picked new bosses "there are definitely a lot more issues on the table and a lot more tension than theres been in a long time " said harvard university economist kenneth rogoff a former chief economist for the imf david mccormick the treasurys undersecretary for international affairs said yesterday that the recent financial turmoil will be at the top of the g s agenda in washington tomorrow in an effort to head off some of the global concerns mr paulson has asked a global financial forum to form a group to look at the causes of the turbulence and to offer proposals another key issue on the table mr mccormick said will be the growth and scope of sovereign wealth funds government controlled investment funds that control more than &# trillion in assets mr mccormick added that the goal is to ensure the funds "act in a way thats consistent with free market principles" rather than make investments for political reasons but while tensions may be greater at this meeting than in the recent past the gathering is unlikely to result in any substantive action say government officials and outside observers the official g communique which outlines the issues and areas of focus going forward is expected to be tweaked slightly most expect the communique to continue reflecting concerns about "risks" to the global economy to reiterate calls for exchange rates to reflect "economic fundamentals" and specifically to say that china should allow movement in its exchange rate it may also touch on hedge funds and financial regulation including perhaps a call for improved oversight of credit rating agencies and a mention of sovereign wealth funds mr paulson is already trying to head off some of the concerns in a speech earlier this week he called for stronger risk management at financial institutions and the treasury recently created two advisory groups to develop voluntary guidelines for hedge funds mr paulson also reiterated his view that a strong dollar "is in our nations interest " adding that "currency values should be determined in competitive markets based on underlying economic fundamentals " but thats unlikely to end debate about global currencies europeans in particular are agitating for some type of washington response to the recent depreciation of the dollar which has fallen against the euro and british pound and is on par with the canadian loonie that decline is hurting european exporters who must either raise prices for products sold in the u s or accept a lower value for their goods exacerbating the problem is that many asian currencies including the chinese yuan are pegged to the dollar depressing prices on europes exports to other countries as well but the u s is unlikely to do anything more than continue to reiterate support for a strong dollar and most observers say the europeans dont actually expect and may not even want anything tougher while the falling dollar is hurting european exports it is helping the u s trade gap which europeans see as a source of instability in the global economy "wise leaders in business and in government understand that a depreciation of the real value of the dollar is necessary to get a rebalancing of global demand and output " said matthew slaughter an economist with dartmouth colleges tuck school of business the meeting is also expected to focus on financial regulation and the concerns of some foreign officials most notably in germany and france that global oversight of financial markets is lax german chancellor angela merkel has called for more transparency in the financial markets and french president nicolas sarkozy has urged industrialized nations to do a better job of policing their markets meanwhile french finance minister christine lagarde said recently that she sees a need for tougher banking oversight whether that leads to any global changes remains to be seen but canadian finance minister jim flaherty said he isnt keen on supporting new rules simply to say they have responded to a problem "we dont believe in the exposure of filling warehouses of documents for the sake of producing pieces of paper that people dont read " mr flaherty said "we will be reasonable and careful in our regulatory approach we have had these discussions before about regulation and we have not been one of the countries that have been pushing them " douglas belkin contributed to this article
