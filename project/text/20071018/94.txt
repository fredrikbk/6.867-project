readback in her own words in her memoir under the skin nobel prize winner doris lessing wrestles with memories truth online edition doris lessing wrote her autobiography in self defense in ms lessing learned that five biographers including one she had never met or even heard of were writing her life story "no matter how second rate biographies sell well " she later wrote "writers may protest as much as they like but our lives do not belong to us they belong to the publicity machines " ms lessing who won the nobel prize for literature last week makes a tempting target for biographers as she tells her own story in "under the skin " published in she had a rough and tumble childhood on a farm in southern rhodesia with parents deeply scarred by world war i she was a high strung adolescent dropping out of school at the age of then after two husbands and three children she became a poet and joined the communist party and all this was before she was what makes "under the skin" different from so many memoirs is that ms lessing openly wrestles with herself over which memories are "true" and which have been distorted by age guilt or vanity as she admits shes only in a little better position to tell her life story than her biographers "you see your life differently at different stages " she says "like climbing a mountain while the landscape changes with every turn on the path " even more troubling is this question which she italicizes "how do you know that what you remember is more important than what you dont " ms lessing has a remarkable memory for the travails of early childhood the infuriating vulnerability to everything the relentless clashes with parents and other authority figures anyone who was ever forced to take an afternoon nap will be thrown back into that timeless agony and the astounding cruelty of forced tickling "no hatred on earth is as violent as the helpless rage of a little child nature knows what it is doing prescribing amnesia for early childhood " ms lessing always had progressive political and social ideals especially about the so called native problem the "toe rag" poverty of so many black rhodesians in her s she became a self declared communist and began a short period of proselytizing at a time when the word communist is almost a profanity its worth hearing an unapologetic account of why communism appealed to this intelligent and sensible woman later she totally repudiated communism calling it "mass psychopathology " communists she said were "murderers with a clear conscience " ms lessing has written more than works of fiction but she is best known for "the golden notebook " published in which the swedish academy cited as a "pioneering work" for the "burgeoning feminist movement " for many years "the golden notebook" was a feminist bible a social realists guide to the psychological and sexual discontents of modern women although it seems far less avant garde today than it did years ago its still a wonderful book but ms lessing has regrets about "the golden notebook " too describing it as her "albatross " the feminist revolution "has produced some of the smuggest most unself critical people the world has ever seen " she said she found herself "increasingly shocked at the unthinking and automatic rubbishing of men which is now so part of our culture " the second volume of ms lessings autobiography "walking in the shade " picks up her life in london in where she has emigrated with a small child but no husband no job and no place to live that book ends in and she has said there will be no third volume ms lessing now years old wrote "under my skin" when she was in her early s "had i written this when i was it would have been a pretty combative document " she wrote "in my s a wail of despair and guilt now i look back at that child that girl that young woman with a more and more detached curiosity " reading "under my skin " i couldnt help wishing that more memoirists would get a few more years under their belts before writing about themselves "under my skin" is mature in the best sense of the word a graceful harmony of confidence and doubt pleasure and pain humor and gravitas
