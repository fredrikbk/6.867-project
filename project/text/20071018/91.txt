politics &amp economics polands bizarre political landscape kaczynski twins contentious actions spur new elections and possible end to leadership warsaw prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski of poland faces parliamentary elections sunday and many european diplomats and politicians barely conceal their hope he loses mr kaczynski and his identical twin brother lech polands president swept to power two years ago promising a revolution to free poland from its corrupt communist past and to aggressively assert its interests in europe in the process the former child actors now have scandalized the tolerant secular consensus on what it means to be a part of the european union in the past month alone they have blocked the eu from holding a day against capital punishment banned as a condition of membership in the bloc and lost three appeals at the european court of human rights on rulings that challenge conservative polish policies on abortion gay rights and the outing of ex communists they embrace a catholic radio station israel condemns for anti semitism the twins may be europes most provocative and caricatured politicians jaroslaw lives with his mother and has said he uses her bank account one western embassy keeps a special file on the twins marked "bizarre " they eschew the accepted boundaries of european statecraft this summer as he argued for poland to keep extra voting weight in the european union jaroslaw kaczynski said that were it not for massive world war ii casualties mostly at the hand of germany polands population would now be million rather than million "thats why the kaczynskis are so dangerous they appeal to these feelings of hate we all considered as overcome " said martin schulz the german head of center left parties in the european parliament which has clashed repeatedly with polands government the kaczynskis taboo busting style also represents a messy rebirth of democracy in eastern europe for years the former soviet bloc nations that joined the eu in were on their best behavior constrained by the goal of joining the north atlantic treaty organization and the eu now that they are in voters who have done less well since the collapse of communism in poland slovakia and other countries are with their guts and electing populists that has left the "old" eu countries increasingly unsure of how to get along with them "europe encouraged us to fight communism and now that we won you dont know what to do about it " said lech walesa a former polish president and the iconic leader of the anticommunist solidarity movement "i dont like the kaczynskis and i dont agree with them but i like the debate that they cause " he said polands populist trend has big implications for the governments plans now on ice to cut back polands fixed spending on subsidies and free up cash for education and other areas that economists say is needed to sustain growth over the longer term slovakia is trying to roll back some market oriented laws it is also bad news for further expansion of the eu where older countries like france are looking for reasons to stop the nation blocs growth seeing difficult new eu members as a threat to europes integration though poland is a u s ally with troops in iraq and a plan to host a u s missile shield the divisions the kaczynskis cause in europe are bad for the u s says timothy garton ash professor of european studies at oxford university they make it harder to get europe to act as one on major u s foreign policy goals such as handling russia he says fervent backers of a unified europe worry the teenaged democracies of the former communist countries arent ready for the eu the kaczynskis who have put loyalists in key posts across the country and launched a purge of former communists are certainly testing polands young institutions for all the upheaval polands democracy is proving stronger than many feared the economy is growing at more than and foreign investment hit a record high last year of euros billion euros &# billion earlier this year polands constitutional court threw out the worst excesses of the kaczynskis a law that had forced journalists doctors and other professionals to declare whether they had worked with the secret police before or lose their jobs "you have to accept poland will be different" from other european union countries president kaczynski told reporters in paris last week in what amounted to an hourlong lecture on his countrys deep catholicism and history of domination by other powers "i know many people in europe dont like it but thats the way it is " recent opinion polls put the kaczynskis law and justice party roughly level with the main opposition civic platform while a grouping of center left parties trails a distant third but even if his party gets the most votes prime minister kaczynski could have a tough time finding coalition partners to form a government his bruising style has alienated many candidates andrzej lepper leader of the rural left wing self defense party called jaroslaw kaczynski a "despot" and a "psychopath" in an interview and ruled out working with him again markets have been calm about sundays election which was caused by the collapse of jaroslaw kaczynskis coalition with self defense and the far right league of polish families both kaczynski brothers declined to be interviewed for
