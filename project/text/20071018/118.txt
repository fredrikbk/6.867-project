the daily fix in euro soccer preliminaries england is pushed to brink online edition last summers soccer world cup with teams from around the world had room for lovable underdogs such as trinidad &amp tobago which brightened the mood next summers euro championship with room only for teams from a continent that has of the worlds top teams is a considerably more cutthroat competition "in international soccer the world cup is a wedding a non stop month long party featuring a lot of teams that are just happy to be there " cathal kelly writes in the toronto star "it hardly matters to most if they get to be the bride or bridesmaids third or fourth place in a world cup actually means something ask south korea or turkey or croatia the euro has more in common with a funeral teams go there to get buried with only spots available many dont even make the trip in recent years we remember the high profile victims better than the almost rans " england is close to becoming the cups first high profile victim before play even begins after a loss to russia last night in qualifying sealed by two goals within four minutes from russia substitute roman pavlyuchenko england needs a lot of help to qualify for the euro cup russia only needs to beat both israel and a very weak andorra in its final two games to clinch a berth in the cup and eliminate england "and so barring the improbable assistance of those footballing pygmies macedonia israel and andorra england will spend next summer selling a soiled brand in asia or the americas while the real football goes on in europe " glenn moore writes in the independent "all hope is not yet lost although it has travelled to a far flung field " the times of london adds "probably for the first time these millionaires from planet premier league will be taking a close interest in events in the middle east next month hoping for a miracle in the holy land " the brave but devastating loss is a trademark of english teams tim rich writes in the daily telegraph "while the national rugby team have reacquainted us with the old english concept of the bloody minded victory so last night was the time to remember another great trait of this country the heroic defeat " the defeat is likely to cost coach steve mcclaren his job the daily telegraphs henry winter urges martin oneill as mr mcclarens replacement "with mcclarens days surely now numbered following this reverse and soho square accountants totting up the potential tens of millions lost by not qualifying the fa must appoint a true no a real leader someone of the substance of oneill currently reviving aston villa " score last nights qualifiers former soviet republics britain georgia beat scotland by that same score and now the scots must beat world cup champs italy to qualify the loss to a team scotland should have beaten exemplifies the teams problem scotsman columnist mike aitken writes "for all the progress scotland have made in international football over the past months the challenge of making the running against supposedly lesser opponents remains a more insurmountable hurdle than frustrating the european elite " the los angeles lakers are reportedly considering trading their discontented superstar kobe bryant and several columnists in eastern conference cities want their hometown teams to go for the prize "there was a time when id have said bryant is the most selfish problematic punk in sports " chicago sun times columnist jay mariotti writes in his brief for the bulls "the more i watch him i see a maniacal competitor who has the same cutthroat urgency to win titles while demanding the same hunger from the teammates and management around him that jordan possessed at a similar age funny how america overlooked michaels tantrums and scoring flurries and rooted for him to overcome adversity and win championships contrary to kobe who is viewed as a superbrat " in the new york sun john hollinger urges the knicks perhaps the only nba franchise more dysfunctional than the lakers to make a deal for bryant first though team chairman james dolan and coach isiah thomas or his replacement have to get their house in order so that the coveted prize might waive his no trade clause "the biggest change has to come off the court " mr hollinger writes "somehow dolan and thomas or whomever dolan hires to replace thomas need to convey to the basketball world that madison square garden is a respectable address again if they could demonstrate that there was some level of organizational humility and the capacity to admit mistakes or show that the coddling of stephon marbury has ceased or prove that they had some players who were capable of playing around bryant as opposed to the current gang of shoot first point guards and ball hungry post players those would all be steps toward making the knicks a viable destination again " philadelphia daily news columnist john smallwood is disappointed to report that kobe isnt likely to his pre nba home he was drafted out of lower merion high in a tony philly suburb "the sixers are in rebuilding mode and that plan doesnt include gutting your franchise to bring back the allen iverson era only with bryant substituting as the one man show " mr smallwood writes the colorado rockies are in the midst of a nine day layoff while the red sox and indians last night took a day off in the middle of clevelands three game homestand in the alcs dane cook might call this month waitober "baseball used to be able to laugh at sports like basketball and hockey with their ludicrous intermittent post season scheduling that forever bowed to the whims of television at the cost of fan interest and any sense of continuity " richard griffin writes in the toronto star "now with the rockies waiting nine days to play the world series baseball has become as guilty as any sport in diminishing its marquee event " with the alcs taking its break in cleveland and the indians needing just one win in their next three games to clinch a berth in the world series now is as good a time as any to reconsider the indians mascot "chief wahoo is the indians mascot a grotesque caricature grinning idiotically through enormous bucked teeth " nyu professor jonathan zimmerman writes in the christian science monitor "you can see him during this weeks american league championship series between the indians and the boston red sox hes a reminder of the days when whites regarded native americans as savages on the warpath with scalps dangling from their belts and its time for him to go " kansas city star columnist joe posnanski agrees in a post on his baseball blog "the only reason chief wahoo is around is because native americans dont have a strong enough voice in this country to put a stop to it when native americans protested at the world series they were mostly laughed at three were arrested is this really the kind of country we want to be and for what to stand up for our inherent rights to enjoy a racist sports logo " vernon bellecourt also agreed that its time for chief wahoo to go twice he was arrested for burning an effigy of the mascot mr bellecourt died last weekend at age "bellecourt indian activist citizen of the world politician provocateur and ambassador for the dispossessed was a giant force in helping to end the triumphal approach to the history of this state " nick coleman writes in the minneapolis star tribune the university of south florida began fielding a football team years ago today the bulls are undefeated and ranked no in the country not all scholastic football debuts are as successful "the first football season at stuart hobson middle school started off bad and ended early " dave mckenna writes in the washington city paper hapless play suspensions and two shutout losses culminated in an early end to the season because coach kip holland couldnt field a team "before the season opener against p r harris educational center holland says he told his team that they would win that game then would go on to an undefeated season that would shock the world " mr mckenna writes "he didnt believe either would happen he just wanted the first pep talk most of his kids ever heard to be a good one that plan didnt work " tip of the fix cap to reader don hartline and deadspin found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to
