sing it loud theyre black and proud new york taking their final bows on the opening night of "three mo tenors" at the little shubert theatre the stars saluted luciano pavarotti "without him " they added warmly "no us " a handsome gesture but the line of succession is more wish than fact conceived by creator director and choreographer marion j caffey as a "theatrical concert " the show has supposedly been playing to sold out houses across the country and internationally since now it has landed on new yorks theater row for a "limited engagement" code for one the producer hopes to keep extending forever that just might happen the gimmick is that all the singers are black and classically trained the claim is that they can do it all opera broadway jazz blues soul rhythm and blues new school spirituals gospel a range of styles spanning four centuries with a heavy skew to the th "the tenors of three mo tenors embody a musical repertoire of extraordinary breadth " says mr caffey "through song and dance we hope to elevate the stature of african american musical performers in the world our goal is to sing our way into history " well on every front but one that war was won long ago surely mr caffey remembers such legends as paul robeson cab calloway muddy waters bobby short sammy davis jr harry belafonte ray charles james brown bob marley gregory hines ben vereen brian stokes mitchell prince michael jackson none billed himself as a tenor of course but then the term simply indicates a voice range the highest of the three standard ranges of adult males distinguishing tenors from baritones or basses makes little difference in popular genres in classical music it matters a lot and most of all in opera the black male singers last frontier apart from george shirley a tenor of grace and refinement who came up in the s or the commanding if unpolished bass baritone simon estes who crested in the late s the considerable galaxy of black opera stars sopranos mezzos altos is made up overwhelmingly of women and what women marian anderson leontyne price grace bumbry kathleen battle jessye norman the list goes on on the evidence "three mo tenors" will do little to right the balance unlike the original three tenors pavarotti of course plus placido domingo and jose carreras each an icon in his own right the three mo are fungible a fact driven home by the fact that mr caffey has actually fielded two coequal full sets performing on alternating evenings the opening night audience something short of capacity heard kenneth alston jr ramone diggs and phumzile sojola "cast " the alternate cast "cast a" comprises james n berger jr duane a moody and victor robertson who sing the same ensemble numbers but different solos and theres also a standby sean miller the tenors operatic credentials as captured in the bios range from respectable to thin and while none lists a major role with a major company some have indeed tackled major roles in less stellar surroundings opera is a tough racket any singer who can get through a lead in "la boheme " "the barber of seville" or "carmen" on any stage has accomplished something to be proud of but then the same applies on broadway or in a jazz cellar or recital hall according to one study a live performer in any medium at any level of accomplishment experiences the same stresses as a soldier going into battle make of the science what you will excellence is a separate matter "three mo tenors" opens with a three way rendition of "la donna e mobile " the dukes hit tune from "rigoletto " performed in tails the opening night cast came out smiling and gamely made a hash of the fancy bits then each man sang an aria on his own mr sojola of nelson mandela bay south africa led the way with the dashing "questa o quella " another aria of the dukes his roly poly build and full moon of a face recalled the late lamented luciano his tone glowed with a sunny sweetness and he looked at ease in the spotlight but classical technique youll hear better at the conservatory mr alston from the bronx wiry and in dreadlocks introduced himself as a countertenor offering "ombra mai fu " popularly known as handels "largo " delivered with touching sincerity and suspect vowels the tall lanky mr diggs of amarillo texas came to grief in "le reve " from massenets "manon " which must float high and light like spun silk instead the line was tense the pitch sagged and the singers demeanor was that of a whipped puppy once past the operatic segment it got better thank heaven mr sojolas honeyed sound shed its grace on "bring him home " the teary ballad from "les miserables " returning for "who can i turn to " from "the roar of the greasepaint the smell of the crowd " mr diggs was simply a different person confident communicative and in charge mr alston back in the tenor register shone in the traditional "noways tired " but most of the best licks came when all three joined forces as in "make them hear you " an anthem from "ragtime " sung with dignity and ardor or in a good time call and response number from south africa designed for audience participation the highlight of the evening was an arc of spirituals sung not as a vehicle for showy emotionalism but simply deeply truly changing outfits a variety of jackets a bit of native costume for the south african segment gave the proceedings a touch of flash as did richard winklers rainbow array of lighting effects without placing great demands on their dancing skills mr caffeys steps made the singers look coordinated hip and sassy at the piano keith burton the white music director accompanied the arias that opened the concert in purely supportive fashion from then on the singers had the benefit of fabiola leon and etienn litel on keyboards carl carter on bass and steve williams on drums a combo unfazed by any idiom thrown at them audiences who love this celebration of black pride and versatility will want to know that mr caffey is expanding the franchise with "three mo divas" divas be it noted not sopranos which sets the bar rather high they start an american road tour on sunday in san antonio the web site www modivas com lists over two dozen one night stands through february with extended engagements in toronto and denver to follow divas personalities are more precious commodities than mere tenors think josephine baker mahalia jackson billie holiday ella fitzgerald sarah vaughn eartha kitt odetta aretha franklin diana ross mariah carey beyonce knowles if mr caffeys stable lives up to his hopeful hype we aint seen nothin yet mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on culture and philanthropy
