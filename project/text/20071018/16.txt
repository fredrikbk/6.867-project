capital central banks map a middle course watching the global financial system writhe these days is like watching iraq from afar theres no doubt about the pain but its difficult to discern exactly whats happening or even if conditions are improving or worsening about the only certainty is that many more people now claim that the mess was "inevitable" than were actually preparing for it the story so far the merry go round of rising housing prices stopped early in builders were thrown off first then subprime borrowers because these homeowners could no longer tap rising home values to refinance mortgages they couldnt afford defaults and foreclosures spread more rapidly than investors in mortgage backed securities had anticipated until late spring there was a case that the worst of the housing collapse was past and damage to the rest of the economy had been contained by summer that case was shattered housing prices kept falling a surprise to many "the ongoing housing correction is not ending as quickly as it might have appeared late last year " treasury secretary henry paulson said in an unusually blunt speech this week "and it now looks like it will continue to adversely impact our economy our capital markets and many homeowners for some time yet " then in august the problem in the u s housing sector became a global financial problem and thats when things got complicated a lot of subprime mortgages had been turned into securities that were sold to outfits that relied on short term borrowing with the value of those securities in doubt these outfits could no longer borrow and turned to the banks that had created the securities or which had promised to lend to them in a pinch since no bank was sure who was or would be stuck with this toxic waste banks grew wary about lending to one another a classic case of distrust that called for central banks to provide credit which they did in the weeks since mortgage markets have remained troubled but other financial markets seem to be improving to the federal reserves great relief the &# billion sale of texas utility txu to private equity firms went through and this week in one of the biggest junk bond deals since the summer first data an electronic payment processing firm raised &# billion in debt albeit at a pricey yield of citigroup and some other big banks clearly remain uneasy about the overhang of mortgage backed securities that could be dumped on the market if the various funds that own them cant easily borrow hence the efforts by the u s treasury and some big bankers to organize a megainvestment pool to buy them but why did the woes of the relatively small subprime slice of the overall financial system have such a big effect on the markets it was "more a trigger than a fundamental cause of the financial turmoil " fed chairman ben bernanke the nations economics professor in chief explained this week investors lenders and home buyers had become giddy interest rates had been low for a long time despite higher oil prices and the housing bust the u s economy kept growing europe and japan were back and emerging markets seemed invincible investors and lenders were taking ever greater risks with ever lower standards and not just in housing the cassandras who said this couldnt last and there were some were ignored until august when suddenly the unquenchable appetite for risky investments abated "conditions causing the turmoil in financial markets were long in the making and these causes should not be conflated with the particular troubles in the mortgage market " fed governor kevin warsh said recently the fed and its counterparts abroad have made their objectives clear do whats necessary to keep financial markets functioning and prevent a financial crisis from provoking an unwelcome recession encourage the return of more prudent realistic attitudes among investors lenders and borrowers notice that the fed and other central banks are not trying to restore conditions to the ebullience of earlier this year "greater caution on the part of investors seems appropriate " mr bernanke said this week acknowledging that that implies "financial restraint on economic growth as credit becomes more expensive and difficult to obtain " that pregnant sentence says a lot the fed is trying to do enough cutting rates lending to banks to avoid repeating mistakes its predecessors made in the s that exacerbated the great depression but it doesnt want to do so much cutting rates further appearing to be organizing a bailout that investors start feeling giddy again even by central banking standards thats a very delicate balance to strike wish them luck
