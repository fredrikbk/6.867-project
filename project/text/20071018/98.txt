departments no mr morford a year old former assistant u s attorney in cleveland has been the departments parachuting troubleshooter for years and he hasnt been afraid to ruffle feathers in august when he was named as acting deputy former attorney general alberto gonzales gave him a mandate to act like a chief operating officer hired to fix a company in crisis that was one month before mr gonzales resigned from the top job now with the imminent arrival of mr mukasey administration officials have backed off nominating mr morford a year veteran of the department and suggested mr mukasey make his own pick for deputy according to people familiar with the matter such a move however could raise questions from mr morfords supporters among the ranks of u s attorneys in particular about whether he was denied the job because of his past work on politically sensitive cases that have hurt republicans mr mukasey whose confirmation hearings are expected to conclude today after which it may take another week for the senate to set a vote already faces a difficult task in the aftermath of the firings last year of several u s attorneys which culminated with mr gonzaless resignation nine of the most senior positions at the justice department are held by temporary replacements the question of why the department fired the attorneys which still hasnt been fully answered sparked a torrent of criticism from allegations that mr gonzales politicized the department to controversy over the administrations warrantless wiretaps yesterday at his confirmation hearings mr mukasey a year old former chief judge of new yorks southern district was greeted warmly by lawmakers in response to questions from sen patrick leahy the vermont democrat who chairs the senate judiciary committee he expressed disdain for a justice department memo that allowed harsh interrogation methods to be used on suspected terror detainees unlike mr gonzales who refused to distance himself from the memo during his confirmation hearing mr mukasey said the legal document "was worse than a sin it was a mistake it was unnecessary " he said he didnt believe the president had executive power to override laws banning torture mr mukasey said he planned to allow only a "very few" people at the department to interact with political officials "hiring is going to be based solely on competence and ability and dedication and not based on whether somebodys got an r or a d next to their name " he said in that light mr morford presents mr mukasey with a dilemma justice officials say mr mukasey shouldnt be forced to accept someone who is essentially the white houses pick however in the ranks of the department bypassing the acting no could be problematic at least three times in recent years mr morfords work has figured in electoral politics harming the election of republicans in the process mr morford led the case against former democratic congressman james traficant of ohio who was convicted of bribery and racketeering in he was sent to detroit to fix the botched prosecution of the first major post terrorism case he untangled a messy corruption prosecution in ohio during the election season which cost the republicans the top elected jobs in the state and last year he was deployed to nashville where justice officials thought a troubled u s attorneys office needed some management help u s district judge gerald rosen who handled the terror case in detroit and who is a friend of mr mukasey says of mr morford "he was mr fix it he had rock solid judgment and an extremely high level of integrity theres no doubt in mind craig followed every lead followed evidence to where it led " in that case mr morford moved to have the charges dismissed after determining that the mistakes made by prosecutors were insurmountable "im a firm believer that if i do my job as best as i can and make the decisions as best i can i dont have to worry " mr morford said in an interview in his fourth floor office at justice headquarters across from a portrait of edward bates president lincolns attorney general he said he doesnt know whether mr mukasey plans to give him the job permanently mr morford has his critics including a web site called morford watch which logs allegations of misdeeds in his handling of the traficant and the detroit terror cases a former prosecutor who led the detroit case in which north african immigrants were accused of operating a terrorist "sleeper cell " went on trial this week on charges of obstructing justice and making false statements the former prosecutor richard convertino has filed his own lawsuit against the justice department alleging that the department retaliated against him for being a "whistle blower" in criticizing its counterterrorism strategy mr morford said that he hasnt looked at the web site and that the allegations are without merit
