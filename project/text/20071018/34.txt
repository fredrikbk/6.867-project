democrats plan stopgap measure to curb amt washington democrats are planning a temporary measure that would prevent the alternative minimum tax from hitting more people this year and extend several popular tax breaks for individuals and businesses house and senate lawmakers say that with time running out on the legislative calendar they want to act on a one year package soon rep charles rangel d n y the chairman of the house tax panel said for the first time yesterday that such a measure would be necessary this year "theres no question that that has to be done this year " mr rangel said he had been holding out for a broader overhaul bill but said he didnt want must do tax items to be held hostage to it the amt is a parallel income tax originally designed to prevent very wealthy people from avoiding taxes altogether but it has been biting deeper into the middle class and is expected to hit million people this year without new legislation the change under consideration would protect most of those people roughly million from the amt reducing their tax bill by about &# billion this year complicating the situation are pay as you go budget rules which democrats reinstated when they took control of congress this year which require new spending or tax cuts to be financed by offsetting spending cuts or tax increases the tax package would be worth between &# billion and &# billion and the rules require any tax cuts and spending increases to be offset mr rangel and his senate counterpart sen max baucus d mont have suggested they will try to abide by pay go but it will be politically painful and perhaps impossible to find offsets the senate and house can agree on "its difficult to come up with measures that will pass offsets that will pass recognizing that we need votes in the senate " mr baucus said "my preference is not to waive pay go " mr rangel said he plans next week to release his separate broader tax overhaul plan it is unlikely to even come up for a vote in the house this year but it will send signals about the direction of future overhaul the bill includes permanent elimination of the amt as well as a reduction in corporate tax rates and expanded deductions and credits aimed at lower and middle income people it would be fully offset mr rangel said though he didnt specify how wealthier individuals would likely have to pay higher taxes and the corporate rate cut would be offset by closing corporate tax loopholes the broad overhaul idea never caught on this year in the senate where mr baucus has consistently spoken of a temporary remedy for the amt mr baucus said he is eyeing next week or possibly soon after for consideration of a limited tax bill in his committee but in the house many democrats have pushed for "tax equity" with a bill that would deliver tax breaks to roughly million people while making about one million wealthier people pay more mr rangel said "it seems as though im leaning toward waiting until next year for the vote" on the larger bill if lawmakers stick to pay go a variety of controversial offset proposals floated throughout the year could gain momentum and new ones are likely to surface lawmakers have floated limits on certain tax deferred compensation plans used by executives or on the ability of hedge fund managers to defer taxes by holding their money offshore in the house some want to increase taxes paid by private equity managers and others on "carried interest " mr rangel didnt say if he would include that idea which appears unlikely to get through the senate in his legislation
