in august that veteran manager scott schoelzel would be leaving janus in a release at the time the company noted mr schoelzels "significant contributions " mr schoelzel said it was "time to consider new challenges " the main driver of the stock price has been performance which has bounced back at several janus funds and stayed strong at others many are top performers for their categories this year according to morningstar inc offerings like the janus overseas fund and the janus contrarian fund are doing particularly well the janus twenty fund and the janus adviser forty fund which mr

upgraded the stock to "neutral" from "sell" but cited intech as a concern janus says the units long term returns remain strong departures and other staff changes have been another issue in addition to mr schoelzel several other portfolio managers have left this year an institutional asset management executive a european sales executive and its chief financial officer also have departed such changes could suggest "all is not happy in janusland " says morningstar analyst rachel barnard at a recent internal town hall style meeting in denver top executives had to assuage employees concerns about the
