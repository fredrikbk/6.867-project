seen his paid subscription base grow to from in the past six years its all part of what could be called the halloween inc boom the national retail federation estimates that spending on halloween items ranging from candy to decorations will reach a record &# billion this year up more than from its not just your typical decorating however the extremepumpkins site showcases pumpkins transformed into everything from the horror film heroine carrie to a "pimple faced booger eater " but we were hoping we could just carve something more ambitious than our usual triangular eyed jack o lantern but still within our limited artistic and technical reach and within the realm of safety theres no shortage of warnings concerning handling all those sharp carving tools we tapped a variety of resources web sites books and software that each offered tips and some designs for a modest price the carving tools ranging from scoops to saws are extra and in some instances not always available through the same merchant then we headed to a community pumpkin patch where our purchase of several plus size pumpkins had the staff scratching their heads "its an experiment " we explained and sometimes a rather bizarre one at that take our experience with "the halloween jack o lantern " a new book and dvd package that bills itself as "an old time halloween in a box " while it promised to help us carve our pumpkin we had to get past a lot of extraneous material the book includes everything from halloween recipes pumpkin chili anyone to a nathaniel hawthorne short story the minute dvd is intended more

for the publisher explained that said the book offers some basic carving pointers the tip to cover your carving area with plastic sheeting is valuable since the process does get extremely messy and the package includes seven laminated stencils with fairly easy to execute designs we went with a grinning face pattern that straddled the line between silly and scary pc jack o lantern a software program from m&amp r technologies that can be downloaded directly from a web site www pcjackolantern com for &# offers a more tailored approach you can choose from printable templates we went with a not too intricate one dubbed "the guardian " of a haunted tree or create your own from an array of facial features best of all the program which includes nicely illustrated carving tips asks for the sizing of your pumpkin so that it can create templates that fit accordingly theres nothing worse than carving a complicated design on an extra large pumpkin and realizing all the details will be lost in a sea of orange flesh but we still would have liked more design choices and perhaps a more innovative approach to designing your own pumpkin a company spokesman noted that the programs goal is to be as kid friendly as possible with the carving web sites pumpkinwizard com and jps jammin pumpkins www jamminpumpkins com the design choices are upped considerably pumpkin wizard gives you free

pumpkin instead of tape but we think well be more comfortable with jammin pumpkin when weve jammed a little longer say by next halloween and for this halloween we especially liked tom nardones "extreme pumpkins " for two reasons not only does the book take that "extreme" approach offering designs for pumpkins resembling everything from an electrocution victim to a roadkill eating carnivore

used in the "radioactive pumpkin" or in some instances created with the "guts" of the pumpkin itself as in the "puking pumpkin" we chose where the seeds and gooey bits of flesh do an effective job of
