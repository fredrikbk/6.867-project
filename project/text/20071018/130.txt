why consolidation storm is brewing in beer industry the worlds beer giants are showing a growing thirst for consolidation as they try to gain leverage with suppliers distributors and retailers amid slowing sales in the u s and western europe a week after two of americas iconic brewers said they will combine forces two european titans heineken nv and carlsberg as said yesterday that they have formed a consortium to bid for the united kingdoms best selling brewer scottish &amp newcastle plc the companies said they plan to divide up the assets of s&amp n which has a market value of &# billion the edinburgh scotland brewer however reacted coolly calling the proposition "unsolicited and unwelcome " the announcement followed news that londons sabmiller plc planned to combine its u s unit miller brewing co with the u s division of molson coors brewing co creating a joint venture called millercoors the maneuvers coming about years after the most recent wave of beer industry consolidation are a reaction to shifts in beer drinking habits across the globe in western europe and the u s beer sales growth is sluggish amid increasing competition from wine and spirits in many emerging economies however including eastern europe and china sales are booming another factor prompting consolidation is the rising cost of key commodities like grain glass and aluminum which is squeezing profit margins in the worlds mature beer markets brewers seeking to consolidate hope to use their increased market share to negotiate better deals for everything from commodities to advertising that could bolster profits thats part of what miller and coors plan to do in the u s as they seek to forge a stronger competitor to long dominant anheuser busch cos its also a key objective of netherlands based heineken in the united kingdom jean francois van boxmeer the companys chief executive said in an interview last month that the beer industry today takes so much capital that it isnt worth the expense being in many of the worlds markets unless your company is either the no or no player and he said the best deals are ones that beef up a brewers share of an existing market not ones where it expands into a virgin one "consolidation in terms of operational benefits synergies is essentially a local thing " mr van boxmeer said s&amp ns marketing and distribution clout in the u k could help boost the paltry market share of heinekens namesake brew which as a premium brand sells for higher margins carlsberg of denmark and heineken said they may make an offer likely in cash for scottish &amp newcastle which makes newcastle brown ale its best known brand in the u s as well as john smiths and kronenbourg under the planned deal carlsberg the worlds fifth largest beer maker by volume or quantity of beer sold would acquire full control of a joint venture it owns equally with s&amp n in russia where beer drinking is growing as the populace turns away from hard liquor the venture baltic beverages holding ab has the leading market share there led by baltika russias best selling beer carlsberg also would acquire s&amp ns operations in france and greece heineken the worlds fourth largest brewer by volume would take over s&amp ns u k brands and other european markets combined heineken would be nearly twice as big in europe by market share in terms of volume as the next biggest player carlsberg heineken also would increase its share of the u s market through the deal it would import newcastle brown ale which had of the highly fragmented market for imported beers in the u s last year according to beer marketers insights an industry publication the heineken brand is the second largest imported beer in the u s after grupo modelo sas corona heineken could use that size to help raise newcastle brown ales u s profile imports account for about of the u s beer market heineken and carlsberg left in question how other joint ventures would be carved up including businesses in fast growing regions such as india and china the brewers havent approached scottish &amp newcastle a person close to the matter said the consortium aims to negotiate a friendly deal but scottish &amp newcastle said it "is confident in its future as an independent group" and "strongly urges shareholders to take no action " a sign that it fears the consortium may try to buy shares in the market the move marks the latest example of a breakup proposal from corporate buyers who group together to acquire businesses that for a variety of reasons couldnt be snapped up by just one bidder a group of three european banks this month clinched a record &# billion takeover of dutch lender abn amro holding nv the sprawling operations will be sliced apart and divided among the buyers consortium bids have been increasing in recent years because despite the difficulty of assembling groups of competitors and getting them to agree on value and strategy together they can pay a higher price and often overcome obstacles such as antitrust concerns that no single buyer could surmount shares of s&amp n surged to gbp or &# because rumors of a bid for the company have been around so long the consortium considers the price on march of gbp to be the best reflection of where the shares traded before the rumors began according to a person familiar with the matter because carlsberg is already a joint venture partner with s&amp n it could be difficult to assemble a rival group to make a counterbid the venture has a clause that allows one side to buy back the others stake one potential buyer is sabmiller but the company earlier indicated it wouldnt be interested in s&amp n at least not as a solo bidder sabmiller chief financial officer malcolm wyman said in april the western european beer market is "singularly unattractive " sabmiller is the worlds second largest beer maker by volume after belgiums inbev sa another possible suitor for s&amp n is anheuser busch the worlds third largest brewer by volume the st louis based beer maker is heavily dependent on the u s market and may be attracted to the opportunity to gain a big stake in russia or the u k w randolph baker anheusers chief financial officer declined to comment
