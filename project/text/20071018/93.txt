putting a little pizzazz in the family sedan auto makers try to stoke buzz by adding stylish features to a dull class of vehicles the everyday family sedan is undergoing a transformation from stodgy to stylish as drivers begin to demand more from their basic transportation than a nondescript appliance on wheels some call it the target effect after the budget retailer that has successfully applied costly looking design and style to inexpensive commonplace items from soap to sofas now car makers are following suit with their mass market midsize sedans which have long sold in high volume despite their decidedly unstylish looks in the past two years cars like toyota motor corp s camry nissan motor co s altima general motors corp s saturn aura chrysler llcs sebring and other basic family haulers with starting prices under &# have begun to resemble more expensive models thanks to distinctive shapes and attention to details like wheel design chrome trim and paint colors two of the latest models gms redesigned chevrolet malibu and honda motor co s accord are especially dramatic departures from previous versions which were often criticized for looking like generic rental cars from some angles the new accord bears a resemblance to a &# bmw series the malibus smooth sided aerodynamic looking body and low cut roof remind one of the lexus ls which costs more than three times as much the malibu and accord which are just arriving at dealerships roughly mark the fruition of a marketwide turnaround thats been under way for a couple of years for the first time in years ordinary sedans from ford chrysler chevrolet honda and other marques dont all look the same or similarly unexciting the emphasis on styling is part of a strategy to increase sales and profit as buyers turn away from once reliable cash cows such as pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles the midsize sedan market has declined from january through september according to j d power &amp associates but over the period pickup truck sales have fallen and suv sales have fallen going forward car makers see high fuel prices and other financial worries limiting family budgets and adding to the appeal of more economical and fuel efficient cars consumers are likely to see more styling upgrades in the midsize sedan market and may see changes happening more frequently as car makers keep tweaking their designs to outdo competitors anne james a year old sales and marketing associate in springdale ark says she has been shopping for a new car and plans to buy one within the next week her leading candidate the nissan altima in part because of its new styling "when i first looked at the new one i thought wow theyve changed a lot " ms james says "i like the overall body shape and the way the headlights and taillights wrap around it looks like a more expensive car " even though the honda accord which is also on her shopping list has a better reputation for reliability shes leaning toward the nissan because she likes the way it looks "if im going to spend this much money i should get a car that i enjoy driving " says ms james industry research indicates consumers care more about styling than they used to whether they are buying an expensive luxury vehicle or a bread and butter family car about of people planning to buy a basic midsize sedan say styling is a top consideration compared with in according to surveys conducted by cnw marketing research a firm in bandon ore while developing the new accord says lisa macdonald a senior marketing analyst at honda the company noticed that styling and design are becoming more important to consumers indeed the new accord is a striking example of a sedan using design cues to spice up its once staid image the new model forsakes the plain slab sided look of previous accords in favor of deeply creased flanks large wraparound taillights and pronounced headlights that bulge outward instead of fitting flush with the front end the car also features such luxury style touches as chrome trim and flared fenders and sharply defined wheel arches "the objective was to convey a sense of upscale sophistication " says ms macdonald the theme continues inside the car going beyond simple cosmetic changes to subtle details one feature the cars developers like to point out is a wider center console and armrest between the front seats so the driver and front passenger have less chance of bumping elbows crystal windham design manager for the chevrolet malibu says the swing toward more stylish family cars isnt as sudden as it may seem while working on the previous malibu the company focused on improving fit finish and the quality of materials more than the cars appearance with the model her team was able to focus more on styling and interior features to set the car apart from rivals "we like to have a few wow features that customers will notice " says ms windham describing the malibus two tone seats trimmed with piping and its "dual cockpit" interior which recalls chevrolets corvette sports cars of the s but the design feature that may get the most notice is a practical one a covered compartment in the center console that is long enough to conceal a reasonably large handbag the degree to which the restyled sedans stand out in traffic is a point of debate critics say the honda looks like a hodgepodge of elements from other makers that the chrysler sebring is still too conservative and that the toyota camry may be too much of a styling departure for some traditional buyers some longtime industry watchers say that the new styling is more hype than substance "what im seeing are a lot of boring cars that are supposed to be stylish " says david healy an analyst with burnham securities he also says that for gm ford and chrysler spicing up their sedans is aimed more at maintaining market share than at increasing profit "i think the cars are probably break even placeholders for the detroit three " mr healy says adding that profit margins are "probably quite a bit better" for honda toyota and other imports because of lower production costs the midsize sedan segment is among the industrys most crowded and competitive and the new emphasis on these cars comes at a time when car makers are also focusing more resources in their most promising segments such as so called crossover vehicles rebates and other incentives required to attract sedan buyers cut into already thin margins this is the case even with newer models special deals include a &# rebate on hyundai motor co s sonata and a &# rebate on chryslers sebring for returning customers
