politics &amp economics education funding looms as key budget battleground washington education funding is set to be the next big budget battle for democrats who are trying to build on todays house veto confrontation with president bush over health insurance for the children of working class families the chosen battering ram is a giant appropriations bill that funds the heart of the domestic budget and seeks to outbid mr bush on his own legacy the no child left behind education act the house has already approved an increase for education including &# billion more than proposed by the president for his no child programs which impose a system of national tests but also promise money to improve core teaching of math and reading in public schools among the dozen annual spending bills required to operate the government this one will be the key to unlocking any final agreement for spending all told about &# billion is expected to be added to the presidents requests for not just education but also labor and health and human services programs those spending levels all but guarantee a second veto fight with mr bush in which the president is again expected to prevail but together with the child health care debate it could be the one two punch democrats need to pressure moderate republicans to sue for peace and ask the white house to compromise on domestic spending it is a gamble but both sides say they have an interest in settling after using the veto fights to define themselves politically democrats fear that without some agreement on overall domestic appropriations they face a protracted stalemate the democratic budget adopted last spring assumed about &# billion more than mr bush requested in discretionary spending for fiscal much of the extra money actually went to restore cuts proposed by the administration privately lawmakers say an agreement that splits this difference might be workable the education department budget is especially sensitive because the no child left behind law is coming up for renewal democrats have long smarted over the level of funding provided to help local public school systems meet the requirements rep george miller d cal chairman of the house education and labor committee predicted "turmoil" in his partys caucus if no agreement is reached that promises an increase in education funding "for five years there has been a pattern of underfunding and if thats going to continue thats a big problem for me " said mr miller house appropriations committee chairman david obey d wis said flatly "i have no intention of voting for no child left behind if the president isnt going to live up to his commitments " apart from education the underlying bill covers the departments of labor and health and human services which administer medicare and medicaid health care benefit programs for the elderly poor and disabled total expenditures for would exceed &# billion but the debate focuses on about a quarter of this or &# billion in discretionary spending that can be adjusted by congress each year current discretionary spending for these accounts is about &# billion or &# billion above what mr bush allows in his budget democrats argue that the increases they have proposed are in the to range overall and far less than the rapid growth seen in the pentagons budget for the coming year
