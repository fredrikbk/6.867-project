dna test for cervical cancer gains support accuracy is greater than pap exams false positive fears dna testing is more accurate in detecting cervical cancer and its precursors than conventional pap tests according to a pair of large scale studies that bolster previous findings researchers not involved with the studies said the new findings strengthen the case for dna testing although some warned that such tests could lead to false positives and unnecessary follow up procedures for some women in the food and drug administration approved dna tests in conjunction with pap smears for women over the age of but use of the tests isnt widespread because of their higher cost and doctors lack of familiarity with the method previous research had supported the greater effectiveness of the dna screen but the latest studies are more authoritative because of their size and rigorous methodology far more common in developing countries cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women world wide with nearly new cases and fatalities a year in recent decades screening has sharply reduced cervical cancer in the u s where there are about new diagnoses and deaths a year the new studies published in this weeks new england journal of medicine were conducted by separate research groups in canada and sweden both compared conventional pap smears to dna testing for human papillomavirus or hpv hpv is an infection that can cause cervical cancer although in most women it is short lived and doesnt lead to the disease a pap test involves examining tissue samples from the cervix under a microscope for abnormal cells with the other test dna or deoyxribonucleic acid the chemical blueprint in all living cells is extracted from the tissue and measured for the presence of hpv the canadian study involved more than women ages to years old who received both tests researchers focused on how well the first test they received detected precancerous lesions the dna tests did so of the time while the pap tests had a accuracy rate the dna tests were also more likely to result in a false positive wherein a woman had the virus but no sign of cancer but given that tests higher accuracy rate "in terms of a tradeoff i think it is probably something we can live with " said lead author marie helene mayrand an obstetrician gynecologist at the university of montreal hospital center the swedish researchers followed women ages to divided into two groups one group received only pap tests and the other received both kinds at the start of the study cancer or precancerous lesions were found in more women in the second group in follow up screenings women who received both tests were more than less likely to show signs of the disease that werent detected initially philip castle a national cancer institute epidemiologist who wasnt involved with the studies said the findings provide further evidence that dna testing is a "promising technology" that could allow women who test negative to go longer between screenings but the bigger challenge he added is bringing screening of any kind to the parts of the world where cervical cancer is most prevalent in an editorial in the journal carolyn runowicz director of the neag comprehensive cancer center at university of connecticut health center advised caution noting that neither study compared dna screening to more sophisticated "liquid based" pap tests now common in the u s and that of american women diagnosed with cervical cancer havent had any recent screening
