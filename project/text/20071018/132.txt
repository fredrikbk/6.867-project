world bank runaround the worlds finance ministers descend on washington this weekend for the annual meetings of the world bank and the international monetary fund and true to type bank officials and their media boswells are doing their best to sweep the issue of corruption under the carpet a letter from the bank published today on the preceding page illustrates the point the letter from external affairs vice president marwan muasher responds to our october editorial "smiling past corruption " which reported the conclusions of seven internal investigations into bank projects in cambodia the investigations conducted by the banks anticorruption unit int revealed stunning levels of fraud extortion bid rigging bribe taking and what the bank euphemistically calls "misprocurement" in nearly every aspect of the examined projects yet far from acting decisively to recover its stolen assets debar corrupt companies and penalize the phnom penh government the bank did what it could to return quickly to business as usual mr muasher nonetheless insists "the world bank is confronting corruption head on" in cambodia and we really wish we could believe him in transparency international ranked cambodia on its corruption perception index next to such all stars as the central african republic in cambodia was ranked whatever the bank is doing doesnt seem to be helping mr muasher also says "it was bank staff in cambodia who first raised concerns about corruption in projects there " that is true in some cases though not all but the real issue is how the bank responds once the nasty details are laid before it also slippery is his remark that the bank suspended the cambodian governments "right to draw funds for three projects where the bank had identified problems " but seven projects were identified by int as rife with corruption and it would be good to know why the other four fell from the banks radar screen similar questions hang over the funds mr muasher says were either cancelled by the bank &# million or refunded to it by the cambodians &# million in a february letter to the cambodian finance minister james adams the banks vice president for the east asia and pacific region tallies the contract values of just five of the troublesome projects his numbers add up to &# million in contracts of which &# million had already been disbursed weve posted the letter on opinionjournal com that ought to mean that at least &# million dollars not &# million should have been cancelled a discrepancy presumably explained by the banks decision to shut down only three projects instead of five or seven it also ought to mean that the cambodians should have refunded &# million and not &# million here the discrepancy is explained by an arrangement worked out by mr adams and described in his letter to demand the "accelerated" repayment of only a portion of the funds so what happened to the remaining &# million our sources say that whenever the matter is raised at the bank "the topic is changed " these sums may seem small compared to the banks grand moral ambitions however total bank lending to cambodia between and was &# million and the int lacked the resources to investigate every project what the int found one project after another corrupted root to branch was almost certainly symptomatic of what happens across the board not to worry adds mr muasher because cambodias government has "agreed to incorporate anti corruption action plans" in the future thus the bank is resuming business as usual first on the hope that the government keeps its promises wed have thought the better way to reduce corruption would be to withhold money until the government proves it will in fact do something the bank is ignoring some of its own not so distant experience here in july the bank cancelled a portion of funds for a "demobilization project" involving the distribution of cash free motorbikes and other goodies to former soldiers after the cambodian government inflated the list of those who were supposedly eligible for the handouts yet by february all was forgiven with cambodia country director ian porter telling associated press that "the government has taken significant steps toward resolving these issues " perhaps they were even "action plans " in his letter mr muasher reminds us that cambodia is still recovering from its s genocide all the more reason then for the bank to ensure that the money it spends goes to benefit the people of cambodia not corrupt middlemen its smooth assurances notwithstanding the banks behavior in cambodia looks like a classic example of downplaying corruption as rapidly as possible so the bank can get on with shoveling ever more money out the door regardless of results
