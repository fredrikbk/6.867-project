gordian knot how london created a snarl in global markets sivs fueled debt boom but now banks scramble to prop up the funds years ago two london bankers left citigroup inc to set up a company specializing in a new kind of investment fund they named their firm gordian knot ltd they said because they liked the legend about alexander the great solving a complex knot by simply taking a sword to it now the u s treasury and the worlds biggest banks are grappling with their own baffling knot how to prevent the unraveling of an entire class of such funds called structured investment vehicles from turning into a financial and economic disaster the industry that grew out of the efforts of the two bankers nicholas sossidis and stephen partridge hicks is in trouble fears are rife that dozens of huge structured investment vehicles or sivs many of them affiliated with banks will be forced to unload billions of dollars of mortgage backed securities and other assets such a fire sale could cripple debt markets that play a crucial role in the global economy by providing financing for everything from company payrolls to mortgage loans in recent weeks bankers and treasury officials have held a string of urgent meetings to address the problem they summoned messrs sossidis and partridge hicks because of their expertise in sivs which until weeks earlier some of them had never even heard about gordian knot runs the worlds biggest such fund with some &# billion in assets from an office in londons ritzy mayfair district the two bankers are part of a small coterie of london bankers who engendered what became a &# billion industry the funds boomed because they allowed banks to reap profits from investments in newfangled securities but without setting aside capital to mitigate the risk now the industry has become a significant threat to the stability of global financial markets after the recent meetings citigroup bank of america corp and j p morgan chase &amp co announced an extraordinary effort they will attempt to raise a fund of as much as &# billion by the end of the year aimed at supporting an orderly unwinding of many sivs with an eye toward restoring investors confidence in the debt markets that the funds use to raise money they chose &# billion as a goal for the superfund based on a back of the envelope calculation roughly one third of the &# billion in debt issued by sivs would be coming due in the next six to nine months the plan faces significant obstacles some bankers have been hesitant to take part on the grounds that it would amount to a private sector bailout of citigroup an assertion the bank denies citigroup is the largest player in the siv market with seven funds holding about &# billion in assets many investors are skeptical "conceptually its a good idea but we prefer higher quality paper " said chris vincent head of william blair &amp co a chicago based firm with &# billion in fixed income investments he added that the firm has not been comfortable with sivs "and this would be like a super version of one " the funds sponsors have countered that it wont be a sweetheart deal for the sivs theyll have to pay a fee to take part accept a discounted price for their assets and help insure investors against losses the fund has garnered the support of big investors such as fidelity investments and banks including wachovia corp the late s when the idea for sivs was born was a period of sweeping change in the credit markets the concept of securities backed by home mortgages was evolving and the junk bond boom that made michael milken famous was going strong mr partridge hicks working in london and mr sossidis based in new york were looking for a better way for citigroup clients pension funds and banks to profit from the nascent market for securities backed by assets such as commercial mortgages and credit card receivables the two bankers hatched the idea of setting up a fund that would issue short term commercial paper and medium term notes to investors then use the money to buy higher yielding assets typically longer term ones the bank would profit by collecting fees for operating the fund the funds assets would belong to its investors so they would stay off the banks balance sheet sivs had an advantage over conduits a similar structure that was already gaining popularity they didnt require banks to cover fully the funds debts if the commercial paper market dried up in and messrs sossidis and partridge hicks launched the first two such structures for citigroup called alpha finance corp and beta finance corp both attracted investors garnered high credit ratings and generated hefty profits for the bank in the two men left citigroup to form gordian knot assets in sivs ballooned into the hundreds of billions of dollars globally but the business remained local dominated by london based bankers and lawyers many of whom had some connection to citigroup after the departure of messrs sossidis and partridge hicks citigroups london office launched five more sivs with names such as centauri and dorada their combined assets reached &# billion earlier this year in two more bankers left citigroup for germanys dresdner kleinwort to help arrange an siv called k corp citigroup also earned fees by helping other banks arrange sivs such as tango finance ltd which it set up for dutch bank rabobank in london law firms too got into the action last year the london office of chicago law firm mayer brown assisted german bank hsh nordbank in the creation of an siv called carrera capital finance corp most of the few dozen sivs typically registered in offshore havens such as the cayman islands are managed out of london most players attribute the citys dominance to the fact that sivs are extremely complex often taking as much as a year to set up so it is difficult for new players to enter because the business started in london most people with the necessary skills and experience are in the united kingdom says geoff fuller an attorney with allen &amp overy llp in london who has advised citigroup and other clients on sivs and other structured finance products "its a small world where people know who their competitors are " says mr fuller mr sossidis says that as the siv market peaked in recent years many of the new players didnt fully recognize the perils involved in borrowing money short term and investing it long term "these were the last ones to enter the first ones to exit " he says in the wake of the collapse of hedge fund long term capital management gordian knot took precautions to protect itself from being forced to sell its assets if markets turned against it among other things the company got rid of a trigger that would force its flagship sigma fund to sell if the value of its assets fell in addition he says the firm sought to better match the duration of its assets and liabilities analysts now say that veteran organizations such as gordian knot should be able to survive the current crisis when troubles with subprime mortgage loans in the u s sparked a broader credit crisis this summer sivs didnt appear to be affected because few had exposure to subprime loans on july moodys investors service said in a report that sivs were "an oasis of calm in the subprime maelstrom " within days though weaknesses began to show in the short term debt market in late july a bank affiliate set up by german bank ikb deutsche industriebank ran into trouble it had relied on extremely short term financing in the commercial paper market to finance investments in risky securities backed by subprime loans a month later cheyne finance a &# billion siv operated by a london hedge fund began liquidating assets to repay debts by now investors in citigroups sivs were growing concerned citigroups london office issued a letter to investors in its seven sivs saying that its funds were sound on sept the bank took the extraordinary step of stating publicly through statements to the london stock exchange that its sivs had little subprime exposure but citigroup too was selling assets today the bank estimates the value of its sivs at &# billion down from nearly &# billion in august throughout august u s treasury secretary henry paulson and other top treasury officials were watching with increasing concern as the commercial paper market on which sivs rely for much of their funding began showing signs of severe strain information from the treasurys markets room where staff sit in front of flat screen monitors scrutinizing market movements was painting an ominous picture the difference between yields on treasury bills which are considered safe investments and corporate commercial paper which companies issue to fund day to day expenses was growing sharply a sign that investors were rapidly losing confidence robert steel mr paulsons top domestic finance adviser and a former goldman sachs group inc executive learned from colleagues on wall street that the crux of the trouble was sivs investors in the commercial paper market had all but stopped lending to the vehicles mr steel and others within treasury began to worry that the bank affiliated funds would engage in a fire sale of assets a move that could exacerbate the credit crunch and damp the broader economy "what you dont want is a disorderly liquidation " mr steel explains on sept mr steel began phoning wall street executives that sunday sept about people gathered in a large conference room across the hall from mr paulsons office the group included executives from citigroup goldman sachs lehman brothers holdings inc merrill lynch &amp co bank of america j p morgan chase bear stearns cos and barclays plc as they munched on sandwiches provided by treasury a consensus emerged that large scale dumping of assets was a likely outcome over the next year people who attended the meeting say at first some bank representatives were hesitant to get involved saying they didnt see a need to participate if they didnt have exposure to sivs according to the people who attended but treasury officials stressed that even if the banks didnt have direct exposure to siv assets there was a broader risk that would eventually filter down to everyone including those firms at least one bank representative suggested that treasury step in with some money to help bail out the firms the people who attended say mr steel told the group that wasnt an option treasury would only back a private sector market based solution "we bought the sandwiches and thats it " mr steel told those assembled in the room was nazareth festekjian a year citigroup veteran who runs a group that deals with unusual situations such as the restructuring of iraqs debt in mr festekjian years old hadnt known what an siv was until he received a call several weeks earlier from a government contact asking him to work on a solution he and his team came up with the idea to create a fund that could "bridge the gap" in the market by acquiring assets in a way that might give investors more comfort according to a person familiar with the matter at the meeting mr festekjian unveiled his plan which was printed up in color says one person who was present the following week the group again gathered in new york there were fewer bankers but they were joined by big siv investors including fidelity and federated investors inc and by messrs sossidis and partridge hicks siv managers expressed frustration with investors for backing away from the market according to two people who attended investors complained that the sivs were not as reliable as they had been billed one of these people says ultimately all sides settled down and agreed that a solution would be important for the market the banks and investors held conference calls every other day until participants agreed on a plan richard l prager bank of americas head of global rates currencies and commodities who was considered an experienced but relatively neutral party has since been leading the campaign to sell the superfund to other banks investors and sivs the plan still may not come to fruition if not enough banks agree to provide financing or if sivs decide that the cost of participation is too high some sivs including those sponsored by smaller u s banks have started working out their own solutions with investors and say they dont plan to join the superfund architects of the plan could be satisfied if no one at all ended up using the fund so long as its existence staved off a collapse of the siv market according to a person familiar with their thinking ian mcdonald and craig karmin contributed to this article
