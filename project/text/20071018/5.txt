apple opens iphone to outside software move may help harness programmer creativity many questions linger apple inc s move to more fully open the iphone to software created by independent developers could make the product more competitive with rivals such as microsoft corp seeking to define technology standards for cellular phones the decision announced by chief executive steve jobs in a letter posted yesterday morning on apples web site reversed the cupertino calif companys earlier more restrictive policy on the types of independent software that could be used on the iphone that policy had ignited a storm of criticism from independent programmers who complained in online message boards that apple was trying to exert too much control over the iphone stymieing innovation from others eager to exploit the computing power of the product in his letter mr jobs said the company early next year will release a software development kit or sdk a set of tools that will let programmers make "native" iphone applications that offer better performance and features than alternative methods of programming "let me just say it we want native third party applications on the iphone and we plan to have an sdk in developers hands in february " mr jobs wrote apple had previously told programmers it would limit independent iphone applications to only those that run through the products web browser a decision apple said it made to prevent security problems such as viruses on iphones but web applications on the iphone were limited in the types of features and performance they could offer unlike native applications the software couldnt be stored locally on the iphone which meant it wasnt accessible to users when they didnt have wireless access to the internet on an airplane for instance by opening the iphone to native applications apple could better harness the creative energy of independent software programmers much as the company and microsoft have done in the personal computer market with macintosh and windows operating systems microsoft is attempting to do the same thing in the cellular phone market with its windows mobile operating system for which independent programmers can create applications mr jobs left many questions unanswered about the degree to which the iphone will be open for software programmers giving no details about whether apple will handpick all native applications for the device and what if any technical limits it will place on such programs he also didnt say whether apple itself will control the distribution of independent iphone software or take a share of revenue from its sale an apple spokeswoman declined to expand on mr jobss letter "no one is quite certain of the business model theyll use " said avi greengart an analyst at research firm current analysis programmers could make a broad array of software for the iphone including games and software that improves the products compatibility with corporate email systems mr greengart speculated programmers could also create voice over internet protocol or voip software for making low cost calls over the internet apples move could also help allay criticism apple received after the company issued software updates that caused technical problems with some iphones beacause of unauthorized software users had installed on the devices apple executives have warned that such programs could cause "irreparable" damage to iphones some of the technical problems stemmed from software that programmers used to "unlock" the iphone so they would work on a greater range of wireless networks but there is also a growing library of unauthorized games text chatting programs and other software in his letter mr jobs said the iphone software development kit will take until february to produce because the company is "trying to do two diametrically opposed things at once provide an advanced and open platform to developers while at the same time protect iphone users from viruses malware privacy attacks etc " "this is no easy task " he continued "some claim that viruses and malware are not a problem on mobile phones this is simply not true there have been serious viruses on other mobile phones already including some that silently spread from phone to phone over the cell network " roger entner a telecommunications expert at consulting firm iag research said he was sympathetic to apples concerns about security "the standards users put their phones up to are higher than those of a computer " mr entner said "when was the last time your phone crashed "
