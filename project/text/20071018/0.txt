a cultural conversation with nadine gordimer she marvels at post apartheid life johannesburg south africa beyond the white walls of the comfortably modest villa that nadine gordimer has lived in for the past five decades small things astound at the local school boys of different races jostle girls whisper secrets "you know when i take the dog for a walk at the park its quite a shock to people like myself having friends who went to prison for having black white love affairs to see a white and black lying under the trees kissing and fondling " says ms gordimer "i think oh theyre going to be arrested " her numerous novels "the conservationist" and "burgers daughter" prominent among them and short story collections chronicled a tumultuous half century of south african history as a member of the african national congress who lent her name and support to the anti apartheid cause ms gordimer also militated for change in as the old regime began to crumble she won the nobel prize for literature this multiracial democracy perhaps more so for a member of a certain generation and political inclination is still to hear her speak a marvel noting this enthusiasm i remark that she once said that "monstrous detachment" is essential for a novelist didnt the end of white rule deprive her of a big subject and make for a difficult artistic adjustment she bristles "but you dont understand that was being boxed in now its freedom its completely the other way around " she says adding for good measure "what subject the business of life is my subject " in the years since apartheids fall ms gordimer who is has stayed very active publishing her last novel "get a life " in speaking of the post apartheid lives of the people around her she mentions a poet and friend from "the struggle" who went into politics "a hunted person all his life a shack here and room there " he now lives she says in her leafy prosperous and previously whites only neighborhood of parktown "his children going around on bicycles in the garden living a normal life " another marvel yet ms gordimer says her friend misses the close relationships formed in the close quarters of his old township "here you are truly alone " she says "living in freedom alone " also her black friend "dispossessed someone" who had lived here becoming only the latest in a line of different races to claim this land people tend to change more slowly than their surroundings old mindsets in ms gordimers country are lingering "inherited even by young children from their parents born after our freedom in " she says at once seemingly intrigued and disappointed "thats a nice subject for a novelist can you change can there be rebirth " her hair pulled back in a bun and wearing casual slacks ms gordimer is formal and self possessed in her manner a petite and charming woman with an unmistakably steely demeanor "the more staff you got the more you dither " ms gordimer snaps when a european embassy interrupts our tea and biscuits more than once to finalize details for a coming reception in her honor yet when the topic turns to south african politics she puts on a soft smile and checks her caustic tongue anything at all you miss about the old south africa a sour expression "nothing " did nelson mandela the anc leader and first democratic president of south africa make any mistakes "no " then "the only mistake he has said he made but he was unaware of at the time and many of us were all over the world that hiv and aids were going to be the epidemic they were " why cant south africas new rulers pressure zimbabwes aging tyrant robert mugabe "i was constantly defending thabo mbeki because its true he couldnt do this on his own " she says "you see theres a psychological thing there that blacks suffered so much from whites that there is this feeling we black brothers must stick together this is a syndrome that has to be broken i would have thought but i understand how difficult it is " ms gordimer is visibly annoyed when conversation turns to the daylight burglary at her home last year she was locked in a storeroom and had her jewelry stolen the incident drew world wide attention to south africas crime epidemic which she had previously played down to foreign audiences the disappointment for her "if i have a disappointment" is festering corruption that has implicated several top anc figures in "get a life " she writes broadly about the rise of powerful black capitalists and politicians continuing her lifelong fascination with the politics of race in her country "at least human temptation isnt discriminatory the difference is whites have held that power exclusively so long " her longstanding and politically correct defense of the ruling anc annoys many south africans her reproaches of the current regime over graft or zimbabwe are considered patronizing in other quarters where she is seen foremost as a privileged white jewish woman "isnt it healthy to be criticized for both " is her quick response but her position once so clear as an internationally prominent writer and opponent of apartheid seems more ambiguous under present circumstances summing up her career biographer ronald suresh roberts offered a double edged compliment "from inside a heritage of homage to europe gordimer emerged as the twentieth centurys foremost white afrocentrist " contradicting her own view of herself as put to me as a purely south african writer ms gordimer fell out with mr roberts in and pulled support for his authorized biography "no cold kitchen " a small south african publisher brought out the book in race is still the main frame of reference in south africa and ms gordimer has discovered that pc ness can cut both ways one of her best known books "julys people " was removed from an approved school reading list for lacking "any condemnation of racism" the apartheid regime had banned outright three of her novels the countrys other literature nobelist j m coetzee immigrated to australia after publishing the most notable south african work of the past decade "disgrace" which depicts whites as terrorized by blacks ms gordimer rejects any suggestion that roles merely reversed after and will say only that her "political commitments" differ from mr coetzees typical in a young democracy south africa is a mixed bag for all the countrys evident problems the economy is thriving and the politics are lively but the immediate surroundings weigh heavily zimbabwe most of all if a charismatic former liberation hero like robert mugabe can destroy a once prosperous country so fast whats to stop the scenario from repeating itself here former vice president jacob zuma who dreams of becoming the next president and is taking the first step by running for the top anc job in december possibly fills the bill "an awful man " says ms gordimer rather tartly south africa i offer has stood on the brink of doom for years in "julys people " published in war between the races engulfs the country forcing a white family to take refuge in their black servants home village "its an old book " says ms gordimer "the fact that we avoided that terrible prolonged civil war another congo is indeed i hate to use the word miracle but it is something of a miracle brought about by the extraordinary leadership that we had " foremost nelson mandela and in a supporting role and motivated by less enlightened views the last apartheid leader f w de klerk who realized "the need for accommodation " in her view this tradition of compromise and of the civic society forged in the long democratic struggle marks south africa from the rest of the continent making it better able to resist contagions from its northern neighbors i note patience and forgiveness are other character traits often ascribed to this country "i am humbled by it " ms gordimer says "it is not this country its the blacks in this country why they didnt get up and come into these houses and cut our throats i dont know "if you look at nationalism as a sense of self it was always there in the black population and thats perhaps a clue as to why they had the self confidence not to get up and cut everyones throats they didnt want to destroy the country in a civil war which was a very remarkably astute and human way of looking at a terrible situation " another difference from the rest of africa "weve got real white heroes " she says a boulevard in johannesburg was renamed after communist leader joe slovo a hospital for anc activist helen joseph and so on in ms gordimer one picks up on an almost pious attachment to the ideals behind the creation of this new south africa as well as a recognition that it has yet to mature fully with its biggest tests perhaps still over the horizon there is also an inexplicit awareness that some black leaders dont share these ideals and stake their claims to power by preaching revenge against the whites in recent months calls have grown to try former apartheid officials for crimes committed in the previous era threatening to reopen old wounds fights over history are easily picked in countries that made a quick transition from authoritarianism to freedom but ms gordimer counsels forbearance "it has to be accepted that in the past you were this and that one was that " she says "now above all for survival and to have our place in the world we simply have to accommodate not accept but accommodate and live together " suddenly thinking again of the neighborhood school she says "i cant help but have faith in these kids jostling and whispering secrets we never grew up together our kids didnt grow up together my faith is in these kids they are the first generation " mr kaminski is editorial page editor of the wall street journal europe
