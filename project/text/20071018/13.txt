was his only option "you get to a point where your hands are tied " he says a growing number of investors like mr rozzen are making the drastic decision to walk away from their properties and ultimately send their homes into foreclosure lenders and real estate agents say many investors who were hoping to quickly flip their investments are now left with homes that can no longer be sold for more than the mortgage debt in many cases these investors cant even find tenants willing to pay enough rent to cover hefty mortgages certain data point to the trend according to an august study by the mortgage bankers association defaults on mortgages where the owner doesnt live in the house are a major driver of the defaults in florida nevada california and arizona four of the states with the fastest rising rates of seriously delinquent loans defaulted mortgages are defined as those days or more past due or in foreclosure according to the study but walking away from a mortgage is almost always a bad idea you can lose your ability to take out future loans and you might find the lender coming after your personal assets such as your principal residence depending on your states laws and the terms of your loan "a lot of these people cant think clearly because the level of financial distress is so great " says david dweck president of the boca real estate investment club in boca raton fla who is also a realtor "theyre hoping that by taking this step its going to work itself out " tom crossett is one investor on the verge of walking away from his properties at the height of floridas

mortgage payments totaling &# hes been stuck renting the units to tenants who make sporadic payments he says that next month he plans to cut his losses and stop paying the mortgages "the only way i can see for me is to just get out stop the bleeding and let them go " mr crossett sighs before walking away from a mortgage legal experts say investors should approach a lender about a possible loan "workout " in which the mortgage payments are reduced but the investor gets to keep the property some investors say they have tried this but without success still banks dont typically want to act as property managers nor do they want to have high foreclosure numbers on their books "there is a real incentive for both lenders and borrowers alike to do a workout and avoid foreclosure lenders are not good at being homeowners " says fred witt national director real estate tax services at deloitte tax llp in phoenix one of the first effects of walking away from a mortgage is an assault on ones credit the foreclosure could remain on your credit report for years and will sharply reduce your credit score experts say "this makes it more difficult or extremely costly and in some cases impossible to do more financing in the future " says jack guttentag a professor of finance emeritus at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania who operates a mortgage advice web site in some cases lenders can go after an investors other assets to satisfy a loan if the borrower defaults but that often depends on the loan agreement which sets out what recourse the lender has in the case of a default in a nonrecourse loan lenders can take only the property itself to satisfy the debt most loans however are recourse loans which means that the borrowers other assets may be at risk individual investors may even be on the hook if they borrowed through a limited liability company or a partnership principals of llcs or general partners of partnerships can be personally liable if they act as guarantors lenders often require personal guarantees as part of the loan agreement "banks want the individuals on the hook " says new york lawyer gideon rothschild partnerships and llcs are good to "protect you against slips and falls on your property " adds jay adkisson a newport beach calif lawyer but they offer little protection if a lender requires you to sign a personal guarantee whats more whether other assets such as insurance policies and personal residences are shielded from creditors varies widely by state in florida and texas for instance your home life insurance policy annuity or retirement plan are generally shielded from creditors california by contrast offers much less protection for debtors more details about your states laws are available at www assetprotectionbook com state resources htm of course investors can take steps to shield their assets from creditors but setting up fancy structures such as offshore trusts designed to keep property off limits from creditors typically only works if done before creditors appear on the horizon says beachwood ohio lawyer john e sullivan iii similarly assets in a k are generally protected from creditors if the plan was already in existence "if you plan when the coast is clear you should be ok " says mr sullivan "if you choose to wait it could be too late " mr adkisson the newport beach calif lawyer says he has received about calls a week in recent months from real estate investors seeking to shield their assets just as lenders are beginning to chase after them "theres just an absolute flood of people seeking asset protection and its all after the fact its like buying auto insurance after the car wreck " there are a few things you can do to protect your money even as creditors are moving in one idea move to florida and buy a big house as long as you can stay out of bankruptcy and qualify for florida residency a creditor cant force the sale of your home under florida law says mr rothschild the new york lawyer who adds that the tactic wont work under new bankruptcy rules if youre forced to file for bankruptcy protection investors who face foreclosure may be left with a big federal tax hit says mr witt of deloitte thats because in a recourse loan the amount of the loan forgiven by the lender in excess of the propertys fair market value is typically taxed as ordinary income to the taxpayer he says the tax code does offer some relief but only if the loan is forgiven during bankruptcy proceedings or if the borrower was insolvent immediately before the loan was discharged however its tough to prove insolvency since the internal revenue service considers many assets such as k retirement plans in determining whether a borrower is insolvent "these assets are typically exempt from creditors but not for tax purposes " says mr witt one option to avoid if possible filing for bankruptcy protection laws passed in make it much tougher in some cases to protect certain assets such as your primary residence from creditors during bankruptcy cutting loose some real estate investors are considering walking away from their mortgage loans heres what to consider an investors credit score could be sharply impaired lenders may go after your personal assets part of the loan amount that is forgiven could be considered taxable before walking away from a mortgage consider seeking a loan "workout" with your lender
