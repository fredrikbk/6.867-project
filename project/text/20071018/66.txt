in myanmar the dissident as comedian zarganar kept joking until thrown in prison what makes god cry on the eve of myanmars violent crackdown on demonstrators last month friends implored maung thura to flee his home in the capital city yangon and go into hiding instead he cracked jokes maung thura is one of myanmars best known dissidents a thorn in the side of the military dictatorship that has ruled this southeast asian country for more than four decades popularly known as zarganar "tweezers" in burmese he also is considered myanmars charlie chaplin "george bush hu jintao chinas president and than shwe myanmars military leader went to visit god " zarganar emailed a friend at just after oclock sept the evening before the crackdown "bush asked god when will the u s become the most powerful nation in the world god replied not in your life driving bush to tears " mr hu then asked when china would become the richest nation in the world which drew the same "not in your life" answer from god and tears from the chinese president zarganar wrote finally myanmars ruler asked when his country would have enough water and electricity this time it was god who broke into tears saying "not in my life " prominent dissidents often are scientists or writers in myanmar one of its most famous is a comic later on the evening of sept shortly after zarganars wife called from los angeles where she has been living with their two children since leaving myanmar formerly called burma a year ago she pleaded with him to go into hiding "i have nothing to hide " he replied says his wife lwin mar oo "with my bald head theyd recognize me right away theres no point in running " hours later at about in the morning zarganar was arrested for the next three weeks relatives and friends heard nothing though he had been jailed before including for four years in the s the severity of septembers crackdown on buddhist monks and other demonstrators gave cause for worry if the countrys sacred monks were being physically abused friends and family reasoned what would happen to an irritating comedian yesterday zarganar was released according to three people who have spoken with him individually early yesterday morning according to these people he was told he was being taken to another place for further interrogation then suddenly brought to his home and released he had been moved during his imprisonment to four different prisons for extensive interrogations often through the night those who spoke to zarganar said that though he sounded tired he was back to making jokes "the more intense and threatening the situation becomes the more jokes he comes up with " says maung yit a friend from their student days and now an information technology consultant in a san francisco library "this is how he survives the regime " zarganar years old once studied to be a dentist but in the early s discovered his talent for the stage with other students he formed a troupe using a traditional form of burmese entertainment combining dancing girls and jokes told by clowns performing at a party at the dental school he was given a choice of stage names relating to the profession including pliers chewing gum and tweezers since tweezers arent really a dental tool and made little sense he chose that name friends recall his troupe called gangaw grove increasingly took on social and political matters in the mid s he began performing on national television gaining a wide following not surprisingly he also caught the attention of the government then led by gen ne win "every country has a success story to tell " zarganar joked during one performance at the time some like to boast about a citizen with no hands who can still write or another with no legs who can still run "but theres no other country like burma " he continued "here we have generals able to rule a country for years with no brains " zarganars fame grew as he appeared in a handful of burmese films he continued to use satire to focus on the countrys ills such as a lack of adequate water power and education "any joke that came out about the regime people said it must be a zarganar joke even if it wasnt " says maung yit his student friend during a major uprising in zarganar was made a leader of the student movement in the ensuing crackdown which human rights groups estimate resulted in deaths zarganar was imprisoned for about eight months according to people who know him shortly before a election zarganar was arrested again this time for giving political speeches for his mother who was running for parliament he drew a sentence of five years in prison later reduced to four the political opposition led by eventual nobel peace prize laureate aung san suu kyi won that election in a landslide but military men took power again instead after his release from prison in the s zarganar was allowed to perform again he participated in videos raising awareness of aids among other social issues last year he began running afoul of the regime again the government banned a film he directed called "running out of patience " then he himself was banned after giving a british broadcasting corp interview in which he criticized government regulations on the countrys annual water festival he complained the government had disallowed traditional elements of the festival including a portion devoted to performances touching on current events he also said government cronies were allowed to sell liquor at the event the ban meant he could not perform publicly in february of this year following a small antigovernment demonstration in yangon he was criticized by the countrys state run newspaper the new light of myanmar for "inciting public unrest and violence " the newspaper claimed his participation in a debate at a yangon location operated by the u s embassy had prompted the demonstration he denied the charge despite the personal ban zarganar jokes kept circulating sometimes passed by him on the phone to contacts outside the country who then posted them on burmese exile web sites operated from the u s one of them referred to a daughter of gen than shwe giving birth quite soon after getting married "in other countries instant noodles and instant coffee are popular " went zarganars joke "only in burma are there instant babies " the most recent demonstrations in myanmar were sparked in mid august by an increase in fuel prices tapping into long festering discontent about the nations economic troubles as the marches grew led by the monks several celebrities began to come forward to show their support during the two days before the crackdown zarganar brought water to the monks and urged others to back them on the night of zarganars arrest myo thein htun a graphic artist in new york and a fellow comedian from their university days called zarganar "what are you doing at home " myo thein htun says he asked zarganar "i am not afraid if they arrest me " zarganar replied according to myo thein htun "what are you doing then " "writing jokes "
