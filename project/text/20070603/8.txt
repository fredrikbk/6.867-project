love &amp money premier soccer the readers weigh in if you want to get a reaction out of people start talking about kids and sports i learned that lesson after writing about my year old son wanting to try out for a local premier soccer team basically a higher caliber team than the recreational teams he has played for in the past its also more demanding a kid we know is on this team and he had to play more than games in eight cities during the fall and spring seasons my wife amy and i like the idea that our son has found something hes passionate about but we worry about the effect on the family the added costs of uniforms and travel as well as the time commitment required in addition to all those away games there are multiple practices each week readers had plenty to say on the topic and their thoughts were all over the lot some questioned why any parent would allow a child to monopolize family time for the childs own dreams others argue that competitive sports keep kids away from mischief and that the added time spent together as a family traveling to venues time in a hotel etc is well worth the price of admission paul lebaron in fountain valley calif says he and his wife have "struggled with the idea of allowing our kids to play in higher levels of competition " not because of the financial and time constraints but because of the "emphasis on winning at all costs brought to the team by parents and coaches who have a mixed up set of priorities the concepts of playing a game and having fun have been replaced by college scholarships and draft day material " mr lebaron says his boys recently moved to a more competitive level of baseball and he is thrilled with the skills the kids learned through superior coaching "however " he says "it also came with a price we quickly found an abundance of unhealthy expectations " in one episode a parent encouraged mr lebarons wife to order additional personalized baseball cards of one son "because if he makes it to the major leagues they will be worth a lot of money unfortunately she was absolutely serious " as a result of such experiences mr lebaron says "i think my boys have not grown into their maximum potential because of the stress they undergo at each practice each game and each at bat to be the best every time " tom lowry of fair oaks calif has watched each of his three kids now and play soccer at the premier level for years while two of them did reasonably well he says the third "has played for some of the best club teams in the country " winning a variety of championships hes currently a captain on his college team and "will likely graduate early and enter the major league soccer draft or go to europe and take his chances " mr lowry says but mr lowry wonders if he and his wife would sign up for the ride again "the years of getting our kids to practices games and tournaments were an enormous stress on our family and our marriage " he says mr lowry urges parents looking at a premier team lifestyle to "try very hard to be objective about your childs qualities " do they really have the drive and skills to succeed at that level or are you the parent rationalizing the participation on the idea that "something will click and your child will go from mediocre to exceptional " more broadly mr lowry says entry into competitive sports "tends to suppress all other interests and talents " he says its easy to see that two of his kids should have "balanced their time across a number of activities " as for the one who has found the most success on the field mr lowry wonders "what would he be today if hed been exposed to a broad range of activities " in the end mr lowry says he has wonderful memories of those years but adds that "as time passes and you have invested yourself in your sons sports success it becomes increasingly difficult to separate yourself from your childs participation and truly keep their best interests in mind " several readers took exception to my comment that "despite any inconveniences we as parents owe our son a chance to pursue his passion " briana leclaire in boise idaho echoed many others in writing that my comment was "mixed up " she says that "were naturally selfish and have to be taught self sacrifice " "what is your son learning " ms leclaire says "when his familys world comes to a screeching halt for his personal benefit being in a family means learning it isnt all about you " gaylene pattinson in seattle disagrees her year old daughter was recently selected for a premier soccer team she also pitches for a boys baseball team plays basketball and skis the familys weekends are hectic ms pattinson says and "some people might think we push our kids but that is simply not true and tends to be the response from people who just refuse to make it happen "we are very careful to ask our kids what they want to do making sure they understand what theyre giving up " she says "i feel very strongly that if your child has a passion you need to give them the opportunity to follow it children need their dreams and to that end the support of their family is key " patrick owen in camp hill pa says he and his wife "wrestled with all the emotions you discussed but watching your child excel at something he loves is worth the price " the owens are a travel hockey family for their now year old son mr owen says when he "first realized what we had been sucked into with travel hockey i was more than a bit unhappy " but then during the ride home from the fourth road game when his son was mr owen says it all clicked his young son asked to stop and have dinner "the two of us had a really great conversation " mr owen says "i got it more quality time with my kid than virtually any other activity now we cant get enough he has a great group of friends plays some decent hockey and is far too busy to get into much mischief the cost is a minor trade off " jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write him at
