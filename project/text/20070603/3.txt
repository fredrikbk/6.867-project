eyes on the road high gas prices shrug quality family time trumps cost for holiday weekend driving online edition just about every memorial day weekend for the past years our family has piled into a car and driven about miles to spend the weekend by a lake in northern indiana this year as gasoline prices hovered near record levels adjusted for inflation we changed our plans instead of leaving on friday night we left on sunday because of various scheduling conflicts and we took two cars instead of one because my daughter had to make a side trip to toledo in other words we not only didnt curb our driving we did more than usual all together based on the receipts i gathered up late last week i spent about &# gassing up various vehicles in the family fleet during the period from may to june my own car the eyes on the road subaru wrx slurped down &# worth of regular on may and by june had traveled miles with just under a half a tank left the wrx is supposed to run on premium but because of the price i filled up with regular even though that degrades performance the four cylinder toyota camry my daughter drives took in about &# worth of fuel on may the family saab wagon got a &# fill up on may a one family sample isnt worth much of course but recent market trends and conversations with a few industry analysts suggest my household is a microcosm of the conflicted ways in which americans are reacting to rising gasoline prices first lets look at me i shelled out a bunch of money for gas rather than abandon plans for a family getaway i dont consciously put a dollar value on spending time chilling by the waterside with family but in fact i did it was worth the &# to &# of gasoline our car consumed on the round trip it was also worth the additional &# of gas i put into my daughters camry effectively replacing the gas she burned during her holiday weekend travels to me this expense is an annoyance but we are fortunate enough that its affordable my daughter on the other hand has a different view shes looking for a summer job and even after she finds one its a good bet that &# a week for gas will loom large compared with her total take home pay so for her &# a gallon gasoline is a big problem and if i decided to stop subsidizing the cost for her shed have to change her lifestyle there are some indications that the recent run up in gasoline prices is starting to affect consumer behavior the u s energy information administration noted in a may newsletter that the year over year pace of growth in gasoline consumption slowed to during the week of may from in the week of april but gasoline consumption still grew a look at may vehicle sales trends suggests that many new vehicle buyers are placing a higher value on better fuel efficiency the power information network which gathers detailed sales data from hundreds of u s dealerships said the share of gas electric hybrid vehicles sold in the u s rose to in the period may with a total of hybrid models on sale compared with for all of may when there were hybrid models available toyota motor corp in may sold of its prius hybrids a new record for any month and an increase of nearly from a year ago toyota has been promoting the prius more aggressively with various discount offers designed to offset the diminishing tax break available on the car related article edmunds com the car shopping site says the prius rose from no on the list of top most researched vehicles in december to no in may the no most researched model the honda civic in may december and may the highest ranked detroit brand model in may was the gmc acadia at no the acadia is a new seven passenger crossover wagon that can substitute for a large suv in terms of carrying people and their stuff still hybrids remain a long way from mainstream in terms of total sales and the sales figures suggest that at least some new vehicle buyers still like a big truck if the price is right or its luxurious enough sales of fords big expedition suv rose in may by reflecting in part the comparison of a fresh looking model this year to the runout of an aging expedition a year ago sales of land rovers rose even though the hot selling ranger rover sport is rated at just miles per gallon on the highway jesse toprak an analyst with edmunds says large suv sales were strong last month compared with a year earlier in part because general motors corp and others offered some attractive deals gm dusted off the for months financing promotion to help move chevy tahoes hummers and other suvs in its lineup mr toprak estimated discounts in the segment of as much as &# a vehicle in january edmunds estimated the value of discounts on tahoes at just &# so as they have done before auto makers are responding to concern about gas prices by effectively rebating the incremental cost sales of big suvs overall have tumbled from the peak of about million a year at the start of the decade and appear headed to a level of about a year says ford sales analyst george pipas but that still means americans are buying more large suvs than they are hybrids at least for now one of the fastest growing market segments is so called crossover suvs such as the ford edge or acura mdx these vehicles tend to be more efficient than say a ford explorer but not radically so a ford edge with all wheel drive is rated at miles per gallon in combined city highway driving compared with miles per gallon for a four wheel drive explorer ellen hughes cromwick fords chief economist says shes concerned about the potential that the housing slump and rising energy prices could depress consumer demand but for the most part the people who buy new cars and trucks arent low income people such as my unemployed daughter they are older more affluent folks for whom the ups and downs at the pump dont really mean that much in straight economic terms at least not yet congress is debating proposals to boost average new vehicle fuel economy to miles per gallon and the bush administration is pushing parallel proposals to decrease oil consumption taken on their face these proposals would result in a very different fleet of smaller vehicles on the highway and quite different choices about how much to drive than i made over the recent holiday judging from the latest sales trends and the continuing rise in gasoline consumption its not clear that americans are ready to drastically alter what they drive or how much they drive unless someone hits them over the head harder than theyve been hit to date send comments about eyes on the road to
