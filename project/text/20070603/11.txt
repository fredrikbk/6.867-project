real time growing up in public like it or not new generations public disclosures are the wave of the future on the internet online edition last week a story crossed my desk claiming that a quarter of human resources decision makers had rejected job candidates because of personal information found online the survey was conducted by a business social network so i was skeptical of the numbers and the methodology as was my colleague and fellow daily fixer carl bialik but i understand why the survey got a receptive audience it mines something a lot of us find troubling the idea that those younger than us are blithely unaware of the consequences of putting details about their personal lives online the conventional wisdom is that as those who grew up with the net get older theyll pay the price for their youthful indiscretions starting when theyre trying to get that first job and get googled by the hr guy and itll get worse from there the members of generation exhibitionist will get older and wiser but theyll never escape from their boozy pictures and angry blog postings and other digital detritus and eventually theyll realize that they spent their teen years embroidering virtual scarlet letters for themselves that can never removed but is that really true theres a huge sociological question here will the kids who grew up with the net lets call them after netters become more like their elders lets call them before netters as they take on full time jobs relationships children and the other stuff of adult life having once craved attention will they now shun it or will they continue to live their lives in public chronicling their ups and downs in ways their elders will find befuddling and disturbing for a great take on this read emily nussbaums "say everything " from february s new york magazine heres betting on the latter i think before netters like me are the ones who seem out of step leading lives that seem hermetic in comparison with those who grew up in cyberpublic for better or worse decrying what kids reveal on some myspace successor will soon seem as painfully out of it as grumbling that teenage boys and girls shouldnt use the telephone to chat unsupervised take whatever side you like in that debate but it wont matter the world will change and render the debate moot its done so before those who saw the telephone as a destructive force in communities might have had and might still have a point but technological changes have left them on the fringe of society and keep in mind that no commentor in the history of the world ever went broke worrying that todays kids are immoral swine today its pretty obvious that having the hr guy at your prospective employer find photos of college beer bongs isnt a good idea but that before net guy running hr isnt going to be in his job forever before too long hell give way to an after netter with an old myspace page of her own out there for anyone to find will she conclude drunken snapshots are a sign of bad judgment and hire someone else i very much doubt it one of the biggest changes ushered in by the net is the strange semi celebrity it allows anyone with a net connection to attain myspace facebook twitter flickr and blogs all turn people into public figures in a way that was impossible not so long ago as ive written before this has left "regular" folks dealing with issues that used to be celebrity concerns such as the overlap between public images and private lives like plenty of real celebrities some people become object lessons in the perils of getting the two mixed up at the same time theres a lot of talk these days about how the net lets teenagers play with questions of identity a common defense of rowdy myspace pages is that kids are experimenting with digital personae by posing as bad girls tough guys and the like which is true though that latin plural sure makes posting drunken exhibitionist pictures on webshots sound a lot more high minded than it is but its not just teens and college kids who shift personae during a single offline day we may act very differently at work at the bar after work at a childs parent teacher conference and at the ballgame just as online we act differently on im work emails home emails blog posts and blog comments the difference is that were used to choosing which persona is appropriate to a given situation and letting it carry the day but an online search can reveal all our different faces at once competing for search results google yourself and you quickly realize that your public image is by and large out of control daily life in the offline world comes with a certain expectation of privacy but the power of search has reversed the situation in the online world its a public arena in which the smallest detail can and will be unearthed by the right search that can be a shock even for net veterans im far from famous but google me and youll find real times and my thoughts on journalism as well as evidence of my dorky hobbies and less dorky hobbies of those with the misfortune to share my name my wedding announcement and my amazon wish list and if facebook had existed in the late s i guarantee youd also find an old facebook page with evidence of enough stupidity to establish beyond any reasonable doubt that my judgment was frequently terrible what do you do when you realize how public your online life is you could retreat into anonymity and try to ensure you leave no trace online but increasingly theres something weird about that you could try to scrub your online image getting rid of the things youd rather not have people see and or taking steps to elevate what you do want people to see in search results but that generally doesnt work or you could say "so what " you could accept that every aspect of your online life is out there for people to find and judge as they will note im not talking about personal information like social security numbers thats a whole nother column you could decide that if some people then judge you poorly based on one aspect of that online life thats their problem developing the thicker skin well all need in a changing world thats the tack the after net kids have taken not consciously but because its the only world theyve ever known will it cost some of them jobs and college slots undoubtedly but not for much longer because its their worldview that will win the day as they assume the positions of authority vacated by us the people wholl struggle heres betting itll be before netters like me with our weirdly sterile google lives that begin in middle age and our old fashioned skittishness about online embarrassment and criticism that younger people wont think twice about how will the webs increasingly public nature change how we live our lives will the after netters change their ways do you worry about what search engines turn up on you or some after netters you know join me and other online journal readers in real times new forum or write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
