getting going tweaks that help fatten your wallet grab that low hanging fruit disappointed by your skimpy savings with a few simple tweaks to your finances you could pocket thousands of extra dollars each year the trick stop hunting for hot stocks and superstar mutual funds and start searching for &# bills on the sidewalk here are nine places to look  losing balance "i meet smart people all the time who are sitting with thousands of dollars in their checking account " says allan roth a financial planner with wealth logic in colorado springs colo "thats low hanging fruit " suppose you have &# in your checking account earning zero interest you might shift &# to emigrantdirect hsbc direct or one of the other high yield online savings accounts where you can find yields around this simple maneuver could garner you &# over the next months  taking credit the potential gain is even greater if you have credit card debt "paying off a credit card is the most obvious thing to do " mr roth says "its costing the most interest and it isnt tax deductible " lets say you have &# of credit card debt incurring interest by using &# from your checking account to pay off that debt you would save &# a year  heading home shrinking your checking account may leave you uneasy because you view it as your emergency reserve but you can always open a home equity line of credit which you can then tap if you find yourself in a financial pinch "theres a little bit of risk there " mr roth concedes "interest rates could go way up and that home equity line of credit could really cost you "  losing interest you also could save a bundle by refinancing your mortgage if you have a year loan costing you could slash monthly payments by refinancing at or less one warning if you are say nine years into a year mortgage you can cut payments sharply by taking out a new year loan but part of the gain would be illusory you are taking whats now a year loan and extending payments over years instead when refinancing consider opting for a year loan if it isnt worth refinancing because your loan balance is small or you might move in the next few years think about making extra principal payments instead suppose you have &# in a savings account earning if you use that cash to pay down your mortgage you will be better off by &# over the next year true your mortgage interest may be tax deductible but you would also be paying taxes on the interest earned by your savings account so you would still be ahead even after adjusting for taxes  taking shelter many folks hold bonds and other conservative investments in their taxable account because they like having low risk investments they can easily unload if they need cash meanwhile they stash stocks in their retirement account this seems logical because stocks are designed for long term growth and retirement is often years away but what seems logical isnt always right lets say your taxable account holds &# of municipal bonds yielding while your retirement account contains &# of stocks if you swapped the stocks into your taxable account and moved your bonds to your retirement account you should improve your portfolios return a big reason instead of owning munis you could use your retirement account to buy taxable bonds that might yield the extra percentage points of yield would add &# to your portfolio over the next year what if you suddenly need &# if you dont want to tap your home equity line of credit you could sell &# of the stocks in your taxable account to maintain your stock exposure you would then move &# from bonds to stocks within your retirement account  trimming taxes when you held munis in your taxable account you werent paying any federal income taxes on the interest and possibly no state income taxes either by contrast the stocks you now hold in your taxable account could be generating hefty tax bills to avoid those hefty bills favor low cost stock index funds that way any taxable distributions you receive should be mostly qualified dividends and long term capital gains which are taxed at a maximum  boosting yield as you shift your bond money to your retirement accounts think carefully about which fixed income investments you buy within your employers k plan you will be limited to whatever investments your employer offers but if youre buying bonds in an individual retirement account you are free to snag the best deal available to improve your yield favor no load bond funds with rock bottom annual expenses mr roth also suggests hunting the internet for high yielding certificates of deposit these cds offer handsome rates and your account should be protected by the federal deposit insurance corp  insuring for less to cut insurance costs consider raising the deductibles on your homeowners insurance "companies have been dropping customers if they have lots of claims so people arent filing claims " says ross levin a financial planner with accredited investors in edina minn "you might as well raise your deductibles " while youre at it see if you can trim your life insurance costs "its a good time to be shopping for term insurance " mr levin says "if you shop online you can get great rates especially if youre in good health and youve never smoked "  snatching the match dont overlook possibly the most attractive low hanging fruit the employer match on your k contributions in a common arrangement an employer will kick in cents for every &# you invest up to of your pay thats like an instant return on your money on top of that you will get investment gains tax deferred growth and an immediate tax deduction "we still come across people who arent contributing enough to get the full company match " mr levin says "in fact a lot of people dont even know what their match is " jonathan clements also writes the "getting going" column that appears wednesdays in the wall street journal write to him at jonathan clements wsj com
