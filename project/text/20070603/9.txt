ton of mistakes " says stephen spinelli jr vice provost for entrepreneurship and global management at babson college in wellesley mass "if youre in a really rich market theres greater forgiveness" for those mistakes in a narrow market "you could fail very quickly " just of small businesses with one or more employees in addition to the founder survive after four years according to the small business administrations office of advocacy here are six mistakes to avoid to better your chances  lacking a detailed plan "people dont begin to do enough research on the size of the market how can it be priced how can they get their products made will there be demand " says carl schramm president of the ewing marion kauffman foundation which promotes programs to foster entrepreneurship a detailed business plan forces you to clarify how much money youre willing to invest in the venture it should spell out some time frames objectives costs and expenses says todd mccracken president of the national small business association a washington d c based advocacy group with about small business members nationwide "entrepreneurs are always very optimistic " he says "but they dont look closely enough at what theyre willing to lose " for help creating a business plan look for a small business development center in your area at sba gov aboutsba sbaprograms sbdc index html also score a group

part of your network often entrepreneurs worry that others will steal their idea "thats a huge mistake " says mr spinelli its very hard "for them to steal an idea it almost never happens " dont assume hiring a consultant will get you the same result as talking to business owners says bruce phillips a senior economist with the national federation of independent business research foundation a nonprofit research group in washington d c "you dont get the same feel that you do when you talk to real business owners who have to struggle with these decisions "  assuming control over prices "most small firms think they can manipulate prices in a market " says mr phillips "frequently you cant " do your due diligence on the industry to gauge average prices "small business owners should talk to other people in the field join an industry trade association " to get a sense of what prices the market will bear says mr phillips "talk to people who own a similar type of business preferably in a similar type of location "  not connecting with the customer small business owners often focus on their new product or service and sometimes they forget a necessary aspect how to connect with their customers mr spinelli says entrepreneurs often fail to answer basic questions including "how am i going to get to the customer " and "how is the customer going to get to me " this includes things like getting customers into a store or to a web site as well as physically getting a product to a customer another mistake small businesses make is focusing on the broader market rather than core customers says jack fuchs a business consultant and lecturer in entrepreneurship at the university of california at berkeleys haas school of business "too few entrepreneurs go out and really talk to customers and do all the leg work necessary " he says one idea ask potential customers to agree to a provisional purchase order for a pending product "if you ask that question and nobody buys it " mr fuchs says "maybe thats a hint" that your business idea isnt suitable for the market  failing to seek advisers would be entrepreneurs mistakenly think people like bill gates became successful without aid from others mr schramm says "most entrepreneurs of large scale businesses are actually part of a team of people " he says entrepreneurs need to find industry experts who are willing to advise them even if it means cold calling people you dont know and you may need investors but make sure the fit is right "just because they were the right investor for google doesnt necessarily mean theyre the right investor for this particular company " mr fuchs says "some people would like investors who are going to help a lot some want investors who are going to help only on the largest strategic issues "  not reacting to market changes entrepreneurs need to be "very quick and nimble on their feet " says mr schramm to stay on top of fluctuations in their industry ask any successful entrepreneur "and they will tell you that the company they ended up running was not very much like what they thought they would do " he says "they set out to sell x and the market doesnt buy x and they quickly move around and create x plus because thats what the market wants " andrea coombes writes for marketwatch www marketwatch com email forum sunday wsj com
