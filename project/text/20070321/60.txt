ksms confession last week khalid sheikh mohammed ksm admitted to having been responsible for planning no fewer than acts of terrorism including the horrific september attacks from "a to z " the sensational confession made during a military hearing at guantanamo bay raises a number of serious questions most pointedly about the decision of the commission to rely on the cia for information about this terrorist leader who was captured in although the commission identified ksm as a key witness in the world trade center and pentagon it never was allowed to question him or his cia interrogators instead the staff received briefings from a cia "project manager" who was himself briefed by other cia case officers on what ksm had putatively revealed during his interrogation as the commission chairmen noted this was "third hand" information but it allowed the cia to fill in critical gaps in the commissions investigation now ksms claims throw this reliance on the cia into question consider the feb attack on the north tower of the world trade center a pound truck bomb was exploded by islamist terrorists intending to topple the building over people were injured and eventually five of the perpetrators including the bomb builder ramzi yousef were caught and sentenced to life imprisonment yousef is a relative of ksm and was involved with him in a subsequent plot to blow up u s airliners nevertheless the commission concluded that ksm had played at most a "cameo role" in the attack limited to providing yousef with &# and having a few phone conversations with him and it based this conclusion largely on the cia briefings of what ksm had said during his interrogation according to the cia for example ksm had maintained that "yousef never divulged to him the target of the attack " the wtc bombing therefore appeared unrelated to the attack and so the commission had no need to investigate it or the conspirators involved in it in his confession however ksm says that he was responsible for the wtc bombing if so both it and are the work of the same mastermind and the planning financing and support network that ksm used in the attack may be relevant to the attack of especial interest are the escape routes used by abdul rahman yasin and ramzi yousef both of whom helped prepare the bomb and then fled america yasin who is not even mentioned in the report came to the u s from iraq in at about the same time as yousef and then returned to iraq via jordan despite being indicted for the world trade center bombing and put on the fbis list of the most wanted terrorist fugitives with a &# million price on his head increased to &# million after iraqi authorities allowed yasin to remain in baghdad for years in after the u s invasion he disappeared his co conspirator yousef who entered the u s under an alias on an iraqi passport switching passports to his pakistani identity escaped after the wtc bombing to pakistan where after being involved in another bombing plot with ksm he was arrested and is currently in a u s prison but if indeed ksm had been behind the bombing and the commission had not been told the opposite by the cia the question of what support ksm had in recruiting the conspirators and organizing the escape routes of the bomb makers would have become a far more pressing investigative issue for the commission of course ksms credibility is a very big "if " he might have lied in his confession about his role in the wtc bombing he might have lied to his cia captors which itself would say something about the effectiveness of their aggressive interrogation or in selecting bits and pieces out of their full context the cia project officer may have accidentally mis briefed the commission staff but at the root of the problem is the failure of the commission itself to question ksm this was not for lack of trying the commission chairmen fully recognized the need to gain access to the author of and took note that their staff was becoming "frustrated" at their inability to get information from ksm and other detainees on dec with less than seven months remaining before they had to deliver their report they brought the problem up with george tenet then cia director he told them point blank "you are not going to get access to these detainees " the commission considered using its subpoena power but was advised by its general counsel that since ksm was being held in a secret prison on foreign soil it was unlikely that any court would enforce a subpoena the commission also decided against taking the issue public believing it could not win in a battle with the administration at least in the time it had left so lacking any viable alternatives it allowed the cia to control the information it needed from ksm and other detainees the result is that basic issues concerning ksms interrogation and the dozens of crucial citations in the report are now in such doubt that commissioner bob kerrey suggested last sunday in his daily news column that ksm be put on trial in new york where presumably he could be properly cross examined while that remedy may be far fetched some resolution of this investigative failure is necessary mr epstein is writing a book on the commission
