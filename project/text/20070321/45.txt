hackers grow in sophistication computer hackers are showing a voracious appetite for sensitive information valuable in fraud schemes and new sophistication in gathering it packaging it and selling it to other criminals according to symantec corp s latest semiannual threat report malicious programs designed to filch confidential information are becoming more widespread they accounted for two thirds of the top malicious programs tracked by the security software maker during the second half of up from about half during the previous six months nearly of these programs tracked computer users keystrokes in an effort to steal account numbers passwords and other information meanwhile the online markets where stolen identities and financial account information and other commodities like "zombie" home computers and spam ready email lists are bought and sold have become more sophisticated "theres a thriving underground economy thats trading stolen information and in particular information that will lead to identity theft " complete with packaged products and well established price lists says alfred huger vice president of symantec security response a complete identity a package of a persons name date of birth social security number credit card and bank account numbers and home address sells for &# to &# mr huger says a verified paypal account sells for &# to &# depending on the available balance and an infiltrated home personal computer sells for &# to &# depending on the quality of the computer and its internet connection this economy has been developing for several years now but the level of sophistication it has reached has elevated the risk that consumers whose data is gathered will experience fraud says mr huger "if your computers broken into and information has been stolen its going to end up on the black market this is almost a certainty " he says "more than ever you need to concentrate on guarding your identity" by being careful about what sites you use and give information to and by using security software in addition to hacker infiltration of peoples home computers identity theft can occur as a result of organizations loss of customer records of such data security breaches symantec estimated that theft or loss of a computer or other item holding digital records accounted for more than half of lost information and that poor security policies accounted for mr huger says it is unclear how different kinds of security breakdowns play in cases of fraud symantec one of the worlds largest security software makers has a comprehensive view into malicious code trends unavailable from independent third parties its semiannual study draws on the work of its experts and on data from more than network sensors in countries more than million pcs that use its security software some two million decoy email accounts and a popular forum it operates where security experts disclose security vulnerabilities a sign of hackers increased sophistication and criminal intent is the rise of the "bot " a malicious program planted in home computers that provides control of the pc bot infected pcs are networked together and used for tasks like sending spam and attacking others on the internet anonymously symantec says it detected more than six million bot infected computers on the internet up from the first half of last year meanwhile the number of server computers controlling those pcs shrunk to about suggesting a consolidation in the hands of more experienced and more ruthless players mr huger says symantec has seen "bot herders" launch online attacks against smaller competitors in an effort to push them out "theyre competing for cash " he says the kinds of malicious programs hackers are using offer another sign of increased savvy attackers are increasingly favoring so called trojan horses destructive programs that masquerade as benign ones trojans accounted for of the malicious code reports symantec received among the top attacks of the period and of attempted infections these programs are often used to turn home computers into spam machines or hosts for "phishing" web sites which are fake bank or other sites used by identity thieves to trick consumers into parting with their personal information symantec says hackers are more aggressively using flaws in microsoft corp s internet explorer web browser and office applications to plant trojans in pcs because these applications allow them to bypass firewall and antivirus defenses web based attacks are in general on the rise and are making clicking on web links in emails and postings on the internet increasingly risky attacks using malicious web pages often take advantage of security holes in browsers which are bounteous symantec documented flaws in internet explorer during the second half of last year in mozilla browsers including firefox and four in apple inc s safari browser microsoft patched security holes in internet explorer an average of days after learning of them compared to two days for mozilla and as long as days for apple mr huger says that the security of apples computers is no better than those running microsofts windows operating system but that apples small market share continues to mean hacker "neglect" and therefore few bug discoveries and few attacks overall symantec documented a record security flaws in software during the period up from the previous six months database programs are increasingly being scrutinized for flaws and oracle corp software in particular mr huger says symantec documented flaws in oracle software during the period
