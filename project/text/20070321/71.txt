newcomer ice chicago merc try to sell rival bids to cbot latest offer appeals more to holders than to analysts the battle lines for the chicago board of trade have been drawn now the bickering begins the upstart intercontinentalexchange inc is planning to sit down with officials from the year old grain and bond exchange as soon as today to discuss ices &# billion merger offer according to people familiar with the matter the goal convince the cbot that its offer launched last week is better than one from chicago mercantile exchange holdings inc that cbot management agreed to last october yesterday the chicago merc the largest u s exchange operator by market value said it would meet with cbot members and shareholders tomorrow to argue for its bid part of the battle will be fought outside the boardrooms representatives of ice were outside the cbot building in chicago monday handing out fliers outlining its case for acquiring the exchange which includes bringing increased competition to derivatives trading "ice brings nothing to the table that enhances cbots growth prospects " counters terry duffy the chicago mercs chairman several analysts are leaning toward mr duffys point of view even though the ice offer is currently valued at more than the chicago merc bid they say the merc is a better partner for the cbot because the two companies are in the same town have negotiated with each other for months and have worked together since under an agreement that allows the chicago merc to collect fees for making sure the cbots trades are successfully competed the two exchanges also have complementary product lines the merc trades short term interest rates while the cbot trades long term u s treasury bonds in agriculture the mercs products livestock and hogs eat the cbots corn and soybeans shareholders though are taking ices all stock bid seriously ices shares are holding almost steady while the chicago mercs are falling further a sign the market believes ice could prevail since ice sent a letter to the cbot proposing the combination ice stock has fallen only versus a sharper drop in cme shares the divergence widens the spread between ices bid and the chicago mercs stock and cash proposal to about &# billion from &# billon when the offer was announced thursday that could force the merc to pay more if it comes in with a counteroffer "i think cme will sweeten the offer a little bit and that well end up with the cme " says patrick arbor a former cbot chairman who owns or controls about cbot shares "id rather have shares of cme " he says "its a more established exchange with more money in the bank i believe its a better fit " ice chief executive jeffrey sprecher was scheduled to arrive in chicago by today to meet with customers of the chicago exchanges and possibly local politicians people familiar with the matter said ice and cbot officials are also getting ready to go through each others books one group mr sprecher wont be meeting yet is cbot shareholders who were scheduled to vote on the merc proposal on april until the cbot delayed that vote yesterday after inviting cbot shareholders to a meeting earlier this week ice officials abruptly postponed the meeting after cbot representatives persuaded them to work with management instead of talking to shareholders according to a person familiar with the matter as an established exchange more than years old the merc argues it is better positioned to integrate the cbots business atlanta based ice on the other hand is a fast growing company that would need to invest to increase capacity while also delivering on more than &# million in promised cost savings "we believe the expense savings potential is higher for a cme deal rather than an ice deal " wrote banc of america securities analyst christopher allen after a friday meeting with the chicago mercs management part of the cmes advantage analysts say is that it has had more than six months to look inside the cbots books to find out how to wring out costs ice though argues it has a track record of integrating exchanges it has done two major deals this decade and mr sprecher says that the rapid integration of the last one the agricultural commodities focused new york board of trade gave his company the ability to pursue a bigger deal ice officials add they can handle the added business of the cbot while cutting costs about two years ago ice closed london based international petroleum exchanges trading floor and could cut costs that way but mr sprecher has sent signals that the company would try to preserve the cbot floor while still cutting costs ices best scenario to close the deal would be if the justice department were to raise roadblocks to the cbot cme proposal which has already raised red flags because the combined exchange would control more than of u s futures trading if the department does block it ice would stand as a backup for cbot though some followers of the deal say ice could face its own antitrust review especially in agriculture where both the energy dominated ice and cbot trade products the mercs biggest advantage is its size if the battle for cbot becomes a bidding war "the cmes resources and balance sheet are larger " said sandler oneill analyst richard repetto "the cme is still the front runner " richard herr an analyst with keefe bruyette &amp woods estimates cme could pay &# a share for cbot and still boost its earnings yesterday ices deal valued cbot at about &# a share versus cmes &# cbot holdings inc the parent of the board of trade rose &# to &# in new
