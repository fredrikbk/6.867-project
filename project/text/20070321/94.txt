sanyo struggles to rebound accounting issues resignation add to turmoil tokyo japanese electronics company sanyo electric has struggled to keep up with competitors despite a &# billion investment by a consortium led by goldman sachs group plus efforts to shed jobs and restructure businesses now an accounting investigation and the resignation of sanyos chairwoman raise more questions about how quickly the company can be revived shares of sanyo have fallen since the investment by goldman and its partners in february last year while the benchmark nikkei stock average of companies has gained during that period yesterday the day after sanyo announced the resignation of chairwoman tomoyo nonaka the companys stock rose to yen &# in tokyo trading sanyo said ms nonaka years old was resigning for personal reasons the announcement puts a spotlight on sanyos management strategy the former journalist was a controversial figure when she took on the post of chairwoman and chief executive in june because she came into the company with little management experience or knowledge of the electronics industry though ms nonaka was initially celebrated as the first woman to lead a major japanese electronics maker analysts said they wondered whether it was toshimasa iue the president and grandson of sanyos founder who was really running the company ms nonakas accomplishments were limited as she focused on building sanyos brand image around environmentally friendly products such as rechargeable batteries and solar products "ms nonaka touted abstract slogans and that wasnt very persuasive " says tatsuya mizuno an industry analyst for fitch ratings "sanyo needs strong leadership that can provide a specific vision for product areas it intends to focus on to compete against stronger rivals " like many other second tier japanese electronics companies sanyo has been squeezed by lower cost manufacturers elsewhere in asia and by rising raw material costs meanwhile the companys vast portfolio of products ranging from rice cookers and television sets to semiconductors and batteries has spread resources so thinly that it is unable to keep up with larger rivals such as sony corp matsushita electric industrial co and samsung electronics co to try to alleviate the problems the management team has undertaken a massive restructuring since when the company was forced into an unprofitable position after an earthquake damaged a chip plant sanyo has cut thousands of jobs and has closed factories and businesses but many analysts say the company needs to be even more aggressive part of the obstacle to stronger restructuring efforts they say has been ms nonaka though she lost much of her power in january in a management shuffle that eliminated her ceo title she was seen to be an ally of mr iue who many observers consider resistant to drastic change sanyo hasnt announced who will succeed ms nonaka analysts say shares of sanyo are unlikely to turn around anytime soon as its businesses continue to suffer in november the company said that because of falling prices of mobile phones and digital cameras as well as by costs connected with cutting jobs it would post a loss of billion yen for the fiscal year that ends this month even in its battery business one of the few areas in which it has leading market share the company has hit a bump it recalled about two million mobile phone and laptop computer batteries because of overheating or recharging problems the biggest issue for sanyo now is uncertainty about its accounting on feb the shares fell to yen after it was revealed that japans securities and exchange surveillance commission was investigating the companys accounting practices sanyo is conducting its own inquiry into whether it needs to revise past financial statements fitch ratings which has a bb plus rating on sanyo meaning there is a possibility of credit risk developing has put sanyos long term debt rating under negative review in light of the disclosure morgan stanley analyst masahiro ono says he believes that once the accounting matter is settled sanyo has a chance to recover "theres plenty of possibility since theyve got the funds " he says referring to the investment by goldman daiwa securities smbc co and sumitomo mitsui financial group inc mr ono adds the company should sell or close all businesses that arent making money or arent a core activity sanyo has already taken some steps the most notable was last years creation of a wholly owned chip company the move is seen as a precursor for selling that business this year
