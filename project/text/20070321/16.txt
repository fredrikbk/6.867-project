british airways prepares to defend its skies heathrow faces big changes if u s eu pact goes ahead to deregulate air travel if all goes as expected tomorrow in brussels the eu states will vote to start deregulating air travel across the atlantic ushering in greater competition on routes between the u s and europe british airways plc has long opposed the "open skies" deal in part because it would open up the british airlines home base heathrow airport to more rival airlines but the airline has a plan b that in the near term could mean good news for ba fliers in the form of lower fares business class promotions and easier connections for flights between london and u s cities including houston and atlanta in the longer term the new pact will likely bring even more benefits to trans atlantic fliers as it heightens competition and increases the links between heathrow and the u s while the u s already has fairly liberal air travel agreements with most european countries the u k has been a stumbling block particularly heathrow with its limited capacity under the present treaty between the u s and the u k ba and virgin atlantic airways ltd are the only british carriers that can fly from heathrow to the u s while amr corp s american airlines and ual corp s united airlines are the only u s carriers permitted at the airport the open skies agreement would replace such bilateral treaties with a single u s eu pact that removes most restrictions on destinations frequencies and fares though it is still possible that disputes in the eu could derail the agreement if it goes through as expected the treaty could go into effect as soon as october meaning a host of new airlines can start planning new routes to and from heathrow among the u s airlines that have already expressed interest in jumping into heathrow if the "open skies" pact is approved are continental airlines inc delta air lines inc and northwest airlines corp ba argued the pact doesnt go far enough in opening the u s airline market even under the new agreement it wont be able to use its u s destinations as a springboard to most places outside the u k but bas critics charge it mainly wants to protect its prime position in london ba gets almost of its operating profits from routes linking britain to u s cities including denver phoenix and seattle the long term hit to bas profits from extra competition and lower fares "could be quite material " says chris avery an airline analyst at j p morgan in london so before the new competitors arrive ba is readying some pre emptive strikes "when open skies happens we know what we are going to do " ba chief executive willie walsh recently told an investor conference "british airways will not be damaged " he told members of the british parliament several days later part of that plan is pushing new perks to tighten the airlines lock on a steady clientele of business travelers the carrier recently began rolling out a &# million revamp of its business class on long haul flights called "club world " and would promote it more aggressively if the open skies pact goes through executives have said ba was the first carrier in to offer business class seats that open completely flat into a bed over the next few months ba will offer cushier roomier seats bigger tables and wider video screens on all its long range planes ba is even rolling out better food including a self serve "pantry" where fliers can grab drinks or snacks throughout a flight "ba will make the most of club world " said craig jenks who runs airline aircraft projects an international aviation consultancy in new york the airline also plans to improve its service to atlanta dallas and houston by shifting those flights to heathrow from londons secondary gatwick airport where they are now forced to fly under the current treaty heathrow is more desirable because it offers more connecting flights easier access to london and even better shopping mr walshs ability to deliver on his pledge will of course depend on how aggressively bas competitors push into the airlines home turf another part of bas defense tactic will be to grab more space at heathrow before other airlines can playing on its advantages as heathrows now dominant carrier with around of all takeoff and landing "slots " heathrow is the worlds busiest international airport by passenger traffic and operating near capacity when it comes to the complex process of getting flight time slots gates and terminal space airlines are on their own and the open skies agreement wont provide any help on this to get takeoff and landing slots airlines must either go through a lottery process that can take years buy them from other airlines a prime time slot at heathrow goes for as much as &# million or work out arrangements with partners that have slots but it isnt impossible "five years from now you wont be able to remember how little u s competition there was at heathrow" if the open skies deal is approved " mr avery says "we would very much like to have slots at heathrow " said a spokesman for northwest airlines who declined to comment on specifics of the carriers plans airlines such as northwest and delta could get slots and space at heathrow through their respective european partners klm royal dutch airlines and air france both divisions of air france klm sa the european carriers now fly from heathrow to france and the netherlands and could strike deals to switch their slots over to flights to the u s all four carriers have said such deals would be possible klm for example has weekly flights between heathrow and the small dutch city of eindhoven using a seat turboprop northwest could fill those heathrow slots with a wide body plane that seats more than people and go directly to minneapolis or detroit instead of eindhoven potentially generating far more profits for both partners says mr jenks klm "will discuss opportunities with our partners" after the outcome of tomorrows vote is clear a spokesman for the dutch airline said william echikson and rod stone contributed to this article
