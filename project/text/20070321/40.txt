economists react economists focus on three words in feds rate decision statement online edition the federal open market committee held its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at for a sixth straight meeting and acknowledged signs of a worsening economy and higher price pressures below economists and others dissect the statement particularly fixated on three words "future policy adjustments" and what it means for future fed rate moves the real action this time occurred in the policy bias paragraph of the statement inflation continued to be cited as the predominant policy concern but the second sentence referenced "future policy adjustments" contrasting to the previously used wording of "additional firming " by swapping the more ambiguous "adjustment" for "firming " the fomc edges closer to a truly neutral bias although in our mind the continued mention of inflation as the primary concern indicates that an easing move is not immediately around the corner barring a much sharper slowing in growth than currently envisioned joshua shapiro mfr inc in short this is a grudging removal of the tightening bias the fed is not quite as worried about inflation but is not yet sufficiently relaxed to abandon the idea it might have to hike again despite "mixed" data and "ongoing" housing "adjustment " the fed still expects "moderate" growth when that does not materialize expect rapid easing start aug at latest ian shepherdson high frequency economics bernanke and company chose to double down their bets and refrained from cultivating a dovish statement that might validate the recent move in the federal funds futures market to price in cuts this summer in fact given the tone of the statement we do expect that fed rhetoric over the coming weeks will provide support to the march monetary statement and dampen expectations of cuts in the near term joseph brusuelas ideaglobal while core inflation is still above the feds target zone the continuation of sub potential growth in should lead to a moderation in inflationary pressures it seems prudent at this point to nudge the policy bias slightly in the direction of neutral but keep a wary eye on first base to make sure that inflation does not attempt to steal second brian bethune global insight todays statement states that "future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth " thus omitting the phrase "the extent and timing of any additional firming that might be needed " some analysts are touting this change in language as meaning the fomc has abandoned its tightening bias we strongly disagree but will acknowledge that while the fomcs tightening bias remains in place todays statement represents a somewhat kinder and gentler tightening bias richard moody mission residential if the feds predominant policy concern is that inflation will fail to moderate then the most likely risk to policy is higher rates relative to the current funds rate not lower rates we do not see the changed language as paving the way or opening the door to a potential rate cut down the road john ryding bear stearns economics the feds statement was as close to sarcasm as you might ever expect to hear from that august body of course they cant say what they really think the fed knows how important confidence is and they do not want to do anything to discourage consumer sentiment or spook the psychology of the markets if they were unconcerned with those issues the statement might look more like this " recent indicators have been much worse than what we were hoping for housing is a bigger mess than we anticipated business capex is heading south as are durable goods retail sales have been punk for months running dont even ask about the auto makers we expect the economy is likely to continue to soften until it slips to about a gdp " barry ritholtz ritholtz research &amp analytics the statement contained one significant surprise specifically the risk assessment language was altered in a way that left a tightening bias in place but replaced the reference to "any additional firming" with "future policy adjustments " we see the change as reflecting a "cleaning up" of the risk assessment language that carries little policy significance however we admit that there is one major problem with this interpretation the fed knows the risk assessment was being viewed as a signaling mechanism why change it now and risk generating market confusion about their near term intentions david greenlaw ted wieseman morgan stanley research
