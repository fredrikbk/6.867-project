therapeutic safety issues of biochemical copies the biotech medicines to which you refer in "for booming biotech firms a new threat generics" page one march are large complex molecules made from living cells and no two cell lines are precisely identical therefore although two such biological products may be similar they can never be exact copies from a biochemical perspective there are numerous examples some of which you cite where biological products thought to be comparable were found to behave differently in the clinic these differences can have important therapeutic and safety consequences for patients the u s food and drug administration understands these crucial distinctions which is why the agency refers to similar biotech medicines as follow on biologicals in europe regulators have adopted a term "biosimilars " that captures the relationship between the innovator product and the copy the two drugs are indeed similar but non identical in light of the potential therapeutic and safety implications physicians and patients need to understand that biosimilar products may behave differently than the innovator product this is especially important from the perspective of post marketing surveillance where it is essential that adverse experience reporting be linked precisely to the product that was prescribed amgen isnt opposed to biosimilars we have made our position clear biosimilars should be permitted to enter the market when patents on current drugs expire its the right thing to do in fact amgen would support an abbreviated regulatory pathway for biosimilar drugs as long as there is sufficient testing to establish similarity with respect to both efficacy and safety in pre clinical as well as clinical settings and with the proviso that each biosimilar must be uniquely identified in the marketplace to permit brand specific safety surveillance of the biosimilar products amgens mission is to serve patients so our interest in the biosimilars debate centers squarely on ensuring that these products are safe and effective that will only happen if the people who are prescribing them using them and paying for them make decisions about the drugs based upon sound scientific and clinical information roger m perlmutter m d ph d executive vice president research &amp development amgen inc thousand oaks calif
