business world why be public look upon blackstones prospectus if one is ever issued as a self rebuttal to blackstone co founder stephen schwarzmans comment "the public markets are overrated " that was just one of his numerous recent contributions to a debate among financial theorists legal scholars and bloggers over whether private equity as personified by mr schwarzman himself has become a more efficient way of financing and managing large industrial enterprises than the public corporation that issues shares on the stock market now blackstone is contemplating issuing shares to the public and mr schwarzman is accused of at best irony and at worst hypocrisy by anchors on cnbc meanwhile the kibitzers are thinking anew about the tradeoffs between public and private we wont hold our breath for a prospectus which would be under no obligation in any case to explain why blackstone a &# billion collection of ownership stakes in companies real estate and other assets has decided to go public timing we may consider self explanatory mr schwarzman and partners think they will get a good price his face has recently been hyped on magazine covers his th birthday bash last month was strained and kneaded for every last drop of metaphorical value a tidy trope of financial potboilers since the gilded age extravagances of the vanderbilts and their ilk too mr schwarzman has publicly fretted about the cost of capital going up for private equity what some have called his urge to unload part of his firm on a "greater fool" might just as aptly be called an urge to share the risks of his business with diversified investors more willing and able to bear those risks nor is there any reason to think the public markets would be willing to pay a "foolish" price for blackstone shares but what about the theoretical argument between private vs public mr schwarzman has offered two observations perfectly separable one is that government regulation shareholder lawsuits and political mau mauing have made the bureaucratic and legal overhead of being a public company prohibitive in relation to the benefits yup costs attend going public as well as benefits and the costs likely have been rising since enron and worldcom but regulation is driven by headlines and headlines about the power of private equity now are making washington hungry to regulate and tax the private equity firms more punitively so it goes wealth holders are constantly on the hunt for new legal and financial structures to preserve their wealth from predatorial government and government is never far behind second and more dubious or at least more subjective is mr schwarzmans complaint that the public markets obsession with quarterly profits works against intelligent management of companies for the long term here we come to the real crux complaints about short termism always issue from managers who naturally prefer freedom from second guessing and nitpicking but the shoe rapidly shifts to the other foot when an owner manager wants to retreat to a more passive role then the second guessing of public investors becomes a blessing not a curse few of us after all are prepared to extend to our agents the trust and confidence that we extend to ourselves in caring for our precious money and the benefits of a public share price only begin with the opportunity and incentive for all the smartest money in the world to inform itself about a company and its prospects and cast a weighted vote in the stock market constant feedback from well informed investors is also a form of competitive intelligence providing a signal when managements strategies arent working its assumptions need revisiting or new developments in the marketplace warrant its attention a public share price also allows no ambiguity internally about a companys overarching purpose no difficulty in communicating its agenda and challenges up and down the chain of command nor any uncertainty about what constitutes success and failure and a public listing offers a transparent easily understood mechanism to attract talent to a growing operation like blackstone in the form of stock options stock options allow risks to be shared with recruits without the arbitrariness or unreliability of promised bonuses and profit sharing after the fact most of all a public listing provides the incentive and means for well informed outsiders to intervene and force a change in direction when a company is off track these benefits have tended to be downgraded in the recent enthusiasm for escaping from the public markets while mr schwarzman runs blackstone he like anyone undoubtedly prefers to be free of outside monitoring by busybody investors and analysts and financial journalists someday though he will hand off to a successor whom he will prefer not to trust quite so much one onlooker christopher bower chairman of pacific corporate group was aptly quoted in saturdays journal about why a public listing becomes attractive at this point to blackstones founders "they can use this to further institutionalize their business and make sure blackstone is around years from now versus relying on any one personality " bingo private equity does have the virtues its admirers claim for it relative freedom for now from regulation the unity of ownership and control which eliminates the monitoring costs risk premium and related inefficiencies that attend a public company the public markets may indeed no longer offer any real advantage as a way to finance a business as a way of closing the information loop and allowing owners the freedom to be absentee however the merits of the public markets are in danger of being underrated
