fiscally fit leave the kid back readers share their insights on the benefits and drawbacks of repeating a grade in school online edition all we can say is "wow " my husband gerry and i were awed by the response to last weeks column in which i dissected our debate over whether our son gerald should repeat second grade or progress along with his classmates despite struggling with his class work i wanted to hold gerald back a year and gerry was against it primarily because he feared gerald would be stigmatized and taunted by former classmates for being left back we decided to share our dilemma because we hoped readers would share their own experiences with being left back and you didnt let us down in my forum on the topic readers posted their thoughts on the u s public school system and the pressure kids are under to progress in school based on age and not their level of maturity but more poignant responses came to us by way of email as many readers who were left back in school shared their successes you might be surprised by how many presidents vice presidents and other captains of industry once repeated a grade others looked back and voiced their regrets at being pushed ahead when they now feel they should have been left back that said a few readers urged us to avoid having gerald repeat a grade at all costs citing the enormous social toll repeating a grade had on their own lives and parents who have faced the same decision shared lingering misgivings over whether they made the right choice this week id like to share some of their stories anonymously to allow parents facing similar decisions to benefit from readers wealth of experience as gerry and i have as always letters have been edited ive also talked with some experts to get their insights on the emotional and academic impact on children who are left back for the most part parents and former students looked back and were satisfied that repeating a grade was the right thing to do for all parties my daughter and i were both born on july and both of us repeated grades my daughter stayed behind one year in nursery school and went on to excel in school graduating university magna cum laude we all agree we made the right choice i repeated th grade i went on to yale and being held back was no big deal socially but i do wish id been held back in preschool when there was less stigma one of my grandsons had similar problems with behavior and struggling to keep up the school suggested it might be better to have him repeat a grade nd or rd i was dismayed at first but the results spoke for themselves because he found schoolwork easier he did better was more relaxed and in the end happier he has steady as and a few bs now that hes in high school other kids move on gerald will make new friends i repeated kindergarten and went on to college an mba and two professional designations and ive had a successful career i never felt like id failed because my parents and teachers were positive about their reasons for having me repeat the grade i remember it but not in a negative way my oldest daughter repeated st grade we struggled with it but ultimately &lt ndash&gt and using our private school principals words &lt ndash&gt we gave her the gift of an extra year shes now in high school with straight as and we believe the extra year gave her a chance to catch up her friends were still her friends and she was never made to feel small if it were me i would give gerald the gift of an extra year and work with the adults in his life to ensure the best possible outcome when my son was in first grade his teachers told me the exact same thing yours did but i was afraid of the stigma so i didnt hold him back big mistake hes in th grade now and has a very hard time keeping up he also is extremely immature for his age i would stick with the teachers assessment i was younger than a lot of my classmates and there was serious discussion about whether to hold me back at the end of st grade looking back i wish my parents had how well i do in school seems to directly correlate to my maturity level and how mature my peers are its something about which i often think the main problem was confidence issues if you can find an effective way to deal with that you should be fine id recommend holding him back the overwhelming conviction among readers that students do benefit from an extra year of development made my husband gerry wonder if he was making too much of the social aspects of repeating a grade for a professional perspective i turned to richard iannuzzi who taught elementary school for years and is now president of the new york state united teachers union mr iannuzzi reassured me that kids tend to adjust well socially after being left back "it is amazing how those students do adjust to retention how quickly they make friends " he says "the rest of the class loses track of it very quickly " he cautions however that leaving a child back doesnt always result in the academic payoff youd expect "often the case is not just simply that the child wasnt academically ready there may be other emotional issues going on in the family or the child has some type of undetected disability " he says "more often than not you discover another factor that is at play rather than just the maturity level " while most reader experiences with repeating a grade were positive there were a handful of reactions that made my stomach churn a few readers well into their s still look back in anger and resentment at being left back other parents say they didnt take educators advice to leave their kids back and have no regrets i missed almost half of th grade due to an illness and was allowed the choice of repeating th grade or going on to th grade i felt that my teachers and parents wanted me to repeat so i did it was a mistake that has affected my life to this day i was no longer in class with my friends and i graduated a year after my classmates many of us started kindergarten together once i was a senior and my friends went off to college i felt left behind i never went to a class reunion my class graduated a year before me there was also a kid on my block who had to repeat kindergarten and he never overcame the humiliation of not going on to first grade with the rest of us please consider these experiences when you make a decision that may affect your child for the balance of his life my husband is years old and his mother kept him back in st grade for all the reasons cited in your column to this day it bugs him my sister is years old and she was left back in rd grade believe it or not she is still ashamed dont do it our sons kindergarten teacher recommended holding him back a year for social reasons my wife and i elected to not take this recommendation today our son is still not a social butterfly but he is independent and happy we just didnt feel at that time years ago that there was any evidence holding him back would help him be anything more than he is today your sons long term outcome isnt likely to hinge on holding him back or not holding him back he is who he is these letters made me second guess my own conviction that repeating a grade is best for gerald they clarified the social ramifications of leaving a child behind in a way we cant ignore studies on children who have been left back support these sentiments says clancy blair an associate professor in the department of human development and family studies at penn state "studies on children who repeated grades have shown that being left back isnt particularly beneficial because of the social aspects " he says "social competence and friendships are a determinant of early progress in school " and no study in the world can help parents struggling with this decision he says because at the end of the day its really a clinical decision "is this the right decision for this particular child " mr iannuzzi agrees that the childs emotional well being should be a determining factor one instance where he absolutely would avoid leaving a child back is when the student would have a younger sibling in the same grade or when the child is at the same maturity level with his or her classmates "if the childs emotional makeup is that theyre likely to shut down if theyre detained then that outweighs the academic risk of moving them forward " he says finally reader parker lyons wrote in to offer some suggestions on how to best include gerald in the decision making process and help ease his transition should we decide its best for him to repeat a grade i am an october baby but my mother didnt recognize that i was rushed into school too quickly it wasnt until nd grade that the parent teacher and principal got together and suggested i repeat second grade im still unhappy about this but what has me most upset is that it wasnt presented well or explained properly and the emphasis on the positive aspects of staying back werent stressed enough if i can give you any suggestions it would be to do what i would have liked when i was geralds age and facing the same situation dont spring the decision on him make it a process of discovery and discussion dont wait until the end of the school year he has to say goodbye to his friends help him with developing a positive story for his friends and a response for answering the negative comments hell get make sure he knows the kids in his new class i went from knowing everyone very well to knowing no one emphasize over time that this is all about learning and understanding be clear on your expectations my parents seemed to "hope" this would work and i really felt alone and adrift dont feel guilty just treat him with respect thanks to all of you who wrote in to share your experiences your candor has helped make our decision easier please join in the ongoing discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of repeating a grade write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com
