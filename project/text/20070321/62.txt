linens n things goal is far off if apollo management lp and its co investors ever hope to revive linens n things inc theyre going to have to win over shoppers like vilma rivera who walked away with some harsh words for the retailer after a trip to its jersey city n j store "the stores arent kept in stock and a lot of things are broken " said ms rivera who left empty handed when she couldnt find a baking dish she liked "its just kind of disappointing " ms riveras comments show that a year after going private and embarking on an aggressive plan to fix the business linens n things is still a long way off from getting its house in order chief executive robert dinicola is the first to admit that but he said the clifton n j retailer is in better shape than it was when it was purchased for &# billion in february by apollo nrdc real estate advisors llc and silver point capital fund investments llc "this is a major turnaround " mr dinicola said in a recent interview "we have a lot of problems to clean up " linens n things has stumbled over the past two years as home furnishings became one of the most competitive areas of retail it was slow to adapt as the sector transitioned to a fashion driven business from a largely utilitarian one and customers defected to chief rival bed bath &amp beyond inc and discount giant target corp linens n thingss new owners spent trying to lure customers back with an overhaul of its basic business this entailed clearing out old merchandise and using the cash from sales of those items to ensure that its best selling items are always in stock cleaning up the appearance of its locations and making sure that similar goods like sheets and pillows are displayed together reducing overall inventory levels to free up money and reduce clutter and reviving its bread and butter textile business by carrying more stylish assortments like wool knit throws and herringbone sheets by designer nate berkus apollo and its co investors brought in a slew of experienced retail executives to implement those changes starting with mr dinicola a renowned turnaround executive who masterminded the revitalizations of jewelry store chain zale corp in the s and more recently of vitamin seller general nutrition centers inc another apollo holding joining him among others is executive vice president of merchandising robert homler who worked under mr dinicola at gnc where he oversaw merchandising the changes have yet to help the companys bottom line as clearance markdowns have hurt margins despite driving sales the company reported a loss for the year of &# million including significant interest expense compared with net income of &# million in but same store sales appear to be stabilizing declining just in compared with a decline the year earlier mr dinicola said hes happy with the companys operational improvements but admits that he wished it had fared better financially "but that will come " he said "sometimes you have to take a couple of steps backward to go forward " still some industry experts say apollo and its co investors may have underestimated the challenges ahead when they bought the company apollo banking on its finesse at turning around troubled retailers likely sized up the stellar performance of bed bath &amp beyond and figured that linens n things could steal market share with some simple operational improvements said karru martinson a high yield analyst who covers retail for cibc world markets "the reality of the situation is things were a lot worse than they were expecting " said mr martinson "the story had been this is low hanging fruit lets clean it up a little bit and everythings going to be good " apollo and its co investors may have also failed to predict a general malaise that has gripped linens n things and its competitors likely driven by problems in the housing industry according to howard davidowitz chairman of davidowitz &amp associates inc a retail consulting and investment banking firm in new york "what i dont think they expected was what happened in retail housing last year " mr davidowitz said "the residential housing market collapsed which was hard to predict given how things were a few years ago " mr dinicola however rejects the assessment that linens n things is worse off than apollo expected the buyers knew they were in for a tough turnaround from the start he said thats why they invested &# million of equity half the total purchase price into the buyout he said giving the company the liquidity to start an operational overhaul right away mr dinicola has maintained from the start that it would take a long time to fix the problems at linens n things unveiling a nine year turnaround plan last march the company spent implementing the first phase which entails cleaning up the basic business and reviving its three product lines textiles housewares and decorative home accessories phase two will entail branching into new product categories like bridal goods and in the final phase the company will start expanding its store base some analysts are on board with the companys view "its still a work in progress " said carla casella a consumer products and retail analyst with j p morgan chase &amp co "we assumed it would take two years before we start to see any real impact i think theyre doing a good job with what was there "
