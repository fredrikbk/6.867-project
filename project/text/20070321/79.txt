next in line a poetry lover tries to keep u k economy in rhythm poised to take top job brown pushes openness amid spending worries london as he is poised to become prime minister of britain gordon browns great political balancing act embracing both global capitalism and big government is teetering in his decade as finance minister britons have become richer londons financial center is booming the united kingdom has opened its doors wide to foreign capital and legal immigration with little of the backlash seen in the u s or continental europe yet mr brown who enjoys almost complete latitude to run the economy under prime minister tony blair has also unleashed a flood of public spending he has raised the countrys tax burden angering businesses and added two thirds of a million people to the government payroll now although the economy is growing at a clip rising taxes and utility prices are beginning to bite the average familys disposable income actually fell last year meanwhile mr browns penchant for fine tuning taxes has doubled the size of the tax code to pages thats the second longest in the worlds top economies after india according to a november study by the world bank and accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers preparing to take over from his old friend and rival mr brown the bookish son of a scottish presbyterian minister will bring a sharply different style to the job mr blair has a lawyers talent for articulating any argument and an actors instinct for the camera mr brown can appear awkward the former rugby player he was blinded in one eye in a game while at edinburgh university often bruises opponents with reams of data and special reports that in some cases have run to thousands of pages mr brown is expected to confirm in his annual budget speech today that spending growth will have to slow starting next year but after boosting the governments share of the economy to about the same as germanys he is adamant that he wont introduce thatcherite efforts to cut back "we are seeing the biggest restructuring of the economy since the industrial revolution " he said in an interview "the issue for the future is how you avoid even people who are benefited by globalization thinking that somehow because there is huge change forced upon them that they are losers " the labour party is expected to vote in june on a successor to mr blair as party leader mr brown is the overwhelming favorite he would then become prime minister by virtue of labours parliamentary majority but he faces a tough fight to stay in power once the full electorate gets its say the prime minister can call parliamentary elections any time he wishes but must do so by may a monthly icm research opinion poll published in the guardian newspaper yesterday asked people whether they would vote for the labour party under mr brown or the opposition conservatives under david cameron a fresh faced year old who has mr blairs smooth oratorical style the conservatives came out percentage points ahead conservatives charge that mr brown has wasted the new spending on schools hospitals and transport and of britons agree according to the icm poll "people up and down the country who are struggling to find a decent school place or campaigning to keep their local hospital open or sitting in traffic on congested roads are entitled to ask where has all the money gone " the conservative partys shadow finance minister george osborne said in a december parliamentary debate mr brown is likely to face similar attacks when he releases his budget numbers today hemmed in by rising budget deficits he has little room for eye catching programs but he is expected to lay out plans for improving u k schools a core element of his globalization program and to offer something to business leaders they say britain is losing its competitive edge under mr brown and they want lower corporate taxes "look has productivity gone up yes has employment risen yes has prosperity risen yes has wealth risen yes about have we been the most stable economy of all the advanced industrial economies probably " mr brown said in the interview "but of course i want us to do better " a voracious reader mr brown occasionally asks the national poet laureate andrew motion for recommendations of new poets to read adding to favorites such as wordsworth and t s eliot mr brown also invited mr motion to his home "the first poetry reading in downing street since disraeli " said mr brown proudly recently he wrote a book of essays titled "courage " due for publication in may the essay subjects include martin luther king raoul wallenberg the swedish diplomat who saved thousands of jews during world war ii and edith cavell an english nurse executed by germany in world war i for helping allied soldiers escape from a red cross hospital in belgium "i like working on a lot of things at once so inevitably theres always a lot of papers around and a lot of books " said mr brown he recalled a little sheepishly how police had come to investigate a burglary in his edinburgh apartment while he was writing his doctoral dissertation "one of them came out of my study and said totally ransacked totally ransacked it hadnt been touched " he said for five years mr brown dated princess margarita daughter of the deposed king michael of romania "i never stopped loving him but one day it didnt seem right any more " the princess said in a interview with a british womens magazine "it was politics politics politics and i needed nurturing " later according to biographer paul routledge mr brown had long relationships with a lawyer and a british broadcasting corp journalist when labour took power in messrs blair and brown swapped homes the official residence of the chancellor of the exchequer the formal title of britains finance minister at no downing street is bigger than the famed no mr blair arrived with his wife and four children and has since had a fifth child mr brown then unmarried moved into no and still lives there in at he married sarah macaulay who had co founded a public relations firm representing leftist causes with the daughter of famed marxist historian eric hobsbawm ms macaulay took her husbands name quit her job and has avoided involvement in political debates the browns prematurely born daughter jennifer jane died after a day struggle in reminded of her over lunch in the treasurys bustling cafeteria mr brown seemed to surprise himself by shedding tears proceeds from sales of his book will go to a charity the browns set up to fund research into pregnancy complications that cause premature birth the couple also have a year old son john and an month old james fraser who was born with cystic fibrosis a hereditary disease from which most sufferers die mr brown now says he wants to restore a lost sense of britishness to help unite scots welsh english and the countrys growing immigrant communities he describes the relationship with the u s as "incredibly central to what we do as a country " while he is unlikely to emulate mr blairs tight relationship with president bush which badly eroded the prime ministers popularity at home he is equally unlikely to make any showy break mr brown spends his summer vacations on cape cod and is an unabashed admirer of u s enterprise from the start in mr brown strove to erase fears that he would repeat the mistakes of his labour predecessors whose punitive taxes and profligate spending ended in recessions and currency crises he gave independence to the bank of england eliminating concern that he would meddle with monetary policy for political reasons he even cut corporation taxes to from britains media dubbed him the iron chancellor though he made and kept a promise not to raise income tax rates mr brown used creativity to amass a war chest for public programs in he eliminated a tax break for pension funds that has cost them about gbp billion a year according to pricewaterhousecoopers he increased the tax britons pay when buying property and raised income tax thresholds slowly so that the number of britons paying the top rate of has risen nearly most recently he increased the tax on airline passengers in the name of battling global warming by mr brown was ready to open wide the treasurys coffers the poor got tax credits and health care got a big bump up in spending biographer robert peston titled a chapter of a book describing the period "how brown won the confidence of financial markets so that he could be a real socialist " wrong interpretation said mr brown his goal he said was to provide services that people need to survive the dislocations of globalization so far the approach seems to have worked when the european union expanded to eastern europe in the u k was unusual in allowing poles slovaks and others to come and work freely right away in the first two years people poured into the u k and it turned out to be a boon for the economy to be sure grumbling about the migrants led the government to restrict immigration from the eus newest members romania and bulgaria while france and spain are battling to keep out foreign utilities britons barely reacted to the news that a spanish company wants to buy scottish power plc mr blair boasted to eu leaders last year that downing street is supplied by a french electricity company a german water company and a choice of four gas companies only one of them british its mr browns willingness to spend that worries some economists as recently as government spending hit a low of of u k gross domestic product not far from the u s level of according to figures from the organization for economic cooperation and development in paris today the u k figure is just one percentage point below the european average mr brown said he had little choice britains public infrastructure had been starved of investment for decades before mr browns budget boost britains per capita health spending was one third of the u s level the world health organization estimated in that britons a year were dying of cancer who would have survived in better european health systems when mr brown said he was raising taxes to pay for health it was a popular move by next year the annual budget of the national health service will have doubled in real terms since to gbp billion under britains state run system everyone is entitled to free health care provided by doctors who are paid by the state the number of nhs staff has grown by to million waiting lists have been slashed st bartholomews &amp the london a pair of london hospitals are undergoing a gbp billion redevelopment the project is the largest of about around the country the new glass and steel hospital at the london will include a state of the art cardiac center and a tall building topped by a helipad st bartholomews will get similar treatment and a new cancer center yet many people complain that the spending hasnt translated into better care the number of beds at u k hospitals has actually fallen since an nhs sponsored poll last october found that more than half of britons think the nhs has gotten worse since and that the "government has wasted most of the extra money " in its haste to hire more personnel the nhs often turned to nurses and doctors from other eu countries africa and asia complaints about poor english and cultural differences are legion khaled choudury recently spent several weeks in two london hospitals after his pelvis was broken in a motorcycle accident he says nursing hygiene was poor and he went for days without pills he needs for a heart condition because caregivers either didnt think it was their job or didnt understand english well "what i dont understand is that all these things are normally effects of cost reduction initiatives " not a big budget increase says mr choudury higher salaries for doctors and nurses have soaked up about half of the new spending yet doctors still arent happy they complain the governments bureaucracy in the campaign to reduce waiting lists is micromanaging decisions on which patients need attention first some say british health care needs a dose of capitalism co payments for patients currently they never see a bill and more private sector competition for the governments health dollars political scuttlebutt says mr brown blocked mr blair from making more such changes which are unpopular with the left of the labour party he denies it but a page report on future health and other policies from his department last year made no mention of moving in a free market direction many hospitals have gone into debt some are letting staff go and some are closing st bartholomews &amp the london last august said they would mothball of the new hospitals planned beds citing rising costs and falling budgets "the whole system suddenly got so much money it lurched like a drunken sailor " says alan maynard chairman of the body that runs the nhs
