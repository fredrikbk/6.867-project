the mossberg solution from pc to tv via apple we test gadget that lets you play digital video music photos on your widescreen the race to connect your tv to your computer and the internet is about to kick into high gear this week when apple inc the company many believe is best positioned to pull off this feat introduces a slender wireless set top box called apple tv this silvery little &# gadget is designed to play and display on a widescreen family room tv set all the music video and photos stored on up to six computers around the house even if they are far from the tv and even if they are all windows pcs rather than apples own macintosh models it can also pull a very limited amount of music and video directly off the internet onto the tv apple tv is tiny just about eight inches square and an inch high far smaller than a typical dvd player or cable or satellite box even though it packs in a gigabyte hard disk an intel processor and a modified version of the mac operating system and it has a carefully limited set of functions yet in our tests it worked great and we can easily recommend it for people who are yearning for a simple way to show on their big tvs all that stuff trapped on their computers we tried it with various combinations of windows and mac computers with movies photos tv shows video clips and music and we didnt even use the fastest wireless network it can handle it performed flawlessly however it wont work with older tvs unless they can display widescreen formatted content and accept some newer types of cables like the ipod before it apple tv isnt the first gadget in its category several other companies have made set top boxes or even tv sets and game consoles that could link the tv to the digital content that people have on their computers but none has found a mass audience for this functionality mainly because they tend to be hard to set up and confusing to use apple is hoping that just as the ipod trumped earlier but geekier rivals apple tv can do the same by making a complex task really simple part of the secret of apple tv is that like most of apples products it doesnt try to do everything and thus become a mess of complexity it cant receive or record cable or satellite tv so it isnt meant as a replacement for your cable or satellite box or for a digital video recorder like a tivo it cant play dvds so it doesnt replace your dvd player its sole function is to bring to the tv digital content stored on your computer or drawn from the internet like a dvd player it uses its own separate input on your tv set and you have to change inputs using your tv remote to use it apple tv isnt for that small slice of techies who buy a full blown computer and plug it directly into a tv or for gamers who prefer to do it all through a game console and its not for people who are content to watch downloaded tv shows and movies directly on a computer screen instead its for the much larger group of people who want to keep their home computers where they are and yet enjoy their downloaded media on their widescreen tvs apple tvs most formidable competitor is the xbox game console from microsoft which in addition to playing games can also play back content from windows computers on a tv and xbox can do something apple tv cant do at least not yet which is to directly purchase and download movies and tv shows from the internet but the comparable xbox costs more than apple tv is much larger and stores only half as much material weve been testing apple tv for the past days or so and our verdict is that its a beautifully designed easy to use product that should be very attractive to people with widescreen tv sets and lots of music videos and photos stored on computers it has some notable limitations but we really liked it it is classic apple simple and elegant in our tests apple tv performed perfectly in walts house over a standard wi fi wireless network with a pioneer plasma tv and six different computers three windows machines from hewlett packard and dell and three apple macs setup was a breeze the user interface was clean and handsome and video and audio quality were quite good for anyone but picky audiophiles and videophiles we never suffered any stuttering buffering or hesitation while playing audio and video from distant computers unlike any of its rivals apple tv can play the copy protected music tv shows and movies purchased from apples itunes online store the most popular legal downloading service by far however it cannot play copy protected music in microsofts formats even from windows computers it worked great with laptops and desktops alike with windows xp and the new windows vista operating system and with newer macs powered by intel processors and an older mac powered by an ibm built g processor apple tvs most important limitation is that it cant stream much video or audio directly from the internet yet the capability to go directly to the internet bypassing the computers in your home is built in but is initially being used only to fetch feature film trailers and short preview clips of popular songs tv shows and movies sold on the itunes store apple tv also wont allow you to buy media directly from the itunes store you must first download content from the internet or itunes on a computer and then apple tv will grab it from the computer and play it on the tv in its usual secretive fashion apple refuses to say if or when this direct to the internet capability will be expanded but we fully expect apple to add the capability to stream or download a variety of content directly from the internet and that this new capability will be available on current apple tv boxes through software updates in our tests apple tv is a pleasure to use setup was stunningly simple we just plugged the unit in and hooked it up to the tv with a single cable not included the unit found and connected with walts wi fi network almost instantly to link to each computer we just typed into itunes on that computer a five digit code number the apple tv put up on the tv screen this needs to be done only once you can select one computer to automatically synchronize with the apple tv any song tv episode movie or photo you download or otherwise add to that one computer is automatically replicated on the apple tvs internal hard disk for playback on your tv we tested this synchronization function with both a mac laptop and a windows vista desktop and it worked perfectly on both for instance we imported photos katie had taken on a recent trip to france to a mac laptop that was synchronized with the apple tv in short order all of the photos were on the apple tv and we watched them on the big plasma screen we also bought some tv shows movies and songs from itunes on our synchronized laptop and they were automatically transferred to apple tv where we could watch them it can however take hours to synchronize large files like movies over a slow wireless network in addition to your single synchronized computer you can designate up to five other computers as sources for your apple tv from these machines you "stream" the content over your wireless or wired network instead of actually transferring them but the music and video shows up on the tv just as if it had been synchronized to the apple tvs own hard disk all of these functions are controlled through itunes on your windows and mac computers just as you would control an ipod through itunes the latest version of itunes is required in our tests streaming worked just as well as playing content from the apple tvs own hard disk even though walts wi fi network is of the older "g" variety and the apple tv can handle newer faster "n" variety networks every single movie tv show and song streamed without interruption from both windows and mac computers that even included older or slower computers this was an impressive feat the only downside of streaming as compared to syncing is that you cant stream photos these can appear only through synchronization apple plans to enable photo streaming later on the tv screen apple tv presents a simple handsome list of content for each computer you choose to view media is divided into movies tv shows music podcasts and photos you can change among your various computers using a menu called sources there are some drawbacks to apple tv it wont work with most older tv sets the square kind that arent capable of handling widescreen programming and it works only with tvs that have the newer types of connectors such as "component" jacks and the new hdmi cables being used on most high definition tvs it works best with high definition tvs and it puts out video in high definition resolutions but it will also work with "enhanced definition" widescreen sets also the tiny simple apple remote control cant control the volume on either apple tv or your tv set or audio receiver so you have to keep reaching for the tv or audio receiver remote and you cant plug in an extra hard disk to add storage capacity even though theres a usb port on the back and the built in gigabyte drive is too small to hold many tv shows or movies but all in all apple tv is a very well designed product that easily brings the computer and the tv together mossbergsolution wsj com
