politics &amp economics bush congress clash over interviews president refuses to allow aides to speak under oath in feud over attorneys washington the white house and congress appeared headed for a wider confrontation as the administration said current and former administration officials including senior presidential aide karl rove could answer questions about the firings of eight u s attorneys but in private and not under oath in a letter to members of congress white house counsel fred f fielding presented a rare concession in the administrations claim of executive privilege but congressional democrats who have been pushing the administration to reveal more about its decision making in the ousters of the prosecutors balked at the restrictions they threatened to issue subpoenas perhaps as soon as today to try to compel public testimony under oath president bush responded in a televised news conference yesterday saying that he would oppose any subpoenas mr bush said he wanted to avoid a precedent that would hurt his ability to receive unfettered advice mr bush also gave forceful backing to his close friend attorney general alberto gonzales dismissing calls by members of both parties for mr gonzales to resign while acknowledging that the justice department has provided "confusing" and "incomplete" answers to questions raised about the dismissals of the u s attorneys mr bush said there was no proof that anyone at the white house did "anything improper" in initiating the ousters and he warned democrats not to "provoke an unnecessary confrontation" over their threat to issue subpoenas to white house staffers "i hope they dont choose confrontation " mr bush said the white house offered testimony from mr rove harriet miers former white house counsel and william kelley deputy counsel separately the white house said president bush telephoned mr gonzales yesterday to express confidence in the attorney general amid calls for his resignation yesterday the senate by a vote approved legislation that would strip the attorney general of the power to unilaterally appoint u s attorneys for indefinite terms the bill undoes a section of the patriot act approved last year and restores to the senate the power to approve the prosecutors who have been nominated sen patrick leahy the vermont democrat who heads the senate judiciary committee rejected the white house offer of testimony saying "it is not constructive and it is not helpful to be telling the senate how to do our investigation or to prejudge its outcome instead of freely and fully providing relevant documents to the investigating committees they have only selectively sent documents after erasing large portions that they do not want to see the light of day testimony should be on the record and under oath thats the formula for true accountability " in response to president bushs assertion that he was trying to preserve presidential power by not having aides testify under oath and in public democrats issued a list of presidential advisers who have testified under such conditions before congress including carter administration counsel lloyd culter and clinton white house advisers john podesta and harold ickes the latest developments unfolded as congressional committees pored over pages of internal documents released by the justice department late monday night the document turnover did little to quiet the tempest over the administrations ouster of the prosecutors earlier this year the controversy has been stoked by the justice departments piecemeal release of information and explanations that have been undercut by documents uncovered in the congressional investigation the latest documents released offer little new information on the white houses role in initiating the dismissals which has led to democrats accusations that the ousters were done for political reasons justice department officials have laid blame for the incomplete information with kyle sampson mr gonzaless chief of staff who has since resigned however the documents show that many more top officials including deputy attorney general paul j mcnulty were aware of the preparations sen charles schumer d n y has said mr sampson is being made a "fall guy" for the controversy other emails portray top officials in the department showing discomfort about some of the firings of u s attorneys and being unsure of the reasons the department was giving for the dismissals mr mcnulty in a dec email two days before the firings were to take place wrote to mr sampson "im still a little skittish about nevada u s attorney daniel bogden " mr mcnulty added that mr bogden had spent his career in government mr mcnulty wrote that he hadnt reviewed performance reports for mr bogdens district after the ousters were carried out mr gonzales raised concerns that mr mcnulty may have provided "inaccurate statements" when he testified to congress about the dismissals and was described by an aide in an email on feb to be "extremely upset" at media reports on mr mcnultys testimony justice department officials last night said that even though the new documents dont show it mr mcnulty later came on board with the departments decision to fire mr bogden the departments explanation for mr gonzaless discomfort with mr mcnultys testimony raised the prospect that bud cumminss dismissal as u s attorney in little rock ark was for "performance reasons " that directly contradicts testimony provided by mr mcnulty to the senate judiciary committee brian roehrkasse a justice department spokesman said mr mcnulty wasnt made aware of all details in the firings until late in the process "the deputy attorney general was only brought into this process in the fall while the list of u s attorneys was being finalized and he was unaware of the historical context and previous discussions about this matter " mr roehrkasse said mr cummins in an interview yesterday rejected the latest explanation of his dismissal saying the pages of documents produced by the administration still dont offer the performance related data that would support his firing mr cumminss successor was tim griffin who formerly worked for the republican national committee and is a former assistant to mr rove
