ceos and their millions proxy season is under way and as companies file their annual reports we can expect a spate of "analysis" stories purporting to tell us just how much americas top executives are making these stories will also purport to demonstrate that there is no pay for performance at the top of publicly traded companies by comparing stock appreciation with the pay as disclosed under a new sec rule these stories will be wrong this is so for the simple reason that the secs new standard is not designed to measure pay for performance last year the securities and exchange commission promulgated a rule on executive pay disclosure on balance it is an improvement in transparency but one complication is the way it measures the value of stock options as compensation the sec rule requires companies to set the value of options based on their "fair value" at the time of the grant that number is then disclosed as compensation as the options vest even though by then they could be worth a lot more or a lot less than their original "fair value " this will present big numbers for the media to chew on but it wont say much about pay for performance consider two hypothetical ceos in year zero ceo dow is given options on three million shares of stock even though hes done nothing more than agree to run your company the company has not backdated or otherwise monkeyed with the strike price so the options at current prices are worth zero dollars even though the company must record an expense and disclose some portion of the value of those options in its proxy ceo jones runs a similarly sized company in the same industry is hired on the same day in year zero and likewise receives three million shares worth of options under the same terms over the three year vesting period for their options both companies dutifully disclose that their ceos messrs dow and jones are "paid" the same amount but if the stock of mr dows company doubles in three years his stock options are worth a lot of money and if mr joness companys share price is cut in half his options are worth nada those two numbers "a lot of money" and "nada" are what matter to messrs dow and jones its not the accounting cost of the shares or some "total compensation" figure in an eight column chart buried in a page executive pay disclosure form filed with the sec that determines the size of mr dows mansion it is whether he can monetize the shares given to him as an incentive to boost the stock price ceo pay packages are more than just options of course theres a salary and cash bonus there may be deferred compensation and assorted perks some of those are performance based and some serve as a kind of retainer to keep the guy around and happy while his options vest and his deferred comp matures but to understand whether a ceo is being paid for performance you need to know not only what the board offered him last year but whether his actual total pay the amount in vested stock cash and bonuses that he could walk out the door with was well correlated with the companys performance in recent years the sec disclosures now being released dont tell you that but one compensation consulting firm has looked at the numbers and it has found that while the system isnt perfect it actually works better than is widely believed watson wyatt worldwide has been tracking trends in executive pay for years what it has found is that a ceos pay tracks a companys three year performance pretty closely thus a company that offered its ceo a pay package in the middle of its peer group and had middling performance over the next three years ended up putting an average amount of money in its ceos pocket companies that outperformed over those three years ended up with richer ceos than comparable companies that underperformed regardless of whether the pay package at the outset was low medium or high relative to its peers some companies do overpay and watson wyatts ira kay acknowledges that the lake wobegon syndrome is present in some board rooms few directors want an "average" ceo so they pay above the average for their group while overpaying may not be optimal for shareholders even "overpaid" ceos according to watson wyatts research do better when their companies do better which we thought was the idea the secs disclosure rule unfortunately does more to obscure these facts than to illuminate them take messrs dow and jones again suppose that in the previous three years mr dows company went nowhere while mr joness firm had beaten the market by is it right that they got the same "pay" this year as defined by the sec the question is easier to answer once you realize that going forward how much they are actually able to take home from that package still depends on their future performance which is as it should be none of this is to say that there are no badly designed pay packages and the new sec disclosure rules may help shareholders sort the good from the bad the danger is that the new information will be misused by reporters and politicians with a class war ax to grind so we thought wed point out in advance what the new rules show and what they dont
