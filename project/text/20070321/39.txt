deconstructing a new capital gains strategy structured sales aim to ease tax bite but returns are slim and benefits arent ensured eager to cash out of their real estate or businesses some property sellers are being drawn to a new strategy to help put off paying capital gains taxes the recent approach called a structured sale is being marketed more aggressively by some financial firms in the wake of the recent internal revenue service clampdown on another tax deferral strategy called a private annuity trust the irs and tax courts havent yet opined specifically on structured sales some tax lawyers believe the strategy is likely to pass muster if it is implemented carefully although theres always a risk the deals may be disallowed the irs declined to comment on the strategy a structured sale essentially allows individuals to sell an asset today and then receive over several years a stream of payments backed by an insurance company instead of paying the full tax bill at the time of sale a portion of the taxes is paid each year that funds are received the market for structured sales is still small but allstate corp which began offering structured sales in recent years says it expects the overall market to grow to about &# billion within five years from about &# million last year another big insurer prudential financial inc also offers structured sales a host of small financial firms around the country typically act as brokers to arrange the deals with individual consumers critics say the strategy doesnt make sense for many property sellers costs can add up the broker putting the deal together earns a commission which is usually and there are typically set up fees of between &# and &# plus legal and accounting fees whats more the sellers proceeds are essentially locked up in an annuity that currently pays about to which is net of the commission "deferring the tax is great but if your proceeds are stuck in a low rate of return annuity then you are not doing yourself much good " says atlanta tax lawyer kevin mcgrath who has examined the transactions with federal capital gains rates at historic lows of some advisers say it may be a better deal for some sellers to just pay taxes upfront and invest the money in vehicles that can yield higher returns also if capital gains rates were to rise deferring the tax means you may end up paying higher rates in the future but proponents say structured sales make sense especially for older sellers willing to take lower returns in exchange for a guaranteed stream of income or for people living in states with high capital gains tax rates also some individuals may have difficulty investing the proceeds of a large sale all at once in that case it also could make sense to put off the tax hit on the asset sale jean schwalbe of newport beach calif several months ago did a structured sale on a rental property that she sold for roughly &# million ms schwalbe will receive payments over years at an interest rate of around according to the terms of the deal which was set up by capstone bay llc a denver firm that arranges structured sales she will pay capital gains taxes gradually as the installment payments arrive "it was one way to ease the payment of the taxes " says ms schwalbe who is years old "uncle sam will still be getting some of my money but it will be in smaller doses " structured sales are a new twist on the long used tactic of installment sales in which a buyer of a business or real estate agrees to make payments to a seller over a period of years sellers pay taxes only when they receive each installment but if a buyer defaults the seller can be left in the lurch enter a large insurance company such as allstate or prudential which effectively backs the installment payments in a structured sale the deals can be detailed and typically involve offshore affiliates of the insurers in barbados where the companies benefit from more favorable tax treatment in a structured sale a buyer and seller agree to a series of installment payments but the buyer instead of making the installment payments himself transfers his payment obligation to an affiliate of the insurance firm known as an assignment company the assignment company then uses the buyers cash to buy an annuity from the insurer naming the seller as recipient to cover the installment payments to the seller the strategy is usually employed for sales less than &# million because federal tax rules impose an interest charge for installment sales above that amount per individual allstate says that on average most of its structured sales have been under &# million often sellers will do a structured sale for a portion of the sale and take upfront cash for the rest sellers pay federal and state capital gains taxes on a portion of the payments as they receive them and pay ordinary income taxes which are taxed at a higher rate on the interest tom swegle of salt lake city recently did a structured transaction on the income from a tenants lease termination fee lesti structured settlements inc los altos calif helped structure the deal so that mr swegle received the income over a year period deferring the tax liability at first mr swegle was wary of the untested nature of the transaction "im a little old homeowner and doing a deal where im having money coming through an unknown company out of barbados was pretty adventuresome " says mr swegle years old "we were pretty nervous and pretty conservative about all this " he says adding that he felt more comfortable after researching the transaction with his legal and tax counsel the deals are typically marketed through small financial firms mark wahlstrom owner of wahlstrom &amp associates in scottsdale ariz says he currently gets three to four inquiries a week about the deals including from real estate agents and financial professionals calling on behalf of clients and from consumers directly cliff brown president of capstone bay the denver structured sales firm says that he has deals worth about &# million in the pipeline up from just &# million a year ago one reason for the growing interest the irs this fall issued proposed regulations that effectively ended another popular tax deferral strategy called a private annuity trust in which sellers exchange real estate or other property for an annuity issued by a trust the irss proposed regulations essentially ended the capital gains tax deferral for these deals the irss move caught many private annuity trust promoters by surprise and some in turn have now turned to marketing structured sales or variations of the transactions matt brown a tax lawyer in irvine calif says his biggest concern about structured sales is not whether the irs will clamp down on the practice but whether it makes economic sense for a particular individual "id be perfectly comfortable recommending this structure to a client " he says some critics argue that some less than scrupulous promoters are pushing the strategy to earn insurance commissions and might not be so careful about the tax formalities "an industry has been created to help people avoid capital gains and that industry largely profits by selling insurance or annuities and earning commission " says lawyer and financial adviser jay adkisson who founded the web site quatloos com which provides information about various tax shelters among the various complexities a seller in a structured sale arrangement cant be the owner of the annuity the seller also isnt allowed to touch the buyers money before receiving the installment payments or this could trigger a tax hit another risk once you enter the transaction the annuity payments generally cant be accelerated without collapsing the deal "if you dont have the right people doing it you can certainly foul it up " says san francisco tax lawyer robert w wood who has written several articles for tax journals about structured sales its important to run the numbers with an independent financial adviser to see if a structured sale makes sense depending on your income needs age and tax situation also make sure to get independent tax counsel since the strategy is still untested from a tax perspective and theres always a risk it could be disallowed other promoters are peddling alternative tax deferral tactics often involving trusts partnerships annuities or charitable entities strung together in convoluted ways if youre approached by a tactic that seems dodgy be wary and make sure to get independent tax and financial counsel before jumping in or else you may be socked with taxes and penalties bigger than those youre trying to defer if youre more comfortable with tried and true tax deferral strategies tax advisers recommend charitable remainder trusts which generate income tax deductions as well as capital gains and estate tax savings there are also exchanges in which property owners exchange one property for a similar one but thats less attractive for individuals who want to exit commercial or investment real estate putting off paying a new tax deferral strategy works by spreading over several years the proceeds from selling an asset the strategy can be useful for older people wanting a guaranteed income stream the irs hasnt opined on the approach so theres a risk it could be disallowed low capital gains rates might make it better to pay the tax upfront
