maguires poor timing may lead to subprime trouble buildings recently bought from eop contain batch of lenders in shaky sector investors in maguire properties inc are hoping st patricks day brought this real estate investment trust some irish gold because over the past few weeks all they have seen is bad luck late last year maguire put itself on the auction block hoping to take advantage of the high prices that private equity firms were paying for reits but even as other reits sold at a feverish pace maguire couldnt find any takers at its price in february it conceded as much saying it was better off "continuing to run the company publicly " now more bad news on feb maguire said it would pay &# billion to buy buildings that blackstone group acquired in its recent deal for equity office properties trust the buildings were in maguires backyard of southern california one of the countrys strongest office markets but it turns out about of the tenants in the eop orange county properties are subprime mortgage lenders an industry that has nose dived in the past few weeks maguires stock price has taken a tumble as well down since feb compared with a drop for the reit sector "it almost points to unbelievably poor timing in buying the eop portfolio " says michael knott senior analyst with green street advisors an independent trading and research firm based in newport beach calif even without eop maguire would be wrestling with the subprime lending fallout orange county based new century financial corp a reit that was the second largest lender to subprime mortgage borrowers leases about square feet in two maguire buildings at park place in irvine and is scheduled to be lead tenant in a story building maguire is developing at michelson also in irvine new century can get out of its leases only if it files for bankruptcy protection maguires chief executive officer robert maguire iii was unavailable for comment but in public statements he presented the leases with subprime lenders as a potential opportunity if these tenants cancel their leases maguire can sign up new ones at higher rents for example rents now are higher than the &# per square foot new century is paying for the top floors of michelson the company says real estate experts agree that southern california will perform well over the long term but they worry that the market could go through a short term shakeout particularly in orange county if many mortgage companies return sublease space to the market maguires story looked very different just four months ago at a time of fevered merger activity maguire directors believed it was prudent to pursue "strategic alternatives" meaning a sale of the company on paper the los angeles reit seemed a delectable morsel for a real estate hungry private equity firm after all maguire held a string of california buildings many of them trophy properties and development sites for more but maguire proved that even at a time when many reits are being taken private at a premium a company can be too pricey bids were likely in the low &# s per share but mr maguire is believed to have wanted at least &# "the purported prices were not what they should be " mr maguire said in a recent conference call then to show the market it was serious about its renewed focus as a public company maguire announced excitedly that it would buy eops buildings in orange county and downtown los angeles "the blackstone acquisition gave us an incredible unique opportunity and a rare chance to quickly and efficiently extend our asset base and grow our revenues " mr maguire said at the time the company said it would look for a joint venture partner for the transaction but analysts questioned whether maguire was paying too high a price and whether it should take on more debt when its debt ratio at was already higher than the industry average they also criticized the &# million break up fee maguire must pay blackstone if it is unable to close the deal then came the news ferreted out by merrill lynch analyst ian weissman late last week that subprime lenders make up about of the tenants in the eop orange county buildings making matters worse maguire is attempting to sell properties in glendale san diego and orange county including of the soon to be acquired eop assets in orange county mr weissman estimated that of the space in the eop buildings in orange county that maguire wants to sell is rented to subprime lenders that raises questions as to whether maguire will be able to get its &# billion price already some potential investors are striking the properties from their wish lists unsure about the leasing atmosphere especially given the eight buildings under construction in orange county included in that group is kbs realty advisors a private equity real estate company in newport beach calif "we are very sensitive about the specific tenants and occupancy in the orange county market " said charles schreiber jr kbs chief executive yet william halford chief executive of bixby land co a family owned reit said his company is interested in some of the orange county properties with so much capital flowing into california commercial real estate he predicts maguire will find buyers for all buildings "will they get their price " he says "i dont know but you may be surprised "
