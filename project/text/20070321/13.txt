thursday judge joseph tauro of federal court in boston cited the indictment as one reason for ruling that milberg shouldnt serve as sole lead counsel in the organogenesis inc securities fraud litigation "a court concerned with insuring competent representation for an absent class must worry about the possibility of distraction as the firm and its partners struggle to defeat the criminal charges " he wrote in the medtronic inc product liability litigation judge james rosenbaum last year disqualified milberg from a plaintiffs steering committee noting "a grand jurys indictment means that it found probable cause to believe a criminal act has taken place " other judges have maintained that the indictment of the firm is a nonfactor in the merck &amp co securities litigation in federal court in new jersey judge stanley chesler earlier this year retained milberg as co lead counsel in the case noting that viewing the indictment as anything other than an accusation would "be a

microsoft in other states "we dont double bill " said richard hagstrom a lead plaintiffs counsel in an interview "ive looked at our time records and i cant figure out what they are talking about " in contingent fee cases like the one in wisconsin mr hagstrom says plaintiffs lawyers deserve a premium above normal hourly rates for assuming the risk that they will lose a case and recover nothing "people forget about unsuccessful contingent fee cases " microsoft he added is "seeking to punish counsel that has cost them a lot of money by increasing the settlement value to wisconsin class
