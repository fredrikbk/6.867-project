getting new start selling ad packages across platforms questions for jean rossi company news corp title president fox one executive vice president sales fox broadcasting co both are units of news corp news corp is making a new entry into the difficult and complex world of so called cross media ad sales the media conglomerate led by chairman rupert murdoch is creating a unit devoted to helping advertisers craft marketing plans that can reach customers across the companys many properties which range from tv guide to fox and fx to movies and myspace known as fox one the unit is headed by jean rossi who is also executive vice president of fox broadcasting co ms rossi has been spearheading multimedia ad plans based at the fox network for some time and the announcement of the new operation formalizes and broadens her role similar "cross media" ad sales efforts have been made by several other big media companies in recent years including time warner inc and viacom inc not always with great success even news corp has tried before media buyers say that too often media companies tried to offload large amounts of ad inventory through these cross media deals rather than customize programs for particular products below ms rossi discusses how selling cross media ad packages has begun to change and addresses past skepticism about these efforts the wall street journal rivals such as viacom and time warner have over the years had cross media sales operations so why is news corp only now putting one into place ms rossi the frank answer is that weve always had some form of cross divisional opportunity but we are just going to make it easier a more collaborative effort and less of the traditional force feeding if you will im not saying you have to buy these different pieces at the same time i think clients understand that we are not doing it for any kind of mass discount or volume basically we have all these properties that fit together and that will enable our unit to really drill down to create a targeted and customized program for our customers the other goal of this group is to have one point for contact in the past year or two that hasnt been the case advertisers would have to deal with separate divisions its taking the content that we have and threading it across various platforms whether its broadcast cable telephony and the internet if someone is a "prison break" or "" fan they will be able to find that content across the various media venues and clients will be associated with that wsj one long held concern by media buyers who make cross media pacts is that the media company often views these agreements as a way to sell less desirable ad time and space alongside more valuable inventory why shouldnt clients be concerned theyre getting inventory you might want to offload ms rossi we are actually doing the exact opposite we are customizing marketing campaigns distinctly tailored to an individual client and their needs i mentioned earlier that we wont force clients into a certain space if they dont want to go online we wont take them there fox one is not about cramming platforms down a clients throat a recent deal that aligned toyota with "prison break" involved everything from customized call to action promotions on the network to product integration in the show we did everything from myspace to video on demand we did "mobisodes " they were also at all our publicity events we did local radio network radio national print anywhere we connected with "prison break " toyota was there we are putting advertisers where the show is and definitely they are supporting us but we are not putting remnant inventory into these deals we really sit down with the client listen to what their marketing goals are and then we go and try to develop a media and marketing plan that fits into that wsj there has been an awful lot of skepticism about the success of cross media packages what do you think has changed that will make people see more value in these types of pacts ms rossi clients are actively seeking out demanding these kinds of opportunities and that is a big driver of our business research has shown that traditional media messaging is strengthened when the message is taken across emerging media platforms probably the best example quite frankly would be "american idol " where we have been able to take those clients the three main clients ford cingular and coca cola we have been able to align them with "american idol" across whatever new platform emerges and they continue to want to associate with that i think there is a real understanding that advertisers really need to engage with customers and have an opportunity to enhance that by engaging with content that is really cool in our case everything from "" and "family guy" to "the simpsons " wsj lets say an advertiser wants to come in and support just two shows on the fox network for a few months but then wants to build that out with digital extensions and a movie tie in would you work with them or demand a stronger commitment to the network before moving forward ms rossi if a client came to us and didnt want to do anything at all on the broadcast level that would be fine we will look to the many news corp properties to create and execute a campaign and work and collaborate with the client to find the best solution in fact we want to push it away from being network centric this is really about news corp content and pushing it through we would welcome a deal like that of course it needs to have a price of entry
