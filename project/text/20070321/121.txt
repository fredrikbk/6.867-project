where young artisans get a strong foundation in beauty saint remy les chevreuse france when the palace at versailles wanted the sumptuous bronze and gold filigree balcony of the kings chamber restored where did it go not far as it happens only miles or so to the south the fondation de coubertin spreads over an estate covering acres in saint remy les chevreuse miles southwest of paris virtually hidden in the estates secluded woods behind the sculpture studded gardens and year old chateau are massive workshops and an art foundry here odd of europes finest artisans including young fellows on full scholarship are working in metal stone and wood or casting sculpture in bronze and steel for world class artists living and dead including the spanish architect and sculptor santiago calatrava the hungarian sculptor marta pan and the late auguste rodin strewn about are huge slabs of marble limestone and other raw materials for the stone carvers bronze ingots stacked against the foundry warehouses filled with rare woods for the furniture makers and statues awaiting pickup headed to museums and outdoor sites ranging from pariss left bank to tokyo in the foundry glowing vats bubble with molten bronze being prepared to cast grillwork destined for a chapel in upstate new york and a table in bronze for mr calatravas own collection resting against a wall is the mold for rodins monumental "gates of hell " which the foundry cast for among others stanford universitys rodin sculpture garden hard by you find suspended for restoration the pound equestrian statue of louis xiv originally cast in that has been the centerpiece of versailles main court of honor the master craftsmen who work here have executed and restored pieces for the elysee palace mont saint michel the rodin museum the musee dorsay the banque rothschild tiffany &amp co louis vuitton and loreal they restored the bronze cap on the obelisk of luxor in pariss place de la concorde the australian john kellys "cow up a tree" was executed here and exhibited a few years ago on the champs elysees on exhibit in the center of paris are bronze statues that they cast of winston churchill charles de gaulle and thomas jefferson by the sculptor jean cardot the foundation has restored calatrava sculpture for king juan carlos of spain but ask even the most sophisticated parisians what this place is all about and they will likely appear nonplused at best they might suggest that it has something to do with pierre de coubertin founder of the modern olympics right family wrong ancestor the foundation is the creation of his niece yvonne de coubertin who inherited the estate and established the foundation in with the sculptor joseph bernards son jean bernard besides its setting on the grounds of a magnificent estate what distinguishes the foundation from just a bunch of workshops is the fellowship program for young artisans mostly french but including other europeans and the occasional american they have previously apprenticed in one or another of these crafts and most of them are likely to be admitted soon to the compagnon du devoir the guild that emerged in the th century when the great cathedrals of europe were under construction coubertin and bernard were driven to create a haven where promising young craftsmen could spend a year working alongside masters but could also gain some education that would otherwise be unattainable because these novices typically leave school at age to begin their technical training during their year at coubertin they work on the foundations commissions and their own chef doeuvre a sort of doctoral dissertation that they must submit for admission to the guild but they also get courses in english psychology computer assisted design math accounting and salesmanship as well as regular lectures from visiting scholars and artists covering a range of subjects from guy de maupassant to the life of bees nowhere else in the world can such craftsmen find a similar experience the fellows their instructors and the foundations principal staff live pretty well in the renovated outbuildings of the estate and for the most part they stick close to the grounds though its a short walk from the last stop on the rer which could get them into the heart of paris in less than an hour they are rarely tempted only a handful of women artisans have attended thus far and their quarters are upstairs in the chateau itself recently the foundation was granted its most spectacular commission from versailles the re creation of the once celebrated grille royale or royal railing a foot high gilded fence destroyed in the french revolution that in louis xivs day stretched from wing to wing of the estate barring access to the inner courtyards and the kings and queens apartments the re creation will require tons of iron and ornamental pieces in hammered gold leaf and bronze the coubertin workshops regularly create modern work as well the cabinetmakers turned out all the woodworking and high tech furniture for a french tv networks boardroom and a mahogany veneer staircase with glass steps for a paris home the foundry produces stainless steel sculptures for the avant garde artist marta pan some of her work remains on exhibit at the estate unlike the u s france does not embrace the concept of generous tax breaks for not for profit institutions so the foundation supports itself barely on revenues from its commissions currently metalworking brings in the most revenue but "we need more work for the wood and stone workshops " reports gilles de navacelle the foundations president mr de navacelle a coubertin descendant and retired french businessman has established saint jacques artisans workshops inc in the u s as a subsidiary of the foundation during my visit a team of milwaukee architects and interior designers arrived to check progress on elaborate wood and metal furniture chandeliers and railings they commissioned for a milwaukee hedge fund mogul mr de navacelle hopes that this subsidiary will encourage more u s architects and designers to work with the foundations artisans "we would also be open to assisting u s based programs in training in our crafts " he adds his craftsmen in france arent into reproducing off the shelf products according to jean louis gimalac the head of the woodworking atelier they relish the restoration work because "it helps us preserve certain skills that might otherwise be lost " and then he continues "we can apply those skills to new commissions " other than for special occasions including annual exhibitions in its sculpture garden the estate is not open to the public but if youre about to years old and a french speaker of any nationality you can apply for a fellowship in any of the foundations crafts the web site is www fondation coubertin asso fr mr henning writes about arts and culture for the journal
