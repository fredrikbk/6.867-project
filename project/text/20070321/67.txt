modern blasphemy paris a french court is tomorrow expected to decide whether i and the newspaper i edit charlie hebdo committed a crime by publishing cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed if the court finds me guilty of "publicly abusing a group of people because of their religion " in effect racism as the organizations of french muslims that are plaintiffs in this case claim i could be imprisoned for six months and fined thousands of euros a great deal is at stake for free speech in france and europe in the outcome of this trial a little background is necessary as you may recall the original "danish cartoons" were published in september in denmarks jyllands posten without provoking any great interest but later that year danish fundamentalist imams went on a middle east tour to denounce what they claimed was anti muslim racism in denmark to support their argument they brought with them not only the cartoons published in jyllands posten but others with clear racist overtones which ended up sparking all the trouble the whole story was started by a kind of manipulation of public opinion in countries like egypt yemen and sudan where official illiteracy is as high as turmoil broke out in the middle east huge protests were held in syria and iran organized mostly by the police since any protest unauthorized by the government is forbidden in those dictatorships the danish embassy in lebanon was burned down which is an act of war danish companies were attacked in many muslim countries without this unduly disturbing the other member countries of the european union quite the contrary many people said that jyllands posten was a xenophobic paper which is untrue and that denmark was a racist country which is equally untrue during the last war when the nazis asked the danish to hand over the jews the danes were the only ones in europe along with bulgarians to refuse in february of last year the director of the daily france soir jacques lefranc decided to publish the cartoons in france he was immediately fired it was in protest against mr lefrancs firing that i in turn decided to publish the cartoons in charlie hebdo our front page headline was "mohammed overwhelmed by extremists " and had a drawing by cabu of the prophet covering his eyes with his hands and crying "its hard to be loved by idiots " i invited my colleagues from the daily and weekly press to republish the danish cartoons too most of them published some of them only lexpress did in full before publication i was pressured not to go ahead and summoned to the hotel matignon to see the prime ministers chief of staff i refused to go the next day summary proceedings were initiated by the grand mosque of paris and the union of islamic organizations of france to stop this issue of charlie hebdo from hitting newsstands the government encouraged them but their suit was dismissed after the cartoons appeared the muslim groups attacked me by filing suit against me on racism charges president jacques chirac who campaigned for this just completed trial offered them the services of his own personal lawyer francis szpiner dalil boubakeur the rector of the grand mosque who always took orders from the elysee was apparently not convinced this case was necessary he told me as much several times but mr boubakeur was under pressure from the fundamentalists at the uoif union of islamic organizations of france who had come to dominate the french council of muslim worship which he heads and mr chirac why only he knows we can only guess probably to nurture his friendships in the middle east and win arms contracts for france while at home playing to muslim public opinion thats supposedly in thrall to fundamentalism with so much on the line in this case the outcome of which i still do not know as i write politicians across the french spectrum have come out in support on the right the presidential candidates francois bayrou and nicolas sarkozy and on the left the first secretary of the socialist party francois hollande have come to charlie hebdos defense i had not asked them to a number of jewish christian and muslim intellectuals stood in the witness box to defend us and through us to defend the exercise of freedom of speech in a law abiding state these cartoons criticized not believers but religion when it is used as an alibi to perpetrate terrorist acts when religion leaves the private sphere it becomes an ideology like any other and must accept to be criticized with the same virulence as any other ideology that is the very essence of democracy since it is hardly thinkable that the french parliament could be persuaded to re establish the crime of blasphemy the plaintiffs chose the legal path to try to obtain a ruling condemning all criticism of religion but in order to survive democracy needs to confront dogmas we saw this happening when rights for women and homosexuals were established we see it again today in defending genetic research on stem cells for instance this trial is important for all the forms of expression that should flourish in democracy painting cinema literature journalism scientific research and even the free speech exercised in everyday life the limits to this freedom are already fixed by laws that protect life and that penalize racism insults and defamation in publishing the danish cartoons no one broke any of them mr val is publisher and editor of charlie hebdo a satirical weekly in paris charlotte mandell translated this article from the french
