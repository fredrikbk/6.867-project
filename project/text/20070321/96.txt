some traditional sites aiming to be hip end up the opposite for the john edwards presidential campaign last week was as usual busy there was a college rally on tuesday speeches to firefighters and boilermakers on wednesday a swing through new hampshire on thursday and then a three city tour on friday we know all this not from news accounts but from mr edwards himself via his postings on twitter com twitter allows users to make in effect one sentence blog postings that describe what they are doing at any given moment in recent weeks twitter has been praised by a small but influential group of tech bloggers who helped the site go from zero to loud buzz in hours attracted to twitter by all the attention the edwards campaign is among those going along for the ride there are more sites like twitter these days new web ideas and aspiring trends talked up by a chorus of tech bloggers and commentators many of whom also make a living off them but this crowd doesnt always have a good record in predicting what the real world will take to as some recent web history suggests one of the latest success stories among tech oriented web users is digg a news site that brags how readers not editors pick the stories digg readers send in items and then vote on their favorites with the most popular stories then given prominent display tech bloggers typically genuflect before digg regarding it as a founder of a new kind of democratic journalism as with any democracy diggers get what they deserve recent top stories have included a cnn report about a girl who found the severed head of her missing pet dog on her front porch an interactive graphic featuring three women in halter tops at a car wash and a posting about unusual urinals some apparently thought diggs appeal could be imported executives at netscape com the home page for the once popular browser last summer redesigned their site to make it digg like netscape com had been a "traditional" web portal displaying news and feature stories selected by editors now netscape readers were going to be submitting and voting on stories themselves but netscape customers apparently were happy to let editors do those chores for them when they voted it was with their feet since september when netscape made other changes that affected readership traffic at netscape com has dropped reports hitwise a netscape spokesman said the site undertook a "dramatic transformation with the understanding that our traffic would be impacted over time we think traffic will grow " a similar experiment is under way at the web site for usa today last month it unveiled a redesign that incorporated many of the social networking ideas shared among blogosphere fans of what is called web the site would still be devoted to news written by usa todays journalists but users could comment on stories vote for them just like at digg and set up profile pages to meet others in the community of readers usa today said the revamped site represented "the next generation of network journalism " the change was big news in the tech blogosphere which erupted in applause "bravo " said one "hopefully other mainstream online news sites will follow this lead " said another the reaction however was quite different among usa today readers at least those who posted comments on the site there were more than and they were almost uniformly negative most simply didnt like the fact that familiar items had been moved someplace else which is a common complaint with any kind of redesign but many were unhappy with the sites new social networking emphasis "social media may be the next big thing but if i wanted to get my news from myspace i would " said one reader "who really cares what rooster or mongo thinks of the worlds events " asked another executives at the paper say they arent alarmed in contrast to netscape com traffic at usa today com since the change is "stable to trending upwards " said kinsey wilson executive editor he also noted that the comments were from million readers in redesigning the site mr wilson said editors "tried to be careful not to chase the latest fad " while adding social networking style features editors realized many readers wouldnt be interested in them and worked to make the site useful to those expecting a more traditional experience adjustments will continue "we are in the phase " he said if some users of web sites like netscape and usa today dont care for some of the newfangled ideas it might be because their demographics skew toward the somethings and somethings who are dazed and confused by the emerging web world its also possible that the corner of the tech world that shills for each web fad de jour is an echo chamber of folks more captivated by technology than the rest of the world the edwards campaign and anyone else trying to make sense of the evolving internet might thus want to tread carefully the web trend you hop on early may be the next big thing or you may wake up one day to find yourself wearing the internet equivalent of bell bottoms and paisley shirts email me at lee gomes wsj com
