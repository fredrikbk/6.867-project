icahn gets his way at blockbuster as chief antioco calls it quits next ceo faces pressure to move more aggressively into the online world carl icahn now has a chance to run blockbuster inc his way blockbusters longtime chief executive john antioco resigned abruptly yesterday throwing in the towel after two years of acrimonious battles over compensation and strategy with mr icahn the billionaire financier the companys biggest shareholder who won a proxy battle for board representation in says he would like a new ceo to move blockbuster more aggressively into the online world mr antioco years old who had overseen blockbusters revival in the late s only to see its business decline sharply more recently said he would leave by the end of the year but the news appeared to unnerve wall street and blockbuster shares fell despite mr icahns complaints that mr antioco hadnt moved fast enough into the digital sector it is unclear precisely what a new ceo would do differently the biggest issue facing blockbuster is the steady decline of video rentals as consumers flock to alternatives ranging from netflix inc s online mail order dvd service to video on demand services on cable and movie downloading on the internet in recent months dallas based blockbuster has achieved some success with its own version of the online mail order dvd business pioneered by netflix mr antioco had also been taking steps to expand into movie downloading and was recently in advanced talks to buy movielink the movie download service owned by major hollywood studios for &# million after looking at movielinks books blockbusters board is backing away and a deal is unlikely according to people familiar with the matter the boards reticence about the deal wasnt decisive but contributed to mr antiocos decision to leave these people said the main impetus for mr antiocos departure wasnt a strategic difference though but the recent dispute with the board over his bonus last month in a move almost unheard of in corporate america the board balked at paying mr antioco the &# million bonus he said he was due the board instead offered a &# million bonus on top of his regular compensation of &# million mr icahn who has railed for years about what he considers overly generous pay packages for senior executives campaigned strenuously against mr antiocos contract during the proxy battle last year mr antioco wasnt eligible for a bonus because blockbuster lost money in but the company performed better in reviving the question after several weeks of negotiations the board agreed to raise mr antiocos bonus slightly to &# million despite the resolution mr antioco decided it was time to leave he will receive a &# million payment when his employment ends well below the &# million he was due under his contract were he "terminated without cause or resigned for good reason " mr icahn characterized mr antiocos contract as an "albatross around the companys neck" and his departure as "a victory for good corporate governance " mr icahn added that mr antioco "is a pleasant guy and i like him " but "contracts like this are one of the things wrong with corporate america because huge severance payments undermine accountability " indeed mr icahn endorsed mr antiocos reappointment as chairman after the proxy battle at least partly because the investor didnt want to have to pay mr antiocos severance if he left the financier who holds about of blockbusters shares has seen the value of his investment wither since mounting the proxy battle to oust the board in but he said he thinks blockbuster "has great potential " despite its many challenges mr antioco who was hired to run blockbuster a decade ago by hollywood mogul sumner redstone over a long lunch at the beverly hills hotel is credited with putting the movie rental company back on its feet but mr redstones viacom inc which then owned blockbuster was reluctant to make big acquisitions or fund its expansion into the online sphere still mr antioco who had come out of the retail industry tried a number of different ventures in search of a new growth business including variously selling electronics and satellite tv dishes and trading videogames none made much of an impact shortly after the company was spun out of viacom in a slow decline in the video rental market suddenly got much worse hurting blockbusters bottom line in response mr antioco has closed stores and cut back on marketing spending but he also has invested heavily in the last couple of years in building an online business to match netflix the ceo had initially been skeptical of consumer demand for the mail order concept but after netflix signed up millions of customers mr antioco changed course mr icahn criticized mr antiocos slowness to act and while blockbusters service which allows customers to return mail delivered movies to their local store has proved popular it still has fewer than half the number of customers netflix has the board is expected to look outside blockbuster for mr antiocos successor the process could take several months one possible internal candidate is nicholas p shepherd executive vice president of world wide stores though he may not fit mr icahns wish for someone more versed in the digital world joann s lublin contributed to this article
