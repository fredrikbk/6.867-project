they planted hope in times of war for most of us the notion of gardening under difficult circumstances conjures up frost in may an unexpected hurricane or an incursion of hungry deer relentlessly pillaging a bed of perennials not so for kenneth helphand a professor of landscape architecture at the university of oregon the chance flea market purchase of a stereopticon depicting a scene of shelters in the french trenches flanked by gardens started him off on an astonishing search to find and document gardens created in times of war his research has uncovered gardens made by soldiers in the trenches on both sides of the western front during world war i jews imprisoned by nazis in the ghettos during world war ii british soldiers in german pow camps during both world wars japanese americans held at internment camps in the u s during world war ii residents of sarajevo between and and even small plots dug in the desert today by soldiers in iraq i met prof helphand when he was recently in manhattan to give a lecture sponsored by wave hill about what he calls "the landscape" of war in our day his digging into this previously unexamined subject has led him on a fascinating trail from the imperial war museum in london to the world war i battlefields of ypres and verdun from the holocaust museum in washington to the former jewish ghettos of warsaw and lodz poland and from the japanese american national museum in los angeles to what remains of the internment camp at manzanar in california in the course of his research which relies primarily on first person accounts diaries memoirs and testimonies he has come into contact with an astonishing range of people among them roman kent who described the backbreaking work of removing stones in order to make a garden in the lodz ghetto a place where there were no gardening tools and where a watering can was "almost a luxury item " and esther mishkin the only member of her family to escape from the destruction of the kovno ghetto in lithuania in ms mishkin remembered that watching his garden grow in the ghetto gave her father a feeling that because something was growing he and his family could somehow survive this idea that a garden symbolizes survival even under the most extreme conditions is what most interests prof helphand and the photographs drawings and archival material he has collected tell an astonishing story of endurance courage and what might even be called an obdurate refusal to give in to the horror of the hell so close at hand yes it can be argued that many of these gardens were created primarily to supplement subsistence rations but what the evidence also shows is that many were intricate and fanciful creations containing as many flowers as vegetables again and again they reveal the transformative power of a garden to provide not a refuge but certainly a respite from the incongruity and horror of the outside world from a meticulously laid out kitchen garden constructed in a bomb crater on the grounds of westminster cathedral in the heart of london to a neat cottage garden planted around a makeshift tent in a russian camp for refugees from chechnya in these gardens take ones breath away one of the most astonishing has to be that of the huge ruhleben pow camp in germany which housed more than british soldiers here in prisoners organized their own horticultural society collected dues and even became affiliated with the royal horticultural society they cleared a plot of square yards constructed cold frames grew perennials and were later allowed by their captors to use the land inside a disused oval racetrack as a vegetable garden elaborate planting schemes were drawn to scale and the prisoners even organized flower shows and lectures gardens also had less benign uses during world war ii at the pow camp at marlag near bremen germany prisoners digging three escape tunnels were able to dispose of the displaced soil unobtrusively by sprinkling it over garden paths and filling up a homemade compost site how and why one in time of war and imprisonment would create a garden that had little or no chance of long term survival is a fascinating question however i suspect that those of us who garden instinctively know its answer stationed near tikrit in sgt carol quam jr of the st engineer combat battalion decided to plant a garden and turned for help to iraqi gardeners for what to grow in degree weather "that garden was a real release " he later recounted "for a little while you could put your mind off what was going on around you " in his autobiography nelson mandela speaks of a garden he nurtured during his own years of captivity and is quite explicit about its meaning for him "a garden was one of the few things in prison one could control to plant a seed watch it grow to tend and then harvest it offered a simple but enduring satisfaction the sense of being the custodian of this small patch of earth offered a small taste of freedom " in trenches ghettos and camps these "defiant gardens" the title of prof helphands unforgettable book on the subject recently published by trinity press were an attempt to create a kind of peace in the midst of madness and order in the prevailing chaos when europe was in the tightening grip of rising fascism there was a saying among the members of ciam the international collaborative group of modernist architects "how can one think about roses when the forests are burning " the answer of course was itself a question "how can you not plant roses when the forests are burning " ms garmey writes on gardening for the journal
