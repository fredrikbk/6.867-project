the daily fix ole miss uses tough defense to oust terps from tourney online edition want defense how about steals and points off turnovers thats what seed mississippi did to seed maryland in the ncaa womens tournament last night ousting the defending champion terrapins if those defensive numbers give you an image of a turtle on its back feebly kicking its legs youre on the right track the rebels victory continued the bloodbath near the top of the womens ranks as discussed in yesterdays fix yes the seeds connecticut tennessee unc and duke are alive and well but maryland joins seed vanderbilt sent home by seed bowling green and seed stanford ousted by seed florida state among those heaved into the hereafter the lone survivor of the terror of the its purdue which beat seed georgia tech "on the jumbo screen high above a sparsely populated hartford civic center they showed highlights at halftime of better times for maryland " writes richard deitsch on si com "as the film of last years national championship rolled to a close the crowd watched dukes jessica foley miss a desperation pointer from long range in overtime it marked the beginning of the party in college park the end came hard tuesday night in hartford " the heroine for ole miss mr deitsch says its "senior guard armintie price who will make a wnba team very happy after shes selected in the first round this month an athletic foot guard with ridiculous athletic ability according to coach carol ross price hit her first six shots and finished with points seven rebounds five assists and three steals she hit of from the field and was for from the line dont worry if you havent heard of her you will soon enough " texas was eliminated from the ncaa mens tournament last week eliciting groans of frustrations from office bracketeers world wide and leaving hoops fans wondering what the longhorns early exit means for the career plans of kevin durant the freshman star whose next stop could be the nba draft in the washington post sally jenkins looks at mr durants dilemma "should he make himself available despite the fact that hes just and probably pounds too light or stay in school for some reason the stakes seem higher for durant than for other players who will be making the same decision maybe thats because he has the potential to be a three octave performer if he continues to develop so beautifully or maybe its because hes plainly so young for his age and college so clearly suits him " ms jenkins clearly admires mr durant from the way he plays to the way he conducts himself but she isnt sure what the right answer is for him "the choice is not simple if he stays he risks injury and could forfeit millions " she writes "if he goes he forfeits time whats the best way for him to become a finished player thats the real question the finish is what counts there are millions of aspirants in the world who start things and dont finish them much less properly whether novels carpentry projects or to do lists anything of real quality requires finish what brought durant this far was a certain order and thoroughness he is all about working in an organized way toward an end everything the family has done to date suggests that they see this as a slow steady step by step process one that has stressed fundamentals over shortcuts they may decide that durant wont be improved by haste now " in the st louis post dispach bryan burwell also wonders about mr durants choice and whether ohio states greg oden still playing unlike mr durant will opt for the nba or more schooling the two "will be instant pro basketball millionaires whenever they want theyve known that since they were in the th grade but right now they are college freshmen and seem to be enjoying that greatly so why cant all the impatient grown ups back off and just shut up this is the big lie and the grand hypocrisy people want to grumble about how bad the nbas age limitation rule is to the integrity of college basketball yet many of those same folks now can be found in the front of the line telling young men like durant and oden how foolish theyd be if they didnt turn pro after only one year of college ball i dont know what theyre going to do but i know what i hope they do i hope they go back to school because they both seem to be enjoying themselves growing up at their own pace " all but forgotten in the firestorm over allegations of sexual assault at duke is mike pressler the teams former lacrosse coach mr pressler stood by his players in april a month after the alleged incident he was asked to resign hes now the lacrosse coach of bryant university and the boston globes jackie macmullan does a terrific job of surveying the damage the duke case did to mr pressler his family and his players while noting that the latter two categories arent so easy to separate her conclusion also strikes the fix as a remarkably fair summation of a case where there wasnt a lot of fairness to go around "there are no winners in the duke lacrosse case " she writes "the lives of three young men have been permanently scarred even if all charges are dropped a young womans inconsistencies have dealt a blow to all rape victims who endure the most horrific of crimes but so often face the daunting task of having their credibility unfairly questioned a respected university rushed to judgment and shattered the world of a group of student athletes and a respected coach in the process duke lacrosse players who had secured jobs pending graduation were startled to learn they were no longer available once the scandal broke the duke lacrosse program was recently reinstated the blue devils are and ranked fifth in the country mike pressler has purposely kept his distance it is after all no longer his team but they will always be his kids " earlier this month fans of the new york mets might have caught sight of jose reyes before he was sent to minor league camp no not that jose reyes the fix means jose a reyes a catcher with a chicago cubs cup of coffee on his resume who looked rather big and ungainly next to his fleet famous teammate whod be jose b reyes if you were feeling formal about it a perception compounded by the unfortunate decision to give jose a a uniform with number which looked twice as wide as jose b s simple graceful the fix felt somewhat sorry for jose a reyes but consider the life of mesa community colleges shortstop a fella by the name of joe dimaggio except mr dimaggio loves the game so much that he doesnt mind the jokes and questions about his name as tim brown writes on yahoo sports "this joe dimaggio is in miniature seven inches shorter than the willowy and elegant new york yankee legend " he writes "he possesses however a nearly manic affection for the game so pure that had the original dimaggio loosened his tie years ago or undone two or three buttons of his pinstriped jersey years ago you could imagine this joe leaping out begging to play one more inning i always imagined joe d like this young again taking longer less direct routes from the dugout to center field just to expel some of the penned energy adoring the game and his teammates valuing the three hour flight at least as much as the final score this had to be the kid beating in joe d s heart to play the game as he did beneath the reserve and dignity " tip of the fix
