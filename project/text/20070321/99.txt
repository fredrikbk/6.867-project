sales of music long in decline plunge sharply rise in downloading fails to boost industry a retailing shakeout in a dramatic acceleration of the seven year sales decline that has battered the music industry compact disc sales for the first three months of this year plunged from a year earlier the latest sign of the seismic shift in the way consumers acquire music the sharp slide in sales of cds which still account for more than of music sold has far eclipsed the growth in sales of digital downloads which were supposed to have been the industrys salvation the slide stems from the confluence of long simmering factors that are now feeding off each other including the demise of specialty music retailers like longtime music mecca tower records about music stores including towers locations closed in alone apple inc s sale of around million ipods shows that music remains a powerful force in the lives of consumers but because of the internet those consumers have more ways to obtain music now than they did a decade ago when walking into a store and buying it was the only option today popular songs and albums and countless lesser known works can be easily found online in either legal or pirated forms while the music industry hopes that those songs will be purchased through legal services like apples itunes store consumers can often listen to them on myspace pages or download them free from other sources such as so called mp blogs jeff rabhan who manages artists and music producers including jermaine dupri kelis and elliott yamin says cds have become little more than advertisements for more lucrative goods like concert tickets and t shirts "sales are so down and so off that as a manager i look at a cd as part of the marketing of an artist more than as an income stream " says mr rabhan "its the vehicle that drives the tour the merchandise building the brand and thats it theres no money " the music industry has found itself almost powerless in the face of this shift its struggles are hardly unique in the media world the film tv and publishing industries are also finding it hard to adapt to the digital age though consumers are exposed to more media in more ways than ever before the challenge for media companies is finding a way to make money from all that exposure newspaper publishers for example are finding that their internet advertising isnt growing fast enough to replace the loss of traditional print ads in recent weeks the music industry has posted some of the weakest sales it has ever recorded this year has already seen the two lowest selling no albums since nielsen soundscan which tracks music sales was launched in one week "american idol" runner up chris daughtrys rock band sold just copies of its chart topping album another week the "dreamgirls" movie soundtrack sold a mere as recently as there were many weeks when such tallies wouldnt have been enough to crack the top sellers in prior years it wasnt uncommon for a no record to sell or copies a week in general even todays big titles are stalling out far earlier than they did a few years ago the music industry has been banking on the rise of digital music to compensate for inevitable drops in sales of cds apples launch of its itunes store was greeted as a new day in music retailing one that would allow fans to conveniently and quickly snap up large amounts of music from limitless virtual shelves it hasnt worked out that way at least so far digital sales of individual songs this year have risen from a year earlier to million according to nielsen soundscan but thats nowhere near enough to offset the decline from a year ago in cd sales to million units overall sales of all music digital and physical are down this year and even including sales of ringtones subscription services and other "ancillary" goods sales are still down according to one estimate some recording executives have privately questioned that figure which was included in a recent report by pali research meanwhile one billion songs a month are traded on illegal file sharing networks according to bigchampagne llc adding to the music industrys misery cd prices have fallen amid pressure for cheaper prices from big box retailers like wal mart and others that pressure is feeding through to record labels bottom lines as the market has deteriorated warner music group corp which reported a drop in profits for the fourth quarter of is expected to report little relief in the first quarter of this year looking at unit sales alone "flatters the situation " says simon wright chief executive of virgin entertainment group international which runs virgin megastores locations in north america and world wide "in value terms the markets down probably " virgins music sales have increased slightly this year he says thanks to the demise of chief competitor tower and to a mix of fashion and "lifestyle" products designed to attract customers perhaps the biggest factor in the latest chapter of the music industrys struggle is the shakeout among music retailers as recently as a decade ago specialty stores like tower records were must shop destinations for fans looking for both big hits and older catalog titles but retailers like wal mart stores inc and best buy co took away the hits business by undercutting the chains on price today such megaretailers represent about of the retail market up from a decade ago music distribution executives estimate and digital music piracy which has been rife since the rise of the original napster file sharing service has allowed many would be music buyers to fill their cd racks or digital music players without ever venturing into a store late last year tower records closed its doors after filing for bankruptcy court protection in august earlier in following a bankruptcy filing musicland holding corp which owned the sam goody chain closed of its locations and recently trans world entertainment corp which operates the fye and coconuts chains among others began closing of its locations but even at the outlets that are still open business has suffered executives at trans world based in albany n y told analysts earlier this month that sales of music at its stores declined in the last quarter of for the year music represented just of the companys sales down from in for the final quarter of the year music represented just of its sales joe nardone jr who owns the independent store gallery of sound chain in pennsylvania says he is trying to make up for declining sales of new music by emphasizing used cds which he calls "a more consistent business " for now though he says used discs represent less than of his business not nearly enough to offset the declines retailers and others say record labels have failed to deliver big sellers and even the hits arent what they used to be norah joness "not too late" has sold just shy of million copies since it was released six weeks ago her previous album "feels like home " sold more than million copies in the same period after its release "even when you have a good release like norah jones maybe the environment is so bad you cant turn it around " says richard greenfield an analyst at pali research meanwhile with music sales sliding for the first time even at some big box chains best buy has been quietly reducing the floor space it dedicates to music according to music distribution executives whether wal mart and others will follow suit isnt clear but if they do it could spell more trouble for the record companies the big box chains already stocked far fewer titles than did the fading specialty retailers as a result it is harder for consumers to find and purchase older titles in stores see related letter "letters to the editor digital
