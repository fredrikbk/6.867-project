politics &amp economics pay as you owe too stepped up tax collection may fund legislative goals washington the tax man is poised to gain more clout congress facing a tight budget is looking for additional revenue and lawmakers are focusing on narrowing the "tax gap " collecting money that taxpayers owe but dont pay even president bush backs better collection of taxes while maintaining his signature opposition to new taxes the emphasis on tax law enforcement is largely the result of democrats goal to observe "pay as you go" budget rules getting people to pay more of the taxes they owe is politically preferable to raising taxes already democrats in the senate and house have suggested that tax gap revenue could be used for purposes such as reducing the budget deficit providing health insurance to more children and protecting middle class households from the alternative minimum tax the specific tax gap approach with the most bipartisan support would involve arming the internal revenue service with new tools to track under reported income the primary focus would be requiring certain business middlemen such as credit card processors to provide more data about other businesses transactions some democrats also want to ramp up the irs budget "for some time i think the irs has been underfunded " said rep john lewis d ga chairman of the house ways and means oversight subcommittee after holding a hearing yesterday on irs operations "they have a major task and we need the revenues to fund the things we want to do " at the hearing some members said they were concerned the agency is stopping some inquiries prematurely what texas democratic rep lloyd doggett called "cut and run" audits because it is short on staff as lawmakers delve into the details they readily admit that tougher enforcement wont supply all the revenue they might want to cover the cost of their spending and tax cut proposals and they ultimately will have to seek more politically risky options the tax gap estimated to be about a net &# billion a year represents errors carelessness willful under reporting of income and failure to file at all still about of taxpayers are compliant and lawmakers are sensitive to burdening this group with new requirements an aide to sen max baucus d mont chairman of the finance committee for example says increasing the number of irs auditors "might be prudent " but mr baucus also wants to reduce honest mistakes by focusing resources on the services the agency provides as well his aides estimate a one percentage point improvement in compliance would help collect about &# billion a year irs commissioner mark everson also cautions against going too far in a new tax crackdown in congress "theres a recognition that tax administration can contribute to funding the government " he said in an interview but he added "no one wants to go back to the bad old days" of less than a decade ago when the republican run congress went after the agency for being too intrusive and infringing on taxpayer rights businesses already are pushing back against the new enforcement campaign criticizing some ideas as onerous powerful small business groups are especially vocal and the national federation of independent business has helped form a coalition to battle some proposals "youre basically imposing more compliance burdens on an already overburdened taxpayer community " says macey davis the nfibs tax counsel "if you claim that this is the community that creates more jobs yet you want to come and have the federal government banging down their door what does that say " democrats expect political cover in the fact that some proposals under attack were put forth by the bush administration in its budget blueprint this year among them the white house wants to require banks that process credit card payments to report to the irs each year on the aggregate amounts charged at a variety of businesses such as restaurants and dry cleaners the irs could use the data to cross check income that businesses report on their tax returns as well as to look for anomalies in the portion of credit card receipts reported by companies within the same industry the idea has been criticized by some in the industry who say setting up the necessary data systems could take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars lawmakers also are exploring ways to provide the irs with more information about income people earn selling goods at auctions including those occurring online the administration proposed requiring "brokers" of certain transactions to report them to the irs and the seller much like banks send forms showing the interest earned on accounts building on that idea senate tax writers are examining whether to apply new reporting requirements to processors of online transactions a change that could affect companies such as paypal a company spokeswoman said it is too early to say "if or how this will affect our business " another idea that has generated interest in congress would require stock brokers to report the initial purchase price of stocks sold under current law only the sale price is required this proposal backed by the bush administration is aimed at getting more accurate reports of investment gains for many sophisticated brokerage companies it wouldnt be a stretch many already supply such information to customers smaller firms might have to make adjustments for democrats to get the kind of revenue boost they seek they will have to go far beyond the tax gap proposals put forward by the bush administration which would generate only &# billion over five years according to administration estimates
