conrad black fights back at trial chicago media baron conrad black was alternately painted as a greedy swindler and a victim as his fraud and racketeering trial got under way here yesterday federal prosecutor jeffrey cramers opening statements unfolded largely as expected the government alleges that mr black and three other former executives of hollinger international inc diverted more than &# million from the company through a series of noncompete payments made without proper board approval or disclosure "it was theft it was fraud it was crime " mr cramer said "bank robbers wear masks and use a gun they dressed in ties and wore a suit " mr black who has pleaded not guilty for the first time began to unveil his defense strategy firing back at mr cramer chicago defense lawyer edward genson described his client as a family man and visionary entrepreneur who has been falsely charged by the government and wronged by his top lieutenant and business partner david radler who served as chief operating officer of hollinger international "david radler will come into this court and lie to you about conrad black " mr genson told the jury adding that the deals in question "magically became a black orchestrated deal after radler cut his deal " after pleading guilty to one count of mail fraud mr radler agreed to testify for the government in return he will likely receive a relatively light two year sentence and a &# fine mr black is facing a prison sentence of as long as years the three other former executives are pleading not guilty to lesser charges mr black was an innocent bystander as mr radler created schemes to steal from hollinger international since renamed sun times media group inc mr genson said "this is not a story about theft by conrad black this is a story about theft from him " mr genson said adding that there was no "accounting magic at hollinger " as hollinger international grew into the worlds third largest newspaper publisher by circulation with more than papers under its control mr black and mr radler divided the media empire mr black was responsible for papers in the east of canada and the united kingdom while mr radler took autonomous charge of papers in western canada the u s and israel of the different deals the prosecution highlighted as examples of how the former executives skimmed millions of dollars from the company mr genson said mr black only was responsible for selling the bulk of the companys canadian newspapers to canwest global communications corp in that case mr genson said the buyers asked for noncompetition promises and that all the necessary approvals were put in place the other deals in question mr genson says were the responsibility of mr radler the prosecution told jurors the opposite the noncompete payments some of which were paid directly to mr black and former executives were made in return for hollinger international agreeing not to compete with companies that bought certain of its u s and canadian community newspapers mr cramer said the money should have gone to hollinger international shareholders mr cramer said the noncompete agreements were akin to "joes tavern" selling to another restaurateur and that restaurateur then paying joe not to set up shop right next door but the defense turned the folksy analogy into an argument for why the noncompete deals were legal anybody who bought joes tavern said mr genson would want to remember sam the bartender a buyer would have to pay sam not to set up shop next door hes the one who knows the customers knows how to make the drinks sam in this case would be the executives of hollinger international much of mr gensons opening statement appeared designed to distance mr black from recent high profile cases involving white collar crime "this was not enron " he said he also depicted mr black a jet setting executive known for his luxurious lifestyle as a family man and hard working entrepreneur who built the company from nothing and was inextricably linked to its image mr blacks wife and daughter were seated in the courtroom although mr black gave up his canadian citizenship in to become a british lord his lawyer referred to him as conrad telling jurors that mr blacks life is "different from ours not better just different " the prosecution detailed ways that mr black used hollinger international money to fuel his lavish lifestyle defrauding shareholders of hollinger international of investments for their retirement or college funds among other things mr black is accused of using hollinger international cash to fly to bora bora for a summer vacation on another occasion he threw a surprise birthday party for his wife barbara amiel black at a french restaurant in new york mr genson tried to establish mrs black as a businesswoman in her own right who served on the companys board and wrote columns published in major outlets such as the wall street journal and macleans the birthday party for her was business mr genson said set up in conjunction with a board meeting mr black he says paid for one third of the party the rest was a corporate expense mr genson says the bora bora trip didnt cost more than &# the government says it cost more than &# and that hollinger didnt have a flight policy mr genson said mr black picked up the cost of the trip as part of his income and paid income tax on it
