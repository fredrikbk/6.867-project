the evening wrap bird watching online edition wall street has been waiting for any hint from the federal reserve that signs of economic slowing have given central bankers pause about their hawkish stance toward inflation and today they appeared to deliver but some economists warned that the message wasnt quite as dovish as investors may think as was universally expected the federal open market committee left interest rates unchanged the benchmark federal funds rate has now been left idling at since early last summer when the central bank finally ended a long string of rate increases since that time fed policy makers have seen no signs that growth has cooled enough or inflation heated up enough to warrant some tinkering with the thermostat but a touch of fine tuning of the central banks all important post meeting statement suggests that its outlook on the economy is evolving whereas in january when they last met policy makers saw "somewhat firmer economic growth" and "tentative signs" that the housing market had its legs under it now they perceive recent data as "mixed" and says that the housing "adjustment" is "ongoing " that wasnt the only place where policy makers had taken out their red pens where inflation is concerned the bank opined back in january that core inflation numbers had "improved modestly " but following this meeting it declared that it viewed core inflation as "somewhat elevated " whats all that mean the fed spelled it out "in these circumstances the committees predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected " for an institution that long prided itself on the sort of ambiguity that would have put stephane mallarme to shame thats some rather striking clarity still economists read on with many of them zeroing in on another change pointing out that where in the previous release the panel had said any "additional firming" that is rate increases would hinge on the continuing evolution of the economic outlook this meetings statement had been updated to say that any forthcoming "policy adjustments" would depend on the incoming numbers might the fed policy makers ditching talk of firming be an indication that the central banks next move will be to reduce interest rates perhaps not immediately but lehman brothers economist john shin wrote in a note to clients that what it does do is relax "the implication that the next fomc move would necessarily be a hike " its about time financial markets seemed to say with the manufacturing sector hobbled consumer and business spending looking rather weak and the housing sector continuing to careen downhill it appeared that the last thing anyone wanted to contemplate was higher interest rates after investors took a gander at the statement stocks were off to the races the dow jones industrial average which had meandered along all morning surged to the nasdaq composite index climbed to while the standard &amp poors index rose to treasury prices rallied too pushing the year yield to and the dollar was mixed against the euro and the yen but some may wonder whether the euphoria is overdone joshua shapiro chief u s economist at mfr in new york wrote that the feds continued emphasis on inflation doesnt suggest that an easing is around the corner "frankly given the feds emphasis on clarity and communication the ambiguity contained in todays bias statement is more than a little incongruous " mr shapiro wrote subpoenas authorized for bush aides a house panel authorized subpoenas for bush adviser karl rove former white house counsel harriet miers and others to testify to congress on the firings of eight federal prosecutors democrats argue that the dismissals were improperly driven by politics while the white house contends that terminating the lawyers for any reason is within its authority the development opens a battle between lawmakers and the administration over executive privilege and congressional oversight that could drag on for some time and eventually land at the supreme court mr bush insisted yesterday he would fight any subpoenas from capitol hill but lawmakers pressed forward amid the prospect of a high stakes struggle over constitutional prerogatives though possible subpoenas for mr rove and ms miers garnered the most attention a subpoena was also authorized for kyle sampson the former chief of staff for attorney general alberto gonzales who resigned last week the congressional panel will also seek documents from mr gonzales current white house counsel fred fielding and white house chief of staff joshua bolten before todays vote white house press secretary tony snow said the administration was attempting to avoid the media circus likely to result from mr rove being seated for a public hearing schultz defends starbucks strategy starbucks chairman howard schultz who recently penned a memo bemoaning the commoditization of the chains brand defended the companys growth strategy in front of thousands at its annual meeting the memo was designed to lay out strategy ahead of the companys annual planning sessions "not a memo intended to be critical of the company or to demonstrate a lack of faith in the management team " mr schultz told shareholders in his comments he said he had written similar memos in the past over the years in order to challenge the company to be better and exceed the expectations of investors and consumers he reiterated that the company will open and lease stores over the next four years and that he expects the size of the company to double in the next four to
