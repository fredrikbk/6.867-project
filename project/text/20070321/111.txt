the morning brief a washington showdown over u s attorneys online edition the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here with president bush invoking executive privilege and congressional democrats threatening to issue subpoenas as early as today each side seems to be spoiling for a fight over the firing of eight u s attorneys last year but both may be miscalculating the political fallout mr bush appeared before reporters early yesterday evening to argue the propriety of his administrations handling of those dismissals make clear he stands behind embattled attorney general alberto gonzales and unveil what he described as an "unprecedented" sharing of information on the matter with congress "i recognize the importance of members of congress having the importance of congress has placed on understanding how and why this decision was made " mr bush said "so ill allow relevant committee members on a bipartisan basis to interview key members of my staff to ascertain relevant facts " most pertinent among those staff members are political czar karl rove and former white house counsel harriet miers but what mr bush wont allow from his current and former aides is testimony thats public under oath or transcribed and his repeated use of "relevant" underlined the limits on the kinds of questions they will be allowed to answer to mr bush such restrictions are required to "safeguard the ability for presidents to get good decisions " and thats where the matter comes down to any contemporary white houses favorite ill defined constitutional principle executive privilege the notion that the founding fathers emphasis on the separation of powers guaranteed oval office confidentiality that lets the president receive the candid advice he needs to run the country but successful use of the privilege is often a function of the political and moral high ground enjoyed by an administration and the strength of the hands it can play on capitol hill the current white house counsel washington veteran fred fielding who as a member of the commission saw similar clashes with the administration from the other side went to congress yesterday to discuss mr bushs proposal rep chris cannon one of two republican lawmakers who attended the meeting tells the new york times he pressed mr fielding on whether he "understood that a lie would be prosecutable " even if the interview was not conducted under oath "he said yes we understand that " mr cannon says but democrats nonetheless cried foul "instead of freely and fully providing relevant documents to the investigating committees they have only selectively sent documents after erasing large portions that they do not want to see the light of day " senate judiciary committee chairman patrick leahy said as the wall street journal reports "testimony should be on the record and under oath thats the formula for true accountability " democrats offered as examples a roster of officials from democratic white houses who agreed to testify under oath before congress and administration arguments against oath taking may be undermined by timing of a fight that comes just two weeks after ex white house aide i lewis libbys perjury conviction the administration also faces republican anger on the matter that helped produce a vote in the senate yesterday to purge the attorney generals power to appoint u s attorneys to indefinite terms without senate approval as the journal notes republicans are also joining democrats in warning the fbi to get its act together regarding the abuse of investigative tools backed by the white house the times reports and the fight comes as mr bush is under fire on the right as well with critics unhappy with a lack of more forceful support of mr libby and a range of issues that includes the recent compromise deal with north korea one example is robert joseph who is quitting as undersecretary of state for arms control apparently in response to the north korean agreement the times reports thats as much about image as law and yet that anger on the right may in part explain the tough line now being taken by the white house many conservatives have been outraged by the way the dismissals have spiraled into such a large scandal and at how democrats have sought to take advantage of it the house democratic campaign committee already plans to use the affair in some of its first election ads the times reports and while the piles of emails and other materials documenting justice department and white house communications over the dismissals have been inflammatory they have yet to produce a smoking gun "for all their vivid detail the e mails and other records shed little light on the bush administrations motives for carrying out the firings in the way it did " the washington post notes "the new documents also provide little evidence that justice officials sought to interfere with public corruption probes as many democrats and some of the prosecutors have alleged " mr bush pointedly accused some democrats of being "more interested in scoring political points than in learning the facts" and warned against taking "the partisan road of issuing subpoenas and demanding show trials " last novembers election showed how politically weak mr bush and republicans had become and while the war in iraq played a big part the election was also about having a responsible government in washington that issue seems to resonate in the fight over the firing of u s attorneys which may prove to be less a constitutional face off than a contest over image control compact discs seen as a dying breed the falling sales of compact discs and rising number of commercial music downloads do not compose a zero sum equation to the chagrin of suffering recording labels cd sales so far this year are down from the same period of marking what the wall street journal calls a "dramatic acceleration of the seven year sales decline that has battered the music industry " and cds still account for more than of music sold which explains why digital sales havent made up for a trend that shut the doors of about specialty music retailers last year including the stores of the now defunct tower records "apple inc s sale of around million ipods shows that music remains a powerful force in the lives of consumers " the journal says "but because of the internet those consumers have more ways to obtain music now than they did a decade ago when walking into a store and buying it was the only option " popular and lesser known songs and albums can often be heard on the likes of myspace pages or downloaded for free from so called mp blogs and other sources artist and music producer manager jeff rabhan says he now views cds as little more than a way to promote concert tickets t shirts and other more lucrative goods "its the vehicle that drives the tour the merchandise building the brand and thats it " he says "theres no money " also of note bbc a u s military official said children were used in a bomb attack in iraq adding that a vehicle was waved through a checkpoint
