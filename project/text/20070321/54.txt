in domestic intelligence gathering the fbi is definitely on the case judge posner repeats in his march op ed commentary "time to rethink the fbi" his now longstanding criticism of the bureau as an organization that has failed to transform in taking on an expanded intelligence mission he says we have not made enough progress he says we are gathering information to obtain convictions and without regard to our responsibilities as an intelligence agency he says we need a separate intelligence service in this country and he critiques virtually every aspect of the bureau in arguing that we cannot accommodate an intelligence program within the fbi i joined the cia in as an analyst and i left on loan to the fbi to become second in charge of the national security branch responsible for this intelligence transformation in september i watched counterterrorism operations for years my most recent position at cia was as second in charge of the counterterrorist center there are many more important things we do beyond watching our critics comment on the fbi in the media but few things in my months at the bureau have been as curious as the broad gap between perceptions of the bureau among some critics including judge posner and the reality i have witnessed during my time here judge posners comments fall short well short in two fundamental areas facts and analysis he is dead wrong on both fronts first the facts judge posner points to fbi investigations as law enforcement measures that are not intelligence operations this is incorrect we have discussions at least once a day with director mueller and senior operational managers to discuss the most significant terrorist threats we see no discussion has ever focused solely on a prosecution or on a need to compile evidence quickly for a courtroom every discussion ive seen focuses on how much we understand al qaeda and its homegrown cells terrorism is not about stopping plots we can stop plots and do with our partners in foreign security services at cia at homeland security with state and local police and with americans who help but terrorists will plot again if we defend against only their schemes and fail to stop the terrorists themselves so our focus is on what to do about terrorists once we draw an intelligence picture of who they are and what they are up to when intelligence groups use their unique tools to stop terrorists overseas they disrupt unilaterally and sometimes with foreign partners often using those partners law enforcement tools to take terrorists off the streets but the end of their often brilliant intelligence operations is disruption stopping people so they cannot plot again we operate within the u s and we have a different set of tools but we have the same end as they do disruption once we fully understand a cell we can either let it run which we often do or take it down when we take it down we use tools that reflect american laws used in ways that reflect american values we penetrate cells to develop a sufficient understanding of who they are so we can limit the prospects of surprise and once we have that understanding we do what our partners do we disrupt that cell using the tools at our disposal any security service around the world mi cia shin bet operates using this model judge posners arguments are equally flawed when one actually examines how our foreign intelligence partners operate he argues for an mi a separate security service that has only domestic intelligence responsibilities it is not clear to me why such an approach would be any better than what we have in fact i believe it would be fundamentally worse first when our sister security services overseas operate they do not function independently they operate jointly with their police counterparts they may run parallel informant networks at the same time keeping one network focused on intelligence collection while another might include an informant who can appear in a courtroom we have the luxury in this country of a more efficient approach we can sit at the table in one organization and talk about the intelligence we are collecting and what we should do about it whether we should continue collecting or disrupt and what options we have under either scenario the fbi is a national security agency we are not solely a law enforcement agency judge posner is right we are not and never will be solely an intelligence agency we are the federal agency responsible for national security combining the authority and capability to collect information that could pre empt a threat and to do something about it dividing these combined responsibilities by creating yet another federal agency an mi would be remarkably inefficient and terribly slow who would divide the tactical responsibilities that overlap and snag why should one agency manage intelligence sources on hezbollah and another manage sources who provide the same information but can appear in a court of law who would police turf wars and how many more resources would we have to expend to fund and staff an agency dedicated to collecting the intelligence we already collect at the fbi such a move would be not only inefficient but foolish we have had remarkable success collecting against organized crime families for example so we could understand their structures and then take them down in what was a remarkable intelligence success more recently weve hired over a thousand more analysts trained agents in intelligence collection programs added national security training for all agents and expanded guidance to fbi field offices on how we should conduct our intelligence mission and weve shifted massive resources into counterterrorism and counterintelligence and made commensurate advances in our relationships with state and local law enforcement tripling the number of joint terrorism task forces but we also have a ways to go to evolve our intelligence mission once we do we should determine how to get even better we dont train our personnel well enough yet though we are working closely with intelligence partners to do so we continue to devise policies for guidance in collecting intelligence i joined the bureau with questions can we do this will we do this and how nineteen months later these questions are answered it is the responsibility of those of us leading this bureau to provide the guidance tools funding and vision to accomplish this mission judge posner fails to understand what we have done who we are and how we go about our mission he simply doesnt know john p mudd
