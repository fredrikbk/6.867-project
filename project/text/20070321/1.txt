act one should twentysomething artists mix passion and business online edition when my roommate rob travieso was finishing up a graduate degree in creative writing a professor took him aside and said that it might be a mistake to get a professional job that could encroach on his goals and habits as a writer "the idea was that i shouldnt fool myself into contentment with a job that was kind of like writing or in the world of writing that i should instead make what money i could in a separate world " says rob whos and now works as a temp spending much of his time on his novel one of my professors told me the same thing she advised that i paint in a spare room at home and never confuse my fine art ambitions with a "creative" career in media or marketing i think many of my art school classmates left college hoping to show work in galleries however obscure while earning their keep by substitute teaching building bleachers or doing shrub and lawn maintenance with headphones on what happens when an artist must make art but cant afford to make only art do you separate art and money or try to find a way to join the two aspiring artists do have the option of pursuing one of any number of relatively creative vocations designing ad campaigns writing slogans or composing music for the movies for example but plenty reject creative commercialism on principle instead taking retail bartending blue collar or other jobs because they are just that jobs aspiring writer and boston native jonathan scheff gave up trying to support himself as a free lance journalist in new york "even if i had time at the end of the day i wasnt in the mind set to work on my book because i had already been writing all day " he says "i lost the time and energy to write creatively " now he has what he calls a lucrative part time copywriting gig and is back to work on his book a memoir about his experience meeting an old man in vietnam but for year old melissa feudi joining the two pursuits has proven satisfying on several fronts she wouldnt be the first to do so andy warhols campbell soup prints were inspired by his days as an advertising illustrator ms feudi a painter who has a job

and clothes and trips that come along with all the grandeur of a comfortable office job " the brooklyn n y resident says some of her corporate design projects intrigue her enough to trickle into nights and weekends and other times she would rather be making paintings than doing design "having a creative job can up the technical skills of your talents " says year old daniel au who spends his days designing packages for supermarket goods but theres a downside mr au who grew up in houston and now lives in brooklyn says his day job saps his energy leaving him too frazzled to practice photography after work "i do find some hours a week to work on photos ive taken but the fine art suffers more than i would like it to " mr au hopes to work a little while longer at his current job and learn enough to branch out on his own as a free lancer so he can do it all on his own schedule michael "scruff" cardinale who sings and plays guitar in a punk rock band thought about becoming a
