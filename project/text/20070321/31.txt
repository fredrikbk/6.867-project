corporate focus business black trial revives bad old days just as the washington business lobby is stepping up its campaign to remove the post enron shackles from business conrad black has returned to remind us why those shackles were put there in the first place mr black aka lord black of crossharbour is the grandest and most colorful of this decades white collar miscreants he played on a smaller stage than enrons kenneth lay or worldcoms bernie ebbers his alleged crimes are measured in tens of millions not billions of dollars but he filled that stage with outsized flair and bombast he fashioned his life after the great men he liked to study he wrote biographies of richard nixon and franklin roosevelt and his downfall had all the drama of a shakespearian tragedy complete with its lady macbeth second wife barbara amiel whose appetites "i have an extravagance that knows no bounds " she told vogue magazine are credited by some with driving his greed mr blacks trial on charges that he looted his own company hollinger international now known as sun times media group began this week in chicago because he is a controversial character in canada where he gave up citizenship to win a british peerage in britain where he owned the right wing daily telegraph and in the u s where he has hobnobbed with the likes of henry kissinger and henry kravis the trial has attracted about journalists many of them are no doubt hoping to catch one of his famous verbal eruptions or see her in a particularly revealing and costly outfit "vermin" was lady blacks term this week for the journalistic mob his peerage and her decolletage aside however this trial will provide the most graphic illustration yet of why the th century model of the public corporation broke down there is first of all the brazenness of mr blacks actions messrs lay and ebbers might claim their deceits were for the benefit of all shareholders of which they happened to be among the largest mr black can make no such claim he and three others stand accused of fraudulently siphoning about &# million out of hollinger international and into separate entities that they controlled the prosecution will argue this was done without the knowledge or approval of hollingers star studded board of directors which included mr kissinger mr kraviss wife marie josee former illinois gov jim thompson and richard burt former u s ambassador to germany mr black continues to insist he is innocent more remarkable than what was done without the boards knowledge however is what was done with the boards knowledge from to mr black and his associates transferred to themselves and their affiliates a total of about &# million an amount representing about of hollingers entire adjusted net income during that period according to a report prepared for the companys board in the majority of this was apparently legal and isnt at issue in the trial but that doesnt make it right the report was written by former securities and exchange commission chairman richard breeden who has become the antihero of the corporate world favored by judges and shareholder activists to clean up and monitor a variety of corporate messes the breeden report labeled hollinger a "corporate kleptocracy " the report also gave a harsh assessment of the audit committee comprising gov thompson ms kravis and mr burt which was charged with looking out for public shareholder interests "the audit committees performance was ineffective and careless over a prolonged period " the breeden report concludes "in the time needed to consume a tuna sandwich " the committee would approve transfers of tens of millions of dollars for the benefit of mr black and his closest associates without ever "performing any appreciable analysis or review " in todays corporate world that sort of sleepy oversight is unlikely to recur independent directors have more powers and tools and are under more pressure to perform with diligence one hollinger director involved in the mess told me the much maligned section of the sarbanes oxley law which has become the business lobbys favorite whipping boy also might have prevented some of mr blacks most outrageous abuses by tracking the flow of money yet the hollinger story is worth keeping in mind while washington acting under the banner of "competitiveness " begins rolling back those post enron changes in corporate laws regulations and practices some of those clearly went too far and could crimp the ability of public companies to create the prosperity they did in the past century but others particularly those making it clear that directors work for shareholders not management may not have gone far enough
