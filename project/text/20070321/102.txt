the afternoon report subpoena shootout online edition much was made of the presidents pugilistic demeanor when he criticized plans to subpoena senior white house aides in the u s attorneys uproar but democrats are giving no sign they intend to drop their gloves at a hearing this morning a house subcommittee voted to authorize subpoenas for political adviser karl rove and former white house counsel harriet miers among others setting up a battle with the administration over executive privilege and legislative oversight that could drag on for months and perhaps years and eventually land before the supreme court mr bush insisted yesterday that he would fight any subpoenas from capitol hill but lawmakers pressed forward amid the prospect of a high stakes struggle over constitutional prerogatives "there must be accountability " said rep linda sanchez for the firings of eight u s attorneys though possible subpoenas for mr rove and ms miers garnered the most attention a subpoena was also authorized for d kyle sampson a former aide to attorney general alberto gonzales who resigned last week the panel will also request documents from mr gonzales the current white house counsel fred fielding and white house chief of staff joshua bolten a process server wont soon be strolling across the white house lawn though the committee has authorized the subpoenas it hasnt yet issued them before todays vote white house press secretary tony snow asserted that the administration was attempting to avoid the kind of media supernova that would certainly result from mr rove being seated for a public hearing "the question theyve got to ask themselves is are you more interested in a political spectacle than getting the truth " mr snow said to reporters spokeswoman dana perino also jabbed at the democrats saying that if lawmakers "are truly serious about wanting to obtain the facts they have right in front of them the opportunity to do that " yesterday mr bush offered mr rove and ms miers for closed door untranscribed interviews with congressional investigators but made it clear that he would under no circumstances send his advisers to testify under oath in a public committee chamber but democrats said that wouldnt cut it sen patrick leahy chairman of the senate judiciary committee said that testimony "should be on the record and under oath" to provide "true accountability " the president insists that subjecting mr rove and company to a public grilling would have a chilling effect on his ability and the ability of future presidents to solicit and receive unvarnished counsel a similar argument was made when vice president dick cheney sought to protect the roster of industry experts that he had consulted on energy policy during the presidents first term whats still unclear however is just how much the president can depend on republicans in congress to ride along with him as he challenges the subpoenas in court should it come to that several republican lawmakers have already said that they dont support the attorney general and then yesterday a decisive bipartisan majority in the senate voted to repeal a segment of the patriot act that had permitted the administration to replace u s attorneys without the approval of the senate a provision with no small part in setting off this fracas a number of republicans said "no" on the subpoena voice vote though
