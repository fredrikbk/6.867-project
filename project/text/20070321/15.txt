bournes deft way with scissorhands edward scissorhands brooklyn academy of music through march brooklyn n y matthew bourne the year old british choreographer with a string of theatrical marvels to his name prefers to steer clear of the term "ballet" to identify his work this is so even though most of his big scale creations rework hallowed ballets from the time tested past his "swan lake" an internationally acclaimed and still widely seen reimagining of the th centurys great ballet classic with an all male ensemble as swans heads the list also on it his "cinderella " to prokofievs familiar th century ballet music his "nutcracker " based on tchaikovskys perennial ballet favorite and his "highland fling " which is inspired by an score is set in contemporary scotland and is actually subtitled "a romantic wee ballet " now stopping at the brooklyn academy of music for nearly three weeks on an american tour comes mr bournes "edward scissorhands " a two act stage production based on tim burtons movie in the film a young man is fashioned frankenstein like or to use a ballet analogy coppelia like with scissors for hands becomes a local darling as an eccentric artist and eventually is seen as a threat and run out of town mr bourne himself has noted to journalists the puzzlement hes sensed from audiences all but wondering aloud if anyones going to speak or sing as his works proceed i noted some bewilderment in in st paul minn as no one spoke or sang during "the car man " mr bournes sexy and fiery dance theater take on the bizet opera "carmen " i suspect mr bournes reluctance to attach the word "ballet" to his work comes in part from the gentlemanly honesty he possess as a artist and a person he entered the dance world late as a year old with an abiding interest in movie and show dancing and thus might feel he hasnt earned the right to attach ballets name to his creations in addition id bet mr bournes presenters happily steer clear of the ballet label in cowardly fear of putting people off whatever you call it or dont call it mr bournes "edward scissorhands" moves from its opening curtain through to its snow falling curtain calls with a grace a charm a wit a momentum and a depth worthy of any creation calling itself a ballet to be fair mr bourne calls the fifth section of his first act "the suburban ballet " this scene of overlapping and intermeshing family groups introduces in vivid and deft movements all the individuals who populate hope springs the narratives mid th century american town where edward of the scissorhands finds himself adopted the piled on activities including family rides in unseen convertibles with their tops down are created with no more than blocks of bodies and a single steering wheel to be accurate its in those scenes where the dancing aims to soar to its full height and go beyond specific narrative and pantomimic direction that mr bournes seemingly boundless sense of invention and attention to detail tends to thin out one attribute missing from moments such as these is a sense of mass drawing on what ballet history calls a "gift for grouping " the "topiary garden" scene for example unfolds as what musical theater calls a "dream ballet " in it edward freed for this fantasy interlude from the scissorblades that replace his fingers and hands dances barehanded with kim the local cheerleader who falls in passionate human love with the not quite human stranger terry daviess pretty rippling score recycles many of the themes composed for the movie by danny elfman movie music is a different breed from dance music and the lack of incisive musical texturing in mr daviess soundtrack inspired compositions further pales the would be pure dance numbers especially as they serve to showcase the ecstatic love of an impassioned couple lost in their mutual rapture and yet even as the moments that might produce crescendo end up merely staying the course of the narratives intentions the action that leads into and out of them could hardly be more inspired take for instance those sharp shiny blades that the shock headed and innocent faced edward sports in mr bournes hands edwards not quite hands achieve a rainbow of effects they waggle shimmer reach flourish and function now like a birds plumage or a cats whiskers or an insects antennae then as castanets or spanish fans their gestural tone can be as delicate as batted eyelashes or as determined as the teeth on a buzz saw their inflection can make edward look like a slinky jazz man with hang dog slyness or a hip hopping home boy with finger splayed street attitude lez botherstons fun filled scenic delights and his lovingly detailed costuming are all over the place americana always eye filling in color and cut even when they venture far from the s setting this is a caricatured american landscape but one senses that even if these british artists view of their own populace might be a little more precise as to period they would not be less biting with regard to satire mr bournes and mr botherstons view of british "life" in "swan lake" was similarly tart mr bournes dedicated company of dancers many with ballet backgrounds inhabit his vision with ease and distinction the two men alternating as edward are equally effective sam archer was a bit more remarkable as an actor his pointy chin helping his facial animation cut extra deep richard winsor revealed more buoyancy as a dancer but missed none of the characters emotions kerry biggin proved less riveting than the kim character might ideally be michela meazza as the red headed "desperate housewife" next door could not have been more effective the rubber legged and dashing gareth charlton made one wish his mayor upton had a scene stealing turn or two i suppose the scrupulous mr bourne will continue to find the term "ballet" too strict or limiting to describe his rich theatrical excursions now that ive seen and admired a small share of them i wonder if hed consider calling these original and memorable creations a name all their own bourneballet mr greskovic writes about dance for the journal
