mortgage meltdown stock markets world wide have sold off the past few weeks over concerns the collapse of the subprime mortgage industry could prolong and deepen the housing slump and threaten the health of the u s economy federal reserve officials and most economists believe the problems in the subprime mortgage market will remain relatively contained but there is compelling evidence that the failure of subprime loans may be the start of a painful unwinding of a housing bubble that was fueled by easy money and loose lending practices whether measured in absolute terms or time tested metrics such as price to income or price to rent ratios the rise in u s home prices during the past six years is unprecedented whats more not only has mortgage debt doubled during this time but loans have been offered on imprudent terms for instance a no down payment no income verification loan to a borrower with a checkered credit history its no coincidence that the five fold growth in subprime lending occurred at a time when home prices soared to nosebleed territory as home prices kept rising fewer loans went bad because the homeowner could almost always refinance or sell the property at a profit until the past year or so it seems the only person in california who sold his house at a loss was the convicted lobbyist who in bribed former rep randy "duke" cunningham by buying his house at an inflated price and selling it six months later for &# less as the home price boom gained momentum and delinquencies dropped lenders offered progressively easier and riskier lending terms common sense suggests that the boom time mania that led banks and investors in mortgage backed securities to offer dangerous loans to individuals with poor credit histories also led them to offer the same kinds of risky loans no income verification no down payments high payments as a share of income low teaser rates to individuals with good credit scores far from being limited to the subprime market the data show these risky loan features have become widespread according to credit suisse the number of no or low documentation loans so called "liar loans" has increased to last year from of purchase loans in a nearly three fold increase the investment bank also found that borrowers put up less than a down payment in of all home purchases last year inside mortgage finance estimates that nontraditional mortgages mostly interest only and pay option arms that allow the borrower to defer paying back principal or even increase the loan balance each month which barely existed five years ago grew to close to a third of all mortgages last year the alt a market a middle ground between subprime and prime has increased seven fold since and accounted for of home purchase loans last year fully of alt a loans last year were no or low documentation loans according to first american loan performance why have borrowers employed this kind of risky financing because it was the only way many of them could afford a home in some of the hottest housing markets where prices more than doubled in five years it should come as no surprise that delinquencies on these unconventional loans have increased sharply investors were shaken last week by a mortgage bankers association report which found that mortgage delinquencies hit nearly at the end of last year and that prime adjustable rate loans deteriorated at a faster rate than subprime arms a recent ubs report finds that the alt a loans are "on track to be one of the worst vintages ever " this is no subprime niche problem even if bad loans are more widespread than previously expected many housing bulls say the impact on the housing market and the economy will be minimal because total losses due to foreclosures will be a small percentage of outstanding mortgage debt and a still smaller share of the economy a similar argument holds that bad loans wont lead to a broader foreclosure problem because the average american has plenty of equity in his home foreclosure losses as a share of the economy will be small and most homeowners have a comfortable amount of equity in their homes in fact about one third of homeowners have no mortgage and own their homes outright but they are not the reason home prices have been driven to the stratosphere home prices like all prices are set at the margin it was the marginal buyer particularly the subprime borrower and housing speculator who drove prices higher the easing of lending terms increased the demand for homes and since the supply of homes is relatively fixed or inelastic this increase in demand quickly translated into higher prices as the loose lending practices are inevitably reversed and there is a wide chasm between current lending practices and prudent lending terms fewer people will be able to afford to buy a house which will reduce demand and push home prices lower its not the size of foreclosure losses as a share of the economy that matters it is the effect those losses have on the availability of credit when banks and investors in mortgage backed securities begin suffering losses they inevitably pull back this is why so many subprime companies have gone bankrupt virtually overnight investors balked at buying subprime loans except at a steep discount which produced immediate losses in effect their ability to profitably finance new loans was eliminated whats more the bank regulators are only now beginning to tighten lending standards and will be under increasing pressure from congress to do more after growing by nearly in the first half of nontraditional loan growth has turned negative since the bank regulators issued new guidelines last september the cfo of countrywide recently told an investor conference that of the subprime loans the company is making wont meet proposed federal rules likely to take effect during the summer the concern that tighter lending standards could reduce access to financing is the reason a widely watched survey of homebuilders conducted by the national association of homebuilders dropped earlier this week the report by credit suisse estimates mortgage originations could drop during the next year or two because of tighter credit standards coupled with high inventories of unsold homes and the additional supply likely from distressed sellers this drop in demand could produce an unprecedented nationwide decline in home prices merrill lynch estimates prices could drop as much as this year a price drop of this magnitude would lead to a vicious cycle in the housing market and pose a major risk to economic growth and of course it would create a raging political firestorm tomorrow the senate banking committee will hold a hearing featuring the bank regulators as well as top executives from a number of subprime lenders all of whom are likely to be the subject of some tough questioning the collapse of the subprime industry and the increase in foreclosures are serious issues and congressional oversight is important and appropriate however congress should proceed with caution as legislation designed to protect the consumer from "predatory" lending could exacerbate the credit crunch just beginning in the subprime market the fact that congress is now holding hearings on the fallout from the second major asset price bubble in the last decade should prompt some broader questions for example what role did the feds loose monetary policy from play in fueling the housing bubble should the federal reserve reexamine its policy of ignoring asset bubbles asset bubbles are harmful for the same reason high inflation is both create misleading price signals that lead to a misallocation of economic resources and sow the seeds for an inevitable bust the unwinding of todays housing bubble is not merely an academic question it is likely to inflict real hardship on millions of americans to reduce the risk of a similar outcome in the future it is important that policy makers economists and policy analysts properly diagnose the root causes of the current housing bust not just its symptoms mr laperriere is a managing director in the washington office of isi
