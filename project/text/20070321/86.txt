paper chase how a money manager battled new york times mr elmasry escalated efforts over two years letters to the chairman in late june arthur o sulzberger jr chairman of new york times co received a letter from a little known london based portfolio manager at morgan stanley named hassan elmasry it began mildly "i read my first copy of the new york times nearly years ago in my high school library in suburban chicago " wrote mr elmasry whose fund then owned a stake in times co "the times formed my view of the world " the letter then went on to criticize the companys performance and its management mr elmasry closed by asking to talk to mr sulzberger directly in mr sulzbergers five page response defending the timess financial performance he didnt directly acknowledge the request that rebuff set off months of heated exchanges between mr elmasry and mr sulzberger culminating in an extraordinary assault by a major wall street bank on a pre eminent newspaper company the more he was spurned the more mr elmasry escalated his attack companies across the u s are learning how to handle persistent and critical shareholders a type they once safely ignored at the times amid a historic downturn for the newspaper industry top executives and mr sulzberger in particular are getting a crash course after mr elmasry went public with his campaign morgan stanley chief executive john mack fielded calls about the times from former general electric co ceo jack welch and former american international group inc ceo maurice "hank" greenberg mr welch is leading an investor group seeking to buy the timess boston globe mr greenberg casually suggested he and mr mack work together to take over the whole company according to a person familiar with the conversation late last month for the first time mr elmasry walked into the new york times boardroom and addressed its full board including mr sulzberger that day the company also heard from another major shareholder t rowe price group inc in his presentation mr elmasry criticized the timess planned new headquarters its acquisition strategy and mr sulzbergers ill fated choice of howell raines as new york times executive editor but his main grievance was the complex structure by which the sulzberger family maintains control over the public company dislodging that setup might be an unattainable goal for mr elmasry but his campaign has nonetheless forced the board to embark on some difficult discussions it even pushed the family to consider briefly taking the publisher private james m kilts a former gillette co chairman and an accomplished deal maker joined the times board in and has taken an active role advising mr sulzberger according to people familiar with the matter in particular he has pushed the company to cut costs over time the times has made some changes not it insists in response to mr elmasrys pressure including selling tv stations and cutting options grants that would have been given to top executives catherine mathis a company spokeswoman says the times has taken many steps to improve its business performance such as launching new products finding ways to cut costs and selling assets the company has also regularly increased its dividend and bought back stock she says playing down mr elmasrys influence she says "the initiatives weve taken on are just sound business practices " in addition ms mathis says the times talks often to shareholders since march morgan stanley has met with times executives times the publisher says mr elmasry or someone from his fund has been present for at least of those meetings the times says the ochs sulzberger family one of the countrys great newspaper dynasties has owned the times since after the publisher went public in the s the family continued to exert control through its ownership of the vast majority of class b voting shares class a shareholders such as mr elmasry arent allowed to vote on many important matters relating to the company dual class structures caught on in the mid th century as families such as the grahams of washington post co sought to gain access to public capital without losing control dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal has a similar structure and is controlled by the bancroft family many regard family ownership as a way to promote journalistic excellence by insulating newsroom decisions from short term pressures but today newspapers are under direct assault as never before mostly from the internet which presents a challenge to the industrys creaky business model as newspapers struggle to maintain circulation and advertising investor confidence has plummeted so far the greatest pressure has been felt by publishers not protected by dual class structures last year an activist money manager forced knight ridder then the nations second largest publisher to put itself up for sale it was eventually acquired by mcclatchy co meanwhile tribune co owner of the chicago tribune and los angeles times has hung out a for sale sign following pressure from the chandler family a big minority shareholder mr elmasry years old the son of middle eastern immigrants to the u s went to business school at night while working at first chicago investment advisors in he joined morgan stanleys investment management division after the wall street firm acquired his then employer a firm in philadelphia two years later he moved to london and started managing the global franchise fund described by colleagues as mild mannered but intense he normally likes to keep a low profile mr elmasrys fund has registered an compound annual growth rate over the past decade in the same period the s&amp p index chalked up an growth rate based on total returns mr elmasrys fund currently manages &# billion mr sulzberger is known for his youthful demeanor enthusiasm for digital media and sympathies for the newsroom as well as his penchant for management advice books appointed chairman in mr sulzberger has worked through bouts of turmoil on the editorial side of the company some acquaintances who have seen him in recent weeks say he seems frustrated with the renewed attacks on the company this time on the business side mr elmasrys fund focuses on companies with well known household brands or patents including other family controlled companies such as cosmetics maker estee lauder cos and brown forman corp the owner of jack daniels whiskey the fund began acquiring new york times stock in the mid s even before mr elmasry took over in at the time the times was expanding its circulation nationally a strategy mr elmasry supported he felt the timess brand was strong enough to enter new markets at relatively low cost further he saw the introduction of color into the main part of the paper as an opportunity to boost ad revenue in october the times bought the half of the international herald tribune it didnt own from a reluctant washington post the times gained control of the money losing paper not long before the downturn in the newspaper industry ms mathis says the papers "performance has improved " by mr elmasry was beginning to question the companys direction it was investing in a new headquarters which he saw as a vanity project his concerns escalated in when the company announced the &# million acquisition of about com a huge database of advice and information according to a person familiar with his thinking mr elmasry worried that about com lacking an established brand could easily be surpassed by a rival product from google inc or yahoo inc weeks after the deal was announced mr elmasry called the timess vice president of corporate communications ms mathis and asked to meet with mr sulzberger according to a person familiar with the call the chairman hadnt been available on the companys quarterly earnings conference calls the usual forum for investors to talk to company executives since ms mathis responded according to this person that mr sulzberger doesnt usually meet with shareholders ms mathis says she doesnt recall the exact words she used she says the primary responsibility for meeting shareholders lies with her and the companys cfo and ceo infuriated mr elmasry wrote to the chairman directly after its benign opening his letter outlined six specific areas of concern including the timess declining circulation in the new york region and what mr elmasry called the companys weak and unfocused internet strategy capital misallocation and overly liberal option grants mr sulzberger responded about two weeks later rebutting mr elmasrys arguments point by point without addressing the investors request for a meeting responding to mr elmasrys criticism that the company had neglected its newsroom mr sulzberger wrote "while overall staffing has declined in the business and production departments both the size of the times staff and the newsroom budget have increased as we have invested in our journalism " he listed editors and reporters recruited from other high profile newsrooms cited the timess part series on class in america its coverage of iraq "where we have more reporters than any other american newspaper " its washington bureau "where we have the largest staff in the bureaus history " and the years prizes as for the timess web strategy mr sulzberger favorably compared it to that of the wall street journal where he said online revenues "were below those of nytimes com " about com "will prove to be a very good acquisition " the chairman wrote indeed about coms revenues increased an estimated in compared with the year earlier the times says a dow jones spokeswoman says "we dont know the basis for the revenue comparison " but online advertising revenue has grown at "very strong rates" in recent years as has online circulation revenue mr sulzberger defended the planned new headquarters noting that the timess existing headquarters was built in as a printing facility the costs of renovating the building for future use "were high relative to the cost of a new facility " the company had a development partner and expected to be in the new headquarters "for the next years " the only complaint mr sulzberger didnt parry related to the timess stock option grants which the chairman said "is something we will carefully evaluate " after the exchange mr elmasry and his associates contacted current and former times employees and competitors to check the funds assumptions about the times according to people who took part in some of those conversations mr elmasry seriously considered selling the funds stake but didnt hopeful he could have more influence if he got through to mr sulzberger mr elmasry had met with the companys ceo janet robinson and then cfo leonard forman but he wanted to see the chairman believing it was the sulzberger family that was driving the companys investment decisions in a second letter dated nov mr elmasry told mr sulzberger he was "baffled" by his inability to get a meeting "in over years of investing we have not yet encountered a chairman of a public company who has declined to meet with us as long standing and substantial institutional shareholders particularly after such a lengthy period of poor business and stock market performance " the letter said he raised for the first time his concern about the companys dual class share structure suggesting mr sulzberger would have had a different attitude "if we held seven million voting shares instead of non voting shares " hoping to get the boards attention mr elmasry sent the letter to every director once again mr elmasry got a response in two weeks from mr sulzberger who this time struck a frustrated tone "as you know from having met or spoken with other executives a half dozen times or so over the course of the last months we take investor communications very seriously " mr sulzberger said he and his team are happy to meet with shareholders "when we believe there will be a useful dialogue " adding that times directors represent all shareholders he closed the letter by saying "our executives remain willing to continue the discussion we have had with you " he again didnt offer to meet mr elmasry personally three months later in february mr elmasry got the response he wanted after he sent a third letter this time to class a directors copying top executives the board decided the chairman should sit down with the money manager according to a letter written to mr elmasry by the timess corporate governance officer in mid march mr elmasry and an associate met mr sulzberger ms robinson and the communications chief ms mathis in the chairmans office over coffee mr elmasry said he and other investors worried that the company would have little spare cash because of "speculative investments" like about com according to a person who was there on the timess side mr sulzberger did most of the talking occasionally handing over a question to ms robinson at one point mr elmasry picked up a copy of the companys annual report which noted the companys ownership of two tv stations in oklahoma city "why is it important to this company " asked mr elmasry according to someone who was there the question prompted a lengthy back and forth the times executives didnt understand why mr elmasry seemed so focused on a matter they considered relatively trivial mr elmasry left dissatisfied according to a person familiar with his thinking two weeks later he wrote a fourth letter again to the board again suggesting it rethink the companys share structure which he said was being "used solely to entrench family control and employment " soon after he decided to withhold his funds votes for directors at the timess annual shareholder meeting he wanted the move to be a rebuke and decided to go public he informed morgan stanleys corporate office of his plans morgan stanley is a pillar of the new york establishment as is the times the bank urged him to hire an outside public relations adviser to reduce "franchise risk " say people familiar with the matter mr elmasrys fund tapped joele frank wilkinson brimmer katcher a person new york firm that specializes in mergers and investor relations the day of the companys annual meeting morgan stanley investment management issued a news release saying it had withheld votes for directors the release also noted that the timess market value had fallen since its peak in june mr elmasry had some investor company in other parts of the newspaper business leading the way was money manager bruce sherman of legg mason inc s private capital management who had accumulated stakes in a number of publishers while mr elmasry was pressing mr sulzberger mr sherman successfully pushed knight ridder to put itself up for sale four months after he addressed its board while knight ridder didnt have a dual class structure it had long been associated with the ridder family mr sherman had also taken a stake in the times that spring he lodged his own complaints some of which echoed those of mr elmasry in several conversations with top executives although none with mr sulzberger directly facing this sudden pressure mr sulzberger asked a longtime friend investment banker and former times reporter steven rattner to advise the family on possible moves after hearing a strategic review prepared by mr sulzbergers staff mr rattner presented several ideas to the board of the family trust over the summer the most drastic was taking the company private that idea wasnt welcomed mr sulzberger and some other members of the family didnt want to be beholden to one large shareholder such as a private equity group according to people familiar with the matter instead the companys board took less dramatic actions in mid september the times said it would sell its nine tv stations the business mr sulzberger had defended to the investor just six months earlier it also announced mr sulzberger and his cousin vice chairman michael golden would give up their and grants of stock and stock options another focus of mr elmasrys criticism mr elmasry accelerated his campaign for reform of the companys dual class share structure in september he commissioned a report from davis global advisors an advisory firm for institutional investors which criticized the timess corporate governance the times commissioned its own report from the law firm wachtell lipton rosen &amp katz which concluded the opposite in november mr elmasry submitted three resolutions to the timess shareholder meeting eliminate the dual class structure separate the roles of chairman and publisher both titles are held by mr sulzberger and increase the power of class a directors the company rebuffed him saying that as a class a shareholder he didnt have the standing to submit those kinds of resolutions in january mr elmasry wrote a fifth letter addressed to directors expressing his disappointment he was invited to make a presentation which he did last month times executives say the sulzbergers wont give up the dual class structure mr elmasrys key demand such a move would have to be approved by six out of eight board members of the sulzberger family trust in a largely symbolic move the times says the sulzberger family has moved assets held in custody by morgan stanley consisting largely of times stock to another institution the family "has no intention of opening our doors to the kind of action that is tearing at the heart of some of the other great journalistic institutions in our country " ceo ms robinson told investors in december nonetheless the times is considering further moves to appease shareholders it is negotiating to lease five floors of its new headquarters which would provide annual income of more than &# million says ms mathis the times is also bracing for a rough shareholders meeting on april according to people familiar with the matter mr elmasry is almost sure to withhold his votes for directors last year he was joined by two other big holders t rowe price and private capital management according to people familiar with the matter who together withheld about of the class a votes a spokesman for private capital declines to comment brian c rogers chairman of t rowe price wouldnt comment on last years vote and says of this years "well make up our own mind in due course " how hard mr elmasry tries to rally other shareholders will depend in part on how the times reacts to his proposals in his february board presentation mr elmasry advocated making a sweeping review of all the companys assets ms mathis says that the times examines acquisitions and divestitures all the time
