railcar makers seek steady track as latest boom slows industry trains its sights on avoiding usual bust the boom times may be over for the companies that make freight cars for u s railroads but many in the industry believe it can avoid the boom and bust cycle that in past years has hurt major retailers and others heavily dependent on the u s rail system slowing home construction and auto markets softer growth in some recent months in goods shipped from overseas and intensifying competition from trucking lines in some markets have led to decelerating freight volumes that in turn is contributing to shrinking railcar order backlogs and production forecasts the worst case scenario is a rerun of when slumping sales drove some railcar parts suppliers out of business and led to a tight market for wheels and other parts once the economy rebounded this time though many analysts expect a softer landing that reflects the railroad industrys ability to absorb a freight slowdown much better than suffering trucking carriers while railcar output this year is projected to slip to from in demand is likely to remain relatively robust for the next several years experts say "its going to be a more difficult profit environment for these companies over the next year or two " said arthur hatfield an analyst at morgan keegan &amp co in memphis tenn "but its not going to be as bad as it has been in past downturns " continuing strategic shifts and external forces should help the industry recover faster than it has during previous downturns some analysts contend the ethanol boom has triggered a surge in orders for cars needed to haul raw ingredients byproducts and finished ethanol in addition railroads that squeezed huge profits from customers while the economy was chugging along are in stronger position to replace old freight cars as they wear out in the past a lack of available railcars sometimes was part of larger snarls on the u s railroad system which has also contended with growing amounts of goods traveling over constricted train routes customers of the railroads ranging from steel mills to lumber wholesalers seaports and coal fired utilities complained in past

grain cars are workhorses of the railroad industry but many are nearing the end of their natural lifespan usually to years and have taken a beating from the higher freight volumes of recent years "you
