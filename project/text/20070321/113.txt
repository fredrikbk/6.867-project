the temasek model china recently announced what could be the worlds largest investment fund with assets possibly totaling several hundred billion dollars the fund draws on the model of singapores temasek holdings a state owned investment company so its worth asking is emulating temasek such a good idea state owned investment funds have gained currency because many asian and middle eastern governments are sitting on huge foreign exchange reserves invested mostly in low yielding u s treasury bonds south korea and malaysia have already created such funds vietnam india and dubai are examining the idea the premise is that the public sector can kickstart investment outflows and invest more efficiently and productively than the private sector at face value temasek set up in as a holding company "to hold and manage the singapore governments investments in companies for the long term benefit of singapore" looks like a great success its portfolio has grown to s&# billion &# billion from s&# million &# million according to its annual review last year the company reported an total shareholder return compounded annually and measured by market value since its founding group net profit hit s&# billion last year a rise from the prior year temaseks average dividend yield to its shareholder the singapore government stands at more than which isnt shabby the trouble is most of temaseks claims have to be taken on trust under singapore law temasek isnt required to release audited financial statements under ceo ho ching temasek started doing so anyway in but the statements are limited temasek releases only consolidated accounts so cash flows between its subsidiary investments and the holding company arent detailed historical financials are provided only back to which means some claims such as that compounded shareholder return cant be independently verified that may work ok in singapore where the civil service has a reputation for clean management but chinas bureaucracy has proved to be riddled with corruption party leaders are probably attracted to the temasek model because their power rests on keeping a tight grip on information and capital how profitably and properly will an opaque chinese agency reporting to the state council manage billions of dollars without public supervision transparency aside when was the last time a government agency made better investment decisions than the private sector temasek grew out of the singapore governments wish to distance itself from the management of its various state created enterprises but since ms ho was brought in shes helped morph the company into an international investment fund with the goal of splitting its portfolio evenly among singapore asia and oecd countries does that mean that temaseks main goal has shifted from domestic industrial strategy to something more akin to private equity that raises other questions how much profit should be paid back to the government how should that money be deployed and most important who decides china might want to prop up failing state owned enterprises or hand out cash to its acquisition hungry energy companies in singapore temasek pays dividends back to the ministry of finance which is financed by singapore taxpayers yet temasek maintains that its run as a "commercial entity " if youre as confused as we are youre not alone so is the u s securities and exchange commission which were told has talked to singapore about how its government owned companies report their investments in u s listed stocks under u s law any investor that holds more than of a publicly listed stock has an obligation to reveal that position temasek may be becoming more transparent but its larger peer the government investment corp isnt as gic farms out more of its investments to outside fund managers the sec wants to ensure that gics aggregate ownership of a stock is made clear if china adopts similar practices it may come under similar u s scrutiny especially from a democratic congress itching for a fight even in singapore where public dissent about temaseks practices is rare an mp recently questioned a temasek led consortiums &# billion investment in shin corp a thai purchase that bangkoks military government is investigating for possible breach of foreign ownership laws "perhaps its a good time to take stock of the lessons learnt and to consider temaseks role in the management of singapores reserves and how its carried out " the straits times reported nominated mp eunice olsen saying "its not unreasonable for a company that manages our reserves to be more forthcoming in explaining its decisions and sharing its assessment " well said
