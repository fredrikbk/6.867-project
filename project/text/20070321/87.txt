politics &amp economics a showdown in pakistan judges suspension increases criticism of military ruler since president pervez musharraf suspended the head of pakistans supreme court earlier this month supporters of the chief justice have portrayed the move as a clash between a power hungry general and a champion of an independent legal system the issue has galvanized opposition to president musharrafs military rule amid fears he will use the unrest to postpone elections that have been promised for later this year "its a defining moment the judiciary itself is on trial " says aitzaz ahsan a defense lawyer for chief justice iftikhar mohammad chaudhry who is scheduled to appear before a judicial tribunal today to answer the governments unspecified allegations of misconduct but the spat also marks a turnaround for a judge who like many in pakistans judiciary has been anything but an enemy of president musharraf and his military regime in president musharraf forced through an amendment to pakistans constitution to permit a president also to serve as chief of the army as he has done justice chaudhry was one of the justices on the bench when the supreme court dismissed arguments that the move was unconstitutional the next year president musharraf elevated justice chaudhry to the role of chief justice pakistans judges have long proved a politically pliable lot often backing moves by military rulers to provide legal legitimacy for their role in government before president musharraf pakistan had three military leaders and the judiciary challenged none government officials say president musharraf was simply following constitutional procedures in probing complaints brought by other lawyers about justice chaudhrys conduct the government hasnt detailed its accusations a state news agency cited "misconduct and misuse of authority " the chief justice however recently had made some decisions that were politically sensitive and many judges and lawyers see the move against him as an attack on the independence of the judiciary after president musharraf came to power in a military coup his government dismissed judges who may have pointed out his unconstitutional political role according to the international crisis group a brussels based research organization justice chaudhry was named a judge in after the purge had been completed when pakistan became an independent state in its legal system was based on western civil law left behind by the british pakistan also has the federal shariat court which handles matters of islamic law "these courts have avoided confrontation with the military " said h askari rizvi a visiting professor at the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies they "are not viewed as the champions of democracy and civilian rights against authoritarianism " still mr musharrafs effort to oust the judge have brought the pakistani leader and key u s ally in the war on terrorism to the brink of another political crisis after justice chaudhry refused to resign forcing his suspension pakistani lawyers and political opposition groups took to the streets in large numbers in what some viewed less as support for the judiciary than as a protest against an effort to weaken a key institution seven judges and a deputy attorney general have reportedly resigned this week in protest "the courts can still be manipulated " said samina ahmed south asia director for the international crisis group "its the lawyers and the media that are now the watchdogs " police reacted forcefully including the storming of a television station broadcasting the protests last week president musharraf later apologized for the police action at the station more protests are planned today to coincide with the hearing by the supreme judicial council to decide whether justice chaudhry keeps his job the chief judges supporters say the ouster is politically motivated with the purpose of removing an independent minded judge who potentially wouldnt allow a possible attempt by president musharraf to retain his post of army chief which he is due to give up by years end ahead of his bid to win re election justice chaudhrys supporters also say the effort to remove him was marred by irregularities his defense lawyer mr ashan said the chief justice was summoned by president musharraf who in full military regalia "talked down to him" and demanded his resignation when he refused justice chaudhry was confined to his house for two days among justice chaudhrys recent decisions that were politically sensitive he blocked a government deal to sell a stake of state owned pakistan steel mills to a saudi russian pakistani consortium for &# million amid complaints from workers that the deal undervalued the plant he also had accepted a case of missing persons many of whom are believed to be held by pakistans intelligence agencies as part of the u s backed war on terrorism if the supreme judicial council the body in charge of hearing the case dismisses the government charges justice chaudhry can have his job back says tariq azim khan minister of state for information and broadcasting "the man is innocent until proven guilty " he said "these are mere allegations " mr ashan the defense lawyer declined to detail the charges against his client but he said they were "not entirely different" from an open letter in february from a supreme court lawyer naeem bokhari that was highly critical of justice chaudhry the letter includes charges that the chief justice has embraced the perks of his job police escorts and honor guards and privileges for his family mr bokhari couldnt immediately be reached for comment mr ashan said the charges before the hearing would be proved false
