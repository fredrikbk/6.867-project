dont cheat yourself on your taxes last minute changes in the law are helping to make an already difficult tax season one of the trickiest in recent memory accountants and lawyers warn that its especially easy this year for many people to miss key deductions and overpay their taxes one reason congress didnt act until december to extend the life of several popular tax breaks that had expired at the end of by the time congress got around to extending those provisions the internal revenue service had already sent its tax forms to the printer thus the forms dont have lines that mention deductions for state and local sales taxes higher education tuition and fees or educators classroom expenses instead you need to follow new instructions on where to claim each item some taxpayers even are confused about this years filing deadline which is tuesday april not monday april as the irs initially said in instructions and other material it sent to some taxpayers in early january these are only a few of the new twists confronting taxpayers this year already millions of people who filed early made a mistake many of them say irs officials didnt claim a new one time telephone excise tax refund some people who did remember to claim it probably could have claimed more than they did simply by doing more homework other people claimed far more than they were entitled to lawmakers also approved a spate of other changes last year that will mean higher taxes for many people for example lawmakers expanded the reach of the so called kiddie tax and raised taxes on many americans living and working abroad in addition more americans have been ensnared in recent years by the alternative minimum tax a parallel tax system designed originally to prevent a small number of high income people from avoiding paying any taxes the treasury department estimates about four million people were hit by the amt for and more than million will be hit this year unless congress overhauls the law here are some of the major changes awaiting taxpayers this year and what to do about them sales tax deduction if you itemize your deductions as most upper income taxpayers do you can deduct your state and local sales taxes instead of your state and local income taxes this is an especially important option for many people in florida texas washington and other states that dont have a state income tax but many people who live in other states claim the sales tax deduction too an estimated million taxpayers took this deduction for deducting &# billion a new irs publication says this year because congress took so long to extend this option you should deduct sales taxes on schedule a line five even though its marked "state and local income taxes " the irs says write "st" on the dotted line to the left of that line higher education tuition and fees deduction this deduction which also was revived by congress in december allows up to &# of tuition and fees paid to a postsecondary institution claim it on form line even though that line says "domestic production activities deduction " write "t" in the blank space to the left of that line entry if youre claiming the tuition and fees deduction write "b" if youre claiming both this and the domestic production activities deduction if you enter b attach a breakdown showing the amounts for each about million taxpayers took this deduction for deducting &# billion phone tax refund look for a new one time line on your return for a phone excise tax on long distance and bundled service on form its line "credit for federal telephone excise tax paid " the government stopped collecting this tax last year after losing several court cases in general youre eligible if you paid for long distance or bundled phone service billed anytime from march through july most of the million regular returns expected this year should be eligible says irs spokesman eric smith but about three out of returns received through march didnt request it he says while some filers may not have been eligible "many others almost certainly were " this is "the most common source of errors" by taxpayers this year he says fix errors by filing an amended return on form x there are two ways to calculate the amount the easy way is to use the standard amount allowed by the irs ranging between &# and &# depending on the total number of exemptions on your return for but consider the other option you can base your claim on the amount of excise taxes you actually paid assuming you kept good records and attach form in many cases that will be a larger amount for example don weigandt a managing director of j p morgan private bank in los angeles a unit of j p morgan chase &amp co went through old phone bills and calculated he actually paid &# he plans to deduct that amount plus interest caution this can be complex and time consuming for details see the irs web site www irs gov donations from iras under a law enacted last year someone or older could arrange to transfer as much as &# directly from an individual retirement account to a qualified charity without getting taxed on that money that transfer counts toward your required minimum distribution this law was effective for and its available again for charities are urging congress to make this provision permanent kiddie tax thanks to another change enacted last year a childs investment income may be subject to tax at the parents rate if the kid was under age by the end of and had investment income of more than &# previously the rule applied to kids under for details see publication expatriate taxes among those affected by a new law enacted last may are upper income americans living and working abroad in places with high housing costs and low taxes such as hong kong and whose employers dont offer tax protection plans the law which affects taxes on housing allowances as well as pay is retroactive to the start of the treasury has since issued important details on housing allowances this area can be so tricky and counterintuitive that expats should consider consulting with an expert the impact can vary widely depending on where youre working filing deadline usually the filing date is april but that date falls on a sunday this year the following day is a legal holiday in washington d c however so the irs announced in january that the deadline this year would be tuesday april the irs says it "became aware of the interaction" of the national filing due date and the local observance of the new "emancipation day" holiday after most of its forms and publications had gone to print any irs forms instructions or publications that show an april due date should now be read as april the irs says educators classroom expenses this provision also extended by congress in december enables teachers and other educators in primary and secondary schools to deduct up to &# apiece of out of pocket expenses for classroom supplies such as books or chalk this year youre supposed to claim it on form s line or on form nr line even though its marked "archer msa deduction " write "e" on the dotted line to the left of that line entry or write "b" if youre claiming both this and the archer medical savings account deduction if you enter "b " attach a breakdown showing amounts for each treasury interest this isnt a new point but its a crucial one remember that interest on treasury securities bills notes and bonds is taxable at the federal level but not at the state and local level check your state and local return to make sure you didnt overlook this point wrong social security numbers aside from the phone tax refund the most common errors involve wrong social security numbers an irs spokesman says "you would be surprised how frequently" taxpayers and their preparers make mistakes in this area he says double check your return before firing it off state tax revenues show "worrisome signs " a new report says state tax
