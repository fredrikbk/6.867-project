tall order for starbucks investors seek reassurance on brands buzz as competition circles like a bad cup of coffee starbucks corp s stock may have left a bitter taste in some investors mouths but the coffee chains shares off about since their week high in mid november amid a drumbeat of concerns over weaker sales and a leaked in house missive may have more perk in them than some investors realize at starbuckss annual meeting scheduled for today in seattle executives plan to reaffirm the companys growth plans and shed light on their vision for the future that usually wouldnt mean much to the companys investors who have been accustomed to rapid growth and rising shares but this year is different ever since a frank memo questioning starbuckss business model from chairman howard schultz surfaced last month investors have been worried that starbuckss rapid growth could be in danger of cooling in the memo mr schultz the resident visionary warned starbucks executives that the push for efficiency may be diluting the brand and has made the company more vulnerable to encroachment from fast food chains and other competitors that stoked fears that starbuckss biggest asset the strength of its brand may be in danger "people want to be reassured that there is not a brand problem " says ubs analyst david palmer part of what has always driven starbuckss stock is the magic surrounding its brand led by mr shultzs cheerleading and investors are sure to get a dose of that at todays meeting last year mr schultz and chief executive jim donald mixed homespun anecdotes with financial charts showing the companys rapid growth before crooner tony bennett appeared on stage for a surprise performance "to the degree that people need to see confidence from howard " mr palmer said "we believe that they will see it " over the past two quarters the companys typically breakneck sales growth has softened slightly starbuckss costs have risen in part because the company gave store workers a wage increase and the companys heavy investments to open in new markets overseas have yet to yield rewards for shareholders a further question is that posed by growing coffee competitors mcdonalds corp and dunkin brands inc s dunkin donuts chain but analysts say investors may be overly focused on those negatives they point out that when the stock slides starbucks often buys back chunks of shares which can help boost the price by reducing the number of shares outstanding some analysts expect starbuckss profit margin pressures will ease in the second half of the year and that new initiatives such as hot breakfast sandwiches will drive up sales at stores open at least a year so called same store sales when starbucks reports fiscal second quarter results in may "were proud of what weve accomplished thus far and we intend to continue to deliver strong financial performance " mr donald said through a spokeswoman even when starbuckss stock declines few investors would call it cheap since going public in starbucks has become one of the best performing big company stocks with strong growth potential thanks to the companys consistent ability to deliver same store sales growth beyond its own targets and create an expanding market for lattes and cappuccinos the stock currently trades at about times expected per share earnings for the current fiscal year ending sept according to thomson financial while that may seem pricey compared to mcdonalds with a p e of several analysts who follow starbucks call it a bargain goldman sachs analyst steven t kron last week added starbucks to his "conviction buy list" and told investors that "valuation is cheap at new lows by historical standards " ubss mr palmer also says it is a good time for investors to buy the stock given its valuation messrs kron and palmer dont own shares of starbucks though their firms have done banking work for the coffee chain mr kron says that given starbuckss pattern of share buybacks he expects the company to report a significant reduction in share count when it releases its next quarterly earnings in may and that investors should get in before the stock gets expensive the last time shares were down at these levels in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended oct the company repurchased million shares for &# million starbucks shares added cents to &# each in p m composite trading on the nasdaq stock market yesterday it may be difficult for starbucks to post high same store sales growth during the current quarter since it is up against a comparison from last year but analysts point out that there are new drivers that will help boost sales during the quarter like the addition of hot breakfast sandwiches and more gift card redemptions stemming from the holidays a price increase that took effect last fall also should fatten the sales number people close to the company say theyre surprised mr shultzs memo garnered so much attention and alarm they say mr schultz who built the chain into the coffee empire that it is today often sends impassioned messages to management to keep them on their toes and that this one shouldnt indicate an unusual level of concern one big wild card is whether mcdonalds addition of espresso drinks at some stores will eat into starbuckss sales mr palmer believes it could do the opposite given that the introduction of lattes at chains like dunkin donuts increased awareness of the drinks analysts have said dunkin donutss introduction of espresso drinks didnt eat into starbuckss sales in response to any possible competitive threat starbucks argues that the ambiance and personalized service in its cafes sets it apart from competitors
