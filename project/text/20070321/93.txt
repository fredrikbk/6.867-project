sandisk hopes to ride success of its flash chip sandisk corp s shares have been beaten down but wall street appears to be looking beyond the bruises and welts in the past five months the volatile stock has tumbled tracking the sinking price of the nand flash memory chips the company makes for mp music players and digital cameras during the last few weeks the shares have risen from an intraday week low of &# to around &# the tentative recovery comes as nand chip pricing shows signs of stabilizing investors also are excited about promising new uses for nand memory replacing the disk drives inside laptop computers and providing the memory for apple inc s new iphone indeed sandisk is a company with lots of potential the low cost producer in a rapidly expanding &# billion market the milpitas calif high tech company is riding the wave of digitalization around the world music players such as apples ipod are hot products as people download digital music over the internet flash cards for digital cameras sold better than expected last year and sales of similar slide in cards for cellphones are increasing smartly sandisk shows no signs of slowing the expansion of its manufacturing plants despite the industrywide overproduction that led prices down roughly since early december to adjust to the declines the company cut prices of its retail and original equipment manufacturer or oem products trimmed its work force by as much as and reduced salaries for executives with the market looking more stable better times could be ahead "we have seen signs of prices leveling out " says judy bruner sandisks chief financial officer "perhaps by the second half of the year the market could be in an undersupply situation " some analysts say they noticed stable prices for nand chips since early february when eight gigabit chips leveled out at below &# a piece down from more than &# in december overall nand flash prices could be down for the year says alan niebel chief executive of the research firm web feet research of monterey calif but most of the decline may have taken place the stability if it lasts would be good news for sandisk and other memory producers such as samsung electronics co micron technology inc intel corp and hynix semiconductor inc anticipating an improved environment ubs analyst alex gauna has lifted his rating on sandisk to "buy" from "neutral " "i kind of doubt well see sharp price declines in the next several months" similar to the ones the industry saw in december and january says michael sadler a vice president at micron yet "we continue to be in a state of oversupply " and micron is shifting modest amounts of nand production to dynamic random access memory or dram at its manassas va plant and to complementary metal oxide semiconductors or cmos sensors chips that measure the intensity of light at its idaho plant mr sadler says sandisks decision to keep its foot on the manufacturing pedal despite the oversupply appears to make sense for the company executives say demand for nand in their usb storage drives mp players and other products continues to outstrip their ability to make the chips demand should be up more than this year not far from the extraordinary rise in they say "at under &# a share i think that sandisk has bottomed out " asserts ruben roy an analyst at pacific crest securities with a price earnings ratio of compared with for intel and for micron the stock isnt inexpensive news about sandisk should be more positive than earlier in the year mr roy says one piece of positive news for sandisk is the interest computer makers have shown in using nand based memory in notebooks the price declines this year make nand a more attractive alternative to lower cost disk drives greg rhine senior vice president at sandisk says industry projections forecasting that between one million and two million notebooks will sell this year with nand flash are reasonable sales should jump from there by as many as million notebooks could be made with nand or about of the market the price drop is "driving a lot more applications into the market sooner than they would have been" expected explains shawn sackman director of marketing at intel "a while back i would have said " for nand flash in personal computers "now i would say the second half of " says mr sackman some analysts suggest caution "i think and will be educational years" for the nand computer market says joe unsworth a principal analyst at research firm gartner inc volumes wont rise until after that but even then cost differences could remain significant by mr unsworth estimates a gigabyte disk drive will cost the same as a gigabyte nand drive largely limiting the selection of flash chips to ultraportable machines where its compact size is worth the price to be competitive in the broader notebook market the price of nand needs to drop further both a boon and a bane for the industry each price decline increases the attractiveness of nand flash but it also puts pressure on profits and margins to some the recent ascent in sandisk shares may be premature the company could have several more difficult months before sales surge with the back to school and end of year holiday seasons "we think pricing will be under continued pressure for the first half of the year " says mr unsworth "i think it will go lower over the next couple months "
