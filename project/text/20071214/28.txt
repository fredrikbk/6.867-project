a las vegas casino operator and most recently a chunk of sony corp part of dubais deal making is financed by debt in an emailed response to questions a dubai government spokesman said the emirates debt load is "very moderate" by international standards and the debt raised by dubai entities "has all been in their capacity as leading international players that are successfully expanding in a number of profitable markets " dubai united arab emirates dubai is on a spending spree and financial analysts are starting to wonder about the amount of debt the city state is racking up its oil production is dwindling and its debt load is four times the average among other persian gulf states credit rating companies are asking for more information to determine how sound the government really is "from published documents it is difficult to get a picture of the complete financial situation " said standard &amp poors analyst farouk soussa "the transparency isnt good " one of seven emirates making up the united arab emirates dubai like other middle east governments has been on a deal making binge companies owned or backed by the government have signed agreements or made plays for billions of dollars in assets this year including stakes in american and european stock exchanges a las vegas casino operator and most recently a chunk of sony corp part of dubais deal making is financed by debt at the same time other dubai entities have launched expansion plans relying on public borrowing nakheel a government controlled company building a giant palm tree shaped island development placed &# million in bonds this month to finance its plans government owned jebel ali free zone recently listed billion dirham &# billion of bonds moodys investors service fitch ratings and standard &amp poors ratings services are handing out credit ratings to many of these government backed companies and they are starting to ask for more disclosure from the emirate which they assume will bail out the companies if they get into a jam "the rapid economic development of dubai is certainly being accompanied by increased levels of leverage from companies that are closely associated with the government " said tristan cooper a moodys analyst in dubai "without a clearer picture of the overall financial position of the central government and the broader public sector " investors could become more cautious the situation highlights a broader issue many of the worlds governments and the companies they control are notoriously opaque especially in the middle east but big regional investors like qatar kuwait and abu dhabi also part of the u a e have big hydrocarbon reserves to back up their deals production can be relatively easy to estimate from public figures dubais reserves have been shrinking for years dubai also has taken a more complex approach to investing overseas most other deal making countries have used massive investment authorities to pursue their deals the abu dhabi investment authority for instance bought a &# billion stake in citigroup inc last month in contrast dubais ruler sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum has entrusted a cadre of lieutenants to run his own and his governments business interests they often compete with one another and hunt for deals independently but they all ultimately answer to sheik mohammed the government association has helped a handful of dubai corporate entities get high credit ratings the assumption is that sheikh mohammed or his government will come to the rescue in a pinch and if dubai gets overextended analysts expect the emirates much richer cousins in abu dhabi will lend a hand abu dhabi is the capital of the u a e and its ruler is the countrys president sheikh mohammed is prime minister moodys recently gave one of its highest corporate ratings a to government controlled difc investments llc difc owns a stake in borse dubai the holding company that recently agreed to acquire nordic exchange omx ab

dubai is likely to provide in a distress situation " this year s&amp p rated dubai holding commercial operations group llc single a plus citing "strong implicit support from the emirate of dubai " sheikh mohammed owns the entitys parent dubai holding a dubai holding subsidiary recently bought the sony stake the trouble with these corporate ratings is that without more disclosure it is difficult to evaluate the financial soundness of these entities and the government backing them as its oil supplies dwindle dubai has diversified its economy into financial services tourism and real estate development among other pursuits those revenue streams and their underlying assets are difficult to pin down without access to government books in an emailed response to questions a dubai government spokesman said the emirates debt load is "very moderate" by international standards and the debt raised by dubai entities "has all been in their capacity as leading international players that are successfully expanding in a number of profitable markets " he said dubai is in the process of obtaining a rating on its sovereign or government debt such a rating gauges a governments ability to pay back its borrowing and it is used to price publicly sold debt s&amp p credit analysts estimate dubais debt relative to gross domestic product is about compared with the u s where gross debt stands at more than of gdp according to the international monetary fund that isnt bad but in abu dhabi debt is equal to just of gdp analysts think dubais assets including real estate aviation and tourism interests and taxes far outweigh its debt but they would like to know more of course credit rating companies have another motivation in most cases they are paid to rate the creditworthiness of firms and governments and the big three firms are eager for clients like the government of dubai
