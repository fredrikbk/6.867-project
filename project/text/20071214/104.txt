weekend journal review television dizzy from the view off at her corner of the table meanwhile co host sherri shepherd stand up comic actor and born again christian sat seething as this discourse on early childhood development and the transgender child progressed for all their alertness to world events at least to the basic facts thereof the co hosts of "the view" have lately exhibited a striking capacity for blindness it was a characteristic episode of "the view" monday through friday a m noon est on abc the kind that is in which the most prosaic of conversations takes a sudden lurch toward the abyss the calm ruminations that had begun last week on the subject of childrens gifts boys were now getting toy kitchens had without warning begun rocketing off to the wild beyond not that this was altogether unpredictable the conversation had after all moved on from toy kitchens to the case of a little boy who liked putting a princess dress on during dress up play at his pre school hearing this barbara walters looked somber "the views co creator noted that she had only recently done a very important special on transgender children the childs love of the princess dress should have been reported to the parents ms walters maintained a comment that didnt go down entirely well with the panel whoopi goldberg for one responded that a child that age might just have thought the dress was fun ms walters unmoved darkly noted "transgender children very often know by two " off at her corner of the table meanwhile co host sherri shepherd stand up comic actor and born again christian sat seething as this discourse on early childhood development and the transgender child progressed she had just one thing on her mind namely what shed do if some teacher let her son put a dress on what if a concerned barbara walters asked she had a transgender child "when you get to and you want to wear a dress and you get out of the house you can put a dress on " came the answer eliciting loud applause from the studio audience further what if questions along the same lines yielded roughly the same if increasingly emphatic answers "you know what hes my son im his mother he will not be wearing a dress " ms shepherd said and what ms walters asked if her son grew up to be gay even this question didnt put an end to the dress issue what if you were in scotland where they wear kilts another panelist earnestly asked "well we dont live in scotland we live here " the conversation was headed to its otherworldly mode there would be more on the kilt question notably from co host joy behar a former schoolteacher determined to extract an answer from ms shepherd about this other society scotland where men wore skirts ms shepherds answer not in my house remained firm but the tone was now more agitated the best thing now clearly would be a change of subject something that never comes easily once these conversations start on their inexorable drive toward hell the only way out is the commercial break which finally arrived though evidently not soon enough for ms goldberg the shows otherwise unflinching new moderator it had been an exchange both riveting and unnerving to watch the kind that gives the show now in its th season its life force and also its notoriety the shows strength owes something to the length of its colloquies the argumentation that can run on and on exposing raw nerves and deeply held attitudes which isnt to underestimate its celebrity obsession and show business side its parade of famous or famous enough guest stars its gossip mode wednesdays "view" began with a story about a mcdonalds in london that required customers to depart the premises as soon as they finished eating then moved on to the matter of george bushs decision to quit drinking years ago and ms behars confident assertion that the president was once an alcoholic and must still consider himself one a view that unmistakably irritated the rest of the panel as well as the guest star country singer sara evans on from there to britney spears who they alleged was addicted to frappuccinos "if you drank five frappuccinos a day youd drop your baby too " ms shepherd opined for all their alertness to world events at least to the basic facts thereof the co hosts of "the view" have lately exhibited a striking capacity for blindness when it came to the infamous case of the british schoolteacher threatened with prison and lashing in sudan because she accepted her young pupils choice of the name muhammad for their teddy bear no panelist could find a word of sympathy ms goldberg and ms shepherd indeed made clear their views that the teacher had only herself to blame for her deficiencies in sensitivity and cultural awareness "its just one of the reasons were called the ugly americans " noted ms goldberg for whom the british nationality of the teacher in question was apparently irrelevant ms shepherd agreed noting in addition that naming a stuffed toy muhammad was sacrilegious about the ugliness of culture norms resulting in threats of lashing or months in prison and sudanese mobs screaming for a punishment of death for a teacher on the fantastic grounds charged they had evidently no objections to make this response in which the perpetrators of murderous zealotry escape all judgment while their hapless victim is dismissed sniffily as a typically western cultural barbarian ranks among the bleaker mysteries of "the view " the word "mystery" doesnt quite apply to ms walterss " " interview last march with venezuelas hugo chavez a pilgrimage from which she returned with the news that he was "a very dignified man " "a very passionate man " ah yes "passionate " theres no higher accolade in the culture of our times this passionate and dignified man who has described the president of the united states as a donkey a liar a coward and murderer and in a speech at the united nations called him the devil was ms walters told press interviewers also a " very intelligent man " further she argued "we have a tendency when we dont understand someone to automatically think theyre crazy " the word mystery doesnt apply to any of this because all was perfectly clear mr chavez was the newest and biggest political star in the eyes of hollywoods most enlightened and progressive luminaries kevin spacey sean penn etc his chief distinction being the virulence of his enmity to the u s on "the view" last week ms walters announced that she had chosen the venezuelan leader for her most fascinating people list but clearly the bloom was off this particular media romance with noteworthy economy she mentioned that mr chavez was on her list because "hes charismatic " it has been some time now since rosie odonnells battles on the show were the stuff of daily press bulletins for all its wallowing in received opinion and its strange moments the lecture on that british schoolteacher in the sudan say "the view" exudes an appealing vitality now thanks largely to whoopi goldberg the first and only source of real comedic skill ever to land a place there she is in short the best thing thats ever happened to "the view " this may not be saying a lot given the shows tribulations over the years but dont let that spoil the fun
