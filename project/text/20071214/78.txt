agreed to put more than &# million into a chinese media company this fall the investor group didnt include one of yucaipas high profile partners former president bill clinton the absence of mr clinton from yucaipas investment in xinhua finance media ltd appears to be the first tangible sign of a parting in the much followed five year old business relationship between messrs clinton and burkle mr clinton has been a senior adviser at yucaipa and also had a financial interest in certain investments there but this week mr clinton indicated he plans to curtail his ties to yucaipa should his wife hillary clinton win the democratic presidential nomination this follows a disclosure by the clintons in june that they had sold millions of dollars of stocks to avoid situations like the one that a china related investment might raise that could pose problems for mrs clintons campaign this week in response to a report that a breakup between messrs clinton and burkle had already occurred a clinton spokesman said the former president hadnt severed his ties to yucaipa but the spokesman said there would be an "appropriate transition" of mr clintons yucaipa investment if mrs clinton becomes her partys candidate as part of his yucaipa arrangement mr clinton has had the right to opt out of individual investments and he chose not to participate in the xinhua deal said a person familiar with
