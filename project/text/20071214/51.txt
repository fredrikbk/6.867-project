kung fu monks dont get a kick out of fighting famous temple spurns beijing games sparking trash talk from rivals dechao and most of the other martial monks at the year old shaolin temple in chinas central henan province decline to join in one of the biggest kung fu battles of modern times a competition to be staged in tandem with next years olympic games in beijing at the international wushu federations ninth world wushu championships in beijing last month fighter zhang yong entered the ring to chants of "go for it china " he won the gold medal in the kilogram pound combat competition by striking his russian opponent with a fierce combination of kicks and punches at one point flipping the russian into the air kung fu master shi dechao can swing his pound "monks spade " an ancient chinese shovel like a majorette twirling a baton his lightning punches in a style the ancients called iron fist generate a thunk straight out of kung fu movie sound effects a powerful grunt punctuates his routine but dechao and most of the other martial monks at the year old shaolin temple in chinas central henan province decline to join in one of the biggest kung fu battles of modern times a competition to be staged in tandem with next years olympic games in beijing clad in saffron buddhist robes dechao insists that real kung fu monks dont fight they meditate and practice kung fu to reach enlightenment "every fist contains my love " says the year old dechao also known as big beard the shaolin temples decision to stay out of the competition to be held at the same time as the olympics and passing out medals of its own made headlines in china and it has rekindled a disagreement familiar from the movies is kung fu a form of devotion a style of fighting or both zen buddhism and kung fu have long made an unlikely pair as legend has it zens founder an indian missionary to china named bodhidharma worried that too much seated meditation would make monks flabby so he taught the monks in shaolin a set of exercises codified as "yi jin jing " or "muscle change instruction " many of them based on animal movements "kung fu is zen practice in motion " says shi yongxin the abbot of shaolin sitting in his office next to a sculpture of a meditating buddha when he moved to the temple from a devoutly buddhist family in yongxin learned to add kung fu moves to his meditation over the centuries the otherwise peaceful monks have occasionally used their physical prowess in battle to defend the temple and its allies but they didnt always like it in lore the monks went to battle only when they were facing a life or death crisis and had no alternative now a debate over the olympics has transported the classic kung fu monks fight or pray dilemma to the st century for the games the chinese have backed a committee regulated version of kung fu split into two competitions one dubbed taolu is a sort of rhythmic gymnastics in fast forward individual athletes are scored on the "power harmony rhythm style and musical accompaniment" of their routines which have names such as lotus kick and dragons dive to the ground a second form of kung fu competition called sanshou involves fighting and a fair amount of protective padding kung fu itself is also known as wushu at the international wushu federations ninth world wushu championships in beijing last month fighter zhang yong entered the ring to chants of "go for it china " he won the gold medal in the kilogram pound combat competition by striking his russian opponent with a fierce combination of kicks and punches at one point flipping the russian into the air "sometimes i get hurt during the training " says the year old mr zhang a muslim pointing to a scab on his right eyebrow yet "wushu is something that starts with fighting and ends with spirit " he says "this spirit isnt a religious concept but rather love to the nation " to the monk dechao the spirit or qi in shaolin buddhism is embodied in breathing not force "i can practice kung fu internally while drinking tea quietly with my friends " he says after the abbot publicly distanced shaolin from the olympics in october chinese bloggers and athletes began to suggest the monks are just scared they wouldnt win at the competition athletes said their sport was simply not comparable to shaolin meditation "we are the best wushu competitors " says ma lingjuan the year old chinese world champion in taolu she has been practicing spinning and jabbing a spear since she was "our goal is the medal " she says "the monks in the temple do it as a hobby " yongxin the abbot says monks practice kung fu "with an understanding of zen buddhism and love of the temple on the other hand the athletes use wushu as a way to find honor it is easy to tell which one is more sustainable and deep " whether with blows or rhetoric it seems everybody is kung fu fighting the governments efforts to standardize the diverse practice of kung fu were also designed to control it after chinas revolution the communist party at first promoted martial arts but eventually grew leery of kung fu as a subversive self defense practice during the cultural revolution of the s and s the red guards attacked the shaolin temple and other religious orders by the early s after centuries of unbroken master to student lineage only a dozen or so monks lived at shaolin outside the temple though traditional kung fu schools not all of them associated with buddhism thrived in the s and s a blizzard of "chopsocky" tv shows and films such as the jet li film "shaolin temple " helped to sear the buddhist legends into the popular imagination both in china and abroad the s american tv show "kung fu" featured david carradine as kwai chang caine a shaolin monk who travels through the old west armed only with his kung fu in flashback scenes to the temple his master teaches him to "avoid rather than check check rather than hurt hurt rather than maim maim rather than kill " today kung fu is practiced by more than million chinese and millions more around the world and its purpose remains a topic of debate "the shaolin temple is only a building " says kang gewu the secretary general of the chinese wushu association he points out that martial arts had existed in china for centuries before the shaolin temple began practicing kung fu he adds "in our mind wushu is a sport not a religious practice " it can be both the town around shaolin is home to dozens of wushu schools some employing monks from the temple who accept as students both the spiritually and competitively inclined "shaolin is a meeting place of paradox tourism zen military sports communism martial arts history " says gene ching the associate publisher of kung fu tai chi magazine in california he thinks the debate between the monks and the athletes over spiritual affairs is "fairly artificial " for the temple maintaining its image as the capital of kung fu is about both expanding its reach and paying its bills yongxin who has been dubbed the "ceo abbot" in the press has installed a spectacle of his own a one hour stage show featuring music by "crouching tiger hidden dragon" composer tan dun and the kung fu skills of hundreds of back flipping students tickets cost &# even as he distances himself from olympic competition "the abbot keeps this stereotype alive that kung fu is about fighting " says justin guariglia a photographer who spent several years getting to know the monks and recently published a book "shaolin temple of zen " the "real monks " he notes are kept far away from the tourists the abbot periodically checking his cellphone during an interview said the temple doesnt actually make that much money from the tourist activities "what we have done is spread buddhism and its spirit of universal love " he said another monk at shaolin named bodhidharma after the indian missionary dismisses suggestions that the monks dont want to play because they are afraid they would lose "oh lord " laughs bodhidharma who lives in malaysia and visits the temple to meditate from time to time "monks have a very kind and patient heart we could win that but we dont want to hurt anybody " sue
