the gospel of paul yes the paul campaign with its call to bring the troops home is also profiting as the one landing pad in the gop race for those republicans and independents unhappy with the iraq war ron paul is no compassionate conservative his supporters love him for it if theres been a phenomenon in this republican presidential race its been the strength of a fiery doctor from texas and his message of limited government as the gop front runners address crowds of dispirited primary voters mr paul has been tearing across the country leaving a trail of passionate devotees in his wake paul rallies heave with voters waving placards and shouting "liberty liberty " money is pouring in from tens of thousands of individual donors so much cash that the term congressman recently admitted he wasnt sure he could spend it all a fund raising event on guy fawkes day in tribute to mr pauls rebel persona netted his campaign &# million the biggest one day haul of any gop candidate ever he continues to inch up in the early primary polls and even bests fred thompson in new hampshire mr paul isnt going to be president he trails in national polls in no small part because his lack of a proactive foreign policy makes him an unserious candidate in todays terror world but his success still holds lessons for the leading republican candidates as well as those pundits falling for the argument that the future of the gop rests in a "heroic conservatism" that embraces big government mr paul shows that the way to many republican voters hearts is still through a spirited belief in lower taxes and smaller government with more state and individual rights it helps too if voters know you mean it in nearly years in the house mr paul can boast he never voted for a tax hike nicknamed "dr no " he spent much of the time republicans held a majority voting against his own party on the grounds that the legislation his colleagues were trying to pass sarbanes oxley new auto mileage standards a ban on internet gambling wasnt expressly authorized by the constitution he returns a portion of his annual congressional budget to the u s treasury on principle on the stump mr paul whips up crowds with his libertarian talk of "less taxation less regulation a better economic system " while mitt romney explains his support of no child left behind mr paul gets standing ovations by promising to eliminate the department of education rudy giuliani toys with reducing marginal rates mr paul gets whoops with his dream to ax the income tax and by extension the irs mike huckabee lectures on the need for more government subsidized clean energy mr paul brings cheers with his motto that environmental problems are best solved with stronger property rights his rhetoric is based on first principles carefully connecting his policies to the goals of liberty and freedom and it fires up the base yes the paul campaign with its call to bring the troops home is also profiting as the one landing pad in the gop race for those republicans and independents unhappy with the iraq war mr pauls insistence that he isnt an "isolationist" so much as a "non interventionist" who rejects nation building has also won him voters who might otherwise have been wary of his passive foreign policy still its mr pauls small government message that has defined him over the years winning him election after election in texas well before iraq was a question his appeal has only grown too over seven years of a bush presidency that has moved the party away from its limited government roots "compassionate conservatism" was a smart move on george w bushs part maybe even necessary to win the gop was dogged by a reputation as the heartless party amplified by the government shutdown and the clunky dole campaign and it had learned from the success of welfare reform that message matters many republican voters believed mr bushs "compassionate conservatism" was just that a way of selling conservative reforms tax cuts would help the working poor vouchers would help minority kids charities would fare better getting people off drugs than government bureaucrats mr bush got his tax cuts but voters found out too late that he was no small government believer school vouchers were traded away for more education dollars a new medicare drug entitlement has added trillions to the burden on future taxpayers government directed energy policy is larded with handouts to political patrons in the corn and ethanol lobbies a lack of budget discipline encouraged a republican congress to go spend crazy stuffing bills with porky earmarks much of this was simply a republican majority that had lost its way but at least some of it was promoted by bush advisers who specifically argued that "compassionate conservatism" was in fact a license to embrace government so long as government was promoting republican ideals that idea has become even more vogue with a wing of the party now arguing that the small government libertarianism that has defined the republican party since goldwater is not only immoral but an election loser former bush speechwriter michaels gersons new book "heroic conservatism " calls on republicans to give in to big government and co opt the tools of state for their own purposes "if republicans run in future elections with a simplistic anti government message ignoring the poor the addicted and children at risk they will lose and they will deserve to lose " he writes then again republicans have already been losing and losing big in no small part because theyve taken mr gersons advice the men vying to lead the republican party might instead make a study of mr paul one shame of this race is that for all the enthusiasm the texan has generated among voters he hasnt managed to pressure the front runners toward his positions his more kooky views say his belief in a conspiracy to create a "north american union" and his violent antiwar talk have allowed the other aspirants to dismiss him they shouldnt dismiss the passion hes tapped if mr paul has shown anything its that many conservative voters continue to doubt theres anything "heroic" or "compassionate" in a ballooning government that sucks up their dollars to aid a dysfunctional state when mr paul gracefully exits this race his followers will be looking for an alternative to take up that cause any takers
