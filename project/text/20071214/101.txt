weekend journal hollywood report strike thickens the plot at sundance with projects in limbo demand likely to rise for the festivals films "little miss sunshine " which garnered two academy awards and an oscar nomination for best picture was acquired at sundance in by fox searchlight a specialty unit of news corp s twentieth century fox the sundance film festival is still more than five weeks away but director stacy peralta is hearing from movie executives eager for a sneak peek at his latest work a gang documentary "made in america " mr peralta has already received such calls an unusually high number for a documentary this far in advance "i was very surprised " mr peralta says "gracefully we say look wed like to show you the movie but were holding our cards close until sundance which is a risk were taking as well " maybe this year not so big a risk thats because of the six week old strike by film and tv writers who belong to the writers guild of america the walkout has stopped the flow of new scripts coming into hollywood and is pressuring the studios to stock up on films of all kinds in case the strike drags out long enough to impact the production of new movies that seems increasingly possible given the talks rancorous impasse so the film industry is focusing harder than ever on sundance the year old annual film festival in park city utah which begins on jan the source of many hits including last years award winning "little miss sunshine " sundance has emerged as an important marketplace for independent filmmakers like mr peralta to find distribution for their work this years selection includes a twisted comedy about hitmen by an irish writer known for his blood soaked plays an adaptation of a michael chabon novel about young love and a comedy directed by barry levinson starring robert de niro as a film producer who finds his career on the wane though the major studios and their smaller specialty labels that release more modest independent fare say theyve plenty of movies to weather any strike that lasts into the new year many industry executives expect fiercer bidding wars to erupt over a handful of new films indeed buying a completed film at sundance even for multimillions of dollars could be safer and cheaper than creating a film from scratch especially with no writers around to tweak an existing script "if there is a movie that shows up at sundance that really feels like a slam dunk its going to sell for even more this year no question " says producer michael london whose past credits include the oenophiles delight "sideways" and last years thriller "the illusionist " he has three films screening at sundance including the chabon adaptation "the mysteries of pittsburgh " "the five must have movies will go for stratospheric prices and a variety of other movies will get smaller deals but probably higher prices than in the past " agrees mark gill a longtime studio executive who now runs a new film finance and production company the film department geoffrey gilmore festival director says that sundance is one of the "last pure acquisition marketplaces out there " unlike septembers annual toronto international film festival which studios largely use to launch movies they already own and are about to open only or so of the films being screened at sundance have distribution deals according to festival officials among them the festivals opening night picture "in bruges " playwright martin mcdonaghs tale of two hitmen on vacation in belgium starring colin farrell and ralph fiennes but finding breakout hits at sundance especially in the commercial sense is art not science "little miss sunshine " which garnered two academy awards and an oscar nomination for best picture was acquired at sundance in by fox searchlight a specialty unit of news corp s twentieth century fox the studio reportedly paid nearly &# million for the film at the festival a price never before seen for a movie at sundance but the gamble paid off world wide "sunshine" brought in &# million in theaters and was a big hit on dvd this year searchlight bought four films including "waitress " starring keri russell and "once " a love story set to music that was made for about &# the movie went on to gross &# million in only u s theaters over about seven months officials from searchlight declined to comment on sundance industry and festival officials agree that finding the next "sunshine" isnt easy in a normal year let alone one that could see prices being driven up by studios hungry for finished product past breakouts include the films "napoleon dynamite" and "garden state" and s "the blair witch project " mr gilmore says "there wasnt anyone at last years festival who was talking about once or waitress before the festival started " indeed much of the so called buzz is generated by the folks hoping to sell their movies at sundance so filtering out the truly good films and the ones that will land distributors is tricky "the little miss sunshines are rarities and it will stay that way because most of the work shown at sundance doesnt add fuel to the commercial fire " says mr gilmore and one senior executive at a major studio says that studios cant depend on finding a jewel at sundance to bail them out of a scheduling bind "we dont go into the festival trying to fill release slots " as for whats hot this year folks in hollywood are shying away from predictions besides the chabon adaptation the movies getting a bit of buzz heading in include the comedy "be kind rewind " in which jack black tries to remake classic videotapes destroyed when his brain becomes magnetized then theres "sunshine cleaning " starring amy adams and emily blunt as the operators of a biohazard and crime scene cleanup service ms adamss star has risen since the disney hit "enchanted " and ms blunt won praise for her snippy assistant in "the devil wears prada " this years slate is heavy on comedy a contrast from a drama laden fall when many movies had heavy political themes and did poorly at the box office
