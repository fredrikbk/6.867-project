weekend journal review theater mark twain tonight sort of the problem is that "cymbeline " which shakespeare wrote toward the end of his life is an imaginative retrospective in which he simultaneously deployed all of the time honored devices that drove his plots the weak king the spunky heroine who dresses up as a boy the misguided husband induced by a scoundrel to test his wifes love is he dead lyceum theatre w th st &# &# cymbeline lincoln center theater vivian beaumont theater w th st &# &# closes jan new york mark twain wanted to be a playwright a longing he shared with many other novelists who have sought in vain to strike it rich on the wicked stage one of his plays "colonel sellers " had a brief th century vogue but is now forgotten with good reason "ah sin " his collaboration with bret harte closed after ill attended performances now hes taking a posthumous shot at broadway with the help of david ives written in but never performed "is he dead " is a farce about the art world that vanished into the authors files and didnt reappear until it was discovered in by a scholar and optioned by a producer six years later it has opened in a ritzy production directed by michael blakemore "noises off" and starring norbert leo butz "dirty rotten scoundrels" the results are shriekingly funny i dont know when ive heard a new york audience laugh louder or longer in large part because of mr butz whose performance is a veritable masterpiece of mugging dont be fooled by the flackery though "is he dead " may be "by" twain but its a quaintly amateurish piece of work that wouldnt have run for minutes on broadway had mr ives not "adapted" the script to within an inch of its life the author of "all in the timing" and "mere mortals" is one of this countrys smartest comic playwrights and a line by line comparison between the published version of "is he dead " and the one currently being performed at the lyceum theatre is the equivalent of a postgraduate course in how to make large numbers of people guffaw mr ives has retained twains original situations most of his characters and a fair number of his lines but he has cut rearranged punched up and otherwise transformed them so extensively as to deserve credit not as the plays adapter but as its co author in both versions "is he dead " is a shamelessly silly piece of goods in which jean francois millet mr butz who in real life painted "the angelus" and "the gleaners " is turned into a debt ridden buffoon a la harvey korman who pretends to be dead and masquerades as his nonexistent twin sister in order to drive up the prices of his work no sooner does mr butz don wig and corset than things get out of hand and stay that way ill never forget the sight of him doing a can can on top of his own coffin shaking his super sized bustle to the festive accompaniment of "yankee doodle " not only has mr blakemore directed "is he dead " with splendidly finicky comic timing but he has put together a cast so collectively effective that i dread the day when any of them should feel the need to move on byron jennings marylouise burke and david pittu are especially good but nobody on stage is anything other than right lincoln center theater is giving playgoers a christmas present that no one will want to regift mark lamoss production of "cymbeline" is the best traditional shakespeare staging ive seen in years by "traditional" i mean that mr lamos has imposed no high directorial concept on shakespeares text his cymbeline john cullum hasnt been turned into a game show host the ceo of a bloodsucking multinational corporation or dick cheney instead mr lamos permits him to remain nothing more or less than an angry king who has banished his son in law michael cerveris for secretly marrying his daughter martha plimpton everyone wears the usual somewhere in never never land costumes and everything ends happily ever after so what makes this "cymbeline" special the way in which mr lamos and his remarkable cast succeed in coaxing sweet meat out of what has long been regarded as one of shakespeares least crackable nuts the problem is that "cymbeline " which shakespeare wrote toward the end of his life is an imaginative retrospective in which he simultaneously deployed all of the time honored devices that drove his plots the weak king the spunky heroine who dresses up as a boy the misguided husband induced by a scoundrel to test his wifes love george bernard shaw called it "stagey trash of the lowest melodramatic order " and though that was mere envy speaking there have been plenty of other equally knowledgeable commentators who failed to grasp what shakespeare was up to henry james dismissed "cymbeline" as "a florid fairy tale of a construction so loose and unpropped that it can scarce be said to stand upright at all " and its true that most productions fail to weave the plays variegated strands into a convincing fabric not so this one greatly aided by michael yeargans sumptuously simple sets jess goldsteins gorgeous costumes and mel marvins savory incidental music mr lamos takes a cue from his parallel career as an opera director and gives us a "cymbeline" that flows with the irresistible forward momentum of a piece of music resplendent pageantry knockabout comedy haunting lyricism all are blended in just proportion sweeping us toward a climax in which surprise after surprise is detonated like an extra long string of firecrackers mr lamos wisely plays the first part of the grand finale for laughs allowing the audience to smile for a tension breaking moment at the glorious absurdity of it all then he modulates into the radiant key of reconciliation "the fingers of the powers above do tune the harmony of this piece" and lets shakespeare work his magic dropping the curtain on a fleeting glimpse of a paradise of universal love if its true that the biggest part of directing is casting then mr lamos also deserves ample credit for assembling actors who couldnt be bettered from ms plimptons heart stealing imogen to mr cullums grand voiced cymbeline to the suavely evil iachimo of jonathan cake this is shakespearean acting at its strongest and most exemplary youll never see a better cast or a more soul satisfying production how could i ever have thought that "cymbeline" was a problem play if it was then mark lamos has solved it mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
