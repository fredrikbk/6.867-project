epitaph to a smear ms riza is the bank employee whose personal relationship with then bank president paul wolfowitz created the bogus conflict of interest that ultimately led to his resignation in june given the campaign of vilification endured earlier this year by the world banks shaha riza we thought readers might like to know the results of an investigation into a concocted scandal about her dont expect to read about this in the media that was once so eager to trash her ms riza is the bank employee whose personal relationship with then bank president paul wolfowitz created the bogus conflict of interest that ultimately led to his resignation in june the principal charge concerned the details of her allegedly excessive pay raise which brought her salary in line with roughly other employees of the bank but a subplot about a trip she took to iraq in the spring of was conveniently trotted out at the height of the controversy to help force mr wolfowitz out here are the facts in early ms riza was invited by the state department to go to iraq and advise on ways to set up a democratic government with a particular focus on civil society and womens issues the trip got the enthusiastic go ahead from then bank president james wolfensohn to comply with bank rules concerning outside work ms riza agreed to take a month long unpaid leave from her job amounting to a loss in salary of about &# to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest she also declined any pay except travel and other expenses from the science applications international corp the pentagon contractor that organized the trip thus did matters stand until the phony wolfowitz scandal blew up this spring on april the washington post ran a story under the headline "defense eyes wolfowitz friends contract " the same day national public radio followed up with "wolfowitz faces new allegations of favoritism " quoting ms rizas former supervisor jean louis sarbib saying the trip was "unusual and not terribly above board " graeme wheeler a bank managing director also included the trip among the reasons for his widely publicized demand at the time that mr wolfowitz resign the very next day however reuters reported that in the pentagons inspector general had looked into ms rizas trip and found there was "insufficient basis to warrant further investigation " the ig noted that ms riza who has long experience working with arab reformers and is fluent in arabic and turkish among other languages was uniquely well qualified for the position the new york times confirmed the substance of the reuters story on april adding that the ig had found that then deputy defense secretary wolfowitz had "not exerted improper influence in ms rizas hiring " oddly the times chose to run this news under the misleading headline "wolfowitz backed friend for iraq contract in " despite this finding in late june of this year xavier coll then the banks vice president for human resources hired canadian law firm goodmans llp to investigate ms rizas trip supposedly because of questions related to the approval process for the trip mr coll is known to readers of this page for the dishonest account he gave of his role in authorizing ms rizas raise fast forward six months following a call from us a bank spokesman says the investigation has been completed and that the report finds "no basis to conclude misconduct occurred " the tab for this fishing expedition the bank wont say and goodmans didnt return our calls but a source estimates the cost to the bank runs north of &# that figure may be pocket change at the bank though it is hardly so for the poor people whom the bank ostensibly exists to serve but the episode is also a revealing example of the lengths to which the banks bureaucrats were prepared to go to destroy the career of one of their own colleagues for no greater sin than her connection to mr wolfowitz and it says something about the media which in its efforts to "get wolfowitz" didnt scruple to trash her reputation in a better world ms rizas accusers in the bank and the media would publicly acknowledge her vindication
