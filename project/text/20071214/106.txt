weekend journal sports by the numbers miamis short fall the florida marlins rode a win now strategy to two world titles renting players like ivan rodriguez gary sheffield and bobby bonilla and watching them walk away just after the ticker tape parade at the bottom of the nba standings theres quite a surprise which team is tied with the lowly new york knicks for the worst record in the eastern conference as of wednesday nights games its the nba champs the miami heat how did the heat fall so far so fast for starters dwyane wade has been recovering from knee and shoulder surgery and shaquille oneal has seen limited action but while injuries have accelerated the teams fall make no mistake this was a team with an expiration date the reason for that stems partly from the way the heat built their championship squad when the team acquired mr oneal from the los angeles lakers in it gave up caron butler brian grant lamar odom and a first round draft pick to get him thats a prime example of one of the two basic philosophies behind team building in modern sports the one well term the instant gratification method that method is in stark contrast to the strategy of stockpiling draft picks emphasizing player development and looking past immediate payoffs in favor of long term goals the aim of teams that build for the long haul such as the michael jordan era chicago bulls and the current san antonio spurs is a dynasty teams that follow the dynasty track are often given the benefit of the doubt by fans and the media alike while both are quick to turn on instant gratification teams that dont pan out but this thinking misses two things first building for the long term doesnt always work teams such as the current chicago bulls have followed patient rebuilding programs without coming near a title for every such rebuilding program that works dozens fail to produce a championship caliber team secondly even if it works it usually takes a little something extra to make things really kick in for example if some other team had snagged tom brady before the new england patriots picked him up in the sixth round of the nfl draft that franchises team building strategy may have had a different result and where would the cleveland cavaliers be if theyd won the rights to darko milicic not lebron james the heat and others have proven that bold moves can pay off in the short term for example the florida marlins rode a win now strategy to two world titles renting players like ivan rodriguez gary sheffield and bobby bonilla and watching them walk away just after the ticker tape parade the fans of such franchises as the cleveland indians chicago cubs and san francisco giants cant help but be jealous in the nfl the tampa bay buccaneers and baltimore ravens have also been one title wonders they didnt make the lasting impact a team such as the patriots has but plenty of new york jets fans would happily trade a dozen playoff appearances for one of the super bowl titles snagged by those teams but as the heat are showing one hit wonders are often all that quickly assembled championship teams turn out to be so while careful team building strategies dont guarantee championships they seem to help ensure that a championship team will stay at a high level if a teams primary goal is to enjoy the seasons last champagne shower however building a dynasty may be the ultimate thrill but a one win wonder runs a close second
