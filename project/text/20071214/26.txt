democrats fail to highlight differences johnston iowa the final democratic debate before election season begins unfolded as a low key event that highlighted accord between the six top candidates in what is becoming a heated and intensely personal race a debate that limited interaction between the candidates and skimmed over big issues such as the iraq war brought to a close what has been a long parade of political forums that have run the gamut from fiery to dull yesterdays minute debate sponsored by the des moines register and iowa public television focused on local issues and economic policy and did little to stretch the candidates or push them beyond campaign rhetoric much of the days political drama occurred in new hampshire when the campaign of new york sen hillary clinton said one of its top people had resigned bill shaheen a prominent new hampshire political figure stepped down as a national co chairman for the clinton campaign earlier in the week he had questioned the viability of rival sen barack obama based on his admitted past drug use mr shaheen suggested to a reporter from the washington post that such an admission would make him a prime target for the republican nominee in the general election mr obamas campaign as well as those of other candidates dismissed mr shaheens statements as the latest desperate act of a campaign that is flagging mrs clinton still leads in most polls but has been dropping in a statement released yesterday by the clinton campaign mr shaheen said he deeply regretted making the comments and said they werent authorized by mrs clinton "i made a mistake and in light of what happened i have made the personal decision that i will step down " he said at the debate the six candidates seemed hard pressed to highlight any more than subtle differences in their platforms they all said that trading partner china should be punished for its human rights record and refusal to allow unfettered markets for u s goods that higher taxes on the rich was the best way to bring the federal deficit to heel that the iraq war should end quickly and that the bush administration has made a mess of just about everything at one point mrs clinton asked colleagues for a show of hands if they were serious about combating global warming "were all for it " she said sen joseph biden was questioned by the moderator register editor carolyn washburn about whether racism or just "gaffes or misunderstandings" were the cause of some recent rhetorical faux pas he has made regarding immigrants and minorities mr biden has apologized for his phrasing the question drew a sharp defense from mr obama "i have absolutely no doubt about what is in his heart " mr obama said "joe is on the right side of the issues " mr obama was asked if he was such an outsider why did he have so many advisers who worked in the clinton administration this prompted a burst of laughter from mrs clinton mr obama turned to mrs clinton and said "hillary im looking forward to you advising me as well " when he reaches the oval office mrs clinton got her turn when the moderator citing the secrecy and intrigue that surrounded her failed health care proposal in the early s asked whether she was perhaps too inflexible to make a good president "i learned a lot from that experience " mrs clinton said "you have to have a very strong communications strategy "
