no sympathy for mozilos bailout pleading countrywide ceo angelo mozilos commentary "calling fannie and freddie" dec is the classic example of moral hazard in private business running for government protection when waters get hot this is funny because mr mozilo says that rep barney franks proposals could "forestall the kind of market excess that led to our current mess " as if such "market excess" and "mess" fell out of the blue from the sky no mr mozilos company was a participant in creating the excess and mess and he should correct it without any government help mr mozilos claims that the problem is that the government imposes a cap on the amount that the government sponsored enterprises gses and the federal housing authority fha can hold or insure he argues the cap should be raised however in the commentary next to mr mozilos "how to avert recession " martin feldstein says very clearly "why should american taxpayers provide an implicit guarantee of mortgages of up to &# million when the average sale price of a home is now less than &# " manfred dix metairie la mr mozilo details the significant strides countrywide has made to help families refinance loans at risk of default however countrywide had greater than market share of residential mortgages and the two million loans already delinquent and the two million loans expected to reset next year suggest an additional families that face default risk in the companys portfolio mr mozilo takes gall to a new level by suggesting that lack of national lending standards were to blame for the current crisis this strains credulity as the core business activity of firms like countrywide is to set lending standards that balance the risk that the borrower presents with the return an investor countrywide or a third party requires countrywide had the flexibility to extend more risk not the obligation countrywide is not cleaning up problems partially created by a "disjointed system of rules " it is cleaning up a mess that it made with its own poor lending standards and risk management practices samuel m saunders new york i didnt see any mea culpa included for lax lending standards at countrywide does mr mozilo really think congress can fashion uniform lending standards better than lenders can themselves our system is one of profit and loss no good can come from focusing on the former and ignoring the latter bad bets result in losses prudent bets result in profits give me a break angelo lawrence donaldson comfort texas how outrageous here is a man who took home &# million in and &# million in asking the u s government for a mortgage bailout terri a gumula new york
