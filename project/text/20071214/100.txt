weekend journal holiday book guide seasons readings the book is a compendium of brief but informative essays on individual collectors and their tastes making it a handy reference tool for anyone interested in basic information on say douglas cooper the pre eminent collector of cubist painting between the wars ethel and robert scull legendary patrons of the pop artists or charles saatchi the london ad exec who famously commissioned and later sold damien hirsts shark in formaldehyde in yet look a little closer and the book also offers a fascinating glimpse into the personality of the collector a combination of passion persistence and sensibility not to mention eccentricity art by eric gibson the sumptuous reproductions that fill oversize art rich "coffee table" books are one of the great pleasures of holiday gift buying and receiving but if i may a memo to art book publishers ask too high a price and readers may decide that it makes more sense to see a masterpiece in person take "the history of venice in painting" by georges duby and guy lobrichon abbeville pages though an undeniably handsome volume its &# price tag is not that far away from the &# round trip fare to venice that was offered by an airline earlier this month which would you rather do experience veronese tintoretto and other venetian masters vicariously while balancing a heavy tome on your lap or spend a little more money and stand in front of the originals in fairness "the history of venice in painting" does what a single plane ticket cant do it allows you to look at paintings world wide it is a survey of paintings depicting venice its physical appearance rituals and spectacles it tells the story of the city through its art the earliest view is a map dating from the most recent an undated th century painting of the exterior of the church of santa maria della salute by the austrian expressionist oskar kokoschka in between we come across familiar names from venetians giovanni and gentile bellini who launched venices golden age of renaissance painting to visiting masters such as j m w turner and claude monet this array of taste and talent was drawn to the city century after century by the same things the play of light on water and on venices remarkable buildings and by the citys love of spectacle but not every painter took this venice as his subject a surprise is giuseppe borsatos "snow on the riva degli schiavoni" which shows under a steel gray sky snow drifts piling up outside the doges palace along the churning waters of the grand canal the image is as compelling as any of the more familiar sun drenched views such as canalettos th century work "the rialto bridge " even in winter venice retains its power to enthrall during the twice yearly impressionist and modern sales that are lucrative waystations in christies and sothebys nearly nonstop round of auctions one is always tempted to ask "just who is buying all this stuff " one answer is to be found in james stourtons "great collectors of our time" scala acc pages &# the book is a compendium of brief but informative essays on individual collectors and their tastes making it a handy reference tool for anyone interested in basic information on say douglas cooper the pre eminent collector of cubist painting between the wars ethel and robert scull legendary patrons of the pop artists or charles saatchi the london ad exec who famously commissioned and later sold damien hirsts shark in formaldehyde in it is currently on loan to new yorks metropolitan museum samples of the collected works are generously on display yet look a little closer and the book also offers a fascinating glimpse into the personality of the collector a combination of passion persistence and sensibility not to mention eccentricity consider the case of the frenchman hubert heilbronn who has assembled "one of the most fascinating and idiosyncratic collections of french literature" anywhere mr heilbronn we learn collects books by "soldiers statesmen rugby players and prostitutes alongside his poets and novelists " mr stourton tells us that the day he arrived to interview the collector mr heilbronn was "unpacking a new purchase by the th century transvestite secret agent the chevalier deon " ah literature not every entry in "great collectors of our time" is this racy but the book is that rare thing both an excellent reference work and a terrific read every year or two brings a new college level art history survey phaidon now offers its own huge attempt with " years of art the story of human creativity across time and space" pages &# the books author is not an individual but perhaps understandably given the scale of the enterprise "the editors of phaidon " it begins with the willendorf venus a inch prehistoric carving of a female nude and ends with work by contemporary art eminences such as andy warhol wannabe jeff koons we see his "puppy" topiary of a west highland terrier constructed with tons of dirt and tens of thousands of plants and flowers " years of art" differs from its survey predecessors in two respects first it is primarily a picture book with one illustration per page alongside a short explanatory text most surveys are text heavy second it ranges widely placing its works of art in strict chronological order no matter where they come from it does not "start over" with each region or culture tracing a separate development rather the book invites us to understand artistic creativity globally the idea is to remove the habitual blinders that make us look at art in a narrow way and the approach works it is so to speak eye opening to see juxtaposed an indian miniature painting of a zebra from and a reproduction of frans halss "laughing cavalier " painted only three years after the one image all delicacy and restraint the other an exercise in painterly showmanship if " years of art" has a flaw it is in the absence of context and connecting narrative the brief explanations treat each work in isolation it would have been helpful if the editors had compared individual works or introduced a broad theme now and then still the book completes its survey in a wonderful fashion deftly crossing thousands of years and thousands of miles two must haves this season are "the art and architecture of mesopotamia" edited by giovanni curatola abbeville pages &# and "the art and architecture of persia" edited by mr curatola and gianroberto scarcia abbeville pages &# as each book says rightly mesopotamia and persia constitute "the cradle of civilization " and yet we know too little about either of them great museums like the louvre and the british museum possess sculptures and small scale art and artifacts but the temples and archaeological sites that make up so much of the story can only be seen in situ in iran iraq and elsewhere in the middle east and getting there these days is well a challenge both books provide beautiful photographs to help us along in the meantime the delicate arabesque stone carvings in a th century mesopotamian palace in baghdad are especially striking as is the ornate blue and gold exterior of the persian congregational mosque in esfahan the texts though scholarly are accessible to the general reader giving excellent instruction in a rich civilizational epoch because auguste rodins bronzes plasters and terra cottas are so well represented in american museums he is a familiar artist to us that is as a sculptor but rodin the draughtsman is less known there hasnt been a major exhibition of rodin drawings in more than years and few books focus on his graphic work alone "auguste rodin drawings &amp watercolors " by antoinette le normand romain and christina buley uribe thames &amp hudson pages &# is thus especially welcome for rodin drawing was more than a means of thinking through the ideas for a particular sculpture it was a tool for understanding the human figure working with nude models he would draw without looking at the paper producing images with restless lines that captured all the implicit energy of the models poses and physical forms "auguste rodin" includes more than color reproductions of drawings and diaphanous watercolors even for those who know rodins work on paper the book is a revelation mr gibson is the journals leisure &amp arts features editor photography by richard b woodward with print on paper losing ground every month to electronic formats it is easy to overlook the anomaly that we are also living through a golden age for the photographic book instead of killing the desire to put images on an inked page digital technology has served only to enlarge the options of artists and publishers twenty five years ago photographic books were relatively scarce and hard to find this year dozens of worthy monographs and scholarly histories were released they may still be perennial loss leaders but the titles below are estimable and a mere sample of what any well stocked museum or online store should be offering during the holiday season this is the th year of magnum the collective of photojournalists founded by robert capa henri cartier bresson george rodger and david seymour with a mission to bear witness to the worlds troubles and assert editorial control over its images "magnum magnum" thames &amp hudson pages &# is the enormous capstone for the anniversary as befits a group of photographers who once routinely critiqued one anothers work the books format has current magnum members choosing six pictures by living or deceased members and writing briefly about the person and his oeuvre eve arnold favors cartier bressons pictures from india among his less heralded work while david hurn chooses classics by josef koudelka including his eerie picture of a deserted prague about to meet its fate from the invading soviets in august the result is a book both quirky and epochal most institutional archives contain historic photographs that the passage of time has turned into objects of wonder mark jacobs and richard cahan have uncovered a bundle in "chicago under glass early photographs from the chicago daily news" university of chicago pages &# images that began their lives as nothing more than photo ops an alderman wrestling a bear men playing indoor baseball or policemen standing on a street corner in next to a recent invention the traffic light are slowly acquiring a patina that will only make them more curious and hard to distinguish from art professionals who leaf through "the art of the american snapshot " princeton university pages &# may despair as they realize that offhand efforts with a camera frequently produce more visual excitement than their studied exercises robert e jacksons collection the basis for this national gallery exhibition catalog may not differ substantially from the boxes of curling prints in attics across america but it might be wise to stifle the "any idiot could take a picture like that" wisecracks until youve spent time with this provocative book sarah greenough the exhibitions curator and her colleagues help to give meaning to the ordinary by probing in their essays how deeply the artless has shaped what we now consider art escapism is one of photographys pleasures and there may be nothing that transports one to another age time zone and income bracket as readily as "poolside with slim aarons" abrams pages &# in his photographs of jetsetters at ease from the s to the s a time when swimming pools were truly luxury additions to a home mr aarons actually makes the so called beautiful people look beautiful a feat that anyone who has ever spent time around them knows takes far more effort than he lets on here beauty is not always an advantage for women artists lee miller has never enjoyed proper acclaim her reflected glory as a stunning model and muse for man ray and others obscuring her career as a surrealist photographer with a subtle and insidious touch a lump of stone a dead nazi in a canal a smashed remington typewriter took on extraordinary power and tenderness in her hands mark haworth booth in "the art of lee miller" yale university pages &# redresses the injustice and finally puts her in perspective among the th centurys most searching and original photographic talents taryn simon in "an american index of the hidden and unfamiliar" steidl pages &# exploits the simple fact that anything off limits to the public is automatically mysterious and slightly sinister her all access pass takes us inside avian quarantine facilities the contraband room at jfk airport the nixon gift vault at the national archives a great white shark tank at the monterey aquarium and many other places that few will ever visit except in photographs even a brightly lighted room with newly printed &# bills at the u s treasury department has an ominous glow in ms simons eye going behind barbed wire fences and barred windows her unsettling work questions whether these security measures are any match for the secret human desires that necessitate them documentary style photographers who earned critical notice in the s but vanished beneath a wave of staged photography in the s have found favor again two of the decades eminent figures published terrific books of their vintage material this year tod papageorges "passing through eden" steidl pages &# celebrates central park in lustrous black and white during the years when new york was broke few other books capture so well how people in the city are crushed together yet remain lonely ungovernable entities mark cohens "true color" powerhouse pages &# is a sweet eyed close up report from the middle class streets of his home in wilkes barre pa commissioned by the george eastman house this previously unseen body of work suddenly establishes him one of the pioneers of s color certain technologies hit their peak just as they are becoming outmoded at least thats what happened in the early decades of photography roger taylor convincingly argues in "impressed by light british photographs from paper negatives " yale university pages &# the british art historian has amassed dozens of prints portraits of eminent persons and domestic landscapes notable for their sfumato tonality and abstract massing of forms that were made after when glass plates were rendering paper negatives obsolete photographys evolutionary gain in clarity brought a loss in atmosphere neither this marvelous work of scholarship nor the exhibition based on its contents now at new yorks metropolitan museum of art should be missed finally a few end of the year awards are in order best book value for its price goes to "ansel adams photographs" little brown pages &# the largest survey of his work ever published in one volume also comes in a format pleasing to hand arm and eye the same cannot be said of "on the beach" by richard misrach aperture pages &# needlessly oversized it represents a lamentable trend in photographic publishing huge books too awkward to handle mr misrachs pictures can be mesmerizing as he explores the dynamic scale of tiny human figures in vast landscapes but he has here fulfilled one of the nuttier schemes imagined by kramer from "seinfeld" he has made a coffee table book the size of a coffee table "faith" by jackie nickerson steidl pages &# and "snowbound" by lisa robinson kehrer verlag heidelberg pages &# take the prize for handsomest books most fitting for the season ms nickersons portraits of nuns monks and priests from irish convents seldom reveal more of the person than the face and shoulders but the figures are lit as if from within and seem to ask nothing from us as though their beliefs and vows already gave them everything they need ms robinson has portrayed the world of ice and snow or rather how fences benches granite boulders trees lakes and ponds are transformed when dressed in white like a robert frost poem these are photographs that see the threat of cold and emptiness and the comfort that meditative looking can bring mr woodward is an arts critic in new york
