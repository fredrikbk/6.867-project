town of dominica the project has already sold out "all i saw was the web site which showed a sloth feet from the unit and monkeys everywhere " mr deitrick says he snapped up the home on the advice of a gym buddy who said his own costa rican properties have quadrupled in value over the past four years although mr deitrick isnt looking forward to the daylong flight to dominica when he visits for the
