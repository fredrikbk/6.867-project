meet the editorial committee the committees charge is fairly specific the full agreement can be found on the dow jones investor relations web site as part of the proxy materials filed with the sec it

the committee formally known with lawyerly infelicity as the "special committee" will choose its own successors subject to the approval of news corp which according to the contract shall not be unreasonably withheld the committee has the right to hire at news corp expense such expert help as it feels it may require and will have guaranteed access to company records and documents of news corp and dow jones we will meet at least four times a year and more often as required the committee intends to conduct its deliberations in strict confidence but unlike some protective arrangements elsewhere the provisions of the contract give the committee the right to publish its findings and decisions in the wall street journal and other dow jones publications it also has the right to seek legal enforcement of its decisions the committees charge is fairly specific the full agreement can be found on the dow jones investor relations web site as part of the proxy materials filed with the sec it "shall have rights of approval" over the hiring or removal of three key editors the managing editor and the editorial page editor of the wall street journal and the managing editor of dow jones newswires under its current structure under the agreement these editors in turn have the sole power to hire and fire subordinates control the allocation of resources within departmental budgets set by news corp and make all news and editorial decisions the editors also have the right to appeal disputes over these matters to the special committee the same holds for issues arising from the dow jones code of conduct and a set of five principles adopted by news corp that require among other things that "there are no hidden agendas in any journalistic undertakings" and that opinions "represent only the applicable publications own editorial philosophies centered around the core principle of free people and free markets " the committee does not see itself as an ombudsman riding daily herd on individual stories newsroom practices and the news or editorial decisions of the editors themselves nor do we see ourselves as a barrier to change the contract of which we are stewards also gives news corp the right inherent in ownership to make business decisions as well as set the broad policies governing content and makeup of the individual publications the central challenge to the committee will be to distinguish between change and practices that might threaten dow jones well earned reputation for calling things as it sees them we are impressed by news corp s willingness to enter into such a contract and place considerable resources behind it we take news corp officials at their word that they see no gain in placing dow jones integrity at risk we are prepared to carry out our responsibilities but we are hopeful that the mutual stake in the success of the publications of dow jones will make that unnecessary
