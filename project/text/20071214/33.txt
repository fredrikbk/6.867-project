facebooks flop on tuesday of this week the search engine ask com announced a program intended to offer people privacy protections more advanced than those on other search services an explicit effort to turn consumer privacy concerns into a competitive business opportunity advertisers love the internet because its mathematical and technological tools enable them to analyze anonymous data to detect patterns in peoples interests and consumption habits and to match ads to them adding precision accountability and productivity consumer marketers previously had lacked within the space of a month or so facebook launched and then shut down an advertising program called beacon that alerted users to purchases and other activities their "friends" made outside facebook the episode has been called many things "annoying " "upsetting " "creepy " a "nightmare " a "privacy hairball " i call it proof that when it comes to the evolution of the internet market forces work an increasingly organized coalition of anti business groups sensing a power shift in washington is lobbying to regulate interactive media marketing and advertising their recommendations include a federally administered "do not track list" and a ban on well targeted ads such recommendations would severely curtail investment in interactive technologies they would also curb the flow of otherwise free services that have revolutionized americans ability to teach learn communicate across boundaries and build entrepreneurial businesses using the web the facebook imbroglio is an almost perfect representation of the power of the internet to mobilize people to change the web for the better on tuesday of this week the search engine ask com announced a program intended to offer people privacy protections more advanced than those on other search services an explicit effort to turn consumer privacy concerns into a competitive business opportunity the onslaught against facebook was so severe that it didnt even wait until a competitive threat materialized the site specializes in connecting friends to each other through a network of individually created home pages that feature biographical information photos gossip and just about anything else a person wants to post changes subscribers make to their pages appear in a news feed that runs across the home pages of each friend in their network for example today on my facebook page i discovered that one of my friends is going on vacation in three days another celebrates a birthday today and a third joined an interactive television business alliance this intimate connective tissue has helped propel facebooks growth to million registered users in only three years the controversy began in early november when the site introduced beacon and began sharing information about users purchases and other activities outside facebook accompanied by relevant advertisements almost immediately facebook subscribers began complaining about invasions of privacy facebooks attempts to defend the program "all were trying to do is make sure anytime there is a trusted word of mouth referral that your friend has made about this product we share that information with you " one company executive said were met by complaints that facebook was exploiting for commercial purposes personal information members hadnt intended to share moveon org got people to sign a petition calling for facebook to allow users to completely opt out of beacon a month in facebook did just that facebooks blunder illustrates one of the hoary maxims of the internet era the consumer is in control the ability of aggrieved americans to band together and make noise that is either depending on your point of view productive or destructive is a reality that organizations as diverse as the democratic party and dell computer have learned the hard way "listenomics " advertising ages critic at large bob garfield calls this new principle "the herd will be heard " why does the herd have such a powerful voice because the technologies that enable people to network to their closest colleagues build a blog or launch a global digital video network are now built into personal computers or available gratis on the web this environment a world of no barriers to entry and unlimited shelf space has generated countless businesses many of them constructed around the promise of advertising the entrepreneurial equation is simple offer great content or great services build an audience and bring that audience to advertisers advertisers love the internet because its mathematical and technological tools enable them to analyze anonymous data to detect patterns in peoples interests and consumption habits and to match ads to them adding precision accountability and productivity consumer marketers previously had lacked the internet has paid off on this promise the volume and value of the free services available on the ad supported web are almost incalculable google yahoo and msn together provide million email accounts for free the research firm comscore reports that more than million americans age or older conduct search engine searches each month also for free and each month some million people search the top three online job listings sites monster hotjobs and careerbuilder without charge just one of those sites monster com has million resumes posted on it by job seekers of course none of this is really free advertisers are paying for it internet advertising revenues are likely to exceed &# billion in about one third the amount marketers spend on national broadcast and cable television according to research by the interactive advertising bureau and price waterhouse coopers the veronis suhler stevenson investment bank projects that internet ad spending will reach &# billion in surpassing newspapers as the largest advertising medium small providers as well as large are benefiting million american adults have used online classified ads for selling or buying according to the pew internet &amp american life project activists calls to regulate interactive advertising which include the banning of behaviorally targeted ads would if followed shut down this flow of advertiser money and the services for which it pays by limiting the mediums effectiveness that would be a tragedy because its unnecessary internet consumers have shown themselves willing and able to police the medium on their own just ask facebook consumer regulation proved itself to be a far more effective efficient economically productive and unforgiving mechanism than federal regulation ever will be mr rothenberg is the president and ceo of the interactive advertising bureau see related letter "letters to the editor no you are not in control of your web data" wsj dec
