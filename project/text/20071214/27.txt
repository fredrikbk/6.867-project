attractive target for bargain hunting in the worlds second largest economy the year old company one of the biggest auto parts makers in the world is far outperforming its u s counterparts once part of japanese auto maker toyota motor corp it makes components from air conditioning systems to navigation units it also makes semiconductor chips used inside cars an area where demand is growing as automobiles become increasingly high tech densos prowess in designing and selling auto parts has helped it expand beyond its tight relationship with toyota which owns about of the company although toyota accounts for about half of densos sales the company has developed strong ties to honda motor co the u s big three general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler llc and european auto makers denso based near nagoya is no longer dependent on the fortunes of just one company but denso shares are down from their recent high in late july and at one point had fallen as much as as the japanese yen has strengthened particularly against the u s dollar investors have been worrying that densos products have become more expensive overseas the source of of its record trillion yen &# billion in sales they also worry earnings from overseas will be eroded when calculated in yen the currency in which denso keeps its books analysts said those concerns are overblown they said densos profit margins are fatter than the industry average and global growth and the companys expanding product line will allow it to continue expanding sales "denso is increasing its market share in existing products such as car air conditioners while steadily increasing earnings from growth products " arifumi yoshida an analyst at nikko citigroup ltd said in a recent report mr yoshida has a "buy" recommendation on denso shares which he sees rising more than from their current level in the next months nikko citigroup has an investment banking relationship with denso the auto parts sector is extremely competitive with more than major manufacturers in japan alone but few have the scale and reach of denso and few are as healthy earnings rose to a record billion yen in its fiscal year ended march densos &# billion market value is larger than some of the countrys auto makers such as mitsubishi motors corp and suzuki motor corp many big north american competitors delphi corp visteon corp and dana corp for instance are undergoing major restructurings and some are operating under bankruptcy court protection all are posting losses although their shares may be cheap compared with densos investors who would be interested in buying them would shoulder lots of risk denso has stronger competitors at home many also owned in part by toyota such as toyota industries corp aisin seiki co and toyoda gosei co because denso has been especially hard hit by currency concerns its shares trade at a relatively cheaper price denso shares rose yen yesterday to yen on the tokyo stock exchange its american depositary receipts trade over the counter on what are known as the pink sheets though volume is very light a number of u s mutual funds own shares which can be purchased directly in tokyo though their stakes are relatively small the shares trade in tokyo at times expected per share earnings for the fiscal year ending march toyota industries trades at times current fiscal year earnings aisin seiki co at times and toyoda gosei times denso also is trading below its average price to earnings ratio for the past five years of according to yuriko wakamatsu an analyst at kbc securities japan which has a buy rating on the stock it has no investment banking relationship with the company densos operating margin the difference between what it costs to make a product and what it sells it for is two percentage points above the industry average said ms wakamatsu she said because densos products are so important to car makers it has more pricing power than its competitors the company also is a major player in green technologies used in automobiles it has an emphasis on fuel systems that power diesel trucks and cars which get better fuel mileage than gasoline powered cars with of the global market the company is the worlds second biggest maker of such fuel systems after germanys robert bosch gmbh which has about half the market denso also is a pioneer in battery related components for hybrid automobiles though high research and development costs cap profits hybrids are catching on around the world amid concerns about high oil prices and environmental issues all three big u s auto makers offer hybrid models chrysler said it would offer a version of its durango truck with a hybrid motor "we view products for hybrid automobiles as one of the key sectors that will drive our growth going forward " said goro kanemasu a denso spokesman who added that the company expects hybrid automobiles as well as diesels to continue to increase in popularity throughout the world a sharply stronger yen could weigh on shares and while its big u s competitors delphi visteon and dana may be struggling now they could come out of their restructurings leaner meaner and stronger creating tougher competition down the road because denso has a big presence in the u s a slowdown or recession would likely crimp auto sales and weigh on densos performance denso is diversifying into fast expanding auto markets in november the company said it was spending about &# million to expand its facilities in hungary to take advantage of the expanding automobile market in eastern europe in june the company announced a &# million investment in china to expand operations in the fast growing car market there this week the company raised its fiscal sales forecast for china by to billion yen "the company has always been very aggressive in going overseas " said ms wakamatsu of kbc she said the companys geographic expansion makes strategic sense
