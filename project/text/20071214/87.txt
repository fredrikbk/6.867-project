the delta house congress yesterday senate majority leader harry reid failed once again to get enough votes for an energy bill having refused to remove a &# billion tax increase on energy that president bush has promised to veto in any case in the movie "animal house " the fraternity brother known as otter reacts to the delta houses closure with the classic line "i think that this situation absolutely requires a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebodys part " to which bluto played by john belushi replies "were just the guys to do it " the movie ends by noting that bluto becomes a senator so perhaps this explains the meltdown among democrats on capitol hill as they careen toward the end of their first year in charge congressional leaders seem capable of nothing but futile gestures yesterday senate majority leader harry reid failed once again to get enough votes for an energy bill having refused to remove a &# billion tax increase on energy that president bush has promised to veto in any case mr reid was vowing to try again as we went to press meanwhile in nancy pelosis house of self inflicted pain the blutarsky strategy played out yesterday in one more hopeless attempt to pass a tax increase to "pay for" alternative minimum tax relief the senate has already voted against any such tax hike so this house bill is dead before arrival but ms pelosis troops are just the guys to do it anyway say what you will about tom delay at least he knew how to run the joint ms pelosi and mr reid are letting their left wing troops and interest groups run all over them with the result that their signal achievement this year is a higher minimum wage considering most of their policy goals this failure is good for the country but the dysfunction amply shows that democrats are attempting to govern with an agenda that is too far left even for many in their own party never mind the country start with trying to end the war in iraq which democrats claimed was their mandate from voters last november that was a misinterpretation of their victory which had as much to do with gop corruption and overspending but democratic leaders nonetheless wasted weeks and no fewer than votes trying to impose withdrawal deadlines strategy changes and other war fighting micromanagement on mr bush their only achievement has been to reinforce their image of national security weakness for opposing the baghdad "surge" that has been such a success recall mr reids memorable declaration in april that "this war is lost " even today democrats are caught between their antiwar left which wants more futile gestures and members from swing districts who want to fund the troops democrats have delayed funding for so long that the pentagon is issuing furlough notices to civilian employees so it can shuffle operations funding to keep the troops in iraq and afghanistan in ammunition then theres the amt fiasco without action by congress that hated second tax system will engulf million middle class americans next year most of them in high tax largely democratic states congress has already been so dilatory that the irs has said it may have to delay tax return processing that is supposed to start in january but so determined are house democrats to raise taxes on somebody anybody to "pay for" this relief that they are holding out for senate democrats to walk the tax plank with them in the end the house will surely back down but not before ms pelosi has put her moderate members on record as tax raisers bluto strikes again and dont forget the warrantless wiretap program against al qaeda that expires early next year if congress fails to act the senate intelligence committee which is hardly dominated by hawks passed a bipartisan bill in october but it is now bogged down because judiciary chairman pat leahy refuses to provide retroactive immunity to the telecom companies that cooperated with the u s government in the uncertain days after the house bill is a similar bow to the aclu moveon org and the partys antiwar left if republicans wanted to design a political battle that made democrats look weak on security they couldnt do it any better we could keep calling this roll farm subsidies that are as egregious as anything the delay republicans passed the schip health care bill and its budget gimmicks eliminating secret ballots for union organizing spending bills that keep courting vetoes because they exceed mr bushs targets on nearly every issue democrats have been intent not on getting something done but on making a stupid futile gesture to please their base as for mr bush one lesson is that his veto strategy has been a political and policy success though widely called a lame duck he continues to dominate the debate on security and defense he is also on the cusp of controlling spending growth far better than he ever did when republicans controlled congress we hope gop leaders on capitol hill dont give democrats a last minute reprieve on spending in order to be able to collect their own "earmarks " senate minority leader mitch mcconnell looked shaky on that score earlier this week the best gop strategy is to put the responsibility to govern squarely on the democratic majority and support mr bushs vetoes as a tool for improving policy if democrats keep following delta house rules republicans will be back in the majority sooner than they ever imagined
