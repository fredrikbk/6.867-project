demand for champagne gives peas a chance small french city gets another shot at joining lucrative appellation because of the financial implications of membership in the exclusive champagne club for farmers who own land as well as producers desperate for a bigger supply gossip about the change has reached a fever pitch even before the governments announcement of the contenders like many mayors in the region he can cite city archives that show that champagne grapes grew in his town up until the early s gradually disappearing as phylloxera war and the depressed world economy made food crops more desirable in the mid s the mayor of peas a small city in northeastern france was fed up with champagne the great depression two world wars and decades battling the grapevine parasite phylloxera had persuaded him that growing grapes for the wine was frivolous particularly when the same land could be used to cultivate more lucrative wheat or potatoes thus according to local legend when a letter arrived from paris telling the mayor that the city was eligible to seek inclusion in the champagne grape growing region he "threw it in the trash " says guy gorget peass mayor since that was a big mistake today one hectare or about acres of agricultural land in peas is valued at less than &# only a few miles away a hectare of land that can be used to grow grapes for champagne can be worth almost &# million peas is part of the historical champagne region but it isnt part of the acres scattered through hundreds of small cities in northeastern france that are approved for champagne grape planting in other french wine regions wineries grow most of their own grapes but grape growers own about of the champagne regions vineyards while big champagne houses like lvmhs moet &amp chandon produce over two thirds of the actual champagne and over the years the region has carefully protected the champagne brand by engaging in drawn out trade disputes now mr gorget and some of the inhabitants of his village may get a second chance to share in the bounty a potential shortage of champagne grapes and demands from local mayors to join have led the government organization that controls wine appellations in france the institut national des appellations dorigine to embark on the largest revision of the regions legal boundaries since because of the financial implications of membership in the exclusive champagne club for farmers who own land as well as producers desperate for a bigger supply gossip about the change has reached a fever pitch even before the governments announcement of the contenders the revision process started quietly in with little fanfare the institute worked on defining fresh criteria for entry and sent five scientists out to survey soil climate and the historical location of vines but two months ago a small local newspaper lunion published a list of "communes " or villages being considered for entry based on a list leaked to the paper by the local growers group the naming of names even unofficially set off a stampede of excitement and anger mr gorget was elated to see peas on the list for years he has petitioned the appellation institute to include the city like many mayors in the region he can cite city archives that show that champagne grapes grew in his town up until the early s gradually disappearing as phylloxera war and the depressed world economy made food crops more desirable but in aisne north of peas people are livid frans labilloy a retired farmer leads a group of about land owners from communes that have sought inclusion in the grape growing region since he was furious to see all communes absent from the "list of " "all communes refused at once that makes us think this is a case of discrimination " he says the group involved in a legal battle that predates the current revision has even filed a complaint with the european court of human rights in now other mayors are speculating that being too aggressive is a bad thing aisne officials "were maybe not diplomatic enough " says jean pierre pinon the mayor of fismes which did end up on the unofficial list "im saying maybe working with a lawyer from the beginning is not the best idea " he says "you just need to present the facts" to the institute "and thats it " but all this is speculation because the list still isnt official after lunions article the institute sought to explain that the selection wont be official until the organizations national committee votes probably in mid march until then no complaints can be lodged herve briand the institutes associate director does confirm that communes have been recommended by the scientific team for consideration in addition he says two communes may lose their grape grower status the institute began its reappraisal in response to a request from the syndicat general des vignerons de la champagne the official champagne grape growers group the growers had little natural incentive to add competitors but demand for champagne is soaring in developing countries like india china and russia and traditional markets like the u s with shipments of champagne up since if the grape supply doesnt expand the french champagne houses say the rising price for french bubbly could produce a consumer backlash affecting the industry for years to come that argument as well as the pleading of mayors whose villages want to be included finally won over the growers group choosing the communes is far from the end of the process there will be a public comment period and a further whittling down of the number of communes involved then the individual parcels of land within the communes will be chosen "thats when the fun really begins " says frederic rouzaud the managing director of champagne louis roederer for now nothing is certain the criteria the scientists are using to evaluate the land hasnt been released nor have the names of the scientists "we are taking our time trying to keep the experts away from people" to protect the integrity of the process explains daniel lorson spokesman for the comite interprofessionnel du vin de champagne which represents both growers and houses in champagne the institute optimistically predicts that vines could be planted in new areas by the time lag doesnt mean some interested parties arent getting ready to pounce mr rouzaud whose house produces the high end cristal brand says he has already talked to at least one family that owns land in a commune on the unofficial "list of " about buying their potential grape supply noel maury a champagne grape grower who also farms about hectares of wheat and beets in peas with his brother says he has discussed the possibility of supplying peas grapes to his current grape buyer champagne g h martel &amp co and other interested buyers planning for the distant future have also approached him but everyone is resigned to the fact that this will take some time "i wish with all my heart that we get in the appellation " says daniel triquenot the year old second deputy mayor of peas "but all we can do is wait " corrections &amp amplifications in some editions friday the continuation on page b
