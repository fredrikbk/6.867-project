fcc chief pushes ownership vote move to relax the rules on media holdings faces pressure from senators with little to gain from drawing out the argument mr martin appears determined simply to get a vote done to toss the issue back to a federal appeals court which must review the agencys decision "why give us an argument to attack you all with " although mr lott has been a vocal critic of relaxing media ownership rules his concerns were echoed by alaska senator ted stevens the ranking republican on the senate committee that oversees the fcc washington federal communications commission chairman kevin martin said he plans to move forward with a controversial vote tuesday on relaxing media ownership rules despite th hour pressure from a bipartisan group of senators mr martin has rejected requests to delay the vote on a proposal that would allow media companies to own both a newspaper and broadcast property in the nations top markets serious negotiations among the fccs five members over the measure which mr martin proposed last month have barely begun agency insiders say if the proposal is brought to a vote next week it is likely to be approved by along party lines mr martin left a little wiggle room to delay the vote but one fcc official said he remains pessimistic the agency could substantively discuss the proposal without talks breaking down into partisan bickering the fccs two democrats say they want to slow the process down by as much as six months to allow the commission time to consider how relaxation of media ownership laws would affect diversity and local news content republicans complain democrats and consumer groups are trying to drag out the media ownership review for as long as possible so no changes can be made until a new administration possibly democratic takes over and can tighten ownership caps mr martins plan has become a lightning rod for both sides of the media ownership argument consumer groups say he has gone too far toward encouraging consolidation media companies complain he hasnt gone far enough in view of the rapidly changing economics of the industry with little to gain from drawing out the argument mr martin appears determined simply to get a vote done to toss the issue back to a federal appeals court which must review the agencys decision although he conceded there was no specific media acquisition deal pending that requires the fcc to change its media ownership rules he said he feels it is important for the fcc to act sooner rather than later "im not convinced on media ownership there will ever be consensus " mr martin said "its just too politically divisive " last week the senate committee unanimously passed legislation warning the fcc to slow down its review yesterday several senators sharply questioned mr martin at a hearing on why he was determined to hold a vote next week rather than wait for a more thorough airing of his plan "youre about to make a decision with no understandable rationale against the interests of congress " said sen john kerry d mass senate republicans took mr martin to task for pushing the vote despite widespread opposition "i dont see why you need to force this thing to a head on dec th " said mississippi republican sen trent lott "why give us an argument to attack you all with " although mr lott has been a vocal critic of relaxing media ownership rules his concerns were echoed by alaska senator ted stevens the ranking republican on the senate committee that oversees the fcc "i hope youll listen to us " said mr stevens "i do think we ought to take a little more time on the cross ownership business " but mr martins proposal hasnt gotten much support from big media companies including media general inc gannett co and radio giant clear channel communications inc which have complained in filings and meetings with fcc staff that mr martins proposal doesnt go far enough newspaper companies want the cross ownership ban abolished completely clear channel wants easing of the national radio ownership limit which isnt part of the proposal falling circulation and advertising have generally left newspaper properties less attractive than in years past with some exceptions mr martins proposal would do little to change newspapers fortunes in the near term since it would certainly be challenged in federal court if adopted "from a wall street perspective the rule is probably not going to drive many deals " said blair levin a telecommunications analyst with stifel nicolaus mr martins proposal would set up an expanded process for media companies to receive waivers in smaller markets that would allow them to own newspaper and broadcast properties there that might at some point help companies like gannett or media general which own properties in smaller markets companies could use reasons other than financial hardship as a justification for a waiver under mr martins plan consumer groups complain of loopholes in the language they say could spur consolidation in the industry mr martin said yesterday he would be willing to work with the fccs two democrats and to consider specific benchmarks for the amount of local news coverage stations would have to provide in order to qualify for cross ownership waivers indeed mr martin said he agrees with concerns raised by some new jersey residents that a news corp owned television station wwor hasnt provided as much local new jersey news as it was required to do under a temporary waiver the company received years ago "it does appear that they do not meet the requirements of news needed for new jersey " mr martin said the fcc is unlikely to pull news corp s waiver fcc officials said but would likely require the station to provide more local programming a news corp spokesperson couldnt be reached for comment news corp is the owner of dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal corey boles contributed to this article
