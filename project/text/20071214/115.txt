why web campaign spending trails tv online ad spots grab only small piece of pie get voters to notice candidates political parties and issue groups are expected to spend a record &# billion on ads this election season thanks in part to the unusual number of tight local races says campaign media analysis group which tracks politics and public affairs advertising despite the hoopla about online advertising the web is expected to get only a very small slice of campaign spending in says evan tracey founder and chief operating officer of campaign media analysis part of tns media intelligence a firm that tracks advertising amid the gloomy forecasts for next years ad market there is at least one bright spot political advertising candidates political parties and issue groups are expected to spend a record &# billion on ads this election season thanks in part to the unusual number of tight local races says campaign media analysis group which tracks politics and public affairs advertising but as spending grows one thing that hasnt changed much is how money is spent despite the hoopla about online advertising the web is expected to get only a very small slice of campaign spending in says evan tracey founder and chief operating officer of campaign media analysis part of tns media intelligence a firm that tracks advertising in fact the best way to reach voters in the run up to elections is still the old way via local broadcast television he says thats creating a scramble for tv ad time in unexpected places like paducah ky and charleston w va mr tracey who tracked politically related advertising for more than a decade is particularly curious to see how feb plays out voters in states will vote in presidential primaries that day presenting some interesting ad spending decisions for campaigns he talked with the wall street journal about ad buying trends this year mistakes that candidates make with their ads and even how a third party run by new york mayor michael bloomberg could change the spending equation below are excerpts from the interview wall street journal some of the &# spent on political ads is expected to be spent on local advertising mostly local tv why mr tracey even presidential elections turn into or state battlegrounds that are often waged right down to the county by county level if any business lets say dog food had to run on a cycle where you could only get your customers once every other year and you had one day when they had to pick between your brand and somebody elses brand and whichever brand had of the market won you would want to have a medium that is best situated to essentially drive up the volume and get voters to notice you and customers to notice you that has always been television wsj how does the supply crunch with local advertising impact supply and demand for advertising on other media mr tracey in many cases you have multiple competitive elections in the same media market that will certainly be the case this year in places like florida ohio missouri illinois california once youve bought all the television you can buy then you start to look for other places to use your money and funds things like radio and even in some places things like newspaper also in some respects with other nonpolitical advertisers trying to buy in these markets as well they get priced out and start to look for other media wsj what role is new media playing ad wise this election cycle mr tracey you will see record spending on internet advertising in this cycle but it will still amount to little more than a rounding error when put next to the money spent on television right now the campaigns are using the free part of the internet things like email blogs and youtube and myspace to fund raise and take advantage of grass roots organizing but not doing much from a paid standpoint wsj why arent politicians devoting more funds to the web mr tracey there was the case with mitt romney going through one of these ad wholesalers like advertising com and spots ended up on gay com and sites like that there have been other cases where the campaigns have had similar problems so there is a trust factor no but no an internet ad is not a tv ad it is not going to be something that you can put an unfiltered second message or an attack ad when you need to do those because with an internet ad at this point somebody has to want to see it wsj what are some of the most interesting forms of advertising youve seen so far this election mr tracey there is not a lot of innovation that goes on in the realm of political advertising that is because weve been perfecting it for the last thirty or years one of the things that is going to be very interesting to watch is how campaigns deal with this feb primary where you have plus states all on one day there isnt a political playbook or a media consultant guide to navigating a third of the countrys primaries wsj what effect would a strong third party candidate in the presidential race have on political spending mr tracey if that candidate has a last name of bloomberg it could easily add a third more spending to the mix wsj some new ad firms like spot runner create templates for political ads do you think those ads are effective mr tracey over the last years things like editing costs have gone down literally campaigns are creating commercials on laptops the barrier to entry to tv which always was sort of that upfront production cost is gone the net effect on that has been more campaigns are finding their way to using tv i dont think that there is anything wrong with that but tv spots are only as good as the audience who sees them and the message that is in them and timing of the spot in this marketplace there is probably in many ways an overreliance on tv
