immigrant phoenix arizona businesses are firing hispanic immigrants moving operations to mexico and freezing expansion plans ahead of a new law that cracks down on employers who hire undocumented workers the law set to take effect on jan thrusts arizona into the heart of the national debate on illegal immigration which has become a hot topic on the presidential campaign trail republican candidates in particular have been battling to show how tough they are on the issue arizonas law believed to be the strictest in the nation is shaping up as a test of how employers will react when faced with real sanctions for hiring undocumented labor it is being closely watched by businesses across the country while proponents say the crackdown will save the state money on services for illegal immigrants some businesspeople fear arizonas economic growth may be at risk under the law people will be encouraged to contact a county sheriffs or county attorneys office to report businesses they suspect of employing an illegal immigrant after the sheriff investigates the county attorney can then seek to suspend and ultimately revoke the business license of an employer who knowingly hires an illegal immigrant the measure would also require all arizona businesses to use e verify a federal online database to confirm that new hires have valid social security numbers and are eligible for employment the law still faces a court challenge from the arizona chamber of commerce and other business groups yesterday a federal judge set a hearing for next tuesday on a temporary restraining order that would freeze the laws implementation earlier the judge tossed out a separate lawsuit challenging the law saying the plaintiffs had sued the wrong parties with congress deadlocked over an immigration overhaul many states and cities are taking matters into their own hands some local efforts are meant to make it hard for illegal immigrants to get housing and jobs but recent court rulings have suggested these measures may face constitutional hurdles meanwhile measures that accommodate the presence of undocumented immigrants such as new york gov eliot spitzers failed attempt to extend drivers licenses to them have been met with a harsh public response the issue has echoed in the presidential campaign as voters passionate about illegal immigration have impelled candidates to take stronger stands one of the few candidates to buck the trend has been arizonas senior senator republican john mccain his poll ratings took a beating after he supported a senate bill that would have

of steel beam manufacturer ironco said he has fired several hispanic employees in anticipation of the sanctions law "this law has the potential of sinking a business " he said mr bailey who has formed
