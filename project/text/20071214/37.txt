geochemists chart carbon dioxide levels at year high for a half century sensors atop mauna loa on the island of hawaii have captured the world wide signature of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due largely to burning coal oil and natural gas more than two miles above the pacific surf at the summit of the worlds largest volcano the evidence of human influence on global warming is in the air for a half century sensors atop mauna loa on the island of hawaii have captured the world wide signature of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due largely to burning coal oil and natural gas the carbon dioxide traps heat for years these co readings known as the keeling curve have been climbing steadily setting and then breaking a new record every months or so global concentrations of co in not surprisingly then reached the highest level since the record keeping began in the world meteorological organization recently announced in its annual greenhouse gas bulletin based on samples from countries the level of carbon dioxide in the air reached parts per million up fractionally from concentrations not seen in years scientists said this week while diplomats from countries argued over the cost of staving off predicted climate changes the mauna loa readings started to approach even higher levels these annual measurements are the worlds longest continuous record of co concentrations and plotted as data points in a rising arc form one of the most important graphs in science by the data had provided the first clear evidence that carbon was accumulating in the atmosphere and implicated human activity by inference it also records how little has been done each year since to reduce greenhouse gas emissions "it is one of the iconic records of human influence on the planet " said atmospheric chemist pieter tans at the federal earth systems research laboratory in boulder colo "when you look at it it is shocking how overwhelming the human influence has been on the atmosphere it is the scientific basis for the whole anxiety we have about climate change caused by human beings " climate scientists call the graph the keeling curve in tribute to a skeptical atmospheric chemist named charles d keeling who first began monitoring the pure air at two of earths most remote locations mauna loa and the south pole in oil then sold for &# a barrel a new fuel efficient ford edsel promised miles to the gallon and no one thought the carbon released by burning fossil fuels making cement or clearing land could have a measurable effect on earths climate indeed researchers believed it would be absorbed harmlessly by the oceans not the atmosphere with no adverse effects for thousands of years dr keeling who died in quickly proved otherwise "it heralded the beginning of the scientific discussion about global warming " said his son climate geochemist ralph keeling at the scripps institution of oceanography "my father gave us a year jump start on trying to solve this problem " greenhouse gases drive temperatures over the duration of keelings rising curve average temperatures in the northern hemisphere were "very likely" higher than during any other year period in the past years the u n intergovernmental panel on climate change reported last month fifteen of the past years rank among the warmest years on record spring now arrives days earlier in many parts of north america and days earlier in europe than it did years ago in response to rising temperatures the tropical regions bordering the equator have expanded around the world by about degrees latitude about miles or so north and south in the past years dian seidel meteorologist at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration reported this month in the journal nature geoscience to the north arctic sea ice melted to a record low in september so did the greenland ice sheet university of colorado climate scientist konrad steffen reported this week now the keeling curve is rising faster driven not just by human economic activity but also by natural limits on the planets ability to remove so much carbon from the air quickly new research suggests since co emissions world wide as measured by hundreds of sensors in dozens of countries accelerated growing at three times the rate observed during the s an international research team led by the global carbon project reported in may in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usually plants soil and seawater absorb much of those emissions threatening the ecosystem between and for example new forest growth in the countries of the european union annually absorbed million tons of carbon equal to about of the regions yearly emissions university of helsinki researchers reported last month in energy policy but such natural sponges may no longer be able to blot up atmospheric spills of co so easily the carbon project scientists reported in october in the years marked by keelings curve the researchers said the planets capacity to absorb the gas through soil and sea chemistry has steadily declined email me at sciencejournal wsj com for a discussion on todays column go to the science journal forum see related
