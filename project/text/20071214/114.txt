weekend journal travel the finicky traveler seduced by a frenchman george v famous hotel provides top service style but euro shocks abound surprisingly despite a strike paralyzing paris and an inflated euro sending seismic shock waves though my pocketbook i was feeling especially welcome in france thanks in large part to the extreme comforts and solicitous staff at the george v besides being one of the top rated hotels in the world it also had the advantage for me of offering as a four seasons an extra touch of the familiar for my first trip to europe in nearly eight years in the elegant dining room of the four seasons hotel george v in paris im lavished with attention while i wait and wait for three colleagues to arrive for breakfast waiters offer more coffee newspapers and a little stool for my purse and periodically ask if theres anything else madame needs "my guests are running a little late because of the transit strike " i explain to the maitre d "welcome to france " he says with a wry smile surprisingly despite a strike paralyzing paris and an inflated euro sending seismic shock waves though my pocketbook i was feeling especially welcome in france thanks in large part to the extreme comforts and solicitous staff at the george v besides being one of the top rated hotels in the world it also had the advantage for me of offering as a four seasons an extra touch of the familiar for my first trip to europe in nearly eight years with the city of lights putting on the trim for the holiday season and the hourly sparkle of the disco style lights on the eiffel tower giving everything an extra festive feel its a lovely time to be there if you can take the high tariff the hotel plaza athenee has transformed its garden courtyard into an ice rink exclusively for hotel guests through january though rooms can run more than &# a night the george v with rooms starting in the same range has put up two big christmas trees in the lobby with funky contemporary garlands made of pink neon lights and violet christmas balls and will unveil a decorative wall of water in its courtyard next week there are even some relative deals to be had hotels including the bristol crillon and raphael members of the luxury leading hotels of the world group are discounting rooms as much as through april the park hyatt paris vendome offers a very important family package through next december that includes an upgrade to the next room category for parents up to off for a connecting room and three complimentary hours of baby sitting and if you need a postholiday pick me up lhotel a chic left bank boutique suggests a january and february "escape the winter blues" package that includes continental breakfast two massages and a three course dinner starting at about &# a night having experienced more than our share of haute attitude in other high end paris hotels my husband and i were pleasantly surprised to find none whatsoever at the george v where every staffer we met was friendly professional and ready to go the extra mile we found a loose raincoat button tightened without our asking while we were out a nightgown hung on a padded hanger and bookmarks placed in magazines wed left open a waiter at tea noticed id gotten honey on my fingers while preparing a scone and came over with a finger bowl and serviette of course you pay dearly even taking into account the strong euro prices at the george v like other luxury hotels are stratospheric internet access at &# for hours feels like highway robbery and when a club sandwich small shrimp salad and a couple of coke lites come to &# you know you arent in kansas anymore the room hotel on avenue george v in easy walking distance to the seine the champs elysees and the arc de triomphe has a historic pedigree opened in the hotel served as eisenhowers headquarters at the end of world war ii and was a showplace for parisian society and couture shows for the next few decades before gradually losing its luster saudi prince al waleed bin talal bought it in closed it for a &# million two year restoration and reopened under four seasons management in we checked in through the opulent marble lobby with giant tapestries gilded mirrors louis xvi style furnishings and white marble statues the flower budget is almost &# monthly overseen by celebrity florist jeff leatham who uses about blooms a week and places bouquets in towering vases at jaunty gravity defying angles all over the hotel during our stay roses and other flora in yellow tones were complemented by massive white orchids in tall terrariums groggy after an overnight air france flight we were happy that the one bedroom suite was ready when we arrived well before check in time it had one flaw the bedroom and living room while spacious were separated by sliding doors with glass windowpanes instead of a solid door letting one person sleep while the other read or watched television while some rooms on higher floors have terraces ours didnt and there wasnt much of a view the bedroom had no window and the living room in a recessed part of the hotel looked out over another wing to the street beyond on the other hand the setback muffled street noise and the window still let in plenty of light i was too tired to make my usual inquiry about a possible switch to a different room we took a quick nap ordered some room service so we could dash out to a photography exhibit and experienced our first euro shock a bowl of chicken consomme with raviolis more than &# our first evening we dined at the hotels le cinq restaurant though it was recently demoted to two michelin stars from three it provided the best meal we had during our stay served in the same &amp gray and gold toned room as breakfast with miniature palm trees and a view over an inner courtyard the meal felt special with yellow rose petals on the table waiters brought little extras between courses such as eggplant caviar with parmesan shortbread and watercress soup with a dollop of real caviar for a main course i tried partridge from brittany while my husband had shrimp lasagna with vegetable filling we felt warm and glowing until the bill arrived though wed only had some wine by the glass at &# each rather sparingly poured the tally topped &# including service still we enjoyed the dining room an adjacent lounge with a grand piano and a nearby bar all extremely pretty places to sit relax and do serious people watching despite the high food and beverage prices at least we didnt feel like we were being had at every turn one morning my husband saw that the fruit hed ordered had doubled in price from the day before the waiter said that one order had been part of the continental breakfast another a "melange" of fruits that was a more expensive stand alone fruit plate but he quickly reduced the bill to reflect the lesser price we used the adequately equipped gym and booked some excellent massages at the spa i had a sauna and relaxed in the lounge with a cup of ginger tea and through a picture window watched a family splash away in the pool the hotel is very child friendly offering child size bathrobes and special toiletries childrens menus and bedtime milk and cookies not to mention snacks for grown ups returning to our suite in the late afternoon wed find miniature panna cottas with raspberries or some other treat on the coffee table we liked the large marble bathroom with two sinks a separate wc and bidet a deep tub and a separate shower there was an extra guest powder room and a pretty minibar area the suite decorated in gold tones had two closets including a large walk in one though it was on the dark side in the end the strike didnt inconvenience us much thanks to a car service whose driver zipped us off to museums and galleries in the evenings we dined at a couple of famous restaurants guy savoy terrific with attentive service and apicius stylish but the food didnt measure up the chilly weather was still good enough to let us do some serious legwork on our last day i struck out for an early evening walk down the champs elysees humming the old joni mitchell song about doing the very same thing though i wandered into louis vuitton instead of a cafe or a cabaret i wasnt in a buying mood at these prices but i was a free woman in paris and felt unfettered and alive
