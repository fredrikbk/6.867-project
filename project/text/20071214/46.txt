its planning not just location location the complaints of barry b lepatner "business bookshelf getting hammered " leisure &amp arts dec in his book "broken buildings busted budgets" are accurate and well founded when my wife and i built our own home we experienced unpredictable and often expensive negotiations with our sub contractors mr lepatner points out that any client is at the absolute mercy of the contractor once the job is started this is very much the case the original bid from our electrician was only about a third of the final cost many residential contractors make their profits through change orders our plumber loved our upgrades and we noticed that his change order bills were always at least a hundred dollars more than his original verbal estimate we learned many valuable lessons the hard way but overall we stayed within our budget and tried to enjoy the stressful excitement of "doing it ourselves " i had been a carpenter for many years before we built our own home and after being on both sides of the table as a client and a worker i gained a little perspective on residential building any project whether it is a kitchen remodel or new home would go more smoothly if clients would work out as many details as possible with their architect before they print the plans before the job starts clients should have all their fixtures cabinets paint colors and flooring picked out and then not change them it is also important to realize that old houses have hidden problems so plan for extra costs during remodels in short if you want to stay within budget dont change your mind if clients did this they wouldnt need to stand up to anyone holding a nail gun caleb giffin colusa calif
