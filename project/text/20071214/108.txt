americans who know of the church largely through major media outlets might be forgiven for perceiving it as populated by men who are hell bent on the destruction of childrens souls if they read philip pullmans trilogy for children "his dark materials " their perception might be strengthened a movie based on the first book in that series "the golden compass " appeared in theaters last week and plans for the other ones are in the works although the series is a fantasy set in multiple worlds there is no doubt that mr pullman a self described atheist targets christianity and particularly a rather thinly disguised catholic church in these childrens books while the movie has excised some of the antireligious themes of the first book the name of the most evil institution in its narrative universe remains "the magisterium " some moviegoers wont recognize this term but the magisterium is the teaching authority of the church led by the pope in the movie one of the leaders in the magisterium the beautiful but vicious mrs coulter is played by nicole kidman controversy began to build with the publication of the three books in and but it has taken the release of a major motion picture to bring the dispute to the attention of a wider audience "atheism for kids" is how the catholic league describes the books mr pullman in turn calls his detractors "nitwits " then comes the controversy about the controversy sniffs laura miller in the los angeles times "you have to wonder how much actual reading goes on in the sort of household that welcomes e mails denouncing the golden compass anyway " so is the ferment about "his dark materials" just harry potter vs fundamentalists redux a clash that generates heat but no light probably not first of all "his dark materials " unlike the harry potter series is real literature and as such deserves serious attention mr pullman a graduate of oxford university with a degree in english knows his stuff the books are loaded with allusions to greek mythology and philosophy milton blake and the bible with images ranging from the obvious the garden of eden to the obscure the bene elim or angelic watchers mentioned in genesis these allusions unlike the throwaway latinisms of hogwarts spells drive the plot characters and themes of mr pullmans series indeed a child who investigates them would begin to gain the rudiments of a classical education moreover again in contrast to j k rowlings books which were criticized by some christians for their use of magic and witchcraft mr pullmans series is bluntly anti christian in the third book "the amber spyglass " a former nun tells the two child protagonists lyra and will that "the christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake thats all " the church and its members do nothing but evil the main problem with "his dark materials " however is not the atheism per se but rather its mindless dogmatism there is no such thing as an open minded christian in the series take this quote from "the amber spyglass" "i met an angel she said that all the history of human life has been a struggle between wisdom and stupidity she and the rebel angels the followers of wisdom have always tried to open minds the authority and his churches have always tried to keep them closed " to be fair mr pullman himself noted in a interview that this one sided portrayal is "an artistic flaw " but there it is nonetheless the polemic against religion starts quietly enough in the first book which introduces mr pullmans truly brilliant gift to fantasy literature the personal daemon a daemon is not a demon but more like socrates daimon a sort of guardian spirit that accompanies a person throughout his life in "his dark materials " a daemon is an outward manifestation of a persons soul in animal form childrens daemons change to match their mood or suit their purposes say from a moth to a wildcat but they settle into a fixed form at puberty this change is the crux of the entire series that is the series is about growing up there couldnt be a more time honored general theme for childrens books but mr pullman seemingly found at least part of the impetus for his work in c s lewiss narnia series mr pullmans hatred of those books he says he doesnt mind some of lewiss other works especially "the screwtape letters" is no secret "one girl in the narnia books was sent to hell because she was getting interested in clothes and boys " he noted in actually susan was getting interested in "nylons and lipstick " arguably less important than clothes and boys nor was she "sent to hell " instead she unlike her three siblings remained alive on earth in the last book of the series while susan wasnt "saved " she certainly wasnt damned as lewis wrote to a child concerned about susans fate "perhaps she will get to aslans country in the end in her own way " growing up was not the problem in "his dark materials " however the church condemns growing up particularly sexual awakening "thats what the church does and every church is the same control destroy obliterate every good feeling " claims a character in "the amber spyglass " in mr pullmans world the church by extension condemns the growth life and freedom of the soul itself so strongly does this church want to "save" children from autonomy and the resultant possibility of choosing sin that it literally cuts them away from their daemons destroying their souls mr pullman insists as dan brown did regarding his novel "the da vinci code " that he is only telling a story yet surely he like his character lyra knows that a story is one of the most important things there is in a climactic scene in the third book lyra comes to grief when she spins a fantastic tale to a mythological creature called a harpy who is guarding the underworld "liar liar liar " it screams "so that lyra and liar were one and the same thing " when lyra tells the harpy another story a true one it responds quite differently why "because it was true " says the harpy "because it was nourishing because it was feeding us " "the golden compass" may delight its audiences palate with wonders and even whet its appetite for literature but whether it can nourish them remains to be seen ms baynes is an assistant professor of new testament at missouri state university in springfield mo
