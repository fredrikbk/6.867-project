how baseballs drug bust will play out for the game the former senator made a point of saying that he received little help from current players and had to depend instead on interviews with retired players trainers and strength and conditioning coaches as well as documentary evidence such as checks and money orders made out to dealers and past investigations conducted by law enforcement agencies and the media while stars like mr jeter have deals with national advertisers such as nike and gatorade most baseball players dont have the lucrative deals that many national basketball association and national football league players do say marketing experts while former sen george mitchells report on performance enhancing drugs rocked baseball yesterday the long term marketing and legal implications ultimately may not be too severe say experts in both fields in his much anticipated report which took almost two years to investigate and write mr mitchell linked about players to performance enhancing drugs among them were stars including roger clemens barry bonds andy pettitte and miguel tejada mr mitchell cast a wide net of blame saying that ownership and management were more concerned with their finances than with addressing the drug problem he also blamed the baseballs players union for delaying action for years and for "largely uncooperative" behavior during his investigation "there was a collective failure to recognize the problem as it emerged and to deal with it early on " mr mitchell said during a press conference in new york the former senator made a point of saying that he received little help from current players and had to depend instead on interviews with retired players trainers and strength and conditioning coaches as well as documentary evidence such as checks and money orders made out to dealers and past investigations conducted by law enforcement agencies and the media but rusty hardin an attorney for mr clemens said the report was unfair and the allegations about his client were untrue "theres never going to be any charges filed theres no vehicle or venue to challenge these allegations " despite the immediate damage to the reputation of major league baseball marketers say they arent likely to be scared off the sport in general for example general motors corp s most recent three year mlb sponsorship started in march and ran through the end of the season the auto maker is now in talks with mlb "we understood all along the ramifications of the report we are confident that major league baseball is taking the steps needed to maintain the health of the sport " said ryndee carney a gm spokeswoman but it may be tougher for individual star players affected by the allegations such as mr clemens the superstar pitcher who is currently without a team "for any individuals who are named in it there could be some very specific ramifications because many of them have contract language with their sponsors that says we have a right to re evaluate our relationship with you " said jim andrews senior vice president of sponsorship research firm ieg a unit of wpp group the release of the report comes at a time when marketers are being increasingly wary about endorsement scandals suspended atlanta falcons quarterback michael vicks lucrative endorsement deal from nike vaporized after he pleaded guilty to charges related to dogfighting nike also decided to terminate its deal with sprinter justin gatlin and chose not to renew its contract with track superstar marion jones who has been associated with nike for years both athletes have admitted to using performance enhancing drugs nike and its jordan brand unit have endorsement deals with about two thirds of mlb players including stars like derek jeter alex rodriguez and albert pujols none of them were named in the report "were not in a position to immediately comment on the allegations " said nike spokesman dean stoyer while stars like mr jeter have deals with national advertisers such as nike and gatorade most baseball players dont have the lucrative deals that many national basketball association and national football league players do say marketing experts despite his stinging critique of everyone involved mr mitchell urged forgiveness of most past sins as he unveiled his report "spending more money and years on contentious disciplinary proceedings will keep everyone mired in the past " he said there is also the question of whether prosecutors will pursue criminal charges against any of the players some lawyers suspect they will arguing that evidence has been gathered and the headline grabbing cases may prove to be too enticing to pass up "for a prosecutor its low hanging fruit " says dan ruzumna a former federal prosecutor in private practice in new york still there are a variety of hurdles some of the allegations are based on one source while others lend themselves to an arsenal of deniability mr mitchell said he received a lot of assistance in the investigation from kirk radomski a former clubhouse attendant for the new york mets who has pleaded guilty to distributing performance enhancing drugs mr mitchell also mentioned three interviews conducted with former new york yankees trainer brian mcnamee who worked with mr clemens and mr pettitte ultimately prosecutors may not view pursuing illegal possession as a good use of law enforcement resources "suppliers are most typically the targets of large drug investigations not end users " says daniel gitner a former federal prosecutor and lawyer in new york furthermore statutes of limitations might knock out allegations of activity say before late there is also the matter of whether mlb commissioner bud seligs legacy will be affected by the report although mr selig has received heavy criticism for long ignoring baseballs drug problem others believe he has helped the game turn a corner by commissioning mr mitchells report despite rumors of player use as early as the late s baseball and its union couldnt agree on a mandatory random testing regimen until criticism of that policys perceived loopholes and light punishment prompted the two sides to toughen suspensions ahead of the and seasons in his report mr mitchell suggested a series of remedies that address past criticisms of the mlb drug policy among his suggestions that baseball remove itself from any role in administering tests in favor of an independent body that it adopt more robust year round testing and that it make its testing more transparent to the public mr selig said at a press conference that he hadnt yet read all of mr mitchells report but that he "embraced" the recommendations and disagreed with none of them mr selig said he would implement changes that fell outside the jurisdiction of baseballs collective bargaining agreement and that he hoped to work with union head donald fehr on those that fall within its jurisdiction mr fehr conceded that it now seems "obvious" that the union and owners should have acted sooner but would commit only to considering mr mitchells recommendations russell adams and emily steel contributed to this article
