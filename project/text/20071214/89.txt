schools accused of pushing mainstreaming to cut costs robert macmillan chair of the special education department at bridgewater state college in massachusetts says the plymouth mass public schools are currently cutting costs by moving students from separate centers either public ones operated by multiple districts or private facilities back into community schools and where possible into regular classrooms greece n y for years jonathan schusters mother begged the public schools here to put her son in a special program where he could get extra help for his emotional problems by th grade jonathan had broken his hand punching a wall and been hospitalized twice for depression once because he threatened to kill himself with a pocket knife but teachers insisted that jonathan who suffers from attention deficit disorder learning disabilities and bipolar disorder could get by in regular classrooms his mother kathleen lerch says the reason was cost "it was all about the bottom line " she says citing confidentiality school officials declined to discuss jonathans case but said they seek to provide an appropriate education to all children advocates for the disabled have long promoted the inclusion of special education children in regular classes a practice called mainstreaming many educators view mainstreaming as an antidote to the warehousing of children with special needs in separate and often deficient classrooms and buildings now some experts and parents complain that mainstreaming has increasingly taken on a new role in american education a pretext for cost cutting hurting the children it was supposed to help while studies show that mainstreaming can be beneficial for many students critics say cash hungry school districts are pushing the practice too hard forcing many children into classes that cant meet their needs inclusion has evolved into "a way of downsizing special education " says douglas fuchs a vanderbilt university education professor districts have a powerful motivation to cut special education costs u s schools spend almost twice as much on the average disabled student as they do on a nondisabled peer according to a federal study but the study also found that in recent years per student special education costs rose more slowly than for the general population one of the likely reasons researchers found was cost savings from mainstreaming in fairfax county va an affluent washington d c suburb hired gibson consulting group to study its special education program gibson a firm specializing in education says it has saved clients millions of dollars by "improving productivity and eliminating inefficiencies " the firms president greg gibson says mainstreaming nearly always saves money because regular classrooms have fewer teachers per student gibson found that fairfax spent an average of &# per special education student in all types of classrooms more than for a pupil in general education at special education centers the per student cost was even higher &# mr gibson estimated that the district which currently has a &# billion school budget could save &# million through by closing of the centers and taking other steps to teach more disabled children in regular classrooms fairfax shut down the centers prompting some parent protests fairfax officials acknowledge that the moves reduced costs but say that children are better off in mainstream classrooms they would not specify how much has been saved but said it was far less than mr gibsons projections because special ed students have received additional support robert macmillan chair of the special education department at bridgewater state college in massachusetts says the plymouth mass public schools are currently cutting costs by moving students from separate centers either public ones operated by multiple districts or private facilities back into community schools and where possible into regular classrooms cheryl jacques director of plymouths pilgrim academy a separate public center primarily for students with emotional and behavioral problems says her centers enrollment is dropping because districts are trying to be "economically responsible " though she supports bringing students back to local schools if the children are ready in some cases districts are likely "keeping kids that dont belong there " she says pilgrim charges districts &# a year for each student at plymouths public schools the average cost of a special education student runs &# bruce cole plymouths director of special education counters "i do whats best for the kids " in the greece central school district with students the push for more mainstreaming began in that year steven walts a former maryland schools administrator took over as superintendent in this middle class suburb near rochester n y where many work for eastman kodak co and xerox corp at the time mr walts was under pressure from new york state to include more disabled children in regular classrooms the federal individuals with disabilities education act requires that students be taught when possible in the "least restrictive" environment since congress started pushing for mainstreaming more than a quarter century ago many academic studies have found that the practice helps children with disabilities make academic and social gains the two largest federal studies each examining the records of disabled school age children concluded that while failure rates rose mainstreamed students overall tended to have higher grades and test scores than their counterparts in separate classes in greece mr walts slashed the number of students referred to special outside schools cutting separate classrooms and limiting "resource rooms " or learning centers for students with disabilities from to the percentage of greece special education students considered fully included spending or more of their day in general education classes more than tripled to far exceeding the national average of the number of students receiving special services at all fell below state and federal averages to from special education budgets plummeted too between the and school years greece reduced its spending on programs for disabled students by to &# million from &# million spending on special education dropped to from of total expenditures upset at what they describe as the districts increasing refusal to provide services a group of parents began meeting and comparing notes they suspected that the district was effectively mainstreaming by simply capping the number of students eligible for services some children who were classified as special education students were declassified and placed in regular classrooms with little or no additional help mr walts left greece in to become superintendent of the prince william county public schools in maryland his office referred questions to keith imon an administrator who also worked with mr walts in greece mr imon says mr waltss office never directed employees to deny needed services or set quotas on classifying students as disabled "i can say without a doubt that he makes all decisions based on whats in the best interests of the kids " says mr imon some school officials agreed with parents concerns josephine kehoe who served as interim superintendent after mr waltss departure says principals told her that before she took over they felt "pressure to spend the least amount of money possible" on special education in eight families including jonathan schusters filed a lawsuit accusing greece of denying disabled children a "free appropriate public education" by restricting access to special classrooms eliminating students special education eligibility and dumping them in regular classes the suit which became a class action in u s district court in rochester cited a year old th grader with aspergers syndrome a form of autism the student identified only by the initials "k b " made the honor roll when receiving instruction in a separate student class but when placed in a regular classroom in the school year k b got failing grades the suit says to settle the lawsuit the families and the school district agreed to appoint margaret mclaughlin a special education professor at the university of maryland as a joint expert to evaluate the districts program after examining documents and conducting extensive interviews prof mclaughlin says she was "quite stunned" by how much cost was influencing the push toward mainstreaming "it was boom one year the kid was in a private placement and the next year he was dumped into a regular school with really limited support " she says in a legal settlement in august the district acknowledged no deficiencies but agreed to place no limit on the number of students who would be placed in separate programs or receive other services under the consent decree the number of separate classrooms with eight students and a teacher and an aide would increase from nine in the school year to a dozen in already since the school year the percentage of students in fully inclusive classrooms has declined to from steven achramovitch who became superintendent in november declined to discuss the lawsuits allegations or prof mclaughlins conclusions over the past year the district has hired about new special education teachers a increase and added &# million to the school years &# million special education budget "its going to be more costly no question about it " he says mr achramovitch adds that the moves are unconnected to the lawsuit "well do whatever is in the best interests of our kids " he says deborah hoeft greeces special education director says district surveys show that most parents of disabled children are pleased with the systems services amid the controversy greece received national attention last year when jason mcelwain then a year old senior with autism scored points in the last four minutes of a high school basketball game jason met president bush and school officials hailed the student as an example of the success of including disabled children in school wide activities some parents praise recently added programs sharon eddy says her son ryan now a fifth grader floundered in mainstream classes until third grade when he transferred into a separate autism class with only eight children the new setting "has been wonderful " she says but others say the district is still denying services in the name of mainstreaming christine latus a former elementary school teacher says her son michael a fifth grader with dyslexia needs a separate specialized program either within the district or at a local private school for children with learning problems instead the system has placed year old michael in a mainstream classroom with students of whom have special needs on a recent morning lisa farina michaels teacher asked him to stand in front of the class since he had grasped the meaning of a graph during a smaller discussion at first michael froze his eyes downcast then he muttered a few nearly inaudible words about his findings at home after school that day michael even with the help of a computer struggled to write sentences about a book he had read "in reading were not getting too much help except when we go into the smaller group " he said michaels reading lags behind his peers by at least two grade levels on a homework assignment this year analyzing a political cartoon michael wrote in a nearly indecipherable scrawl "the message seas that the it dos not wreak " ms farina says she wont discuss individual students but she says she has full time help from a special education instructor as well as visits from other support staff she says the school doesnt have enough students for a special class for dyslexia she says students receive individual attention working in groups of six to eight meanwhile jonathan schuster the student whose mother sought help for his emotional problems says the school system should have pulled him out of mainstream classrooms much earlier around the time the lawsuit was filed the greece schools agreed to put jonathan in a separate class especially for children with emotional problems he settled down and graduated though with a grade point average now years old jonathan lives at home and works in a supermarket stockroom "it was too late " jonathan says "i dont feel i met my full potential "
