citigroup alters course bails out affiliated funds taking on &# billion of assets further dents banking giants capital mr paulsons other major initiatives include an effort to prod mortgage servicing companies to ease the terms of certain mortgages that would otherwise jump to much higher interest rates over the next year and an as yet unsuccessful effort to persuade congress to adopt changes in the federal housing administration citigroup inc bruised by mounting losses is bailing out seven affiliated investment entities bringing &# billion in assets onto its balance sheet and further denting its depleted capital base the big new york bank said it would provide emergency support to the entities known as structured investment vehicles if it cant find buyers for their short and medium term debt sivs which often hold mortgage backed securities have come under intense scrutiny in the past several months as nervous investors have balked at buying the short term debt known as commercial paper that provides critical funding to the vehicles while citigroups action may ease uncertainty about the future of its sivs it may be the death knell for an industrywide effort to create a rescue fund for the struggling vehicles since september citigroup bank of america corp and j p morgan chase &amp co have been working to set up the fund at the behest of the treasury department but interest in the rescue fund has waned in recent weeks as several banks concluded they couldnt wait for it to get up and running and decided to bail out their own sivs citigroups decision to follow suit underscores how quickly vikram pandit who was named citigroups chief executive tuesday is moving to tackle the many problems facing the bank just two days into his tenure mr pandit decided to reverse repeated assurances by citigroup executives that the sivs would stay off the banks books the banks action could help relieve some of the anxiety in credit markets by removing the threat that the sivs would be forced into selling assets at fire sale prices the depth of the mortgage and credit crises and the risk to the economy have stirred the bush administration and federal reserve to action but their efforts have had little success so far in thawing frozen credit markets helping to organize the so called super siv rescue fund was one of treasury secretary henry paulsons first responses to the market turmoil and was controversial from the start with some critics saying it essentially represented a bailout for the siv industry the banks involved dismissed that notion saying that it would merely provide one more option for sivs that were in trouble mr paulsons other major initiatives include an effort to prod mortgage servicing companies to ease the terms of certain mortgages that would otherwise jump to much higher interest rates over the next year and an as yet unsuccessful effort to persuade congress to adopt changes in the federal housing administration the fed meanwhile has cut its target for short term interest rates by a full percentage point since early august and this week launched in concert with central banks in other countries a new strategy to encourage banks to borrow more from the fed and lend more readily to each other citigroups decision to backstop its sivs is the latest blow to the nations largest financial institution as measured by assets it is already facing massive losses as a result of the global credit crunch that began this summer the bank named mr pandit ceo earlier this week to replace charles prince who stepped down last month after citigroup announced as much as an additional &# billion in potential losses for the fourth quarter yesterday mr pandit also named the banks finance chief to head a broad cost cutting initiative that could result in the elimination of thousands of jobs many investors are hoping he takes more radical steps including breaking up the financial conglomerate "this is just a ding to credibility that they didnt need " said jeffery harte an analyst with sandler oneill &amp partners while mr pandit may be trying to get all of the banks issues out into the open "this makes you question how well they understand some of the exposure on their balance sheet " this latest move also may ratchet up the pressure on citigroup by bringing the siv assets onto its books the banks depleted capital levels will come under further stress last month it bolstered its balance sheet with a &# billion capital infusion from an investment arm of the abu dhabi government citigroups key tier capital ratio a gauge of the banks ability to absorb huge losses stood at about as of sept citigroup said that the siv assets could reduce that ratio by another basis points that would push it even further below the companys internal target level of although it will remain above regulatory requirements to be sure citigroup remains fairly well supplied with capital federal regulators require a bank to have a tier ratio of a bank with a ratio of or higher is considered to be well capitalized while citigroup said it still expects its capital levels to bounce back by next summer its reduced capital ratio may put pressure on the bank to cut its dividend or take other steps to protect its capital position such as bringing in another outside investor a citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment on possible dividend cuts or capital raising plans for weeks wall street analysts and investors have speculated about the implications if citigroup moved the siv assets onto its books betsy graseck a morgan stanley analyst said in a research note wednesday that if citigroup made such a move the company would need to reduce its quarterly dividend payment next year to cents from cents citigroup is the largest player in the siv market which was valued at about &# billion at the start of the credit crunch just a few months ago the bank was boasting to investors that its sivs had nearly &# billion in assets "citis sivs remain robust and their asset portfolios are performing well " said a letter from paul stephens and richard burrows directors in citigroups london based group that oversees the banks sivs although the move will hurt citigroups capital ratios it could take pressure off the wider commercial paper market until now debt investors have feared that a fire sale of assets held by sivs would undercut prices for a host of debt instruments that caused investors to demand higher rates from all kinds of financing vehicles that sell commercial paper these vehicles called conduits provide much needed financing to companies by purchasing assets such as receivables credit card debt and auto loans citigroup isnt pledging to immediately take assets off the hands of the seven sivs it sponsors but providing them with a backstop may give investors confidence that losses are less likely from commercial paper and medium term notes issued by the vehicles indeed citigroup said that it expects the sivs to continue selling assets and it doesnt expect to have to make good on its pledge to provide funding since the credit crunch began sivs have been forced to sell assets in order to pay off maturing debt the vehicles which were created to operate separately from the banks and stay off their balance sheets issue short term debt to investors and use the funds to buy higher yielding assets the business model only works if sivs can keep issuing new debt as old borrowings come due and it fell apart as the subprime mortgage meltdown accelerated this summer in a statement yesterday citigroup said its action is separate from the industrywide rescue effort and that it "continues to support" the formation of a rescue super fund spokeswomen for j p morgan and the treasury department declined to comment as did a spokesman for blackrock inc which last week was named as manager of the super fund which is formally known as the master liquidity enhancement conduit citigroup said the sivs that it sponsors currently have &# billion in assets down from &# billion two weeks ago and &# billion in august like other banks citigroup has been selling assets to ease pressure on the vehicles already banks like hsbc holdings plc in the united kingdom have taken similar actions to support their sivs further reducing the need for a super fund citigroups action leaves two major financial firms that havent yet taken steps to restructure their siv debt germanys dresdner bank a unit of allianz se and bmo financial group and its bank of montreal unit allianz said on nov that there was no plan to bring assets held by dresdners siv k corp onto its balance sheet a bank of montreal spokesman couldnt be reached for comment citigroups move is surprising because the bank made it clear in its most recent filing with the securities and exchange commission that it had "no contractual obligation" to provide full support to any of its sivs in addition citigroup said it "will not take actions that will require the company to consolidate the sivs " citigroup previously had agreed to provide up to &# billion as emergency support to its sivs the sivs had drawn down &# billion of that as of sept in making yesterdays decision citigroup cited recent moves by credit rating agencies that threatened to make the siv problem worse late last month moodys investors service downgraded or put on review debt totaling &# billion that was sold by sivs a moodys report at the time spotlighted problems that citigroup faced as moodys downgraded or put on review for possible downgrade &# billion issued by six
