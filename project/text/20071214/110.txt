weekend journal tastings cracking the chianti code a few dollars more reap big rewards classicos charms over the next few weeks with company coming over and cold weather arriving youre probably going to need a red wine that will make everyone happy this is it chianti but not just any chianti of course "chianti" is one of those words that makes people smile maybe its because so many of us remember it fondly from our youth maybe its because it makes us think of the beauty of tuscany or maybe its just that the wine tastes good in any event a wine that brings a smile before its even opened is certainly a good start unfortunately its not quite that easy over the years we have become increasingly disappointed with very inexpensive chianti the wine of our youth weve found that most chianti under &# or so has become so simple and bland that it tastes too often like industrial wine it lacks the lusty earthiness and true tastes of tuscan soil that are so fundamental to chiantis charm at the same time there has been a revolution in the quality of better chianti in tasting after tasting over the past decade we have found that somewhat more expensive chianti is made more thoughtfully than ever but generally has stayed true to its roots so here is some very specific advice on what to look for over the next few weeks if youre picking up a bottle of red to take to someones house if youre entertaining or if you simply want to relax with a bottle of wine after all the festivities are over chianti classico from the vintage chianti classico which is made primarily from the sangiovese grape comes from a specific traditional region of tuscany and was a very good vintage that now is widely available we picked up of them from stores in five states to see if they were reliable the answer is in a word yes when we think about good chianti we think about red bricks this is a bit difficult to explain since weve never actually eaten a red brick but if you think about why red brick is so attractive and homey relaxed elegance a sense of earth elemental smells you can get an idea why we think of chianti the same way we found that these wines overall had a combination of easy drinkability and confident depth that made them special "these are not fussy wines " dottie said at one point and thats important the best ones have relaxed dry fruit lively acidity nice oak balance and an underpinning of earth and minerals that tell you where they came from some have a little touch of chocolate and quite a few taste like blackberries or black cherries theyre medium bodied not so light that they can be ignored but not so heavy that theyre hard to drink people who know nothing about wine will drink them lustily because they simply taste good people who know something about wine will be impressed that they are classicos from a good year and will drink them lustily because they simply taste good of course they are not all winners a few have fallen victim to over oaked modernity with tastes that are too sleek and have lost their slightly rough hewn tuscan charm and there wasnt a single wine that totally wowed us none of the wines rated higher than very good but the average level of quality was quite good after almost every flight we talked about the consistent friendliness charm and pleasing tastes of the wines favorites from our tasting are listed in the attached index while its always impossible to know what wines you might find we feel confident that if you stick with chianti classico from youll have a soulful tasty experience after one of our flights we took some of our leftovers to our next door neighbors they called the next day "we hadnt had chianti in a long time and wed forgotten how much we enjoyed it " they said wed guess that would be a pretty common reaction time is running short for holiday presents in case you missed our recent columns with gift suggestions here they are a small wine refrigerator that holds to bottles
