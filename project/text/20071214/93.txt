every business day sign up for the e mail here federal communications commission chairman kevin martin yesterday made clear he will muscle through rules that relax the ownership limits on big media companies no matter how much controversy they have provoked impatient with decades old restrictions that prevent ownership of both a newspaper and a broadcaster in the largest u s markets mr martin announced plans this fall to hold two last hearings on the rule changes with little notice and a final commission vote next tuesday a bipartisan group of senators has sought to deter that vote as the wall street journal notes but at a senate commerce committee hearing yesterday he rejected their request and yet agency insiders tell the journal serious negotiations among fcc members have barely begun with the commissions two democrats already outraged at mr martins actions the expected approval next week would clearly be along party lines "the fccs two democrats say they want to slow the process down by as much as six months to allow the commission time to consider how relaxation of media ownership laws would affect diversity and local news content " the journal says republicans though argue that democrats and consumer groups are trying to run out the clock until a possibly democratic administration is elected next november at the senate hearing mr martin was accused of "rushing to help big media companies at the publics expense " as the los angeles times reports democratic sen john d rockefeller and others complained about a lack of openness at the commission adding that congress could try to overhaul its procedures next year and senate republicans criticized mr martin for pushing through the vote despite such widespread opposition "i dont see why you need to force this thing to a head on " sen trent lott said "why give us an argument to attack you all with " media companies have also complained about mr martins plans while consumer groups say he is encouraging consolidation too much the media conglomerates argue he isnt going far enough at a time when the industries are evolving so quickly when urged by one senator to work for wider support before the vote mr martin responded "im not convinced on media ownership there ever will be consensus " citi gets its debt back citigroup yesterday said it will move back onto its own books &# billion in assets from what have become the infamous structured investment vehicles created to hold huge amounts of debt backed securities and the risk that came with them "citigroup was forced to bring the assets onto its balance sheet because of a potential review by the credit ratings firms " the wall street journal says "while citigroups action may ease uncertainty about the future of its sivs it may be the death knell for an industrywide effort to create a rescue fund for the struggling vehicles " the paper adds citigroup bank of america and j p morgan had been leading efforts to set up that fund but found little desire to participate among other financial institutions the new york times notes the move came just as citis new chief executive vikram pandit "began to place his stamp on the giant bank" and that hours earlier citi announced the departure of chief operating officer robert a druskin but the journal points out that while the siv action will cause citis capital levels to decline only slightly the weaker financial condition could "prevent any dramatic moves by mr pandit " tokyo exchange chief seeks tighter regulation tokyo stock exchange chief atsushi saito "stepped up his attack on japans corporate governance yesterday saying the exchange was almost powerless to stamp out bad practices that have damaged the markets reputation " the financial times reports mr saito said investors in companies listed on the exchange are subject to abuses that other leading markets wouldnt tolerate from listed companies an example he cited is the way japanese companies can sell large amounts of shares to a third party that dilutes the holdings of existing shareholders without revealing the identity of the third party the ft says "sometimes it is said that black money is coming in in that way criminal money is getting into the financial market " mr saito said "the tse is a kind of quasi private company we are not a government organization so unless there is a criminal breach what we can do at most is to issue a warning " also of note guardian india aims to have a missile defense system able to track and shoot down incoming warheads by scientists in new delhi announced in
