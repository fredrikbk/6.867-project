weekend journal taste de gustibus o christmas tree the precise motive for beginning this annual trek is lost in the fog of last years christmas rush but a vague recollection lingers that we thought doing so would connect us more intimately with this object remind us that it was a living thing with a story of its own the national ag safety database nasd a government sponsored program to disseminate information about well safe agricultural practices describes christmas tree farming thus growing maintaining and harvesting christmas trees can be a dangerous job there was a dull thunk followed by a swooshing sound and then a thud my wife looked at me in alarm i sprang from the car to survey the damage our minivan sat undamaged just inside the garage of our building our christmas tree was less lucky it had been dragged off the roof of the car and lay on the ground half in and half out of the garage the trunk was split down the middle at the bottom and the top of the tree was cocked at a crazy angle at any moment the automatic garage door would give the middle a good crushing to finish the job this year for the second time my family engaged in a ritual that may be fast becoming a tradition for us we traveled north to pick out and cut down a christmas tree the precise motive for beginning this annual trek is lost in the fog of last years christmas rush but a vague recollection lingers that we thought doing so would connect us more intimately with this object remind us that it was a living thing with a story of its own that and my sons now ages and liked the idea of getting to wield a saw having never cut down our family tree as a child i thought that the project would involve wandering out into a trackless snowy wilderness saw in hand looking for just the right sort of to foot tree to bring home the tree farms we found were not of this sort christmas trees in reality are an industrial product with close to million of them sold every year they have to be they are grown in neat little rows segregated by type and size walking among them is in some ways not very different from picking one out in a parking lot many who embark on this tree cutting journey imagine that they will procure the "perfect" tree the reality is more complicated we dont expect trees growing outside to conform to some ideal of symmetry and fullness of branch even in the ersatz environment of the tree farm its hard to find this kind of dream tree but the best reason for venturing out to a farm for your tree has nothing to do with perfection the tree farms themselves are more kitschy than quaint one of the ones we visited offered "hay rides" from the parking lot to the trees this involves a bored looking teenager driving a tractor past hay bales to the lot populated by your preferred species of conifer but in one sense at least the experience is a genuine throwback to a simpler time in an age in which you need a personal escort to take a box cutter from the shelf at home depot up to the cash register tree farms are still happy to hand you a saw and let you or even your young children cut down a tree with it there are no waivers to sign no indemnifications against severed limbs thrown out backs or trees that fall the wrong way onto unsuspecting minors no lawyer in his right mind would sign off on such an arrangement but then there dont seem to be many lawyers around which is probably just as well the national ag safety database nasd a government sponsored program to disseminate information about well safe agricultural practices describes christmas tree farming thus "growing maintaining and harvesting christmas trees can be a dangerous job equipment involved in this work has the potential to injure those working with it " it adds for good measure "use care when cutting and felling christmas trees " somehow despite my previous failure to familiarize myself with these warnings we had managed to cut fell and transport our tree without incident until we got home that is the nasd makes no mention of the dangers of driving into a garage with insufficient overhead clearance but i didnt have time to ponder who should be held responsible for that oversight as the garage door came down toward our tree after pulling it to safety and enlisting my sons to help get it into our apartment we found our tree stand and surveyed the damage more fully a number of branches had been pulled off but the crack in the trunk seemed reasonably well stabilized by the stand and the top was still partially attached so we propped it back into place more or less in my limited experience any tree once removed from its relatively natural environment reveals blemishes gaps and asymmetries that the mind is inclined to overlook outdoors but unlike a manufactured product whose shortcomings we are taught to blame on the producer or retailer the trees faults come to be owned by you after all you chose it and cut it down managing to do so without injury or bloodletting is your responsibility and its no one elses fault either if you happen to drive it into a garage door on the way home this year my sons chose our tree it might not have been my first choice or my wifes but we decided they should be allowed to make the decision and live with the consequences it wasnt "perfect" even before i nearly broke it in two coming home but its ours and it has a story now my children couldnt wait to put the lights on and start trimming it well cut our own tree again next year though well park on the street mr carney is a member of the
