citigroup cure tough love or kid gloves deep cuts or break up pose expensive risks quick natural choices citigroup executives already have gone through these breakup scenarios and found that the bank its capital depleted by losses on mortgage securities may face regulatory scrutiny see its credit rating cut and be hit with a big tax bill according to an outside advisor who helped the bank to analyze a breakup some interpreted the remarks as a sign that the former morgan stanley executive who joined citigroup in july after the company bought his hedge fund isnt wedded to the "financial supermarket" model that his predecessors steadfastly defended two days after vikram pandit took the top job at citigroup inc the bank capitulated on its off balance sheet financing vehicles lost its chief operating officer and began "a companywide review of our structure and expense base " but the big question hanging over mr pandit is whether he should take a meat cleaver to the citigroup empire doing so would please many investors and analysts who say the banks parts would be worth more than the whole but such a plan might be costlier than people think citigroup executives already have gone through these breakup scenarios and found that the bank its capital depleted by losses on mortgage securities may face regulatory scrutiny see its credit rating cut and be hit with a big tax bill according to an outside advisor who helped the bank to analyze a breakup the retirement of chief operating officer robert druskin wasnt a shock he was a citigroup veteran recruited by the banks architect sandy weill and he was a close ally of former ceo charles prince who resigned last month as the bank warned of billions of dollars in mortgage related losses mr druskin oversaw the last big round of cuts last spring which included about jobs or about of citigroups staff citigroup executives have again been instructed to find areas to cut and the result may be thousands more layoffs next year people familiar with the matter say other less dramatic moves are more likely in the near future including better integration of businesses and management shuffling in a memo to employees mr pandit named chief financial officer gary crittenden to lead the effort the move to consolidate &# billion of structured investment vehicles onto its balance sheet showed how much pressure mr pandit is under to get the bank back in order citigroup was forced to bring the assets onto its balance sheet because of a potential review by the credit ratings firms and while the banks capital levels will decline only slightly it may prevent any dramatic moves by mr pandit "we think it would be much more likely for vikram to cut the dividend replenish capital more quickly get the ship righted and then possibly consider splitting the company up several years down the road " morgan stanley analyst betsy graseck wrote to clients wednesday a few hours after the board named him ceo on tuesday mr pandit told analysts and investors that one of his top priorities is "an objective and dispassionate review of all our businesses " asked about the possibility of spinoffs mr pandit didnt slam the door some interpreted the remarks as a sign that the former morgan stanley executive who joined citigroup in july after the company bought his hedge fund isnt wedded to the "financial supermarket" model that his predecessors steadfastly defended one idea that has been discussed is merging citigroups thriving wealth management business in particular its smith barney retail brokerage with its struggling u s retail banking group one person said that would be a natural outgrowth of a strategy already under way in which smith barney brokers now work in some citibank branches combining the units would parallel mr pandits approach to citigroups investment bank during his brief tenure overseeing the unit mr pandit took steps to encourage greater cooperation between different types of bankers to provide more seamless service to clients a citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment analysts estimate that if citigroup splintered into several companies a u s retail bank an overseas retail bank an investment bank and a retail brokerage the entities could have a combined value of to more than citigroups current stock price with citigroups shares down about this year those scenarios appeal to frustrated investors the most commonly mentioned breakup scenario would entail citigroup spinning off one or more units to shareholders such a transaction would be tax free but while citigroup shareholders might gain the company might not by shedding profitable business lines citigroup would be relinquishing a source of retained earnings an important part of a banks capital base capital levels measure a banks financial strength essentially gauging how much of a cushion it has to absorb major losses "that in and of itself might argue against a spinoff because it would deplete their capital " said robert willens an accounting and tax expert at lehman brothers that could be a deal breaker citigroups capital levels remain above regulatory minimums but have fallen below the companys internal target of with citigroup bracing for as much as &# billion in mortgage related losses in the fourth quarter the capital levels could dive again regulators might balk at a breakup plan that would further erode the capital cushion "i dont think breaking up the whole business is going to be something that regulators will look on with great fondness right now " especially with fresh write downs looming said christopher whalen a managing director at institutional risk analytics given citigroups capital plight some analysts have suggested that citigroup could sell a business line and use the proceeds to shore up its capital levels smith barney for example could prove attractive to a company such as bank of america corp which lacks a major retail brokerage force david hendler an analyst at creditsights inc said that if citigroup sustains major additional write downs selling a unit might be the only way for the company to avoid slicing its quarterly dividend but a sale would generate a hefty tax bill the outside adviser to citigroup who has evaluated the feasibility of spinoffs for the company says taxes could consume about of the proceeds of such a transaction and therefore wouldnt be worthwhile given the revenue citigroup would be sacrificing meanwhile shedding units could inflate the borrowing costs for citigroup and any newly independent businesses citigroup currently enjoys high credit ratings keeping its borrowing costs low in large part because of its diverse business model if one segment stumbles another is likely to pick up the slack the result at least in theory is a stable income stream "anything they do to de diversify is a negative consideration in the rating " said tanya azarchs a managing director in the financial institutions ratings group at standard &amp poors "each of its parts would not necessarily get an aa rating on its own " the parent company also could see its ratings cut she said robin sidel contributed to this article
