weekend journal review film smith shines but script falters in i am legend rambling plot sinks tale of man vs zombies sluggish kite runner so youre the last human being in new york city maybe on earth thats not good since youre a social animal and you can hardly hang out with the hordes of murderous zombies who emerge from their tenebrous hives every night on the other hand youve got the city to yourself in the daytime no gridlock no pickpockets no bicycle messengers to dodge such is the plight of will smith in "i am legend " just as it was essentially the situation that confronted charlton heston and vincent price in earlier thrillers adapted from the same sci fi novel by richard matheson but the plight of the audience is this the star as solo practitioner does a terrific job of holding our attention when were not taking in surreal vistas of a deserted manhattan that are fascinating in their own right still zombies are zombies and this nasty lot mostly digital creations of variable quality keep draining the distinction that the movie seeks and occasionally finds the cause of humanitys downfall was we are told a virus created by genetic tinkering in the course of cancer research in the price film the "the last man on earth " it was plain old plague while mr hestons vehicle "the omega man" blamed it on a world wide biological war times change and movies scramble to keep up with them will smiths character a military virologist named robert neville has an immunity to the lethal virus which has left the worlds few survivors zombified and for much of the movie mr smith himself seems immune to the formula encroachments of the horror genre he certainly makes the most of what the basic plot device gives him a dog to talk to and to succor far better an empathic pooch than tom hankss volleyball in "cast away" exercise equipment to work out on the actor is in impressive shape an assault rifle to shoot with the targets of choice being wild deer and wilder zombies the city as a theme park to explore at ones peril after the crowds have left in one of the most memorable vignettes neville drives golf balls onto city streets while standing atop one wing of the blackbird spy plane thats parked on the towering flight deck of the aircraft carrier become museum intrepid "i am legend " which was directed by francis lawrence is more than a plot device the story begins on a note of hope and ends with a surprise when the film flashes back to new yorks last days and hours as a populated city andrew lesnies camera finds awful grandeur in the rising chaos the production designer was naomi shohan neville believes plausibly enough that he can find a cure for the worlds viral ill as solitude and desperation take their toll on him though he takes on the demeanor of an archetypal mad scientist and the film becomes a showcase for its stars dramatic gifts mr smith also gets to do a charming imitation of bob marley the movie desperately needs his sense of fun in an eloquent scene about marley as an artist with a virologists approach to using art but the herky jerky script by mark protosevich and akiva goldsman favors vignettes and set pieces over dramatic development and those damned zombies are everywhere overwhelming the proceedings with their slobbering and howling its the end of civilization as seen by edvard munch the kite runner when filmmakers decide to adapt a widely admired book they assume a heavy debt load marc forster and david benioff the director and script writer of "the kite runner " have discharged their debt dutifully but without daring or passion the film set mainly in afghanistan makes a workmanlike stab at evoking that nations recent turbulent history from the last peaceful days of the monarchy through the soviet invasion to the talibans malefic reign the afghan sequences were actually shot in china and the boys at the core of khaled hosseinis first novel wealthy amir and his friend hassan the son of a servant in amirs house are touching at the outset playing together heedlessly and flying their fighter kites yet their story of childhood devotion and betrayal never catches fire for theyre played by non professional youngsters who act as if theyd been directed to concentrate on one emotional state at a time happiness willfulness devotion submissiveness and had done their work all too earnestly in a movie about a storyteller amir as an adult in america is played by khalid abdalla the storytelling pace moves between deliberate and sluggish even the crucial scene an instant of betrayal that leads to the heros decades long quest for expiation and redemption proves perfunctory though its tasteful enough if thats what you want from a depiction of ghastly predation the only reliable source of energy is homayoun ershadi a powerful actor who plays baba amirs westernized father indeed baba provides the films first moment of genuine drama when he decides to defend a woman he doesnt know from a soviet soldier who may well kill him by that time though almost an hour has drifted by youth without youth youth without youth " francis ford coppolas first film in a decade starts with a literal coup de foudre a lightning bolt that strikes the hero an aging professor of linguistics named dominic matei and rejuvenates him after nearly killing him dominic who is played by tim roth finds himself beset by an anguishing paradox hes now a young man with old memories and unquenchable longings to find his lost love laura to finish the book that constitutes his lifes work what passes for a plot has the professor pursued by nazis his apparent immortality has intrigued hitlers eugenicists but the essence of "youth without youth " which was shot luminously in romania lies in its solemn speculations about aging time and consciousness mr coppola is one of the cinemas peerless masters and i would have enjoyed nothing more than a chance to celebrate his new film im truly sorry to say then that i found it impenetrable dvd tip the sine qua non of zombiedom remains "night of the living dead" the low budget horror flick that george a romero unleashed on an unsuspecting world almost four decades ago radiation from outer space is the reason given for a sudden wave of zombie attacks but the main reason for the films enduring popularity is its claustrophobic intensity two groups of people board themselves up in a small farmhouse to defend themselves against the slavering flesh eaters
