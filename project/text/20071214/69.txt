osteoporosis drug is amgens hope for a strong future biotech giant amgen inc reeling from safety and regulatory problems that have sunk sales of its flagship anemia drugs is hoping to find salvation in the &# billion global market for osteoporosis medications sales of those two drugs have plunged in recent quarters in the face of food and drug administration safety warnings tighter dose limits and stricter medicare reimbursement all reflecting heightened risk of heart attack stroke and cancer progression linked to the drugs biotech giant amgen inc reeling from safety and regulatory problems that have sunk sales of its flagship anemia drugs is hoping to find salvation in the &# billion global market for osteoporosis medications at a big cancer meeting in san antonio today scientists will introduce the first of a series of pivotal studies of the companys experimental drug denosumab for the bone weakening disease for amgen a lot is riding on the new data "this molecule represents the great majority of value investors ascribe to amgens pipeline " says eric schmidt a biotech analyst with cowen &amp co "the market has put a lot of hope" into it he says denosumab d mab for short could achieve sales topping &# billion a year if and when approved for both osteoporosis and cancer patients osteoporosis which results from aging or cancer or as a side effect of some medications afflicts more than million americans the new study will evaluate the ability of d mab to strengthen bones of breast cancer patients taking hormone blockers that put them at risk for osteoporosis and fractures but the market for bone building drugs is crowded and even if the data are favorable in this and other soon to be reported studies the twice yearly injectable drug wont have an easy time becoming the success the company desperately needs when d mab emerged as a promising prospect from genetic studies that amgen began in executives at the thousand oaks calif company viewed it as having the potential to rival its two blockbuster anemia treatments aranesp and epogen but sales of those two drugs have plunged in recent quarters in the face of food and drug administration safety warnings tighter dose limits and stricter medicare reimbursement all reflecting heightened risk of heart attack stroke and cancer progression linked to the drugs as a result amgen shares have fallen nearly since the beginning of the year as investors have lopped &# billion off the companys market capitalization which is now about &# billion now d mab the only potential big seller nearing fda approval is amgens best hope to recover from its recent setbacks analysts expect the company to file for that approval by early d mab grew out of an international rivalry in the mid s to discover the keys to a basic biological pathway now known to be involved in physical processes ranging from the immune defense system to bone building "we were looking for novel genes similar to our emerging blockbusters like epogen " says amgen researcher david lacey racing against other teams from japan and the u s amgen hoped to discover some genes in the pathway that could be used as the basis of new medications dr lacey and his team inserted several genes into mice to see how the protein produced by the genes would affect the animals when the researchers subsequently x rayed the animals with one new gene they found to their surprise that it led the animals to develop much stronger bones "i think we have a drug here " dr lacey recalls saying the scientists then fashioned a genetically engineered therapy that it hoped would work better than the mouse protein the monoclonal antibody now know as d mab "discoveries are symphonies of luck " dr lacey says describing how serendipity often goes hand in hand with science in the hunt for new medicines dr lacey a year old lean pennsylvanian who was drawn to science as a boy when he watched the russian sputnik satellite hurtle into space in spent his early career at washington university st louis researching basic human bone biology he made the leap to amgen in to do therapeutic research three years after joining the company dr laceys luck almost ran out when he was stricken by head and neck cancer "its why half my neck is gone" he says wryly he underwent grueling radiation and chemotherapy now a decade later as amgens vice president of basic research he is steering the development of a drug that may help other cancer patients survive the rigors of treatment the data from a patient study being presented today are intended to show whether dr laceys molecule can help shore up skeletal structure in breast cancer patients treated with hormone blocking drugs known as aromatase inhibitors breast cancer patients treated with these medicines have a heightened risk of bone fractures the study will measure changes in bone density compared with a placebo or dummy drug in amgen expects to reap the results of a bigger study in thousands of women taking d mab to prevent fractures in postmenopausal osteoporosis other studies nearing conclusion will test the drug in men with varying stages of prostate cancer and in other diseases that stress bones fragile bones are largely but not exclusively a female issue about eight million women and two million american men have osteoporosis according to the national osteoporosis foundation some million suffer brittle bones in the u s europe and japan says amgen citing world health organization estimates "one third of hip fractures occur in men " says matthew smith head of genito urinary oncology at massachusetts general hospital cancer center and an amgen consultant amgen hopes d mab can protect bones of prostate cancer patients on hormone lowering drugs its boldest gamble is a study testing whether it can prevent prostate cancer from spreading to the bones "its a serious problem for which there is no established therapy " says dr smith in earlier studies d mab has bolstered bone mineral density of the spine and hip its side effects so far include indigestion and low calcium levels d mab faces a host of rival drugs already on the market among them are fosamax by merck &amp co reclast and zometa by novartis ag actonel by procter &amp gamble co and boniva co promoted by roche holding ag and glaxosmithkline plc all of these drugs belong to a family known as bisphosphonates taken as a pill or iv infusion the drugs may cause heartburn ulcers of the esophagus and rarely a serious jawbone decay d mab is given by injection which could scare off some but amgen is betting that patients will find twice a year dosing is more convenient than weekly or monthly pills amgen also is counting on d mabs now favorable safety profile to hold up but its too early to rule out unforeseen problems which often appear only after many years of use by thousands of patients drugs such as d mab not only harden bone but also may suppress the immune system "it is a potential toxicity " says theresa guise professor of endocrinology and medicine at the university of virginia in charlottesville and an amgen adviser still a quarter of her patients no longer benefit from older drugs and need new treatment one man suffered fractured vertebrae while simply sitting on a plane she says after a bruising year kevin sharer amgens chief executive still expresses faith in d mabs "blockbuster potential " but he adds "well pay close attention to safety " analysts are hedging their bets "a lot more data are needed " says cowens mr schmidt "so far so good but you need more to rule out the unknown "
