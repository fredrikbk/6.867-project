weekend journal painted into a corner auction houses and galleries have always kept a respectful distance in separate parts of the art world now in a bid to conquer the market auctioneers are crossing into rival territory how two major gallery owners are fighting back it was the week of his new york gallerys big fall show and art dealer roland augustine should have been in high spirits in less than hours celebrities like actress chloe sevigny and art collecting moguls like peter brant would be mingling with the gallerys top artists at the opening party but upstairs in his office mr augustine was hunched anxiously over his desk talking on the phone with a client about an invitation hed received to an event sponsored by sothebys "we all need to be more careful about our affiliations with the auction houses " he said his voice rising "you cant just let them fund a dinner or event there is more to it than just money or sponsorship our reputations and our clients our artists are on the line " its a consuming issue for mr augustine and hundreds of other dealers across the country auction houses muscling in on their territory as prices for contemporary art have skyrocketed new works have started to appreciate so quickly that they can be flipped at auction for large sums only a few years or months after theyre first sold at galleries that has led more collectors to go to sothebys christies and smaller players like phillips de pury to sell their work bypassing dealers altogether even more heretical in the art world auction houses are going outside their traditional purview and setting up sales directly between collectors a practice known as "private treaty" selling and offering clients advice on shaping their collections "its a changing world and you have to be really nimble as a business to survive the art world is moving much faster these days " says amy cappellazzo international co head of christies postwar and contemporary department "and a market is a market it doesnt consider feelings of artists or dealers in the process " the new landscape marks a major shift in the way art has been bought and sold for decades galleries and auction houses have long operated in separate spheres of the art market owners of art galleries were the gatekeepers to artists they arranged for buyers to visit artists in their studios steered collectors to emerging art stars and acted as the artists primary representative from first solo show to final retrospective auction houses mainly sold off estates and older works it often took at least years for a work of art sold at a gallery to rise in value enough to be worth reselling at auction now as these spheres collide some dealers are scrambling to fight back and regain control co owner of the prominent luhring augustine gallery in new york and president of the art dealers association of america mr augustine is among the most aggressive and outspoken of his peers his gallery which he founded nearly years ago with lawrence luhring sits behind a set of green garage doors in manhattans chelsea neighborhood on its walls are works by top artists such as rachel whiteread george condo and filmmaker and photographer larry clark clients include eli broad and marie josee and henry kravis some of the countrys biggest contemporary art collectors mr augustine has been ramping up his efforts to protect his business amid growing competition from auction houses in one of the more combative moves he is blacklisting clients who resell at auction art they have bought from him he also buys back his artists work at auction to resell on his own but even as dealers feel squeezed some collectors say they welcome the changes they can often get higher prices for their work when bidding wars break out on the auction floor auction houses are also giving collectors more incentives to sell by offering large guarantees money upfront on their works based on presale estimates whether or not the work eventually sells in contrast sales at a gallery can be less transparent collectors put their trust in a dealer to give them a good price theres also risk when they loan works to galleries on consignment which can mean the pieces sit unsold for months while a dealer looks for a buyer only paying the seller his cut of the profit once it is sold dealers say they offer buyers and sellers of art advantages the auctions usually cant access to works directly from the artists studio and the benefit of privacy there is no public record of how much a work sells for when its handled by a gallery theres another longer term benefit for both collectors and artists say dealers like mr augustine when a work sells at auction they argue it is more likely to end up with an anonymous buyer who might flip it again the best dealers will instead seek out a collector loyal to the artist someone who might later loan or donate the work to a museum thus securing the artists legacy for dealers being cut out of some sales has a more immediate consequence losing out on lucrative deals mr augustine points to a recent example in his own business involving four works by christopher wool a year old u s painter known for his large stenciled "word" paintings and one of the gallerys top artists mr augustine has sold a number of mr wools paintings over the years to anthony pilaro an american collector and philanthropist based in switzerland mr pilaro has founded several companies including duty free shoppers which was sold to lvmh in recently mr pilaro decided to sell four paintings by mr wool that he bought from the gallery between and for a total of about &# at the time the gallery took a commission of or about &# on the paintings the rest went to mr wool in the more dealer dominated market of years past a collector like mr pilaro would most likely have gone back to mr augustine when he was ready to resell the works mr augustine estimates that if he had handled the resale he would have arranged a deal with a buyer for about &# million and taken a commission or &# for himself because mr wool is one of his most important artists mr augustine says he would have given mr wool a cut of his own share or &# but mr pilaro took the paintings to christies which he says guaranteed to pay him of whatever the works sold for christies says it doesnt comment on specific agreements with clients the paintings sold at christies in london in june for over &# million mr augustine sees mr pilaros decision as a personal betrayal mr pilaro he says "can forget about buying a work from us ever again " mr pilaro says selling at auction made more sense in todays market "i would never buy a painting from a gallery at all if they said when i sell it i have to sell it back to them " he says "the buyer has the discretion to do what he wants " mr wool has seen a big jump in the prices his works fetch at auction in recent years earlier this month at an auction in london one of his paintings was bought for more than times the price it originally sold for five years ago at mr augustines gallery but mr wool whose work is sometimes compared to andy warhols says the increased fame comes at a cost when an artists work sells at very high prices it is typically harder for museums to acquire or even borrow it for exhibits in part because the insurance premiums go up mr wool says he tried to persuade mr pilaro not to sell at auction saying that he prefers to see his work in collections "rather than traded constantly like commodities " auction houses are seeing some of their biggest sales and highest profits ever fueled by a contemporary art market that has soared in the past few years last year christies sold &# billion worth of art the highest total in art auction history as of this past week sothebys had brought in more than &# billion for the year compared with &# billion for all of michael mcginnis world wide head of contemporary art at phillips says his house tries to protect the careers of emerging artists by pricing their works conservatively to encourage bidding tobias meyer world wide head of contemporary art at sothebys says auction houses have a different set of priorities regarding artists than dealers do "we are not a set of curators sitting around a table trying to place important collections in museums " he says in the past few years mr augustine together with his partner mr luhring has become more aggressive in defending his business from competition with auction houses he has made it clear to all his clients that if he hears theyve sold a work from his gallery through an auction house without coming to him first hell never do business with them again mr augustine estimates that he has cut loose about of his collectors for flipping works at auction he says he also constantly works to pre empt clients from going to auction houses in the first place in the mornings when he gets to work after hes done with his routine calls to his artists he begins a new round of calls checking in with his clients to see if theyre thinking of reselling any works theyve bought from the gallery if they are he urges them to sell through the gallery mr augustine and the year old mr luhring who is known as the more reserved of the two also talk at least or times a day when one of them is traveling to compare notes on whats happening with their artists and clients mr augustine will also bid at auctions himself about once every six weeks he goes to an auction to buy back works by his artists before they disappear into the hands of collectors he doesnt know mr augustine says while his tactics have alienated some collectors theyve also succeeded in keeping many of his key collectors in line howard rachofsky is a retired hedge fund investment manager based in dallas who has bought work from luhring augustine for more than a decade and has promised his entire collection to the dallas museum of art he says he would never sell a work he bought from luhring augustine at auction before first offering it back to the gallery many dealers echo mr augustines concerns about auction houses but not all are following his lead jeffrey deitch one of new yorks top gallery owners says he doesnt try to stop clients from selling works at auction between and sothebys was a co owner of his gallery deitch projects and mr deitch continues to work closely with the auction house "the auction houses need the galleries and the galleries need the auction houses as dealers we too can really benefit " he says
