business insight a special report a recipe for creating new products take two completely separate categories combine when it comes to brand extension the conventional wisdom is simple dont overextend the idea is that companies should stay within established product lines to avoid dilution of the brand identity after all it makes intuitive sense not to diversify into categories that are remote to core products to rejuvenate established product families brand managers thus typically combine features of one product with those of others in the same family think of a cellphone cum organizer cum computer etc the problem with the dont overextend mind set is that managers can easily fall into the trap of inbreeding they overwhelm customers with additional features taken from related product lines since they believe that each additional feature represents a point of differentiation from the competition managers find it hard to step off this never ending treadmill paradoxically in an attempt to not overextend the product line managers overextend the products features leading to "feature glut" and reduced usability for consumers we believe that the dont overextend mind set has so dominated companies approach to developing new products that it has led them to ignore a critical alternative cross breeding instead of using features from many but similar product categories cross breeding uses only two dissimilar and even highly remote product categories to spark the conception of a truly new product to be sure combining two existing products to form a "hybrid" product is not a new phenomenon classic examples of hybrid products include the sofa bed fax phone and fridge freezer what is new however is forming hybrids by using products from dissimilar or even highly remote product categories for example delonghi spa and kenwood corp produce a stylish radio toaster a two slice toaster with built in fm radio lg electronics inc has launched the fridge tv and a glucose meter phone a cellphone with a built in glucose meter for diabetics users place a drop of blood on a test strip that is then inserted into a slot on the phone an application calculates the blood glucose level displays it on screen and can even automatically send the results via text message to caregivers its a useful product for children and the elderly two vulnerable groups that must be closely monitored and need frequent feedback on treatment options the product co developed with health care equipment maker healthpia america of palisades park n j was launched in south korea in cross breeds such as these revolutionize their parent categories and can even create new categories three examples from the portable music industry illustrate the potential of cross breeding sony corp pioneered the portable music industry created a new lifestyle with the walkman made jogging more entertaining and became a shining example for leveraging its core competency of miniaturization into closely related consumer electronics devices yet apple inc has eaten sonys mp lunch not once but twice first with the introduction of the ipod and then by cross breeding one of the ipods more compact successors the ipod nano with a product as remote as a nike inc jogging shoe a chip inserted in the sole of a special nike running shoe turns the shoe into a step counter that is wirelessly connected to a receiver plugged into the ipod nano using proprietary "tune your run" technology the nano displays information about the number of miles run the pace and calories burned there is also a feature that with one click allows the runner to play a "power song " a personal favorite that can help summon up a burst of energy the lesson it is not enough simply to physically integrate two remote products the various attributes and functionalities of the two remote products need to be carefully examined for potential new links to be created psychologists call the result of this process "emergence" and find that the more remote two products are the more potential for emergence there is successful cross breeding must involve new uses or activities that arise only through the combination of two products to see why consider a running shoe mp player that doesnt meet this test dada footwear a line of shoes owned by los angeles based ll international shoe co has integrated an mp player directly into a running shoe it calls the code m the player is integrated into the shoes heel and tongue music is delivered to speakers in the shoes and to a headset using wireless technology that works within a radius of feet consumers can listen to their music while they wear the shoes or as long as they stay within feet of the shoes however apart from not having to carry an mp player while running there is no other emergent benefit by contrast the lg electronics glucose meter phone doesnt just use the screen to display the data it also uses the phones text messaging function to communicate that data to caregivers lavetta willis president and chief executive of ll international says the next generation of code ms planned for release next fall will let consumers "calculate and evaluate" workout data describing the code m as an "operating system for footwear " she says additional lines are envisioned that include games so how do managers look beyond apparent incompatibilities of highly remote products to identify possible matching points that can revolutionize existing product categories or create new ones a good way to identify possible emergent attributes is by scrutinizing how the products are used singly and together can what at first seem to be unbridgeable differences be connected in ways that provide consumers with benefits unheard of in either of the parent product categories it helps to observe what other main product is involved in your products usage or consumption and how the two can be beneficially combined the cellphone camera combination has become a blockbuster not least because it has put into the hands of ordinary people tools for visual communication in cases of accidents terrorist acts and so forth a fundamental step therefore is to look at products in terms of their external attributes and how they might work in relation to other products key questions to ask include how might a critical function in one product serve a modified purpose when linked to another product the screen of the ipod for example normally displays music information when linked to the nike running shoe however it displays numbers of steps and calories burned another question how can we create links and dependencies between functions of two remote products where before there were none tune your run exploits a link between certain types of music and the inspiration to run new uses or functions that can stem from this process often seem disarmingly obvious in retrospect and make one wonder why no one thought of them before one really does wonder why after sonys invention of the walkman it took brand managers more than a quarter of a century to find out that toning up and tuning in not only go together naturally but can be profitably combined memo to apple for the next generation of tune your run nanos why not give runners the ability to select playlists by changing their pace slow jogging prompts slower songs perky music begins when the consumer starts an end of run kick such a revolutionary function can virtually turn an mp player into a personal coach carefully creating links between functions and features of dissimilar products is at the heart of successful cross breeds not only do product managers sometimes find it hard to imagine emergent benefits between two remote products consumers too may be slow to recognize one in a product theyve never seen before and in some situations consumers may initially see the two products as simply encumbering one another take for example a computer mouse and internet telephone made by sony the vaio vn cx is a mouse that flips open into a fully functional handset for making phone calls using voip or voice over internet protocol calls are announced by either a light on top of the mouse or a ringtone and the user then presses a button on the mouse that instantly turns it into a phone the "ringing rodent " as some reviewers have dubbed it may at first raise eyebrows after all isnt one of the attractions of voip apart from the low price getting rid of the telephone handset the mouse phone seems to be reintroducing the handset in a bizarre way moreover while its being used as a phone the product cant be used as a mouse so what is the point well even with voip one has to make the call on something and while one may get a few strange looks in the wi fi waiting lounge of airports talking to ones mouse its familiar clamshell design makes it feel more like a real phone more comfortable to use and easier to transport when on the move than a headset in addition the mouse phone is designed for mobile use and many laptop computers have touchpads so if a mouse is needed while the phone is in use the touchpad can serve as a backup for combinations involving highly dissimilar products then not only do the added benefits have to be explicitly communicated to consumers but companies must also address the potential negatives and inform consumers how the product overcomes them dada footwear in a list of frequently asked questions on its web site addresses concerns consumers may have about code m shoes can the shoes get wet for instance and what do you do when the shoes wear out but the mp player is still working the shoes are water resistant the site says which means theyre fine in the rain but dont swim in them the site also explains that less expensive code ms can be purchased without a player and that the mp player can be transferred to that pair shoes sold without the player cost &# the site says thats about half of what a pair of code ms with the player were selling for recently on one shoe retailers web site cross breeds must be engineered so as to make room for emergent functions while at the same time avoiding possible clashes victorinox ag the maker of the swiss army knife now has a model that combines the pocket knife with a usb storage drive but while it may be useful to keep this product in ones pocket on campus or in the office at airport security one may lose not only ones pocket knife but ones data victorinox solved this problem by making its usb device removable from the knife and explicitly pointed to this in its advertising for brand managers of firms with established product lines and conservative branding strategies it is not too late to look into remote product categories as possible candidates for cross breeding if nike and apple managed to look beyond the differences and create benefits that rejuvenate not just apples but nikes established product categories so can
