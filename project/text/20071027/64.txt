weekend journal food &amp drink hows your drink scaring up a cocktail halloween approaches and given the number of grown up parties held in honor of the occasion liquor companies are understandably eager to get their spirits in the mix from malibu rum comes a pair of drinks worthy of count floyd the malibu vampire kiss passion fruit flavored rum tonic water and cranberry juice and the malibu scream coconut rum vodka triple sec and lime juice grey goose advocates shaking its pear vodka with pumpkin butter and triple sec and skyy has a witchs cauldron punch contrived of vodka midori orange juice and club soda not exactly spooktacular nonetheless the avalanche of contrived halloween cocktails did get me thinking about what might make for a perfect seasonal quaff a liqueur that in name and reputation is intertwined with witchcraft strega the word is italian for "witch " and strega is also the brand name of a saffron colored herbal liqueur made in benevento italy liquore strega even has a picture of a broom wielding hag on its label in keeping with beneventos folkloric reputation as the meeting place of the nations sorceresses and yet to the extent that strega has been associated with a holiday it isnt halloween but valentines day strega used to promote the legend that the liqueur was a love potion whipped up by witches who had "disguised themselves as beautiful young maidens " the company was careful to insist that "they made their brew not from bat wings and eyeballs but from the delicate fragrant herbs" of benevento the romantic conceit was that "whenever two people drank this miraculous potion they would forever afterward be united " which would suggest you should be careful who you share a strega with the liquor has long been served in italy as a digestivo a stomach settling way to end a meal the narrator of w somerset maughams short story "the lotus eater" finishes a meal in capri by ordering a round of coffee and glasses of "strega which is the best liqueur they make in italy " his drinking companion the object of the tale disagrees proclaiming it to be "sickly stuff " strega though generally available has never been particularly well known in the u s in newpaper columnist howard whitman penned a series of syndicated articles on "our drinking habits " one of the pieces focused on the financial burden suffered by suburbanites who try to maintain a fashionably well stocked bar at home "social pressure demands a virtually unlimited supply of whatever a guest calls his poison " whitman wrote happy is the host able to fill the most obscure order even the one placed by "the show off who asks for strega " a year earlier gay talese had written in the new york times about the sneaky new scheme to give moviegoers a thirst for coca cola that legendary fraud called "subliminal advertising " priming audiences with unseen pitches for coke and popcorn was one thing mr talese determined but the real test was whether rather less obvious messages would work messages such as "vote for lionel smudge " "abjure fleshly lusts " and "drink more strega " in his book "the fine art of mixing drinks " david embury praises strega as "excellent for blending in aromatic cocktails " but that promise has never quite been fulfilled perhaps the closest strega ever came to becoming a standard cocktail ingredient was when the early times kentucky whiskey brand held a cocktail competition in of the recipes submitted to judges the winning entry came from pablo l acevedo a bartender at the waldorf astoria the kentucky sunset as he called it was made of three parts whiskey one part strega and one part anisette notwithstanding an ambitious ad campaign to publicize the recipe the drink failed to capture the public imagination there have been a few efforts to revive strega recently blt prime in new york has on its cocktail menu a drink called the strega nator which adds to the liqueur orange juice lime juice and club soda at the zig zag cafe in seattle they have been offering a strega daiquiri made with rum strega lemon and orange juice and a splash of almondy orgeat i cant say that i am enthusiastic about either recipe perhaps because i dont much like strega and citrus together i worked my way through most of the strega cocktail recipes i could find and to my taste the liqueur turns thin and unconvincing when paired with lemon or lime i certainly didnt expect that when i started tasting the drinks after all orange is one of the liqueurs constituent flavors along with a strong note of mint but you cant always predict how a cocktail will turn out by merely reading the ingredients thats a lesson i learned all over again with this weeks drink a concoction that i almost didnt even try because the component parts seemed decidedly non simpatico the drink in question is one with the seasonally promising moniker "wicked witch " i found the recipe in an internet drinks database but have had no luck winkling out its pedigree even the folks at strega had never heard of it the ingredients in the wicked witch are nonintuitive two parts averna amaro to one part strega with a dash of unfiltered apple juice nonintuitive because averna is a bittersweet herbal liqueur combine one type of bittersweet herbal liqueur with another and youre likely to get a muddy herbal cacophony how wrong i was when i first mixed the drink it was clear that the combination of strega and averna resulted in something new different and strangely delicious just the sort of magic one looks for in the black art of mixology but the proportions of the original recipe were out of whack the drink finally came into focus when i tried it with equal parts averna strega and unfiltered apple cider i plan to spend my halloween shepherding the kids around the neighborhood as they collect their annual swag but once theyve finished sorting the desirable candy from the insufficiently sugary chaff and gone off to bed i plan to whip up a wicked witch and toast the ladies of benevento for all their toil and trouble on what is after all their evening email me at eric felten wsj com wicked witch  oz strega  oz averna amaro  oz fresh unfiltered apple cider shake with ice and strain into a stemmed cocktail glass
