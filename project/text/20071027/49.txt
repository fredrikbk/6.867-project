the buzz marketwatch weekend investor how values embraced by a company may enhance that companys value after we were told to evacuate our home earlier this week as the winds kicked up the fires in san diego my wife our dog and i became instant loyalists to doubletree hotels and other brands owned by hilton hotels hilton was within weeks of instituting a companywide pet friendly policy but with so many people landing at the doubletree in anaheim calif the hotel decided to swing open the doggy door a few weeks early it accepted more animals than it would ever take on a regular basis regular guests wondered if there was a dog show in town "it was the right thing to do " said general manager jeff protzman other hilton properties did the same and they did so at bargain rates that got me thinking do companies that do the right thing make better investments than those that dont a gesture like accepting pets regardless of whether there is a natural disaster which admittedly might not be everybodys idea of the right thing is an intangible that is hard to measure "but a philosophy from top management filters throughout the organization " says michael castine president of dover management based in greenwich conn dover runs a mutual fund that invests in companies known for charitable giving perhaps the most quantifiable proxy for doing the right thing if a company is known for its philanthropy mr castine says "its an indicator of cash on its balance sheet if theres a problem the first thing to go is the philanthropic contributions " mr castine says his firms strategy has been tested with dover paying for the collection of philanthropy data from the standard &amp poors companies dovers research he says has shown that companies with a good relationship between philanthropy and operating earnings have outperformed the broader index by percentage points a year over a five year period dovers research was supported by a study last year by baruch lev and christine petrovits of the new york university stern school of business and suresh radhakrishnan of the university of texas at dallas school of management they concluded that "doing good is apparently good for you " in particular they said "corporate charitable contributions are effective in enhancing revenues in the consumer sectors such as retailers and financial services " but having heart isnt enough some companies for example might go deeper into debt to continue their philanthropy not a good thing mr castine says to avoid getting snared by such potential traps dovers screening also takes into account corporate governance and the strength of a companys balance sheet "when you look at these three things you boil down the s&amp p to or names " says doug cliggott dovers chief investment officer still dover responsibility funds impressive gain since its launch in mid lags behind the s&amp p stock index which is up over the same period mr cliggott makes no apologies noting that companies in the funds portfolio might not outperform every year or every quarter "but tend to do better over a market cycle " philanthropy he explains is like paying dividends "you need to have significant free cash flow and the confidence that youre going to continue to have that " companies such as avon pfizer and nike are examples of companies that have a strong charitable bent nikes performance has been consistently strong pfizer and avon less so however all three boast exceptionally strong free cash flows mr cliggotts favorites include pepsico johnson &amp johnson and kimberly clark "when you see the names that make the screen and those that dont theres a pattern " he says he says he believes these companies tend to send off an overall "vibe" that is felt by employees as well as customers which gets us back to hilton while it isnt a company that was on dovers list it has contributed about of revenue to charity every year for the past years and for the most part has generated consistently strong cash flows the strategy paid off for investors the day my wife and i and our west highland terrier checked out of the doubletree to return to our undamaged home blackstone group closed on its &# billion takeover of hilton investors walked away with &# a share in cash about higher than the stock price was during hiltons lows of seven years ago would the same thing have happened if hilton had been stingy that is impossible to know but this much is certain it didnt hurt herb greenberg is senior columnist for marketwatch he doesnt own stocks except those of his employer and doesnt sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of dow jones which publishes the wall street journal email hgreenberg marketwatch com
