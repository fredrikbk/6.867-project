weekend journal books gene master how a private researcher won the race to decode the human genome a life decoded by j craig venter viking pages &# craig venter is not a man who is inclined to underestimate himself but then why should he he beat the governments science bureaucrats in the race to decode the human genome fueled by &# billion in taxpayer money the federal human genome project had waddled along for years until mr venter in managed to come up with private funding for a &# million parallel research effort celera genomics he announced that his team would sequence the genome mapping the three billion dna base pairs that make up all or so human genes plus tracking long stretches of currently unknown function three years ahead of the governments schedule and at a tenth of the cost and he did one of the five genomes that mr venters team sequenced was his own "a life decoded" is a kind of second sequencing in prose instead of proteins this time around mr venter not only traces the events of his life but also maps the future of biomedicine as he sees it mr venters early life was hardly that of a science prodigy while growing up in a town just south of san francisco he proved to be a mediocre student his eighth grade report card reproduced in "a life decoded" shows an average grade hovering between c and d+ "some parents may perhaps find some hope on seeing similar report cards from their children " he wryly notes after barely managing to graduate he moved in the early s to southern california bodysurfing at newport beach during the day and working nights at a sears roebuck warehouse then an army draft notice arrived mr venter enlisted in the navy "it never dawned on me that i might end up in vietnam " trained as a hospital corpsman he was shipped to da nang the site of a vast u s air base not far from north vietnam it was mr venter says a "university of death " he treated hundreds of young soldiers who had been grievously wounded and mutilated this experience mr venter says gave him focus he wanted to save lives so after the navy he started over by going to community college intending to go on to medical school but when he got to the university of california san diego he was diverted by a brilliant mentor the biochemist nathan kaplan who saw mr venters raw talent for science and persuaded him to go into research and so he did concentrating on the working of adrenaline hormone receptors for his doctorate at ucsd and then continuing his research at the school of medicine at the state university of new york in buffalo throughout the s ultimately though he felt trapped by "a weak academic culture" in buffalo "i was still driven by my experience in da nang and i wanted to accomplish so much more " ironically given his future run ins with government researchers mr venter accepted a position in at the national institutes of health in bethesda md where he would embark on a "new career in molecular biology" with a well funded lab he says "the techniques and interests i picked up in bethesda had a profound influence on the rest of my life laying the foundation for my future interest in reading genomes i was in scientific heaven " it is at this point that "a life decoded" turns captivating as mr venter describes his transformation over the course of a decade from an nih boosting molecular biologist with a "suspicion that pure science would not thrive in a commercial setting" to a genome obsessed researcher who decided to take chance on the commercial sector mr venters prose reaches a high pitch when he describes the tension and excitement of racing to the genome finish line but the writing also gets excited whenever discussing a certain j craig venters heroic struggle against self serving risk averse government bureaucrats on one side and on the other short sighted businessmen whose greed would force him into "endless battles" with his "supposed backers" once he left the nih in in mr venters telling james watson co discoverer of the double helix structure of dna and the first head of the governments human genome project is a sneaky apparatchik the author claims that francis collins who now runs the project is a self righteous and backstabbing manipulator who tried to block mr venters progress at every turn threatening to cut the funding of any researcher who cooperated with him one of mr venters sweetest revenges comes when the government sequencing team that had so publicly predicted he would fail eventually adopted his methods specifically they implemented whole genome shotgun sequencing which fragments a genome into pieces that can be rapidly sequenced and then put into proper order by sophisticated computer programs this technique speeded up sequencing fold mr venters privately funded enterprise celera genomics began sequencing the genome in september and completed it nine months later three years ahead of the governments schedule as promised the leaders of the public genome effort panicked when they realized that mr venter would win a compromise was offered if he agreed to a draw then mr venter and the government team would together announce the completion of the human genome at a white house ceremony this historic event presided over by president bill clinton and british prime minister tony blair via video link took place on june throughout "a life decoded " mr venter inserts brief boxed descriptions of what was found in his own genome under headings such as "my asthma and my genes" and "my waistline and diabetes " surprisingly he does not have the dopamine receptor gene variant drd associated with novelty seeking and risk taking he apparently does have genes that raise his risk for late onset alzheimers disease by publicly unveiling his entire genome mr venter wants to counter privacy concerns about genetic information genes are just information that can help people understand themselves better he says and can be used to guide the prevention and treatment of disease since winning the genome race mr venter has not slowed down he has combined his love of sailing with an ambitious effort to sample the genetic makeup of the microbes that inhabit the oceans in his team announced that they had discovered in seawater samples more than new microbes and six million new genes doubling the number known to science in addition mr venter has established a biotech company synthetic genomics which aims to create designer organisms to produce fuel and clean up pollution mr venter wants to bring humanity to "a new phase of evolution to the day when one dna based species can sit down at a computer to design another " that day is drawing closer in june mr venter announced that his team had successfully transplanted the genome from one bacteria species to another mr venter is widely expected to reveal before long that an artificial genome made of genes constructed at a lab bench has been successfully installed in a microbe readers may cock a skeptical eyebrow at mr venters admiring account of his life so far perhaps one day he will discover the gene for braggadocio but "a life decoded" is invaluable as a behind the scenes account of biomedical research and scientific infighting during a momentous time mr bailey the science correspondent for reason magazine is the author of "liberation biology the scientific and moral case for the biotech revolution "
