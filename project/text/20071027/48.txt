politics &amp economics political sway at guantanamo former prosecutor says pressure began with australians case washington in march a plea bargain guaranteed australian david hicks an inmate at the u s military prison in guantanamo bay his freedom by years end the deal helped australian prime minister john howard a u s ally avoid a bruising domestic controversy now the former chief prosecutor at the guantanamo military commission in cuba for suspected terrorists says in an interview that the hicks case was the beginning of political interference in the offshore justice system col morris davis resigned earlier this month to protest new rules he says will ensure that political officials have similar control over future war crimes prosecutions until recently there was a dispute over who had control over prosecutions at the commission under the new structure approved by the defense department early this month the chief prosecutor will report ultimately to the pentagon general counsel who is appointed by the bush administration the system "takes the military out of military commissions and makes them political commissions " says col davis a career air force lawyer col davis added that other political considerations surfaced in recent months including a push to get trials sufficiently advanced to prevent the next president "particularly hillary clinton and the democrats if they win" from changing the policy pentagon spokesman geoff morrell rejected col daviss accusations "at no time over the course of his two years in that job did he allege political interference to anyone and not until he chose to leave the job did he cry politics " said mr morrell "that is a serious charge and not at all supported by the facts " administration officials say the new system is sufficient to protect the prosecution from improper influences the bush administrations plans for trying suspected foreign terrorists before military commissions have been stymied for several years by federal court rulings international criticism and disarray within the pentagons prosecution effort the administration is planning to resume guantanamo proceedings next month against omar khadr accused of throwing a grenade that killed a u s soldier in afghanistan other current and former administration officials acknowledge pressure to resolve the hicks case but they say some involvement by foreign leaders is inevitable when the u s is prosecuting foreign citizens for crimes derived from international law "to say that the military commissions are devoid of politics is naive " says retired brig gen thomas hemingway who negotiated the hicks plea deal before stepping down in april as a legal adviser to the administrator of the guantanamo commission "but was it done in an untoward way i dont think so " the tension between legal and political imperatives has long bedeviled the offshore trial project the criticism from col davis could influence some in congress "you need a professional prosecutor to make prosecutorial decisions without some political appointee unnecessarily looking over their shoulder " said sen lindsey graham the south carolina republican is an author of the military commissions act which created the current version of the commissions after the supreme court found an earlier version illegal mr hicks now years old was captured in december in afghanistan alongside taliban fighters he was chosen in for the initial round of guantanamo prosecutions in a september meeting col davis said in a written complaint to the pentagon inspector general deputy defense secretary gordon england discussed the "strategic political value" in charging terrorists before the u s midterm elections at that meeting col davis wrote pentagon general counsel william j haynes ii "corrected" mr england to say that the chief prosecutor must be free of "coercion and unlawful influence " in december prime minister howard facing problems at home caused by the hicks detention said he would put "increasing pressure on the americans to stick to the timetable they have given us " the next month col davis said mr haynes telephoned him to ask how quickly mr hicks could be charged col davis told mr haynes he would need at least two weeks "two weeks is too long theres a lot of pressure to get this done as soon as possible " col davis said mr haynes replied on jan mr haynes called again asking about the charges adding "who else are we charging appearances would be better if it was more than just hicks " col davis said the pentagon wouldnt make mr haynes available for comment a senior official didnt dispute the account australia "consistently expressed a desire to get that case moved and i assume that message was conveyed " the official said two days later col davis charged three guantanamo prisoners including mr hicks col davis now says "we charged hicks a good six weeks before the pieces were in place " in february vice president dick cheney visited australia where mr howard again raised the issue at a feb press conference in sydney mr cheney said his ability to speed up the prosecution was limited "we cant influence it that would be a violation of the procedures " he said still gen hemingway says mr cheneys chief of staff david addington telephoned him during the return trip to washington to inquire about the impact of a federal court ruling on the hicks prosecution a spokeswoman for mr cheney declined to comment she said mr addington wouldnt comment sensing pressure to wrap things up lawyers for mr hicks proposed negotiations col davis said he wanted a sentence of at least years defense lawyers rejected the offer and after what they say were hints that the commission administrator would be more amenable to their position commenced separate negotiations with gen hemingway from which col davis was excluded in late march on the eve of trial the negotiators agreed to terms mr hicks would receive a seven year sentence but would only have to spend nine months in prison and could serve his time in australia he agreed not to speak publicly about the case for a year australia has parliamentary elections nov gen hemingway said no one improperly attempted to influence the deal and denied that the gag order was politically motivated mr hicks "needs to spend some time incarcerated thinking about what he did and not putting some kind of a spin on it " gen hemingway said gen hemingways successor brig gen thomas hartmann arrived in july and asserted direct control of the prosecution effort prompting conflict with col davis over the offices leadership gen hartmann is neither a judge nor a prosecutor he is appointed by the pentagon general counsel to advise the administrator of the military commission a position that has no exact analogy in civilian courts an internal review ultimately sided with gen hartmann rejecting col daviss view that federal law insulated the chief prosecutor from the legal advisers direct control earlier this month deputy secretary england issued memorandums that essentially put the prosecutions under the control of the pentagons general counsel
