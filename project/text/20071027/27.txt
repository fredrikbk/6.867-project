if lightning strikes drop playstation and pick up a book bolts from the blue fry gadgets and zap users my hair was tingling chris bergin and his brother ben were jamming along to "message in a bottle" on the videogame guitar hero during a storm in june when a bright light flashed and a thunderclap shook their house in wilton conn the lightning strike nearby triggered a power surge that snaked through the houses electrical system to mr bergins playstation then traveled through the wiring to the plastic guitar controller pressed up against his stomach "i just remember falling to the ground and looking at my brother cause he was on the ground too " says the year old mr bergin the two brothers werent hurt but their playstation was fried along with their laptop computer television set cable and phone wiring and ceiling fan lightning safety experts endorsing common sense have long advised that indoors is the safest place to be during an electrical storm the national weather service recently adopted the slogan "when thunder roars go indoors " but the spread of high tech devices including laptops and videogames means there are new ways in which people can suffer injuries or property losses even in the relative safety of their homes a division of sony corp sony computer entertainment america the maker of playstation products says it hadnt heard of incidents like this and says its devices come with safety instructions about lightning activision inc which makes the guitar hero game advocates staying off electronics during storms mark earley chief electrical engineer at the national fire protection association says the new lightning safety slogan should be modified slightly "when thunder roars stay indoors and read a book " among the recent incidents a mississippi teenager got zapped while holding a computer mouse a washington d c man received mild burns from a laptop resting on his legs and a georgia police communications manager felt a stinging sensation when lightning jolted the police department "like somebody took their middle finger and flicked me in the cheek " she says "my hair was tingling my teeth hurt " says stacy blackwell of the winder ga police the strike in july "blew up quite a bit of equipment " says alex wages the citys director of information technology while ms blackwell was unharmed lightning induced surges can cause serious injury the plastic casing covering laptops game controls or computer keyboards sometimes isnt thick enough to insulate users so people holding plugged in devices can get burns or suffer other injuries of course physical injuries related to lightning are still far more likely to occur outdoors in the first nine months of this year people were killed by lightning strikes in the u s and all were outside doing things such as playing golf fishing or standing under a tree according to the national weather service but property damage indoors is common and getting more expensive when it happens the average cost of an insurance claim from a lightning strike has more than doubled since rising to &# in according to the insurance information institute the increase in the cost per claim has a lot to do with all the wide screen tv sets computer systems and other expensive gear the tab from damaged electronics can climb quickly in some cases chubb corp the big insurer says it paid out more than &# in when lightning struck a house in hawaii and damaged the audio system the internal ethernet computer network the lighting system and the wireless control panel that ran the houses electronics chubb declined to identify the homeowner every piece of electronic gear that is plugged into an electric outlet is vulnerable to a lightning induced surge which can enter a house through wiring or plumbing when lightning strikes a power line it can send a surge through a nearby homes wiring the electricity can snake through the home to anything thats plugged in michael utley who has a web site called struckbylightning org says he has logged a number of cases in which people claim to have suffered injuries or property damage as a result of indoor surges to electronic games "when it hits something it goes pop whether its a plasma tv or a heart " says mr utley who himself survived a lightning strike seven years ago when while he was playing golf a bolt traveled through the top of his head and exited his putter two summers ago year old travis brooks was working at his computer with his hand on the mouse when a lightning induced surge traveled through the wiring in his hurley miss home the surge zapped his hand knocking him to the floor according to jackson county miss sheriffs department records when deputies arrived mr brooks was complaining of chest pains and a numb arm he was treated at a hospital and released decades ago lightning safety experts issued warnings about telephones and lightning strikes a surge could travel through wiring and shock anyone using the phone in a thunderstorm in rare instances people on party lines would all get a shock todays cordless phones and cellphones are safe to use indoors unless the handsets are being charged at the time ms blackwell had just answered the phone at the georgia police station when "there was a pop and the phone went dead " she says staying away from household electronics or anything that could carry the charge such as metal is the best way to protect oneself from surges and one simple way to protect electronic gear is to unplug it when a storm is due but many people dont bother instead in an effort to protect their gear many consumers buy surge protectors but lightning strikes generate so much force that they can overwhelm all but the most sophisticated defenses "just putting a device on an incoming line may not solve all the problems " says mitchell guthrie a blanch n c electrical engineer and consultant an article called "pimp your plasma" on a web site that reviews electronic gadgets for consumers advises people who buy expensive tvs to also purchase a &# surge protector that can suppress "punishing power strikes and surges resulting from lightning strikes " "youve just popped for a high end tv " the site says " please tell us youre not going to plug it into a &# strip you grabbed on sale at the hardware store "
