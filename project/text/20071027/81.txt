worlds policeman is uneasy with its role daniel henningers summary "general sanchezs scream " wonder land oct of media coverage of gen ricardo s sanchez was moving but incomplete the generals "nightmare" was to be sent into conflict by an administration then not receive public support for soldiers sacrifice why everything started so well arent there frequent calls for the worlds policeman the u s to "clean up" certain trouble spots in the years just before there were universal condemnations of taliban destruction of ancient religious sites in afghanistan similar condemnations were made against saddam hussein for visiting disaster upon the iraqi marsh region and its people and upon the kurds so we went to war but it was for revenge the wrong reason revenge is so th century doubters are saying let nations that break laws be tried and if guilty punished by courts that ignores how poorly our state department has performed and as for the the u n it is a building full of expensive frauds passing irrelevant resolutions only lawyers think maniacs can be restrained by laws mohammed atta was guilty of many violations of federal aviation law but that never deterred him from his murderous goal if the past is any indicator there are most likely sealed records that explain how iraq aided the terrorists however they will not be available anytime soon our trouble is those who lead us the best legal minds go to the supreme court best fund raisers to congress and the most persistent governors or senators become president all are trained debaters paid to argue a clients case discover facts apply laws all this is reactive not proactive they are verbal gladiators and continue dividing us while our military knows who the guilty are and where to apply the most effective force soldiers often say they sacrifice for the sake of human freedom i believe that if we need a reason that is a good one and the general has a right to be brutally honest the media should accept that decision making is not always based on public knowledge the process will never be as clear cut as our leaders would like bob drew ossian iowa mr henninger asks whether the projection of u s military power into the world irreparably divides the american people along with his question of our ability to undertake difficult military missions this is the wrong question about gen ricardo sanchezs "scream " i think gen sanchez himself was missing the point of dissenters objections to the iraq war when he spoke to journalists in washington the military owes its loyalty to its commander in chief but the nation including its politicians journalists and civilian citizens is sovereign over its president gen sanchez was right not to have objected in public to the presidents iraq war policy while on active duty however it is wrong for him and mr henninger to denounce the public the press and the congress for lacking the courage to support a war effort with which they do not agree a democracy can easily be exploited by an opponent who can act more quickly and in secrecy our ability to defend ourselves against a threat like islamic terrorism is not as much dependent on projecting our military power abroad as on using that power wisely acquiescing in wasting that power on an ill conceived invasion of iraq was a mistake made in panic that has cost our military and the iraqi people dearly correcting that error must be done with composure and in a way that guards against a similar irrational reflex in the future frank a ocwieja hartsdale n y
