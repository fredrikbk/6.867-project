weekend journal sports golf journal the eyes have it new research aims to help players focus on the key role of vision for most of us subprofessionals the chief advantage of great vision in golf would seem to be finding lost balls in the woods distance markers and laser range finders take the visual guesswork out of judging approach shots and up on the green who but mr magoo cant see the hole but almost everything i thought i knew about this subject turns out to be wrong superior vision is a huge advantage in golf especially when it comes to putting many of the worlds best players including tiger woods and seven other pga tour winners this year vijay singh fred funk and masters champion zach johnson among them have had lasik surgery to correct their eyesight to top gun sharpness usually or better golf apparently plays better in high definition "vision is the guiding sense to most human performance " says alan reichow nikes global director of research for vision from extensive testing of pro athletes from all major sports dr reichow has determined that golfers and shooters are the best at seeing and processing things the rest of us dont on the greens tour pros tend to be especially adept at perceiving such small details as individual blades of grass and at detecting low contrasts such as the difference in the shadows cast by the sun on turf that slopes at subtly different angles they also excel at depth perception these skills help in determining how a putt will break a notion confirmed by stan utley formerly one of the tours best putters and now arguably the games hottest putting instructor he didnt hesitate to attribute part of his success as a putter to the fact that he always read on the eye charts meaning he could see clearly at feet what people with vision see clearly only at feet joe dimaggio similarly credited much of his prowess in baseball to vision "the consequences of good vision are greater the closer you get to the hole " mr utley says mostly because there is more to notice there that will have a realistic effect on actually making the putt he cited ben crenshaw another notably expert putter as an example on long putts mr utley observed from playing with him mr crenshaw didnt seem to work especially hard reading the line between the ball and the hole apart from getting a general sense of the break but on shorter putts he carefully inspected the turf and studied every angle at nike dr reichow contributed several ideas to the design of a new putter called the ic that addresses another challenge visual noise more than a million nerve fibers connect each eye to the brain thats a fire hose of information much of it is useful in making a putt including surprisingly the input from your peripheral vision which helps locate you in space and clues you in to the overall context of the green and its slopes but some of it such as the nonessential angles of the putter head and shaft is confusing and even misleading so the new nike putter including the shaft and grip is green to blend into the surrounding grass except for the blazing white leading edge of the blade and the tee shaped alignment line finding ways to improve focus and other visual skills is a growing subdivision of golf instruction the most famous anecdote in this regard occurred at the u s open when eventual winner michael campbell frequently stopped at portable toilets to perform eye exercises for about two minutes at each stop with his head still he kept his eyes focused on a golf pencil that he moved in horizontal figure eights about a foot away the point was to improve his eyes ability to converge properly which was supposed to help him see his putting line more clearly i ran this by mark whitten the rockville md ophthalmologist who performed lasik surgery on messrs woods johnson and funk and other pga tour pros he said he hadnt seen reports of any controlled studies that either proved or disproved the validity of visual training regimens but he did playfully suggest that whatever else those visits accomplished spending a few calm minutes in the john wasnt a bad strategy in a high stress situation like the u s open dr whitten is also skeptical of claims by some companies that their sunglasses can improve a players ability to read a green he says that sunglasses can relieve the distraction of sun glare but in doing so reduce the flow of visual information to the brain one of the leading practitioners of visual training for golf and other sports is craig farnsworth an optometrist based near palm springs calif "you have to distinguish between mere eyesight which is very important in golf no doubt about it and the kind of vision which adds meaning to what you see " says dr farnsworth some of the work he does with golfers is off course such as having them compare and match special cards with shapes that have extremely slight differences on the course he trains them to notice things about greens starting from far away and to make minute distinctions about slope and grain when on the putting surface perhaps the thorniest visual problem in putting is the discrepancy between how the eyes see the line between the ball and the hole when standing behind the ball vs how the eyes sometimes just the one eye closer to the hole see the line when side on standing over the putt the key according to don tieg director of the institute for sports vision in ridgefield conn and the vision consultant to the new york yankees is to believe your behind the ball take "i personally try to imagine a furrow from the ball to the hole that follows the break as i see it standing face on and then when im over the ball i try to relocate that furrow and putt the ball along it " he says but subtleties pile upon subtleties you may see the line differently from one day to the next depending on how youre holding your head that day for instance maybe you have a sore back that causes you to put more weight on one side "despite everything you do to see things correctly some days you have it some days you dont " says mr utley "thats just reality thats why golf is such a hard game " email me at golfjournal wsj
