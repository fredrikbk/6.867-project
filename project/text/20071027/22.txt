hot topic the fires next time cooler temperatures and weaker santa ana winds have enabled firefighters to gain a measure of control over the blazes in southern california and state officials are optimistic that the worst is behind them but estimated property damage exceeds &# billion a result in part of too many people living in fire prone areas as of friday some square miles had burned homes had been destroyed and more than people in san diego county had been displaced the national media have focused on the federal response eager to compare it to the hurricane katrina fiasco of two years ago however local officials also deserve scrutiny fires in southern california are a natural phenomenon like tornadoes in kansas and flooding in the mississippi delta but public policy makers can and should put in place incentives to minimize the potential havoc a good first step would be to require state and local governments to foot more of the costs of fighting these fires the u s forest service which is part of the department of agriculture is tasked with combating fires in national forests but most of the agencys time and resources are spent protecting adjacent private property in what is known as the "wildland urban interface " or wui for the fire cognoscenti local officials continue to allow people to build in these areas because they know that if a threatening firestorm does occur the feds will pick up the tab as a usda inspector generals audit put it "the majority of" the forest services "large fire suppression costs are directly linked to protecting private property in the wui " on the senate floor wednesday california democrat dianne feinstein correctly noted that "local governments have to begin to look at their zoning" that allows "siting of large subdivisions in the path of santa ana winds in parched dry areas of the state " but the senator reverted to politics as usual when she went on to call for "some catastrophic government helped insurance" as well allstate the nations second largest property casualty insurer announced earlier this year it was pulling out of the golden state citing risks from wildfires and earthquakes and the inability to charge adequate premiums californias homeowner insurance market is already one the countrys most heavily regulated expanding the federal governments role would only encourage more insurers to follow allstate out the door and taxpayers nationwide would be forced to subsidize insurance for californians who chose to live in san diego county fire zones like jamul and ramona until insurers are allowed to charge premiums high enough to cover actual risks people will continue to build and reside in places they probably shouldnt secure in the knowledge that when mother nature inevitably strikes someone else will write a rescue check according to a recent study of western states by headwaters economics just of the wildland urban interface is currently developed but that number has been growing steadily as have the costs of protecting the wui since the forest services fire expenditures have grown by and well over half of that has been spent protecting private property next to public land "the only behavioral change i can imagine is if fire fighting costs were borne by local counties " says ray rasker of headwaters "right now if youre declared a disaster area fema will bail you out or blm will bail you out " he says referring to the federal emergency management agency and the bureau of land management two of the more than two dozen federal agencies that respond to emergencies californias last big fires occurred in and largely in the same areas burning today which is to say these fires are not only natural but somewhat predictable in location and while the immediate priority is to suppress them while giving aid and comfort to the displaced policy makers might also look to mitigate the potential damage the next time they occur and that means holding homeowners developers states and local communities more accountable
