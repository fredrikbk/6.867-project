sowoods short hot summer how founder of hedge fund a star at harvards endowment fell from stratosphere in early july hedge fund sowood capital management lp had been grinding out steady if unspectacular gains its year old manager jeffrey larson once a star at harvard universitys endowment had girded the fund for turbulent markets he didnt seem particularly worried according to investors who spoke with him at the time by the end of july sowood was out of business its investors lost more than half their money and its founder was humbled by a market storm that continues to reshape the financial landscape sowoods collapse was among the most dramatic moments in a summer when market forces that the models and strategies predicted could never happen erupted with regularity now analysts and academics are trying to understand how it happened to avoid similar blowups mr larson was confident about his strategy and eager to borrow large sums of money to make it pay off but independent hedge funds even those started by cautious well respected investors are vulnerable to unpredictable moves in financial markets "theres very little wiggle room if you dont have the financial resources behind you " said michael napoli who runs absolute return group a los angeles hedge fund advisory firm "thats one of the lessons that some hedge fund managers like mr larson learned this summer " mr larson declined repeated requests for comment after an early trading career at the agricultural commodity giant cargill mr larson joined harvards endowment where he earned a reputation as a savvy investor during years there he focused on foreign stocks and was responsible for &# billion of the endowments &# billion in assets by the end of his tenure taking home as much as &# million a year in compensation mr larson launched sowood in luring a dozen members of harvards investment team he led a group of four partners including stuart porter who ran commodity investing and rick dowd a friend of mr larsons who became sowoods chief financial officer and ran its operations the firm which grew to about members gained around annually during its first three years often through savvy bets on debt investments mr larson focused on sowoods portfolio but he also became heavily involved in other areas such as the funds operations or "back office " sometimes clashing with mr dowd according to people close to the matter by last year mr larson stripped mr dowd of his partnership and brought in another executive to run operations mr porter and mr dowd left sowood in december of last year to start a private equity firm mr dowd declined to comment mr larson immersed himself in details large and small at the firm when colleagues left a mess in the office kitchen or bathroom mr larson fired off memos to his employees asking that they do a better job cleaning up by the beginning of this year mr larson was worried about many kinds of riskier debt investments according to people familiar with the situation to protect himself and take advantage of those risks he bought senior debt securities and sold short or bet against a range of investments generally viewed as more risky such as junior debt securities and various stocks mr larsons strategy depended heavily on using borrowed money or leverage because he was betting on small movements such as whether a companys senior debt would go up more than its junior debt went down he borrowed as much as six times the firms capital to generate respectable returns when his bets were right but mr larsons tactics started to backfire in june when sowoods investments lost despite that sowood was up during the first six months of the year the fund managed more than &# billion and mr larson stuck with his strategy in early july mr larson put &# million of his own money into the fund and he directed his traders to borrow even more money to expand the investments according to people familiar with the situation within weeks sowoods positions amounted to as much as times its investment capital well above most rivals according to investors in the fund sowood relied on a group of banks to lend money for its trades using certain sowood investments as collateral as debt markets got nervous sowoods portfolio suffered in unexpected ways some large banks and investors dealing with their own losses sold investments that sowood owned that were safer and thus easier to trade such as certain loans and credit default swaps on leading companies the riskier debt investments sowood hoped would drop didnt move much the &# billion harvard endowment would have been able to absorb mr larsons losses but like many traders who have recently left large organizations to start their own funds mr larson found he didnt have any leeway in times of crisis and as the value of sowoods investments tumbled the lenders began marking down the value of the collateral they held asking that the hedge fund come up with more collateral to back the borrowing mr larson began selling starting with healthy positions that he could sell easily such as shares of companies involved in mergers when that wasnt enough he dumped easily traded bonds keeping his lenders at bay sowoods investors were not able to withdraw money until the end of according to terms of their investments if he could get through this rough period the firm could regain its footing he figured according to an investor who spoke with him but by the week of july losses were topping and pressure from lenders was building realizing he needed help mr larson approached executives of harvards endowment asking for an additional investment they turned him down he then asked for a line of credit but this too was rejected harvards executives determined that extending any more money to sowood was too risky according to people familiar with the matter talking to a friend that week mr larson said he was "embarrassed" about his firms troubles according to the friend by early friday july sowood was down more than mr larson worked through the weekend grabbing a few hours of sleep at the nearby jurys hotel by sunday sowood was down more than at least one investor urged mr larson to go on but he was ready for desperate measures mr larson called ken griffin the head of chicago hedge fund citadel investments asking if he would be interested in buying sowoods entire portfolio on monday july sowood revealed to its investors that its two funds lost as much as harvard the biggest investor lost about &# million mr larson apologized telling investors that he had salvaged just &# billion the fund returned to investors &# million of fees collected before the problems hit but theyre waiting for more in recent weeks mr larson has told investors hed like to resume his trading career he said he wasnt reckless and that his investments eventually would have led to profits on this point few would dispute citadel has made big gains on the investments according to people familiar with the situation
