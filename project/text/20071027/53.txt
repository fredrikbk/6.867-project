the week ahead our take on coming events economy how fed officials might perceive interest rate options by greg ip when the federal reserve meets tuesday and wednesday it faces another tough choice on interest rates standing pat retains some appeal given the aggressive rate cut just last month but markets put high odds on a quarter percentage point rate reduction given a string of downbeat economic and profit reports and see a small possibility of half a point how will fed officials assess these options the do nothing case on sept the fed cut its target for its key short term rate by a larger than expected half a point to in a bid to "forestall some of the adverse effects" of a credit crunch many officials at the time felt that was enough perhaps more than enough to cushion the economy credit conditions have improved slowly the third quarter was stronger than expected the rest of the world remains a source of strength especially with the lower dollar housing has been bad but that was expected though it has been worse even than lowered expectations more important there is still no obvious spillover from housing to the economy on the other side some officials have lingering concerns about inflation especially given the cheaper dollar and higher oil prices holding rates steady risks a bad reaction in still edgy markets the fed would have to weigh that against what rate setting it feels the forecast calls for if it remains on hold the fed likely will say risks are tilted toward weaker growth rather than higher inflation keeping hope of a rate cut alive the quarter point case outside of housing the economic forecast hasnt worsened since sept nonetheless jobless claims are rising suggesting a softening employment market some economically sensitive companies such as caterpillar inc have issued recession warnings rising unemployment and slower growth blunt the inflation threat this alone might not warrant a rate cut that would rest on the case that risks are skewed downward mostly from still declining housing activity and prices to contain those risks the fed might take out an "insurance" rate cut a doctrine it calls "risk management " but some officials are wary of the argument for insurance a rate cut particularly if combined with a statement that hints at more could prompt markets to expect a string of rate cuts that the fed doesnt envision and some officials might dissent the half point cut case if the fed thought still tight credit conditions risked fueling a more dramatic fall in home prices with spillover in the financial markets and consumer spending it might consider an aggressive rate cut like last month but fed officials dont have the sense of accumulating negative risks that they did in september and importantly the fed funds rate is half a point lower as are most other rates including rates on jumbo mortgages moreover a larger than expected rate cut could raise questions about the feds anti inflation credibility and some outsiders worry it could fuel a run on the dollar telecommunications alcatel lucent results may be a telltale of fixit strategy by gabriel kahn when alcatel lucent releases third quarter earnings results wednesday investors will be looking to see what strategy chief executive patricia russo has devised to lead the telecom equipment firm out of its tailspin since news leaked in mid september that the board had asked ms russo to present a plan to fix the firms problems expectations have been building among investors and analysts the company has issued three profit warnings since paris based alcatel sa and new jersey based lucent technologies completed their &# billion merger in december the groups share price has fallen some and some analysts have called for ms russo to resign but unfortunately for ms russo there doesnt appear to be any quick fix for alcatel lucents troubles the telecom equipment business is brutally competitive just as new low cost competitors from china emerge the huge telecom operators that buy equipment have consolidated meaning there are fewer buyers all this has led to intense pressure on prices hurting profits not only at alcatel lucent but also at rivals nokia seimens networks and telefon ab l m ericsson one thing ms russo can do is accelerate the cost cutting undertaken as alcatel lucent integrates the company has forecast pretax cost savings of &lt euro&gt billion over three years about half of the savings announced to date come from cutting jobs and the rest by reducing procurement costs selling real estate such as offices and eliminating overlapping products ms russo is widely expected to increase the cost cutting in a bid to shore up alcatel lucents bottom line a tougher problem that has few easy fixes is alcatel lucents wireless division revenue and margins have been suffering in wireless for the past year and some analysts see it as the heart of alcatel lucents troubles before the merger alcatels wireless products in the gsm standard widely used in europe were seen as second best to ericssons offerings lucent was strong in cdma wireless which rules in the u s with the merger the firm aimed to strengthen its wireless portfolio it also bought a line of products from nortel networks known as umts technology but stitching all three of these technologies into an attractive wireless portfolio is proving difficult in addition it hasnt phased out all of its overlapping products that means it has to support and research several different technologies at once one analyst estimates alcatel lucent has five different radio access technologies alone and it must retain engineers to support and service all the different products that has created an expensive mess that is hurting profitability and opening the door to competitors like ericsson to try to poach customers but if ms russo doesnt convince investors that she has a clear roadmap for how the company can emerge she may face louder calls for her resignation the board released a statement of support for ms russo earlier in the month and the structure of the board makes her hard to oust a two thirds vote of the directors is required to remove her and given the deep seated nature of the firms problems it isnt clear whether a new ceo would fare much better corrections &amp amplifications a week ahead column about alcatel lucent in saturdays
