the childrens crusade democrats say they are urgently concerned for childrens health but their main priority seems to be politics thursday they forced a house vote on a new version of their major expansion of the state childrens health insurance program schip the good news is that the bill once again failed to achieve a veto proof majority this was an important vote the bush administrations rejection of the previous version and the subsequent congressional failure to override touched off an intense publicity campaign to scrape up the short votes the danger was that house republicans would wobble as some members appeared to be considering earlier in the week its to the credit of gop leaders that they kept the opposition stapled together democrats scheduled the vote thursday despite the protests of many california republicans who were in their home districts on account of the wildfires the greater affront was that the new bill was released on wednesday around p m and rushed to the floor the next morning that ensured that no one had a chance to go through with a fine toothed comb or any comb at all the democrats say they "modified" the bill to placate conservative objections but the policy changes are ornamental some such as restrictions on schip benefits for illegal immigrants address side concerns the reauthorization is still propped up by a tax increase on cigarettes and it preserves the budget gimmick that disguises the true cost and hands off funding responsibility to a future congress the congressional budget office estimates the schip do over will cost a half billion dollars more than the bill congress passed less than a month ago new spending clocks in at &# billion above a straight extension for and thats without counting the budget gimmick the democrats also say theyve bolstered provisions that cap schip enrollment at of the poverty level or &# for a family of four as though that was some kind of concession in other words a program supposedly targeted at "low income" families has an income ceiling higher that the u s median household income which according to the census bureau is &# the political intention has always been for schip to penetrate into the middle class in truth the bush administration is the one bending here health and human services secretary mike leavitt recently said the administration will countenance as much as a &# billion expansion over five years which quadruples their previous offers in our view such an olive branch would be pretty close to a surrender though the administration would demand a more confining policy such as lower income caps to sign off on a higher figure more telling is that democrats have spurned all administration genuflections even ones this broad after president bush vetoes schip and assuming the override fails the democrats are likely to pass a continuing resolution funding schip at current levels for another a year positioning a new political blow up just before the election so much for the priority of covering children
