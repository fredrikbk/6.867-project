weekend journal food &amp drink wine notes any port in a fridge i bought a bottle of port almost two years ago and i have been reluctant to open it because i thought if my fiancee and i went through a bottle of port in a night that the next day would be pretty ugly recently i heard that you can open up a bottle and keep it in the refrigerator for weeks is this true if so i will feel much more prepared for the coming cold here in rochester jason hall simon graduate school of business university of rochester we are often asked how long a bottle of port can survive after opening it depends somewhat on the port of course older very fine vintage port will obviously lose more of its charm more quickly than others for instance in general though because port is high in sugar and alcohol it keeps very well after opening just put a cork in the bottle or better pump if you have a vacu vin and put it somewhere away from bright lights or high heat we dont refrigerate it will be fine for days or even weeks depending on the wine if you are drinking a glass every day and in rochester you certainly should youll know when its time to rush to finish it aging vs airing many times you say a wine could use some more time aging before it reaches its peak yet again you mention the wine opening up after opening the bottle or even suggest tasting the wine the day after you open it dont these comments conflict if the wine isnt ready to drink but can be made ready by opening it far enough in advance doesnt that work rich kain corona del mar calif in a perfect world all fine wines that are built to last would be gently cellared under optimal conditions for some years until they age into a complete integrated delight in the real world even most fine young wines are bought for immediate consumption and therefore might taste far more aggressive more tannic and less complete than they might with some age in that case air is an imperfect but expedient stand in for age air helps the wine stretch a bit calms its roughness down somewhat so that it can show more of its complexity its no substitute for bottle age which gives good wine a depth and wisdom that is special but it helps think about people you can certainly aid the process of acquiring wisdom with great books and deep discussions we like to think thats why were paying hefty tuitions right now but in the long run theres nothing like years of living and experience to lend to an individual true wisdom and depth the fate of signed bottles you have recommended buying wines during visits to wineries and having the owner or winemaker sign the bottle i have done this at wineries at tastings and at my favorite wine shop you suggest remembering the visit when you drink the wine question what do you do with the empties recycle put in a place of honor or try to sell them on ebay lynwood &amp t j sinnamon arlington va bottles bought at wineries always bring back special memories and when the label is signed thats even better after we drink the wine we simply remove the label and keep it in our extensive library of labels to this day going back and seeing a label that say the late hanns kornell signed for us in napa gives us a warm glow all over if the bottle itself is signed we note that on the saved label and toss the bottle the ebay idea seems a bit of a stretch were not sure that your memories of a visit to the winery are worth as much to other people as they are to you you can contact us at wine wsj com
