the weekend interview with marcus luttrell lone survivor by mark lasswell arlington va at the white house on monday the parents of navy lt michael murphy received the medal of honor posthumously awarded to their son one of his former seal teammates marcus luttrell was on hand in the east room but not entirely there as a military aide read the citation extolling lt murphy for his "conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life" during a ferocious firefight in afghanistan in mr luttrells mind was firmly back in the mountains of the hindu kush on the day that lt murphy died "somebody had to tap me on the shoulder to bring me back i kind of zoned out " mr luttrell recalled in an interview two days after the ceremony as he spoke his thoughts seemed to drift back to the battle again "i remember how loud it was and i remember our lungs being on fire" but here he paused then added "i was thinking that nobody can have any idea what the hell happened up on that mountain that day " the bare outlines are harrowing enough a four man contingent of navy seals were inserted by helicopter at night on june in the desolate mountain region near the border with pakistan the men were mr luttrell a hospital corpsman second class at the time gunners mate second class danny dietz sonar technician second class matthew axelson and lt michael murphy the officer in charge and one of mr luttrells closest friends they were on a reconnaissance mission trying to locate a guerrilla commander who was aligned with the taliban the seals scrambled across the unforgiving terrain toward their target but after daylight broke the mission started to go awry three goat herders and their goats happened upon the seals the americans recognized that they had a potentially lethal problem the herders glowering at them were likely taliban sympathizers who would report the americans presence with deep misgivings the seals resolved to let the herders go a decision they quickly regretted radio communications problems prevented the seals from calling headquarters for assistance moving across the mountainsides with little cover in daylight would almost certainly attract enemy attention all they could do was hunker down and then the shooting started dozens of taliban fighters had taken up a position above the seals and were pouring lead down on them over the next two hours a terrible dance unfolded swarming taliban fighters would try to slide down the mountain slopes on either side of the seals who furiously picked them off until the americans were nearly overwhelmed by force of numbers then the seals would fling themselves blindly down the mountain hoping to alight still alive with a little cover so they could take up the fight again after a series of these desperate plunges the seals were in a grim state shot up hit by the shrapnel of rocket propelled grenades running out of ammunition danny dietz died first he had been badly wounded but then was shot fatally as mr luttrell tried to help him to safety as mr luttrell recounts in "lone survivor the eyewitness account of operation redwing and the lost heroes of seal team " his book about the episode the remaining three seals final plunge down the mountain landed them in a ravine matthew axelson was grievously wounded and would die that day lt murphy bleeding from a stomach wound "groped in his pocket for his mobile phone the one we had dared not use because it would betray our position " mr luttrell writes "and then lieutenant murphy walked out into the open ground he walked until he was more or less in the center gunfire all around him and he sat on a small rock and began punching in the numbers to hq " any act of heroic battlefield self sacrifice is almost incomprehensible to those whom soldiers fight to protect but the fact that lt murphy was performing such a familiar task moving out into an open space seeking a cell phone signal under such murderous circumstances lends his actions an almost unbearable poignancy while he was on the phone calling for help lt murphy was shot in the back the bullet exiting through his chest yet he continued to talk even astonishingly finishing the conversation "roger that sir thank you " but it was too late seals murphy and axelson were killed and then the days disaster was compounded when an mh chinook helicopter carrying a quick response force was shot down by a rocket propelled grenade during a rescue effort killing it was the worst single day of american fatalities of the war in afghanistan and the worst loss of life in seal history but mr luttrell miraculously survived the fight in the mountains just as the seals were making their last stand with taliban fighters closing in he was blown from the ravine to relative safety by a grenade explosion with three broken vertebrae badly wounded and barely able to walk he eluded the enemy for the better part of four days three of them under the care of villagers who took him in and were then obliged by custom to protect their guest against all threats even against the taliban fighters who discovered mr luttrells whereabouts the taliban menaced the village but loath to create enemies in a region where they rely on local assistance never attacked mr luttrell was rescued by u s forces on july war veterans returning to civilian life commonly find themselves in jobs that are in light of their recent battlefield experience decidedly incongruous for mr luttrell coming home after his discharge in june has meant an incongruity of a kind he would never have imagined the former seal a man with special operations training in marksmanship and underwater demolition a recipient of the navy cross for combat heroism a warrior who fought in both iraq and afghanistan has been working for the past five months as a publicist it is strictly a volunteer position and reluctantly undertaken to be sure and mr luttrell has only one client the memory of that terrible day in afghanistan he wants the world to know about the sacrifices of lt murphy of his two other dead seal teammates and of the eight seals and eight army night stalkers killed in the failed helicopter rescue it is a timely effort coming during a period in this country when the heroism of american soldiers is not reliably noted much less honored in every corner "its not about me its about my guys " he says of his publicity labors since leaving the service "its like the job i was doing before i got out there were probably plenty of missions that i didnt want to go on because i was tired or whatever but i still did it because its not about me " mr luttrell was born in houston in but grew up in rural texas on the horse farms his family owned much of the time in the piney woods country in the eastern part of the state he would clearly rather do just about anything than talk to the media at feet inches tall and well over pounds with long cowboyish sideburns he is texas taciturn to begin with and the secrecy of seal missions tends to make frogmen as the naval sea air land team members call themselves a less than loquacious bunch in the months following the mountain fight queries from family and friends about the gun battle and debriefings following inaccurate news reports on the incident became such a distraction mr luttrell says that it was difficult to concentrate on his seal duties "normally i wouldnt talk about any of our operations this one wouldnt leave me alone " he says "it kept banging on my door and i had to do something about it " the solution he thought would be to set the facts down in print so that they would be on the public record then maybe he could move on with clearance from his superiors mr luttrell began looking into writing a book and was eventually put in touch with british writer patrick robinson whose military thrillers often involve the u s navy their collaboration "lone survivor " was published in june it quickly became a nonfiction best seller "all i wanted to do was stop talking" about what happened in afghanistan mr luttrell says "and now im neck deep in it " another frustration is the inadequacy of words to convey the experience "i can sit here and tell you that i got into a gunfight " mr luttrell says "but you cant put it into words your heartbeat doesnt raise the hair on the back of your neck doesnt stand up when i tell you that when youre out there the stuff we get into people get sick you get so scared you urinate on yourself thats fear " hollywood he says has no idea what war is like thats why hes wary of negotiations currently underway to film "lone survivor " if it happens he says with the trace of a grimace hell probably "go out there and help " otherwise it might turn into "a love story" or a special effects extravaganza with "people spinning from wires which it wasnt it was about death and people dying " it should be noted that mr luttrell is giving away his income from "lone survivor " reportedly putting it in a trust to aid military charities and the families of the dead soldiers although now he says simply "im in control of it so it goes to the right places " for now mr luttrell is heading back to east texas not far from his parents place he and his twin brother morgan who followed him into the seals own a ranch the two men each have a large tattoo on their backs one half of the trident badge awarded to newly minted seals "when we come together and it makes the whole thing youre like oh i know what that is it was just something we did to honor all the guys who went before us and are here today and it signifies that without him im only half a frogman " the ranch is devoted to rehabilitating sick and injured horses about a dozen of them at any one time the place is likely to be restorative for mr luttrell as well "out there its pretty peaceful and i work all the time " he says but he hasnt been able to stay at home for more than a few days at a time since being plunged into "lone survivor" concerns "being a civilian hasnt set in just yet except when i try to get on a military base and i cant because i dont have an id anymore " when he feels especially troubled by thoughts about the firefight in the mountains his instinct as it is when dealing with his injuries from which he is still recovering is simply to "suck it up " but sometimes he calls his old seal buddies its not always easy to reach them "i forgot how busy it is being a team guy " i talked to mr luttrell at the crystal gateway marriott hotel on wednesday morning not far from the pentagon in the lobby before the interview it was the uniformed military personnel who caught the eye as they headed out the front door most likely on their way to doing business at the pentagon the few civilian guests in evidence attracted less attention a family was at the front desk checking out and then there was the tall young man in blue jeans who was saying goodbye to a pleasant looking older couple near the entrance the woman in the couple was much shorter than the young man who had to lean over a little awkwardly as if he had a tricky back when he hugged her not a remarkable farewell scene in most hotels but in this one it was unutterably moving marcus luttrell was saying goodbye to dan and maureen murphy lt murphys parents the parting wasnt tearful it was a cordial exchange between people who have a deep bond and who seem to know that theyll be speaking again soon probably on sunday in fact thats the day each week when mr luttrell calls the families the other survivors mr lasswell is the journals deputy books editor
