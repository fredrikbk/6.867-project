weekend journal leisure &amp arts masterpiece the gods do battle violent action dynamic carving on the pergamon altar anatomy of a classic berlin st john the divine called it satans throne but then he had an ax to grind he was speaking of the great altar of pergamon remarkable above all for a monumental frieze depicting the battle of the gods of olympus against the giants a theme an ingenious christian of a classicist bent might gloss as an allegory of the fall of the rebel angels the book of revelation is addressed to the churches which is to say the early christian communities of seven cities of asia which is to say asia minor all seven lie within the borders of modern turkey pergamon also known as pergamos or pergamum was one of them in its hellenistic heyday under the attalid dynasty a brief years beginning early in the third century of the pre christian era pergamon had been a military power to reckon with and a seat of learning too this was following the death of alexander the great the library was second only to alexandrias when papyrus imports from egypt the only source dried up the pergamenes moved on to the substitute of parchment or pergamenum as the latin suggests a local invention accumulating an estimated volumes unfortunately for posterity mark antony made a gift of them to that incurable bookworm cleopatra so the asian collection burned up along with hers the attalids were men of vision by the third century the glory that was athens was an ancient memory but where was the city state that would take her place staking their claim the pergamene rulers built their acropolis on the athenian model for whatever reason their utopian ambitions were at best partly fulfilled but the great altar unsurpassed in the plasticity and dynamism of its carving was widely recognized for the triumph it was acclaimed for centuries now like the battered elgin marbles stripped from the parthenon and shipped to london the friezes from the great altar of pergamon rank with the chief glories of a foreign capital in their case berlin the pergamon ensemble too has taken its hits zeus apollo and athena have lost their heads or at least their faces other figures are missing entirely of the key figure of herakles the human hero who turned the tide of battle only the inscription of his name remains that and a paw of his trademark lion skin even so plenty is left to convey the epic story in thrilling detail as we see at the pergamon museum which also houses such other unwieldy monuments as the market gate of miletus and the ishtar gate of babylon the great altar was not so much an altarpiece as a temple in its own right consisting of a square base and a smaller upper level encircled by a colonnade by the time it began to arouse the interest of modern archaeologists it had lain in ruins for well over a thousand years the installation in berlin is a reconstruction of the great staircase to the west which led to the courtyard above actually this was the part of the structure a visitor in antiquity came to last the original statuary flanking the staircase and the adjacent short sections of the western wall are fitted into the replica the three principal sections of the frieze which ran the entire width of the eastern northern and southern walls are mounted on the walls of the gallery inside out so to speak confusing as it may sound the arrangement makes for splendid viewing notably of the eastern frieze meant to be seen first and the most stupendous of them all as any visitor to the museum instantly understands the staircase makes perfect bleachers choose your step and take a seat to get ones bearings it helps to start with the gods to the far left the three bodied hekate brandishes her torch sword and lance next theres artemis goddess of the hunt accompanied by her snapping hound in their turn come the apollonian nude apollo and beyond the gap left by herakles a zeus whose brawn anticipates michelangelo and athena hauls the winged alkyoneus by the hair of his head preparing to smite him over the pleas of his half buried mother gaea the earth the sons writhing pose and the snake coiling round his arm evoke the celebrated laocooen at the vatican a roman copy some say of a pergamene original though the scholars may debate details the overall program of the frieze is no mystery the gods are the forces of civilization of order of enlightenment ranged against the giants representing unreason confusion chaos the action is tempestuous the movement violent boldly underscored by the gods flying garments on the southern wall rhea or cybele the great mother goddess of asia minor charges into battle on the back of a lion on the northern wall aphrodite the goddess of love yanks a lance from her opponents body this is a struggle not just for supremacy but for existence itself victory is by no means a foregone conclusion in form the gods are human the giants are often monsters if the gods are attended by beasts the giants are themselves part beast human only to the waist fish or sea serpent below or endowed with mighty wings the gods with meaningful exceptions are clothed while the giants are naked the gods bear arms the giants for the most part grapple or hurl stones but the greatest difference between the two orders of being is this the gods are impassive and the giants suffer bearing in mind that many faces are gone the pattern is nonetheless consistent whatever charge of emotion a gods body language may reveal the features betray no inner life at all no rage no determination no adrenaline rush not even cold contempt did herakles share their detachment i wonder everything the gods keep to themselves is on full view in the giants rearing up against hekates triple attack her antagonist is the very picture of bravery a nearby companion his neck in the fangs of a hunting dog shows a face of pained fortitude apollos youthful victim exudes a gentle dignity aphrodites fresh corpse wears a mask of startled misery a merman wrestling some lesser divinity from behind bites his arm in grim desperation most pitiful of all is the sight of two who have been mentioned already gaea and alkyoneus vanquished mother and son pendant portraits of terror and woe only a heart of stone could leap at the giants fall civilization is a fine thing but its price is steep mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on the arts artists and philanthropy
