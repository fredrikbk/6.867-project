cross country new hampshire blues manchester n h if the southern tip of new hampshire that part of the state closest to boston mass were to be split off and made into a separate state which of the two new hampshires would republicans dominate surprisingly it would be the section full of massachusetts transplants and which is sometimes derisively called "massahampshire " new hampshire as a whole is turning blue last year voters replaced both of the states republican congressmen charlie bass and jeb bradley with democrats the gop also lost control of both houses of the legislature for the first time since and yet massachusetts transplants while they may have turned the southern portion of the state into a suburban stretch of chain stores and clogged highways are the primary reason the gop remains competitive in the state they are also republican sen john sununus largest base of support as he seeks to defend his seat against democrat jeanne shaheen a popular former governor next year the most solidly republican towns and cities in new hampshire run along the border with massachusetts cities like salem and towns like new ipswich are filled with registered republicans who fled taxachusetts and who actually want to keep new hampshire a low tax low regulation state last year university of new hampshire survey center director andy smith conducted a poll for the boston globe he asked massachusetts transplants in the state less than a year why they moved their no reason was cost of living their no reason was taxes and no too many liberals in massachusetts mr smith discovered that former bay staters tend to be middle and lower class tax refugees many of them own small businesses or commute to massachusetts they might or might not have a college degree and they are reliably republican unh political scientist dante scala sums it up "i think the reverse of the old yarn about massachusetts liberals is actually true massachusetts emigres are keeping the state as republican as it is down in the border areas " so why is the rest of the granite state going blue transplants into the state are changing the political landscape but theyre not from massachusetts theyre highly educated professionals and come mostly from mid atlantic states these newcomers have college degrees many advanced and work in high tech academia and other specialized fields throughout the state they are affluent and very liberal the massachusetts emigres shop at wal mart eat at a local family restaurant chain and watch the patriots the mid atlantic emigres shop at boutiques eat at small cafes and watch roger altman films theyre the ones tipping the state democratic there is another factor at play on the national and local level the gop has alienated many native granite staters these voters are generally fiscally conservative but socially moderate to liberal they started leaving the party as early as when barry goldwater topped the republican presidential ticket but when george w bush and the republican congress made bill clintons spending look responsible they started leaving in droves some are registering democrat but most are registering as "unaffiliated" voters its more than spending too political corruption has taken a toll on the gop three years ago allegations of unethical behavior led republicans to turn out their own governor and hand the job to democrat john lynch who won re election last year by the largest margin in state history national republican scandals last year only further alienated the partys base in the state the war in iraq which isnt popular here hasnt helped the gop republicans optimistically dismiss last years elections by saying that one year doesnt make a trend but its not just a years worth of statistics democrats have won five of the past six gubernatorial elections and have carried the state in every presidential election since except for that year mr bush won the state by votes as ralph nader took in votes exit polls revealed that about half of his voters would have voted for al gore had mr nader not been on the ballot republicans havent had a lock on the state for quite some time political scientist dean spiliotes formerly of st anselm college in manchester n h looks back to and says "that was the first sign that new hampshire might start to trend blue and every election since then has generally reinforced that shift especially the midterm election " what does this mean for mr sununu he has a strong record of fiscally responsible votes and he has publicly disagreed with the president on some aspects of the patriot act that and the fact that his opponent ms shaheen supported invading iraq early on will give him a little breathing room in the race his task now is to convince voters that he is an old school new hampshire republican not someone who lost his way in washington should he succeed at doing that the race may turn on whether voters will be tired of punishing all republicans for the sins of mr bush if so mr sununu could hold onto his job for another six years if not hell be a goner then sen judd gregg whos up in and without mr sununu would be the only republican representing the state in washington if republicans dont retake at least one congressional seat next year could find it a convenient time to think about retirement mr cline is editorial page editor of the new hampshire union leader
