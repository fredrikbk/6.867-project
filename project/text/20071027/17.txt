impressed by mr malones ph d in operations research from johns hopkins university and his reputation for shrewd and complex investments when mr diller left fox in mr malone along with brian roberts president of comcast corp lured him to qvc inc a large home shopping network mr malones liberty media and comcast were part owners of qvc and the two cable executives hoped mr diller would add luster to the network which they worried was a bit fusty his hollywood image notwithstanding mr diller got right down to the business of hawking jewelry and other goods from qvcs home base outside philadelphia he upgraded the quality of the programming and raised the networks profile with new celebrities and more upscale brands such as saks fifth avenue the partnership crumbled however after mr diller tried to use qvc to buy the cbs television network in mr roberts opposed the bid and mr malone sided with him mr roberts announced he would take qvc private mr diller left mr malone hoped to work with mr diller again so he stayed close an avid sailor mr malone suggested that mr diller buy a boat and sail up the intracoastal waterway from florida mr diller took the advice and regularly called mr malone to tell him what hed seen that day or to gripe about how many times he had run aground by mid mr malone had found a way to put mr diller back to work through his cable company mr malone had acquired control of hsn along with a group of broadcast tv stations called the silver king stations because federal regulations then barred cable operators from also controlling broadcast stations in the same geographical areas mr malone had to sell them or turn over control to someone else he asked mr diller whether he would be interested in taking over silver king mr diller agreed on one condition he wanted to call all the shots "i said i would never sign another employment agreement again " says mr diller mr malone gave mr diller a proxy to vote liberty medias approximately stake in silver king which under the companys dual class share structure amounted to the majority of the voting power the deal called for mr diller to retain that voting right until he either quit or died mr diller set out to build a collection of local news and entertainment stations hsn became part of the company which mr diller eventually renamed iac interactivecorp at first mr malone left mr diller alone and watched his investment grow when mr diller decided a couple of years later to acquire seagram co s cable channels and television production assets for &# billion mr malone signed off even though he had to agree to a dilution of his stake "it was a compromise by us " says mr malone "but in our view it was still barrys company " eventually mr diller changed course to focus on the internet he sold iacs television assets except for hsn and began buying e commerce businesses by the end of iac owned hotels com lendingtree ticketmaster and expedia which mr diller spun off as a separate public company in from to mid iacs stock rose by nearly but the growth came to a screeching halt in late competition in the online travel industry intensified and mr diller said he would scale back the companys buying spree its stock price fell in a matter of months around that time mr malones company liberty media bought full ownership of qvc that meant mr malone had direct control of hsns biggest rival iac suggested that he and liberty medias then chief executive robert "dob" bennett quit iacs board mr malone agreed although he later rejoined he now says he heard talk that mr diller might have had another motive getting rid of a member of the boards compensation committee "skeptics say that barry didnt want dob bennett on his committee when they were renewing his stock options " says mr malone "that probably had an element of reality to it " mr diller says he was acting solely on the advice of his lawyers before long mr malone and mr diller were bickering about iacs balance sheet over the years the two men had developed different approaches to corporate finance mr malone liked to use debt to boost returns mr diller disliked borrowing money around iac was sitting on about &# billion in cash but its stock was languishing mr malone urged mr diller to take on more leverage and buy back lots of shares "what are you sitting on all that cash for " he recalls asking mr diller iac bought back some stock but mr malone says he remains unsatisfied with mr dillers approach to buybacks they also disagreed on how to structure certain deals when mr diller wanted to buy search engine ask com in mr malone advised him to pay the &# billion in cash rather than stock according to mr malone if iac later sold ask com mr malone argued that would potentially minimize any tax hit but mr diller ignored the advice insisting that a stock payment was the only option the sellers would agree to "if it had been me i would have been willing to pay a higher price" to do a cash transaction mr malone says "barry doesnt use his balance sheet effectively he is not a financial guy " mr diller says he values mr malones advice and considers his thoughts on leverage ultimately correct "it is just a matter of timing " he says problems at hsn weighed on iacs stock sales flattened after managers made poor product selections in such categories as health and beauty and electronics mr malone says he is willing to give mr diller the benefit of the doubt that he can turn things around over the long term "i would still bet on barry " he says but he adds that liberty medias chief executive officer greg maffei a former microsoft corp executive who joined liberty media in isnt so patient "there is not quite as much love for barry on average" at liberty mr malone says "greg has made it clear that he isnt as enchanted with barry as i am " mr maffei has a history with mr diller the two clashed when mr maffei was chairman of expedia and mr diller was buying expedia since joining liberty media mr maffei has made no secret of his belief that iacs weak stock is hurting liberty medias stock price he has urged mr malone to ratchet up pressure on mr diller to buy back stock or take the company private he has also raised questions about the high turnover among iac managers mr maffei has told others that he thinks there may be loopholes in the proxy agreement that assigns liberty medias voting power to mr diller mr maffei has said that could allow liberty media to assume control before mr dillers death or could compromise mr dillers control if liberty media decides to sell mr diller says he has a lot of respect for mr maffei but isnt intimidated by him he says he is convinced that the proxy arrangement is ironclad friends say he resents the fact that mr malone often refers to iac as "part of the liberty family " late last year as tensions escalated messrs malone and diller began considering ways to end their relationship in a series of phone conversations they discussed a trade liberty media would get full ownership of hsn and some iac common stock mr diller would get the bulk of liberty medias stake in iac although hsn was coming off a year in which revenue was essentially flat mr diller maintained that the business was back on track under a new ceo by february of this year iacs stock had climbed back to about &# a share up from about &# in july mr malone thought the proposed swap an idea that had been floated before might finally look attractive but results at hsn deteriorated due to merchandising risks taken by new management mr malone lost interest in the proposed deal he wants mr diller to throw another asset into liberty medias pot "i am not about to abandon mr diller unless he offers me something a hell of a lot better than a swap for hsn " says mr malone messrs malone and diller see each other every month or so at iac and expedia board meetings but the breakup talks are on hold either until hsns performance improves or mr diller agrees to surrender another asset such as expedia which mr malone has expressed interest in owning the two disagree about who is most interested in ending their partnership mr diller says hes not anxious for an asset swap but he would negotiate one because its what liberty media wants he says mr diller whose stakes in iac and expedia are worth about &# million says he eventually wants to end iacs relationship with liberty media to preserve his own legacy "the only issue i have to eventually deal with is the issue of succession " he says referring to who will take over for him at iac he says he wants the company to be independent mr malone has a different take "it is a little uncomfortable for barry " he says "right now we are the shadow that walks around behind him " if a deal isnt reached liberty media could try to sell its positions in iac and expedia to someone else forcing mr diller to either raise money to buy the stakes or lose control but to buy out liberty media mr diller might have no choice but to give up a couple of major businesses shrinking his empire mr malone believes that time is on his side at an investor presentation late in he reminded the audience that "if a bus gets" mr diller liberty media gets control of iac last month after mr diller ate lunch with mr maffei in new york the two men walked outside to the lot where mr dillers motor scooter was parked mr maffei laughed about mr diller traveling the city on two wheels "it makes it easier for liberty to run me over " mr diller quipped
