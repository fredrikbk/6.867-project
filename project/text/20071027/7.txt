business insight a special report the future is now in analyzing a companys stock price executives may be seeing only part of the picture imagine you are the ceo of a company that has just enjoyed a year of record sales and earnings in your annual letter to shareholders you assure investors that the companys health and growth prospects have never been stronger and yet youve seen the companys share price drop over the past year even as competitors stocks gained worse the scenario replays itself the following year profit margins and profits again increase but the stock price treads water while rivals shares rack up impressive gains whats going on here the problem is a common one the boost that outstanding current performance gives to shareholder value can be offset when investors faith in a companys future begins to evaporate to avoid this nightmare executives need a complete picture of both these components of their businesss value executives have become increasingly sophisticated in the past couple of decades at analyzing the value of current operations and at using that analysis to help them manage with the goal of increasing shareholder value but they still need to supplement the well developed tools they use for value based management with one that can analyze their companys future value the portion of the share price that isnt based on the earnings from current operations or products we have devised an approach that allows executives to gain a clear outlook on both the current and future components of their companys share price this can give them a better understanding of how the stock market is evaluating their companys prospects for long term success and that can help improve their long term decision making by showing them whether in the eyes of investors they have struck the appropriate balance between short term and long term goals a limited approach by the early s companies were increasingly zeroing in on whether business operations were adding value value based management tools remain popular today among them eva or economic value added which takes after tax operating profit and subtracts from it a charge for the capital employed to generate that profit however a variety of academics and consultants have pointed out the limited usefulness of eva and other value based performance measures particularly given a propensity toward current period and short term backward looking performance evaluation for example eva fails to quantify the increased value a company might realize in the future through say higher levels of investment in programs aimed at increasing brand loyalty developing talent generating patents or bolstering research and development capabilities true value based management requires executives to look both backward and forward how important is future value to share prices in concrete terms as an example an analysis by asseteconomics inc of the companies in the russell index as of may found that future value expectations represented of their overall enterprise value the market value of a companys equity plus the net value of its interest bearing debt obligations in of industry groups analyzed future value made up more than half of enterprise value to put those figures into dollar terms approximately &# trillion of the russell s total enterprise value of &# trillion was bound up in future value and that was three years after the market began correcting itself for the inflated expectations of the dot com bubble even in after corporate profits and therefore current value had risen significantly over a three year period some &# trillion of the russell s total enterprise value of &# trillion or about one third was represented by future value what investors are doing here is placing a significantly higher value on these companies than would seem warranted by the success of their current operations they are saying in effect "we see that your current operations are worth such and such but were going to reward you well above that level because we have faith in your growth prospects " that extra amount investors are willing to pay is the companys future value mathematically it can be calculated for any company by subtracting current value from the businesss overall enterprise value so start with enterprise value which again is the market value of a companys equity plus the net value of its interest bearing debt obligations then subtract current value which is after tax operating profit divided by the weighted average cost of capital the result is future value future value and current value can then be expressed as percentages of enterprise value this exercise allows executives to put a number on the markets view of how the company is doing today and what its expectations are for tomorrow eliminating the need for guesswork or the temptation of wishful thinking while its crucial for executives to know their companys future value there is no optimal percentage that any particular company should strive to achieve the significance of future value lies largely in how it compares with the future values of the companys industry peers depending on how a companys industry as a whole is positioned a future value component of of enterprise value may be exceptionally high exceptionally low or average and the same is true for a figure of another crucial consideration is which way future value is heading a decline can be a warning that a companys growth plan needs to be revisited because it suggests investors have growing doubts about the strategy shaping strategy to understand how an analysis of future value can help executives shape business strategy consider the big box retailing sector for years large retailers were rewarded with higher share prices for opening new stores at a breakneck pace but growth through expansion may be nearing its limit for these retailers as their markets become saturated in our research on a select set of major retailers we saw a downward trend for future value in the industry as a whole from to most of the retailers continued to invest heavily in new store openings fueling an increase in the companies current value future value however didnt keep pace with the growth in current value in fact future value as a percentage of enterprise value for the group as a whole declined from almost to an indication that investors were losing faith in simple market penetration and geographic expansion strategies had these companies been tracking future value regularly they might have recognized earlier that a strategy based on increasing scale was running out of room and begun investing differently for growth best buy co is an instructive exception to the industry trend in the retailer faced a huge challenge wall street had come to expect growth of a year but the company because of saturation of the north american market could no longer rely as heavily on adding new stores to generate that growth best buy then launched its "customer centricity" strategy which was designed to pinpoint the most profitable and fastest growing customer segments in each store once it determined the nature of these segments best buy realigned its stores and empowered employees to target those favored shoppers with products and services that would encourage them to spend more and come back often the strategy has had remarkable results the newly formatted stores generated sales at twice the rate of best buys traditional format and the company largely maintained its future value over the period we examined all the companys stores now employ the centricity strategy which has evolved to emphasize the personal experiences and ideas that each employee can bring to bear in serving the unique needs of each customer that isnt to say that best buy has completely turned its back on scaling up operations at the beginning of the company announced it would open new stores in the u s canada and china it is clear though that best buys growth strategy doesnt depend primarily on penetration and that investors have shown their approval with their assessment of the companys future value tracking a turnaround a similar lesson can be found in mcdonalds corp s ability to renew investors confidence in recent years before the fast food chain had focused heavily on scale growth aiming to rapidly open large numbers of new restaurants around the world that strategy worked well for many years but eventually investor confidence ebbed the share price peaked in and dropped more than by early the company then announced that it would close stores and cut jobs in the ensuing turnaround initiated by a new leadership team increasing same store revenue became the new focus of top management doing so meant renewing the brand through marketing and advertising it also involved a radical change in the product assortment with an expanded menu including salads snack wraps and new sandwich and burger options restaurant renovations and redesigns including the introduction of wireless internet access have had a striking impact along with efforts to make drive through service faster and more convenient with increased confidence in the companys future mcdonalds investors have sent its share price skyrocketing from about &# at its low to &# by the beginning of and above &# for much of this year how did the companys future value track over this period in future value was around of enterprise value but by it had dropped to around following the turnaround the number had risen above by indicating investor confidence in managements ability to continue to take advantage of future growth opportunities were not saying that best buy or mcdonalds changed strategy following a future value analysis such as the one we lay out here we are saying that any company can use this tool to gauge how investors feel about its strategy and can then consider changes based on that information future value analysis can be especially valuable in detecting early warning signals that may not show up in the share price if earnings from current operations are robust thus obscuring long term flaws in company strategy managing for shareholder value current and future requires some technical knowledge to get the numbers right but it is far more a matter of establishing a mind set within an organization one in which employees at all levels understand how they are adding value and in the case of future value it is a matter of orienting everyone in the organization toward longer term horizons executives can help foster this mind set in a number of ways they must ensure that the companys investor relations communications clearly convey a convincing growth story and analysts arent the only target of such messages top management must continually reinforce the logic of future value for the organization as a whole also many companies have executive compensation plans management systems and cultures that reward people and units for achieving accounting results that are set for the coming quarter or year integrating future value into incentive plans can help reorient a companys focus so that it is more balanced between the imperatives of today and tomorrow mr burgman is the founder of asseteconomics in new york and a fellow of the accenture institute for
