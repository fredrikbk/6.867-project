finks name has been mentioned repeatedly over the past week but people familiar with the matter said the board hasnt had extensive discussions with him directors have grown increasingly frustrated since merrill announced &# billion in write downs three weeks ago in the past week the size of the hit grew by more than &# billion and merrill reported a &# billion net loss for the third quarter analysts say several billion dollars in additional write downs may be in store the latest board meeting came after news that mr oneal had approached wachovia chief executive g kennedy thompson in the past week about whether the charlotte n c bank would be interested in a combination with merrill mr oneal didnt consult with the board before making the phone call mr thompson who has said he is focused on integrating two recent acquisitions said the timing wasnt right for a deal people familiar with the matter said mr fink and mr oneal had dinner together thursday night people familiar with the matter said fueling speculation of a management change a merrill spokeswoman declined to comment the discussions between merrill and wachovia were reported in the new york times at a company wide meeting to discuss the write downs someone asked mr oneal if he had considered a merger and he said no according to people who heard his remarks if merrill were sold and mr oneal departed he could stand to make roughly &# million in severance payments and accelerated payout of previous stock awards according to the companys proxy thats more than he would receive if he resigned or were forced out merrills stock price surged &# or to &# a share friday on reports that mr oneal might be on his way out and on speculation the firm could be acquired another person mentioned as a candidate for merrills top job is new york stock exchange chief john thain he has plentiful wall street experience as the former co president of goldman sachs most of merrills directors have arrived since mr oneal took over as ceo in and several have longtime ties to him however some directors have been griping about the losses and agitating for change a handful of merrill alumni have also been considering a movement to get mr oneal pushed out some of the most pointed questions at the previous merrill board meeting at which mr oneal discussed the third quarter write downs were asked by armando m codina the chief executive of flagler development group in jacksonville fla according to a person familiar with the meeting mr codina a director since chairs the boards nominating and corporate governance committee mr oneal years old is the first african american to head a major wall street brokerage firm the alabama native earned a harvard m b a and was working in finance at general motors corp when he was recruited to join merrills investment bank in by mr oneal was chief financial officer the merrill mr oneal inherited earned &# billion less than rival morgan stanley on almost exactly the same revenue those were the figures for the year before the merrill board picked mr oneal as president and he effectively began running the show most of his predecessors as ceo had been outgoing former stockbrokers who favored expansion as the way to profits mr oneal refocused merrill cutting costs and focusing on high profit areas one of those areas was the business of bundling home loans into securities the area that later played a big role in the write downs at times mr oneal has been reluctant to share power until may he held all three top jobs at the firm as chairman chief executive and president he is not afraid to fire those around him who he doesnt feel are up to snuff in july six months after becoming ceo he ousted two top executives including his then no thomas patrick who had helped engineer mr oneals ascent as ceo that came after mr patrick objected to the firing of another executive arshad zakaria who was campaigning to become the firms president in the wake of the recent losses senior executives in merrills bond department were shown the door mr oneal has had his share of successes including the deal in that gave merrill a stake in blackrock in exchange for merrills asset management business but that deal is coming back to haunt mr oneal as blackrocks mr fink appears to be in the running to be the next merrill ceo the week before merrill reported its &# billion write down blackrock beat analysts earnings estimates and reported &# billion in new inflows as investors turned to the firm to manage their cash following the summers volatile markets on thursday goldman sachs group inc upgraded blackrock stock to a buy from a neutral rating noting "the visionary leadership" of mr fink hanging on the wall outside mr finks office at blackrock is a framed menu bearing his signature and that of mr oneal the menu is from the three guys restaurant a manhattan diner where in january the pair met to discuss the deal between merrill and blackrock mr fink helped found blackrock and built it into one of the worlds largest money managers with &# trillion in assets if the year old mr fink lands the merrill job it would close another circle in march mr fink left first boston inc after the mortgage backed securities group he oversaw suffered huge losses the experience helped shape mr finks strategy at blackrock which stresses risk controls in managing money the firm has largely dodged the bloodletting that started this summer in the mortgage backed securities market as well as turbulence elsewhere in the stock and bond markets mr fink is "very very concerned about the risk management side of the business and i think thats been a hallmark of blackrock " says morningstar analyst rachel barnard over the past year blackrocks risk models began waving red flags about lending standards and the potential for rising defaults in the mortgage market even as ratings agencies were still giving many mortgage backed securities top scores for safety says blackrock president robert kapito blackrock began pulling back from riskier parts of the mortgage market "it can be painful when the competition is showing higher yields " says mr kapito mr finks risk management abilities could help him at merrill but he doesnt have recent experience within a major brokerage firm merrills core is its army of brokers who rank no in revenues per broker mr fink also lacks experience managing a trillion dollar balance sheet which proved perilous for mr oneal if mr fleming were to take charge with mr fink it would help placate merrills investment bankers and possibly the brokers who might resent an outsider taking over a firm that prides itself on its home grown talent mr fleming began as an investment banker doing deals for financial companies he advised wachovias mr thompson on predecessor first union corp s &# billion acquisition of wachovia the head of merrills brokerage force mr mccann is also likely to figure in the new management mix because the business he leads has been successful and wasnt part of the write down problem although mr mccann once led the firms research and global stock markets division he doesnt have mr finks deep bond market experience diya gullapalli and valerie bauerlein contributed to this article
