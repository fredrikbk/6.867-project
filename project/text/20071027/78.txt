who is a terrorist one of the trickier battles in the war on terror has been the legal identification of friends and enemies under current u s law people who provide "material support" to terrorists are deemed terrorists themselves even if the groups theyre helping are freedom fighters agitating for causes that the u s government supports this has caused hardships among two worthy peoples to whom the u s owes a debt of gratitude hmong refugees from laos and montagnards from vietnam the hmong and the montagnards fought honorably alongside gis in vietnam after americans pulled out many were accepted as refugees in the u s others fled back to the hills where they are still persecuted then september happened u s law changed and they were suddenly dubbed "terrorists " this week after years of lobbying by republicans and democrats the state department waived the terrorist label for hmong and montagnards who had provided "material support " that lets them apply for asylum or if theyre already in the u s for permanent residency similar waivers have been issued to members of burmas chin karen and karenni ethnic groups and others like cubas alzados who provided "material support" to fighters trying to topple repressive governments nongovernmental organizations estimate the waivers could help at least asylum seekers in the u s and abroad more than burmese hmong and other refugees who were already given asylum and then saw their status change when the law changed in could now get green cards this weeks decision wont help the freedom fighters whom the law still dubs terrorists but congress is working on the problem senators norm coleman and jon kyl both republicans and patrick leahy a democrat have tucked a clause into a bill that would let the government pardon both freedom fighters and those who gave them material support while the clause wouldnt change the definition of a terrorist it would give the feds the ability to right wrongs when they occur
