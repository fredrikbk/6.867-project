weekend journal leisure &amp arts sightings serenading a tyrant should the new york philharmonic go to north korea if you want to know whats going on in the democratic peoples republic of korea all you have to do is look at a picture the one that donald rumsfeld displayed at a pentagon press conference in snapped after dark by a weather satellite it shows what the korean peninsula looks like from outer space every night of the year north korea is nearly pitch black south korea ablaze with countless points of electric light it is a jolting visual metaphor for the dark isolation of an impoverished totalitarian state whose hungry citizens are not permitted to own cellphones surf the web or listen to radio broadcasts from other countries why then is the new york philharmonic giving serious consideration to playing in pyongyang the capital of what may be the worlds most viciously repressive dictatorship and why is the bush administration encouraging it to do so when i heard that the philharmonic had been approached to visit north korea i thought at once of van cliburns visit to moscow where he won the tchaikovsky competition and taught a generation of russians that there was more to america than what they read in the pages of pravda thus helping to bring about the ultimate collapse of communism the state department reportedly believes that a philharmonic tour will have a similar effect on north korea and the management of the philharmonic seems inclined to agree a delegation of orchestra officials visited pyongyang two weeks ago and came home making positive noises but the parallels between moscow in and pyongyang a half century later are to put it mildly inexact in the soviet union under stalin and khrushchev classical music was generally accessible and composers like sergei prokofiev and dmitri shostakovich managed to write major works in spite of the rigid censorship to which they were subjected north korea by contrast does not have anything remotely resembling a serious musical culture and what it does have is not available to ordinary citizens eric latzky the philharmonics director of communications gave the game away when he made the following euphemism clotted statement to the new york times "we went to pyongyang and discovered a city that was clean and orderly and not without beauty and had a kind of high level of culture and intelligence " note especially that last phrase a kind of high level of culture in fact pyongyang under kim jong il who has imposed a stalin style cult of personality on the country he rules is widely reported to be exactly like london under big brother in george orwells "nineteen eighty four " where "culture" existed solely to serve the state and its murderous purposes elsewhere in the times story other unnamed philharmonic officials admitted that the apparatchiks who run north koreas state symphony orchestra "did not appear overly familiar with western classical composers " they go in for folk songs one member of the delegation however was assured that north koreas dear leader as mr kim is compulsorily known to his subjects is a musical expert who "personally fixed the acoustics at moranbong hall " no doubt he also wrote beethovens ninth and "hamlet " should the orchestra of gustav mahler arturo toscanini and leonard bernstein be making music for a man like that some thoughtful observers think its worth a try music critic greg sandow a contributor to the journal has argued on his blog that "if even a few north koreans can see for themselves what the west is like and if they can meet some americans theres no telling how deep the effect might be a western orchestra playing its heart out as im sure the philharmonic will might well be a revelation " i take mr sandows point and i too believe devoutly in the life changing power of western art but as he himself acknowledged "attendance at the philharmonics concerts will be carefully controlled and of course any concert in pyongyang cant possibly reach the north korean people because only the elite for the most part are allowed into pyongyang " even if such a concert were to be telecast the handful of north koreans lucky enough to see it isolated as they are from the rest of the world might well conclude that by sending a great orchestra there the u s was showing its support for the tyrants who rule them thats why ive come to the conclusion that should the philharmonic choose to play in pyongyang it will be doing little more than participating in a puppet show whose purpose is to lend legitimacy to a despicable regime what would you have thought if franklin roosevelt had encouraged the philharmonic to accept an official invitation to play in berlin in the spring of do you think such a concert would have softened the hearts of the nazis any more than jesse owenss victories in the olympics changed their minds about racial equality or inspired the german people to rise up and revolt against adolf hilter or saved a single jewish life the new york philharmonic and the bush administration would do well to ponder these questions before consenting to put americas oldest orchestra at the service of the man who turned off all the lights in north korea mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and blogs about the arts at www terryteachout com write to
