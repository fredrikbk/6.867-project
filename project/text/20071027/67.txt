weekend journal leisure &amp arts declarations apocalypse no i love chicks that have been intimate with ieds " he announced to his fellow soldiers sitting in the chow tent in camp falcon in baghdad "it really turns me on melted skin missing limbs plastic noses " the soldiers laughed so hard they almost fell from their chairs they enjoy running over dogs in bradley fighting vehicles luring them in and then crushing their bones as they whelp when a soldier comes upon a mass grave he picks up a human skull places it merrily on his head and marches around this is from the now famous "baghdad diaries " in the new republic carrying the byline of soldier writer scott thomas they are an attempt to capture the tragedy and dehumanization of war how it coarsens men in ways that you safe in your bed cannot fathom they are a lost generation battered by war and struggling with the real weapons of wars survivors mordant wit pitiless humor the final surrender to nihilism to survive in a world they never made do i overwrite do i sound like an idiot im just trying to fit in to read the thomas pieces was simply to doubt them and to wonder if its editors had ever actually met a soldier on his way to or from iraq or talked to any human being involved in the modern military the diaries appear to be another case of journalistic fabulism this week came word via the published transcript of a telephone conversation between "thomas " who is actually scott thomas beauchamp and his editors it is actually painful to read the editors almost plead with him to stand by his work after months of critics picking them factually apart he wont do it he doesnt want to talk to "the media " hes said enough everyone in journalism thought first of stephen glass i actually remember the day i read his new republic piece on the conservative political action conference in washington in a profile of young republicans as crude and ignorant pot smoking alcoholics in search of an orgy it um startled me after years of observation i was inclined toward the view that theres no such thing as a young republican more to the point id been to the kind of convention mr glass wrote about and i thought it not remotely possible that the people he painted were real i also thought man this is way too convenient the new republic tends to think republicans are hateful and this reporter just happened to be welcomed into the private world of the most hateful republicans in history on the thomas stories which i read not when they came out but when they began to come under scrutiny i had a similar thought or a variation of it i thought thats not iraq thats a vietnam war movie thats not life as its being lived on the ground right now thats life as an editor absorbed it through media thats the dark world of kubrick and coppola and oliver stone of the great vietnam movies of the s and s if thats what you absorbed during the past or years it just might make sense to you it would actually seem believable if a fellow in iraq wrote for you about taunting scarred women shooting dogs and wearing skulls as helmets this is the offhand brutality of war you know you saw it in a movie if youd had a broader array of references and were less preoccupied by the media that is the great occupying force in our own country and you were the editor of the thomas pieces you might have said "whoa " just whoa ill jump here or lurch i suppose to something i am concerned about that i think i am observing accurately it has to do with what sometimes seems to me to be the limited lives that have been and are being lived by the rising generation of american professionals in the arts journalism academia and business they have had good lives happy lives but there is a sense with some of them that they didnt so much live it as view it that they learned too much from media and not enough from lifes difficulties that they saw much of what they know in a film or play and picked up all the memes and themes in terms of personal difficulties they seem to have had less real life experience or rather different experiences than their rougher predecessors they grew up affluent in a city or suburb cosseted in material terms and generally directed toward academic and material success their lives seem to have been not crowded or fearful but relatively peaceful at least until september which was very hard but this new leadership class those roughly to grew up in a time when media dominated all they studied they entered a top tier college and then on to washington or new york or los angeles but their knowledge their experience is necessarily circumscribed too much is abstract to them or symbolic the education establishment did them few favors they didnt have to read dostoevsky they had to read critiques and deconstruction of dostoevsky im not sure its always good to grow up surrounded by stability immersed in affluence and having had it drummed into you that you are entitled to be a member of the next leadership class to have this background in the modern era is to come from a ghetto the luckiest ghetto in the world a golden ghetto beyond whose walls it can be hard to see theres much to be said for suffering for being on the outside or the bottom for having to have fought yourself up and through it can leave you grounded it can give you real knowledge not only of the world and of other men but of yourself in some ways it can leave you less cynical not everything comes down to money and in some ways it leaves you just cynical enough journalistically i was lucky enough to work at cbs news when it was still shaped by the influence of the murrow boys they knew and taught that "everyone is entitled to his own opinions" and they had them "but not his own facts " and i miss the rough old boys and girls of the front page whod greet fdr with "snappy suit mr president " whod bribe the guard to tell them what the prisoner said on the way to the chair and who were not rich and important but performed an extremely important social function they found out who what where when why and they would have looked at the half baked overcooked junior hemingway of scott thomas beauchamp and said "that sounds like a buncha hooey "
