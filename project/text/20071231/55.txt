radio france seeks easing of ad rules state run stations want to air spots from private firms paris when state controlled gaz de france is privatized in state broadcaster radio france will lose a key advertiser under a law radio france which operates news music and general programming stations can accept ads only from state run companies that wasnt much of a problem when most of french industry such as carrier air france and phone company france telecom was in state hands but as the french economy has evolved and paris has privatized many of its largest companies radio france is struggling to maintain its historical mission of being a public service broadcaster that operates free from the constraints of the commercial driven radio market radio france still receives state handouts derived from a tax on television set ownership that account for roughly of its million euros &# million annual budget by comparison in the u s national public radio had revenue of about &# million for the year ended sept limited advertising from state run companies covers almost of radio frances costs when gaz de france is privatized it will leave a hole of million euros more than of annual ad revenue that the broadcaster must fill from a dwindling number of potential advertisers "we need to have a wider choice " says radio france chief operating officer martin ajdari a few weeks ago the state broadcaster asked the french government to open the seven stations it operates to advertising from nonstate companies under draft rules prepared by frances culture ministry supermarket chains and alcoholic beverage makers could remain off limits to radio france radio frances struggle to fine tune its budget is part of a broader dilemma faced by many public service media outlets throughout europe public service media are under growing pressure to demonstrate that they use taxpayers money to produce something different from what can be heard and seen on commercial rivals in the united kingdom some members of the opposition conservative party say private broadcasters should be allowed to compete for state handouts to public broadcasters that are currently monopolized by the british broadcasting corp an ad free or ad light environment is a widespread but waning hallmark of public service radio and tv as many of these stations look for sources of revenue beyond state grants donations or noncommercial sponsorships they are trying to gauge how much room they can make for advertising before they start losing their soul and their audience "our listeners are allergic to advertising " says hubert huertas a reporter at radio france stations france culture and france musique and a national delegate with syndicat national des journalistes the journalists union "we need to preserve our distinctive sound " radio frances mainstream station france inter carries about minutes of ad breaks a day on its airwaves rtl group a unit of german conglomerate bertelsmann ag and frances leading commercial station measured by audience carries seven minutes of commercials every hour at national public radio the u s nonprofit radio content supplier chief executive ken stern says he would never consider extending the length of sponsorship messages for fear of destroying the radios relationship with its listeners "that is our deal with them " he says radio frances management is loath to ask for more money for fear of sparking criticism from budget hawks at the same time mr ajdari radio frances chief operating officer says he is fully aware that changing the ad format risks driving away listeners mr ajdari isnt seeking the right to longer commercial breaks but he says he "hopes to be able to chose from a longer list of advertisers and select the ones which fit best on its airwaves " currently he says the broadcaster is forced to solicit ads from only a handful of companies and nonprofit associations such as a pension company for civil servants or a goat cheese lobby group mr ajdari says there is no reason why an ad by a publicly traded bank such as bnp paribas which now is off limits to radio frances stations would be more jarring to listeners than ads from mutual insurer maif even if the government agrees to radio frances request some products could still be banned from state airwaves because they sound too "commercial" or arent compatible with the missions of public service media mr ajdari said the battle radio france is fighting has already been waged by many public tv stations faced with shrinking public financing state tv channel france and italian state broadcaster rai spa have gradually increased the length of ad breaks today italys three public tv stations are full of the same glitzy variety shows with scantily clad hostesses and frequent advertising breaks that are shown on the commercial channels france now is allowed to air an average of six minutes of advertising per hour as much as commercial rival television francaise or tf "the result is that france is struggling to differentiate its programs from those of tf and is mired in a deep identity crisis " says mr huertas the radio france journalist "it is a slippery slope in which we do not want to get caught " radio frances commercial rivals would dread having to compete for advertisers that is because radio frances mix of highbrow programming has spawned a broad following with a desirable segment of the market that could allow its stations to siphon off a significant portion of the radio ad market "advertisers will want to reach their listeners " guillaume astruc head of rtl ad placement unit ip france says of radio france "they will be able to bill a lot more "
