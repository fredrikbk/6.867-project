speak up mr buffett warren buffetts entry into the muni bond insurance market could represent perfect timing both financially and politically investors can only hope hell seek to do good while doing well specifically he can help put an end to an egregious double standard while congress has been busy crafting still more regulations on private business members have ignored sec warnings about the lack of transparency in government finance unlike publicly traded corporations state county and city bond issuers dont have to provide timely robust disclosure or follow standard accounting practices yet the same washington pols who cheerfully ratcheted up the pressure on companies via sarbanes oxley apparently have no time to address shady accounting in the public sector the recent history of government frauds from san diego to syracuse suggests they should make time an ongoing sec investigation resulted in new fraud charges this month against san diegos independent auditor the sec had already found that the city issued false and misleading financial statements in no fewer than five separate bond offerings in and the city didnt tell investors that its unfunded pension liabilities were about to balloon to &# billion by or about that little matter of another billion for retiree health care said sec chairman christopher cox in july "investors had no way of knowing that the city knowingly under funded its pension obligations so that it could increase pension benefits while deferring the costs " after the orange county bankruptcy of investors might have hoped for aggressive reform yet the years since have yielded new flavors of government accounting shenanigans the city of miami masked its operating cash flow shortage by spending the proceeds from bonds issued for other purposes maricopa county arizona kept investors in the dark about the large deficit in its general fund syracuse new york according to a recent sec white paper "falsely claimed a surplus for its general and debt service funds materially overstated its ending fund balances in those funds and misled investors by describing certain financial information as audited " the residents of san diego know all too well how costly such frauds can be for taxpayers and citizens who rely on city services trends in this market could make future financial disasters even more costly to investors thats because the booming muni market now funds numerous projects for which taxpayers are not on the hook traditionally the funding mechanism for roads and school construction muni securities have become conduits for all kinds of speculative ventures from convention centers to golf courses it is often the revenue from such ventures rather than taxes that is committed to repaying the loans the muni market was once dominated by institutional investors but it now mainly serves the individual investor who will feel the pain when government doesnt pay its debts roughly two thirds of muni securities are now owned by individuals either directly or through mutual funds mr buffett understands that he will be insuring instruments that provide less transparency than the corporate securities on which he built his fortune he told the journal last week that his company will charge high rates to compensate for "moral hazard " backed by mr buffett governments may borrow and spend beyond their means and then default on the bonds leaving berkshire with the tab for his own interest in getting repaid and for all investors and taxpayers mr buffett should lead the campaign for transparency in government finance when state and local bureaucrats have to live under the same regulations imposed on capitalists will the pols decide that all existing regulation is worth the cost perhaps more likely the end of the double standard will bring a reasonable level of investor protection to all markets congress acted in to make its members live by the same laws that they foist on the rest of us why should city hall get a free pass when it comes to securities laws mr buffett is just the man to end this hypocrisy he is adored by the press for advocating tax increases on himself as well as on many americans who dont enjoy his level of wealth he is also a coveted witness at congressional hearings mr buffetts voice on behalf of investors could advance an eminently sensible and much needed reform
