keeping book on immigration the census bureau informs us that when the clock strikes midnight the u s population will exceed million that represents a one year increase of and a increase since when our population stood at a mere million souls a lot of this growth is driven by immigration a topic that has dominated the news for much of talk radio hosts cable newscasters and presidential hopefuls insist that foreign nationals drive crime rates swell welfare rolls and steal jobs but the data tell a very different story between and the illegal immigrant population in the u s is estimated to have doubled to around million yet according the department of justice over that same period the violent crime rate in the u s declined by and the property crime rate fell by reaching their lowest levels since crime has fallen in cities with the largest immigrant populations such as new york los angeles chicago and miami as well as border cities like san diego and el paso texas a recent paper by the immigration policy center an advocacy group notes that "numerous studies by independent researchers and government commissions over the past years repeatedly and consistently have found that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes or be behind bars than the native born " today immigrants on balance are five times less likely to be in prison than someone born here its not because law abiding foreign professionals from india and china are compensating for criminally inclined low skill latinos immigrants from countries that comprise the bulk of our illegal alien population including mexicans salvadorans and guatemalans have lower incarceration rates than the native born another popular belief is that immigrants come here to go on the dole the data show that welfare caseloads have fallen as illegal immigration has risen as peter wehner and yuval levin report in the december issue of commentary magazine "since the high water mark in the national welfare caseload has declined by virtually every state in the union has reduced its caseload by at least a third and some have achieved reductions of over " apparently immigrants dont drive welfare caseloads anymore than they drive the u s crime rate the authors go on to note that "not only have the numbers of people on welfare plunged but in the wake of the welfare reform bill overall poverty child poverty black child poverty and child hunger have all decreased while employment figures for single mothers have risen " for all the talk about the "invasion" of million upon million of job consuming immigrants the unemployment rate stands at and job growth continues apace immigrants arent stealing jobs but filling them the economic activity they create as consumers and entrepreneurs contributes to the overall economic growth none of this is to argue that illegal immigration doesnt have costs especially in border communities and states with large public benefits in the post environment knowing whos in the country is more important than ever thats an argument for better regulating cross border labor flows not ending them the best way to reduce pressure on the border is by providing legal ways for people to come and work with the bracero guest worker program of the s illegal entries from mexico declined to a trickle a similar program today could have much the same effect while serving our homeland security and economic interests on balance the evidence shows that immigrants are still an asset to the u s
