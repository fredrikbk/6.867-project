down at downing street normally when politicians make predictions events make them look foolish but theres been one forecast from a politician in the past months which has proved the prediction of the year at the beginning of david miliband was reflecting on the low ratings of then prime minister tony blair he suggested that unpopularity was just a feature of incumbency he predicted that within a year people would be saying "wouldnt it be great to have that blair back because we cant stand that gordon brown " less than a year later mr miliband is foreign secretary in gordon browns government and their administration is so mired in unpopularity that its actually below the level in the opinion polls mr blair touched at his nadir what makes this all the more ironic is the casual assumption of so many in the labour party that a simple change in personnel at the top and a new direction in foreign policy would revive their fortunes the standard view on the left put labours unpopularity down to mr blairs closeness to president bush his support for the iraq war and his subsequent solidarity with israel during its war with hezbollah in the summer of from the very moment mr brown took over he indicated a different foreign policy direction one that acknowledged the legitimacy of the lefts criticism against mr blair so mark malloch brown a united nations functionary who had been sharply critical of mr blair over iraq and lebanon was made a foreign office minister the new international development secretary douglas alexander gave a speech in washington in which he warned against overreliance on "military might " his words were interpreted understandably as further evidence that the brown administration wanted to distance itself from the bush doctrine mr brown then tried to backtrack by having his aides organize a press briefing where they slapped down mr alexander for going too far but mr alexander was only reflecting his bosss own inner instincts as the world saw later when mr brown visited the u s for his first summit with mr bush instead of the solidarity mr blair had shown to a leader whose nation had been subjected to terrorist attacks and who was spearheading the fight against jihadism mr brown treated the president with the bare minimum of courtesy this passionless take on the special relationship was supposed to signal to the british left that mr brown shared their distaste for the "cowboy" in the white house while also reassuring middle england that he nevertheless knew how to maintain a working relationship with the worlds largest power but the impression left in most peoples eyes was that of a man who having coveted leadership all his life now seemed incapable of leading where mr blairs atlanticism was born from conviction mr browns seemed wholly shaped by calculation and it is calculation of a peculiarly inept kind that has marked all of gordon browns foreign policy positions on iraq his principal aim has been to distance himself from the blair legacy he has failed to articulate the importance of iraq to the broader war against islamist terror as mr blair did so eloquently he has made his sole metric of success the speed with which he can draw down troops in the course of this withdrawal however there have been insurgent gains in the basra region unflattering comparisons have been drawn with the successes secured by the u s surge just as americas iraq policy based on resolution is bearing fruit britains new prime minister shows precisely the opposite qualities on the other principal front of the war on terror afghanistan mr brown has been scarcely more impressive earlier this month the prime ministers team leaked to the media that he would be willing to "talk to the taliban " but when speaking in the house of commons later mr brown offered no such negotiations in fact the prime minister went out of his way to disavow such an approach presumably mr brown had been told in the interim that going public with a desire to talk peace with islamist fighters while british troops were in the midst of an intense war would send the wrong message to the taliban and the home front nevertheless press reports last week claimed british officials are already negotiating with the taliban if correct this would cast doubt not only on the prime ministers trustworthiness but on his judgment jihadist fighters are emboldened by what they see as western unwillingness to stay the course when we offer talks they dont see that as a route to peace but a sign of weakness it is striking how poorly mr brown compares with his predecessor in his understanding of how to show steel in times of danger after the failed terrorist attacks in london and glasgow last june just a few weeks after he became prime minister mr brown had the perfect platform to outline the totalitarian nature of the ideology that motivates the men who wished to commit mass murder but he deliberately ducked the challenge he made no reference to the islamist roots of the terrorists a studied distancing from the clarity of the blair years instead he argues that material deprivation breeds terrorism ignoring the work of princeton economist alan krueger and others showing that terrorism is not a function of poverty but of ideology given how far mr brown has traveled from his predecessors position on foreign affairs with such little electoral benefit perhaps its worth reassessing the blair legacy many on the left were so opposed to the iraq war that it blinded them to the labour governments real problems the issues that most profoundly alienate mainstream voters are the governments failure to improve public services its weakness on fighting crime and its tax raising record the self styled "domestic overlord" who has been responsible for most of these bread and butter issues has been gordon brown now that there is no one for mr brown to hide behind his faults are more cruelly exposed than ever and so mr blairs judgment has been vindicated on another issue as well his succession we can all understand now why he tried for as long as possible to avoid handing over power to his flawed no mr gove is a member of the conservative shadow cabinet his analysis of islamist terror "celsius " was published last year by weidenfeld and nicolson
