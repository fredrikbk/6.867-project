politics &amp economics canadas aid seeded china dam study steered contentious three gorges but warnings existed the canadian governments little examined role in the building of chinas three gorges dam sheds light on how foreign governments and companies helped china move forward with one of the most controversial engineering projects in history many western governments including the u s initially refused to support chinas plan to build the worlds largest hydroelectric dam canada was the first western country to break ranks and back the massive project that opened the door for western companies to sell lucrative high technology equipment to china while certain governments pledged taxpayer dollars in export credits the decision to build the three gorges dam was ultimately beijings but a big part of how events played out occurred thousands of miles away in the canadian province of quebec in the midst of a domestic political crisis the canadian government offered important assistance for the dam despite warnings from canadian engineers about how high the dam could be nearly two decades ago china picked a consortium funded by canada to conduct an official study to determine whether it should build a dam around the canyons of the yangtze rivers three gorges at the time canada was a strong backer of hydroelectric power which had played a key role in the countrys early industrialization the report largely supported the idea of the dam but with one caveat its waters shouldnt exceed a depth of meters feet "we thought to was feasible " says pierre senecal a hydro quebec engineer who worked on the project "but we could not definitely say that or were feasible or infeasible so we did not recommend going beyond " three years later china decided to build the dam at meters disregarding advice from its own official feasibility study today the waters behind the dam have reached meters and continue to rise even as earth slides increase and the number of people to be relocated soars with more than meters yet to go concern is growing that the problems could get worse the waters height has become one of the defining problems with the dam triggering millions of resettlers spiraling costs and serious pollution and thanks to technology transfer from the few western countries that supported the project it has led to the creation of chinese companies that are now aggressively building dams in other developing countries around the world even as developed countries have largely abandoned giant hydropower projects "the problems at the three gorges arent just a chinese problem as its often portrayed " says pat adams of probe international a canadian based environmental advocacy group "its a world wide issue with responsibility in other countries too " the chinese cabinets three gorges project construction committee which holds primary responsibility for the dam declined to comment specifically on the canadian feasibility study and its height recommendations but the committee says foreign experts from previous decades had endorsed building it meters or higher li feng head of the public relations department for the committee said the final height was deemed "appropriate" by chinese planners given the dams various functions when china began to implement market overhauls in the s a group of engineers gained influence in the excitement of the early reform era they pushed a gargantuan vision the dam would create a reservoir as long as lake superior and generate more power than any hydro project in the world but the proposed project spurred unprecedented opposition among leaders and ordinary citizens chinas engineers turned to canada a trusted international friend and a leader in hydroelectric energy that boasts some of the worlds largest dam projects the canadian international development agency agreed to foot the &# million study the study was undertaken by canadas more prestigious energy companies including the utility and power generator hydro quebec they were based in montreal the biggest city in the french speaking province of quebec a location that would have implications later the multivolume study which was the only official feasibility report on the dam was submitted to the chinese government in the canadians backed most of the chinese engineers assumptions even supporting the idea that one dam could achieve the disparate goals of flood control power generation and improved shipping but the studys caveat about height remained little noticed chinese engineers wanted to fill the reservoir to meters in order to generate more power and give the country the option of siphoning off water to its water starved north "when youve done this for a while its easy to predict what will happen " mr senecal the canadian engineer says today "it is a point of diminishing returns " at first the debate over the waters height seemed academic in chinas parliament blocked government efforts to build the dam recommending that it be put on hold for five years in however a hard charging premier named li peng revived the project mr li himself a hydroelectric engineer backed the plan to build a multipurpose dam at meters he pushed the project through parliament construction was scheduled to start in at the time china had relatively low foreign currency reserves and no expertise in building such a complex dam it lacked the technology for the huge turbines needed to generate electricity or the high tension power cables to transmit it initially western countries and international organizations balked at the project canadas development agency which had funded the feasibility study decided in against participating citing concerns over the projects viability and social impact the world bank didnt provide funding saying the project wasnt economically viable the u s withdrew its support ending its year old interest in the project with washington saying in it no longer believed that such dams were a good idea for americans and thus couldnt recommend building them overseas then canada did an about face in recently elected prime minister jean chretien led a trade mission to china mr chretiens liberal party which had won power a year earlier had been on record opposing a canadian role in three gorges but by the time of the china trip mr chretien was facing political upheaval in his home province of quebec where support for a movement to separate from canada was surging ahead of a referendum on the subject quebecs biggest city montreal was the headquarters of canadas hydroelectric industry and home to many global power generating companies the trade mission was meant to show canadians that their future was stronger together than apart says sergio marchi a member of mr chretiens cabinet and later trade secretary during it mr chretien surprised people back home and announced his governments support for the three gorges dam sales followed in china awarded turbine contracts valued at &# million to general electric canada based in montreal and two german companies ge canada and its parent company general electric co of the u s declined to comment a few months later canadas government run export development corp guaranteed &# million of the deal this opened the door for other companies to sell to china more than &# billion of crucial high technology products for the dam almost all the amount was underwritten by foreign governments through export credits low interest or interest free loans to beijing to help pay for the products besides canada germany switzerland sweden and france all pledged such taxpayer support for the sales essentially a subsidy on the dams total costs canadas reversals left china building a dam based on the s canadian feasibility study but without any follow up support from canada it sold the equipment but when its aid agency pulled its support that meant technical help was curtailed follow up studies might have shown that some of the canadian assumptions were wrong most of the engineers had just spent a decade on hydro quebecs gargantuan james bay dam built on the sparsely populated rocky terrain of northern quebec the dam was different from the three gorges with its silty soil and heavily populated surroundings canadian officials today decline to comment on the project saying it was decided by another government the canadian engineers had anticipated that only people would have to move if the dam was built to meters already million have been displaced and the dam is only at meters recently
