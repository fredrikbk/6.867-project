return to tokyo in after s losses for japanese stocks shares there appear relatively cheap tokyo investors in japanese stocks suffered through their worst year since but there is hope the new year may treat them better historically cheap stock prices could overcome worries about the strength of the yen and weak corporate governance in the worlds second largest economy both long running concerns the nikkei stock average of companies fell in to its first losing year in the last five the last trading day was friday the topix index which is usually used by strategists because of its breadth did worse dropping to also its first loss since both indexes fared far worse than other asian markets which generally posted double digit percentage gains even so it will take sizable gains in the new year to pretty up the longer term picture the nikkei is down from its record close set dec while many asian markets set dozens of record closes this year the drop in is due in part to a surge in the yen which erodes the value of earnings from foreign markets when calculated in the countrys currency it also comes after a series of company actions and court decisions that suggest japan isnt ready for more aggressive shareholder capitalism like that practiced in the u s and united kingdom but the slump in share prices has made japanese stocks look cheap compared with those in other countries blue chip companies like car maker honda motor and copy and camera maker canon are trading near their lows for the year even though many are expected to post record profits strategists say that will draw value hunting investors many of whom have shunned the countrys stock market although they will be selective in which companies they buy "everybody is underweight japan " said shoji hirakawa a strategist at the tokyo office of swiss banking group ubs referring to the fact that global investors hold fewer japanese stocks in their portfolios relative to the percentage of the worlds markets that is japanese mr hirakawa said foreign investors likely will prowl japan for bargains in ubs recently recommended that investors raise their exposure to japan to the same as its global percentage mr hirakawa forecasts the topix index will rise to by the middle of which suggests a leap already some foreign investors appear to have taken notice the qatar investment authority a &# billion sovereign wealth fund is looking to buy japanese shares as part of its portfolio so is the china investment corp which manages &# billion behind the optimism japanese shares are cheap by a host of widely used metrics the topix trades at a price earnings ratio a measure of how expensive a stock is that compares a companys stock price to its earnings per share of about that is lower than the global average of and much lower than the nearly for markets in the rest of asia japan is even cheaper when viewed by its price book value ratio this ratio compares the value of a company to the value of its assets like bank deposits buildings and land and machinery on average japanese stocks trade at a price book value ratio of a little over compared with a global average of about u s stocks trade at a little over while markets in other asian countries trade at over three ubss mr hirakawa reckons about of the companies that comprise the topix trade for a price book value ratio of less than one that means those companies stock market values are less than the value of their assets to be sure it is an open question as to how quickly or even if investors recognize the relative cheapness of japan peter tasker a strategist at the tokyo office of dresdner kleinwort said japanese companies are at their cheapest level in years if measured by their earnings but in a recent report he conceded "it takes time for low valuations to attract capital " mr tasker doesnt have a published target for the topix critics said japanese companies are risky because the yen still hasnt stabilized against the dollar they said the japanese currency might rise further if the u s economy weakens and the u s central bank cuts interest rates that would hurt the competitiveness of japans exporters by making their products more expensive on overseas markets concerns about the health of japans economy which is still mired in slow growth also could cap stock prices earlier in december a widely watched bank of japan survey showed business sentiment in the country had slipped to its lowest level in more than two years in addition to the yen high oil and raw material costs weighed on sentiment worst of all critics complain japanese management teams dont run companies for their shareholders but rather for employees and business associates shareholders who have tried to persuade companies to take their interests into account have been brushed aside and more companies have adopted poison pills a plan designed to make a threatened takeover more expensive through the issuance of huge amounts of stock over the summer japans supreme court ruled that a small condiment maker bull dog sauce could use such a plan to ward off a hedge fund that wanted to buy it "the lack of attention paid to shareholders is evident " said marc goldstein a corporate governance specialist at consultancy riskmetrics group "it is why japan has been among the worst performing stock markets in the world " still evidence is starting to emerge that companies are taking better care of their shareholders many firms have begun using some of their profits to buy back shares which pushes up stock prices all other factors being equal earlier this year canon steelmaker jfe holdings and trading house mitsubishi announced they would buy back shares with a total value of more than billion yen &# billion dividends also are rising the companies listed on the tokyo stock exchanges first section paid trillion yen in dividends in the first fiscal half which ended sept that is a increase from the same period a year earlier according to mr hirakawa of ubs he thinks the figure will rise to trillion yen for the full fiscal year which ends march see related article "heard on the street and u s star seeks to rescue shinsei
