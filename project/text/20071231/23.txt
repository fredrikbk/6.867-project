drug use and the candidates in his autobiography "dreams from my father " presidential candidate barack obama admitted using alcohol and drugs in high school he was unusually frank compared to bill clinton and george w bush to name just two politicians reputed to have used drugs mr obama raised the issue again in november in manchester n h in response to a request by central high schools principal that he reveal his "human side " he discussed his high school years in hawaii "i was kind of a goof off there were times when i got into drinking and experimented with drugs " he added that he had righted himself to become a "grind" by the end of college then an influential new hampshire democrat and hillary clinton supporter bill shaheen said mr obamas drug use made him vulnerable to attacks from republicans mr shaheen quickly retracted his remarks but voter attention was directed to the candidates teen behavior just weeks before the jan iowa caucuses and jan new hampshire primary are there many other prominent people who used illicit substances when young messrs bush and clinton are likely only the tip of the iceberg according to the university of michigans monitoring the future survey in about half of high school seniors had used an illegal drug more than seven of seniors had consumed alcohol and had been drunk in fact drank alcohol in the past month these figures rise and fall over the years in the spring of mr obamas th year two thirds of seniors had used an illicit drug and more than had consumed alcohol in the past month there has been massive drug and underage alcohol use by americans over the years more than million americans according to the national survey on drug use and health have used illicit drugs yet the overwhelming majority of them like messrs bush clinton and obama have grown up to be productive citizens some believe theres no need to know about their youthful misconduct republican presidential candidate mitt romney takes this one step further "its just not a good idea " he said "for people running for president of the united states who potentially could be the role model for a lot of people to talk about their personal failings while they were kids because it opens the doorway to other kids thinking well i can do that too " well this is not the whole story neural research indicates that adolescent brains program kids to try risky behaviors it is unlikely we will soon prevent large numbers of teens from drinking and using drugs yet subtracting the approximately million current drug users from the million plus people who once used almost million americans have left drugs behind perhaps it can be good for young people to learn that as they mature they can and will straighten out and fly right this is the opposite of the approach of nearly all school drug education programs here the logic is to troop in people who have ruined their lives by their drug use and drinking as object lessons in the evils of sin but there are reasons to believe that kids reject negative messages from figures like these and that purely scare tactics dont work research on effective drug resistance programs finds that the best ways to prevent substance abuse are for kids to develop skills feel good about themselves have positive peers and look forward to their futures from this perspective mr obamas message that he briefly stumbled but then righted himself to achieve success may be just what the doctor ordered mr peele is a psychologist and addiction expert and the author of "addiction proof your child" three rivers press see related letter "letters to the editor medical consequences of recreational drug use" wsj january see related letter "letters to the editor pot long ago no blot where is character now " wsj january
