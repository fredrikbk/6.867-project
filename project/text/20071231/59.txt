ron pauls war chest swelled in th quarter republican presidential candidate ron paul may lag behind in public opinion polls but after raising about &# million for the final three months of the year he is now among his partys front runners in the race for campaign cash when the books close on the years fourth quarter today the plain spoken antiwar texas congressman will have posted one of the best fund raising periods of any republican presidential candidate this year to be sure other republican candidates hadnt disclosed their fourth quarter fund raising figures as of yesterday but to date only former massachusetts gov mitt romney has issued a better three month report and just once &# million in the first quarter not counting loans the former venture capitalist made to his campaign mr pauls fund raising performance is all the more remarkable because his bid for the republican nomination remains such a long shot an advocate of small government who opposes american participation in most international organizations and treaties and who would leave questions like abortion up to the states mr paul registers in single digits in polls nationally and in the key early voting states of iowa and new hampshire his fourth quarter fund raising figures represent a remarkable acceleration for the first three quarters of this year combined he raised just &# million the year old congressman who is also an obstetrician is the only candidate in either party so far to disclose his fourth quarter fund raising figures he posts a running tally on his web site updated frequently and with the names of his most recent contributors displayed as of midday yesterday mr paul had raised &# million and had more checks to count that had come in through the mail former arkansas gov mike huckabee a folksy baptist minister who has surged to the top of the polls in iowa and elsewhere with strong support from christian evangelicals also had his best fund raising quarter however mr huckabees campaign declined to announce its total take mr huckabees web site shows he has raised nearly &# million online during the quarter and that alone is more than double the &# million he raised in the first nine months of the year in a conference call with reporters friday mr huckabee said he now has about &# million in the bank and no campaign debts neither mr romney nor any of the other republican candidates would say yesterday how much they had raised in the quarter the deadline for filing public reports of their year end finances is jan mr pauls ability to reel in increasingly large hauls of campaign cash is a measure of his supporters passion for his libertarian views and an unflattering mirror of his better known rivals campaigns whose fund raising trends have been downward mr pauls total is all the more impressive because unlike other candidates few of his donors are giving the maximum &# check about percent of mr pauls contributions come through online donations that average &# per donor said his spokesman jesse benton "we have powerful grassroots support " he said "it shows how hungry people are for real change " it also means mr paul will have money to run television ads and hire staff for campaign operations even in big states like florida which holds its primary on jan with his war chest and strong appeal to political independents mr paul could possibly be a spoiler for candidates like john mccain or former new york mayor rudy giuliani in new hampshire where both candidates are angling for such voters independents have special influence in new hampshire because the states jan primary elections are open to voters who havent chosen any party affiliation enthusiasm has been much greater on the democratic side if fund raising is the barometer the top two candidates sens hillary clinton of new york and barack obama of illinois had raised a combined &# million through sept that was roughly the same amount as the entire republican field which originally numbered candidates had raised in the same period the republican money struggles come amid low approval ratings for president bush and the lack of any clear heir apparent such as a vice president running for the nomination "republican donors are being more methodical in how they chose a candidate this time " said jennifer bannister a republican fund raising consultant who isnt working for any presidential campaign "im hearing people say they are waiting to get behind a candidate when one pulls out in front "
