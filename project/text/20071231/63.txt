small satellites launch big plan start up proposes gps collection of weather data a veteran space scientist turned entrepreneur is making a big bet that a new generation of small low cost satellites can revolutionize the collection of weather and environmental data used to track storms and monitor climate shifts tom yuncks closely held company geooptics llc of pasadena calif is raising money in an effort to increase the accuracy and lower the cost of satellites used to do everything from predicting hurricanes to documenting climate change geooptics aims to build tiny low orbit satellites to record how radio signals bend as they travel through the atmosphere such techniques can provide extremely accurate measurements of temperature pressure and moisture content across different regions and altitudes and such data can be gathered at a fraction of the cost of relying on traditional earth observation satellites the methods "have dramatically superior accuracy" compared with established satellite designs and "unprecedented impact on improving forecasting of severe storms including hurricanes " mr yunck said the principles have been widely known in scientific circles for many years mr yunck participated in some of the pioneering work in the late s at the national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion laboratory he helped develop sensors and procedures for tracking the paths of navigational signals transmitted by the governments global positioning system satellites for environmental monitoring air force researchers and groups of international weather researchers have validated the technology u s agencies are looking for such lower cost alternatives in light of technical problems and cost overruns affecting advanced weather and environmental sensors the year old scientist is retiring from the jet propulsion laboratory and moving out of the experimental realm his company seeks to deploy and operating a fleet of two dozen satellites weighing about pounds each to measure gps signals geooptics said it has commitments of about &# million and the initial cost is projected at about &# million traditional weather and climate monitoring satellites are more than times heavier must be placed in much higher orbits and carry price tags reaching hundreds of millions of dollars apiece sensors on those spacecraft dont utilize gps signals for measurements overall the u s spends an estimated &# billion annually for a variety of established earth monitoring satellites and forecasting efforts europe has invested billions of euros over the years in similar technologies mr yuncks plans reflect a government and industry trend of focusing on the capabilities of smaller satellites and looking to commercial operators to supply detailed satellite mapping and climate data functions that used to be the unchallenged domain of the government the new venture has licensed sensor technology from the jet propulsion laboratory and plans to manufacture the hardware itself geooptics hopes to launch the first group of satellites by years ahead of a multibillion dollar satellite system championed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration "the argument is no longer over whether the alternative technology works " mr yunck said "it represents a fundamental shift in the model for collecting data " instead of measuring atmospheric temperatures in vertical bands stretching for miles the proposed satellites are designed to pinpoint measurements to hundreds of yards most important supporters say the sensors can keep recording accurate data through clouds and storms early generation sensors are successfully operating aboard a number of orbiting international spacecraft while the project is projected to cost less than &# million a satellite including launch mr yuncks company still has to raise the bulk of its start up funding at this point it doesnt have a contract to sell the data to noaa or any other government agency in addition to informal discussions with mr yunck noaa officials have publicly emphasized their desire to seek out private providers of weather data mike beavin senior program analyst at noaa said the technology proposed by geooptics "is at the very top of that list "
