air france faces myriad hurdles in reviving alitalia talks could lead to european star overhaul in order the italian governments decision to let air france klm sa enter exclusive merger talks with alitalia spa may lead to the creation of an airline behemoth that could alter the competitive landscape of europes aviation industry air france klm moved closer to uniting with alitalia on friday when italys finance ministry which holds a stake in the italian airline said it favored air france klms bid over that of smaller italian rival air one spa the two airlines will engage in eight weeks of exclusive talks to hammer out details of a deal that could see the franco dutch carrier take a controlling stake in alitalia however air france klm must overcome political financial and industrial hurdles many political quarters in italy favor a deal that would keep alitalia under italian ownership thus political interference that has long plagued the carrier may still scuttle a deal alitalias finances are a mess and the unprofitable carrier will need a massive cash infusion just to keep it flying through the next year moreover air france klm is beginning its talks with alitalia just as the global economy braces for a downturn that could dent revenue across the airline industry "to get any value from alitalia air france will have to play a very long game " said chris tarry an independent aviation analyst in london yet the italian carriers operations are in such disarray that "change at alitalia has to move very quickly " the potential rewards of a link up with alitalia are high air france completed its merger with klm in and the combined group is the worlds largest airline by revenue with alitalia the airlines revenue would be more than billion euros &# billion with its hubs in paris and amsterdam air france klm has been able to channel traffic onto its long haul flights it grabs high paying international business fliers traveling to or from small european cities who must transfer through a hub if air france klm were able to add a chunk of alitalias passengers it could significantly increase traffic on its international routes an alliance between alitalia and air france klm would produce a more varied network and fuller schedule than at rivals such as deutsche lufthansa ag and british airways plc with its european hubs the air france group would be able to send passengers across a wide range of routes this could give it another edge in competing for time sensitive business traffic many european carriers and low cost airlines have enjoyed a bonanza in italy in recent years as chronically weak alitalia bled market share alitalias domestic share measured by percentage of total passenger seats sold has fallen to today from in while the overall market has increased more than in the more lucrative international market alitalia has fared even worse dropping to from in even as overall volumes increased more than the first significant effect of an air france klm acquisition of alitalia would be to make italys national carrier a stronger competitor in its home market in particular in northern italys rich business traffic and in romes lucrative tourist market but that will require significant investment and a deft management touch alitalias powerful unions for example have been wary of the air france klm bid and they have been demanding a say in any restructuring plan union resistance has torpedoed previous restructuring efforts at the airline even as alitalia has inched toward financial collapse unions have threatened more strikes air france and klm management can draw from their own merger experience yet that joining took place over several years and both airlines were financially healthy at the time at alitalia managers will have to work quickly just to shore up the carriers balance sheet alitalia also has numerous operational headaches such as an aging and inefficient fleet a chaotic and mostly unprofitable domestic route system and costly ground operations the air france klm merger also coincided with a rise in global air traffic air traffic is closely linked to economic growth and airline profits generally follow economic cycles the u s and europe are widely expected to undergo an economic slowdown which may add strains to air france klm just as it is spending heavily to integrate alitalia into its network "it seems that was the peak year and all indicators are down now " said mr tarry the aviation analyst "you could argue that youre adding to the problems by buying a troubled airline "
