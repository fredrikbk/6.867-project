data security breaches reach a record in associated press the loss or theft of personal data such as credit card and social security numbers soared to unprecedented levels in and the trend isnt expected to reverse anytime soon as hackers stay a step ahead of security and laptops disappear with sensitive information and while companies government agencies schools and other institutions are spending more to protect ever increasing volumes of data with more sophisticated firewalls and encryption the investment is often too little too late "more of them are experiencing data breaches and theyre responding to them in a reactive way rather than proactively looking at the companys security and seeing where the holes might be " said linda foley who founded the san diego based identity theft resource center after becoming an identity theft victim herself a growing number of states require businesses and institutions to publicly disclose data losses thirty seven states and washington d c now have such requirements ms foleys group lists more than million records that were reported compromised in the u s alone through dec almost four times the nearly million records reported in all of another group attrition org estimates that more than million records were compromised through dec both in the u s and overseas attrition reported million last year "its just the nature of business that moving forward more companies are going to have more records so there will be more records compromised each year " said attritions brian martin "i imagine the total records compromised will steadily climb " the biggest difference between the two groups record loss counts relates to the breach at tjx cos attrition org estimates that million records were exposed in the theft of credit card data at tjx the owner of discount stores including t j maxx and marshalls the identity theft resource center counts about million the number of records that tjx acknowledged in march were potentially compromised attritions figure is based on estimates from visa and mastercard officials who were deposed in a lawsuit that banks filed against tjx on each list though the tjx breach represents more than half the total records reported lost this year the breach is believed to have started when hackers intercepted wireless transfers of customer information at two marshalls stores in miami an entry point that led the hackers to eventually break into tjxs central databases tjx has said that before the breach which was revealed in january it invested "millions of dollars on computer security and believes our security was comparable to many major retailers " with wireless data transmission more common hackers increasingly are expected to target what many experts see as a major vulnerability eavesdroppers appear to be learning how to bypass security safeguards faster than ever said jay tumas the head of harvard universitys network operations at a recent conference for information security professionals "within a year or two these folks are catching up " mr tumas said the two nonprofit groups data also show rising numbers of incidents in which employees lose sensitive data as opposed to cases of hacking in addition to the theft at tjx major breaches include lost data disks with bank account numbers in britain a hacker attack of a u s based online brokers database and a con that spilled resume contact information from a u s online jobs site "a lot of breaches are due to inadequate information handling such as laptop computers with social security numbers on them that are lost " ms foley said "this is human error and something thats completely avoidable as opposed to a hacker breaking into your computer system " attrition org and the identity theft resource center have been keeping track of data breaches for only a handful of years with varied and still evolving methods of learning about breaches and estimating how many people were affected despite those challenges the two nonprofits say it is clear will end up a record year for the amount of information compromised because of greater data loss and increased reporting of breaches the two groups acknowledge that many breaches may be missing from their lists because they largely count incidents reported in news outlets that they consider credible media coverage has risen in part because of the growing amount of legislation
