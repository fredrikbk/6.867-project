yuans surge unlikely to halt u s criticism gain on dollar offset by decline on euro beijing policy shift shanghai if chinas exchange rate policy is a speedometer for the governments move toward market economics the shift appears to be accelerating thanks to a surge in recent weeks the yuan is set to end up nearly against the dollar twice the amount it appreciated against the u s currency in and economists forecast a similar pace of upward movement in that could help cool down the red hot growth in the worlds third largest economy some analysts see the apparent policy shift as a sign of confidence one reason the government seems more willing to move now is that chinese exporters are so far surviving the effects of pinched profit margins resulting from the pricier chinese currency important because maintaining jobs in the huge export sector is a priority of chinas leadership "chinas economic strength is even bigger risk control ability is stronger and the government is more confident " says gao huiqing at the state information center a high level think tank in beijing the accelerated movement against the dollar also appears to be driven by several concerns that a stronger currency could help address inflation running at its highest rate in years a current account surplus that soared to of gross domestic product in the first half of and ballooning valuations on chinese stock markets even so there is little indication that the yuans rise has satisfied u s politicians manufacturers or workers who have complained for years that china is unfairly boosting exports by manipulating the currency deep seated american angst about china as a competitor for u s jobs which is fueling rhetoric in presidential and congressional campaigns is unlikely to be assuaged by a modest acceleration of the yuans appreciation against the dollar and chinas recent moves are less impressive when measured against a broad group of currencies especially in europe chinas no trading partner because china primarily limits exchange rate movement against the dollar the yuan has actually tracked the dollar lower this year against many other currencies including the euro and europe and japan have recently stepped up their criticism of chinas policy although beijing ended the yuans informal peg to the dollar in july it has continued to tightly control its value and critics argue that beijing has kept the currencys value artificially low in order to make its exports cheaper and more competitive u s treasury spokeswoman brookly mclaughlin pointed to a december speech in which treasury secretary henry paulson said the pace of the yuans change is "still not fast enough to reduce chinas global trade surplus" or other pressures and called again for "a more flexible currency " some washington veterans suspect chinese leaders may be holding back on making concessions to the u s aware that no matter what they offer the bush administration the next president will want more the treasury estimated in a report published dec that the yuan had effectively appreciated just since july when measured against currencies of chinas major trading partners the dollar finished at yuan on friday giving the chinese currency a rise of in compared with the gain in that means much of the chinese currencys roughly gain since july has been chalked up in the second half of this year though far from stunning for the worlds volatile foreign exchange markets the gains mark the biggest move for chinas currency since a devaluation of one third in the early s

beijing might engineer a one off boost in the currency of to although chinese officials have said in the past they dont intend to make such a move the yuans recent gains have generated speculation that beijing is trying to delay the political backlash expected when its foreign exchange reserves hit &# trillion triple the level of just three years ago chinas gaping global trade surplus is the biggest reason for the buildup in reserves because they represent money the central bank has bought from exporters in exchange for issuing them yuan but few analysts see chinas dominance as an exporter threatened in the coming year either by the yuans rise or by the possibility of a slowdown in the u s economy data on reserves published by logan wright an analyst for stone &amp mccarthy in

money buying companies overseas including stakes in wall street titans morgan stanley and bear stearns cos than was spent on takeovers of chinese companies the yuans recent acceleration came after the government said in december that monetary policy would become "tight " a significant change in tone that was backed with more aggressive lending limits for banks that in turn followed the selection in october of a new senior echelon of communist party leaders under president hu jintao the leadership has been especially alarmed by surging prices for food that have aroused public discontent and pushed up inflation despite government efforts to tame it the benchmark consumer price index jumped in november from a year earlier while low compared with the plus inflation rates of the early s the rise stoked concerns of social unrest among the urban and rural poor chinas central bank has been raising interest rates to combat the price pressure another factor that could be underpinning the yuan each time the federal reserve lowers rates or china raises them yuan denominated deposits and other investments look comparatively more attractive and beijing may be accepting that reality the mechanics of chinas exchange rate policy remain murky currency traders in shanghai where the yuan trades say recent strength has masked how much more active the peoples bank of china has become in
