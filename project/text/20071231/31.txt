if dr keeley could see you now youd be headed for jabs dr leslie e keeley would be appalled by how many people are getting drunk "inebriated " he would say on new years eve more than a century ago dr keeley predicted that in the future "alcohol would be banished from the face of the earth and drunkenness would be dead " in the late th century dr keeley claimed he had invented a scientific cure for alcoholism with a success rate his keeley institute in the small town of dwight ill was the betty ford center of the era at its peak the institute treated some patients a day and "gone to dwight" became shorthand for checking into rehab he promised his patients that at the end of their four week treatment they would not only be sober they wouldnt be tempted to drink alcohol again his slogan was "drunkenness is a disease and i can cure it " dr keeley was part visionary part charlatan and the combination made him a wealthy man he franchised his system to more than treatment centers across america and in canada and england five state legislatures in the u s agreed to use taxpayers money to subsidize the &# a week cost of treating drunks at keeley institutes when dr keeley died in his estate was valued at &# million about &# million in todays purchasing power many physicians publicly scoffed at dr keeleys theory of alcoholism as a physiological disease that could be permanently eradicated with hypodermic injections and oral tonics whose ingredients he refused to disclose although he was frequently beseeched to reveal his secret recipes for the sake of dipsomaniacs who couldnt afford his treatment he refused "only three people in the world know the formula " he said in he would divulge it only "when the medical profession has agreed that it is a cure for drunkenness such as i claim it is " at dwight patients lined up four times a day at the "shot tower" to "get their jabs " their only other duties were to eat well exercise and get plenty of sleep dwight was a dry town but patients could request shots of whisky from their doctors dr keeley knew theyd lose their taste for alcohol and after a few days the requests ceased dr keeley was often asked whether patients should come to dwight drunk or sober "sober " he would shout but the majority of patients arrived drunk and some were transferred from the train station to the institute on stretchers dr keeley theorized that alcohol essentially poisons the nerve cells and "the craving of inebriates for alcohol is no more controllable by the will than is the high temperature of a fever " if the damaged cells were allowed to regenerate the patient would be exactly the same mentally and physically as a person who had never taken a drink "stimulants in any form will never again be a necessity pleasure or temptation to him " he said if a keeley graduate "returned to his cups " it was a conscious choice not a relapse "the man returned to his old habits simply because he wanted to " dr keeley explained even if his success rate was much lower than his claims some patients did leave dwight sober for life but not because of the dope as it was called the injected drug which was known as double bichloride of gold was actually a mixture of low doses of chemicals such as atropine which could give patients nausea if they drank alcohol although it was known as the gold cure there was no gold in the formula but the patients also cut off contact with their families and friends and entered a community of people who also wanted to stop drinking "the patient is with those who like himself are bent upon one end the patients inspire one another " dr keeley said in "there is a happy and cordial enthusiasm over a friends recovery " the media had their skeptics such as joseph medill managing editor of the chicago tribune he and dr keeley made a bet mr medill would send a half dozen of chicagos most inveterate skid row drunks to dwight if they were cured mr medill would pay their bills if not there would be no charge dr keeley won "they went away sots and returned gentlemen " mr medill conceded giving the keeley institute the kind of publicity that cant be bought but dr keeley also advertised widely in newspapers and magazines another source of friction between him and the medical profession some newspapers endorsed the cure blaming relapses on the drinker rather than on the treatment "the keeley gold cure may not in all cases prove successful for it is utterly impossible for the medicine to place brains in a mans head " a delaware newspaper declared in dr keeleys cure survived for a few decades after his death in but without its chief promoter and defender its popularity waned yet dr keeley played an important role in convincing americas that alcoholism was a disease not a sin or a crime in the future he wrote in "the reproach of drunkenness will be that it is not cured " email me at cynthia crossen wsj com
