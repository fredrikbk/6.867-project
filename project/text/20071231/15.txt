campaign the spirit behind huckabees advertising approach media consultant helps tap conservative vein a tighter inner circle cedar rapids iowa ad man bob wickerss face lit up as he saw the spark he was searching for it was the last stop in a long day of campaigning across eastern iowa and his client mike huckabee was on fire preaching the politics of godliness and the importance of standing up for core beliefs mr wickerss film crew caught it all down to the crowds last "amen " one day soon a clip from this speech may be pumped into the homes of voters contemplating the republican nomination for president the next installment in one of the least conventional presidential ad campaigns in years until now the spots have combined humor and a heavy dose of religion with subtle digs at rival mitt romney that manage to knock the former massachusetts governor without ever uttering his name or delivering an outright attack a strategy that is about to change "theyre just being extremely clever when those ads go up on the screen against any one elses ad it makes the argument implicitly that he is different " said kathleen hall jamieson an expert on political communication at the university of pennsylvania "right now the smartest advertising on the air is huckabee " she said mr romney has been running a more conventional ad campaign with a series of attack ads critical of mr huckabees record as governor of arkansas mr huckabee first addressed these attacks on the stump and put out a general defense on television with the iowa caucuses coming on thursday and polls showing his lead is gone his campaign plans its first attack ad aimed at mr romney to begin airing today a variety of factors explain the former arkansas governors rise from bottom to top of the pack in iowa including his appeal to evangelicals an aura of genuineness and flaws of other better funded competitors another reason for mr huckabees success a set of unusual ads crafted by mr wickers a media consultant working on his first presidential campaign every presidential election makes stars out of a few political consultants in joe trippi won a reputation for harnessing the internet to help his candidate democrat howard dean in karl roves reputation as a political master was sealed with the election of george w bush should mr huckabee continue his climb mr wickers and his team would earn similar reviews for now the huckabee campaign hasnt had much money to spend on commercials and hasnt spent much on consultants through sept the campaign spent &# on a category they labelled "media consultants " well below spending by every other major candidate according to an analysis of spending reports by the center for responsive politics mr wickerss share of that was &# according to the center aides say they havent been able to afford any polling or focus groups to test messages before they go on the air despite this or perhaps because of it their ad campaign has an edginess unusual at the presidential level it began with a tongue in cheek spot featuring action star chuck norris which quickly became an internet hit the next ad the first to air widely on iowa tv showcased mr huckabee as a "christian leader" and reminded evangelical voters what they dont like about mr romney without mentioning or referring to him "i dont have to wake up every day wondering what do i need to believe " mr huckabee says then a christmas ad may or may not have included a subliminal cross in the background a mystery that generated the sort of buzz a campaign can only hope santa will bring on his sleigh with the exception of the ad featuring mr norris the spots all have one thing in common the only voice you hear is that of mr huckabee "you dont hide a candidate like mike huckabee " said mr wickers "he knows how to connect " mr wickers years old is a veteran of california republican politics he got to know mr huckabee through his business partner dick dresner who has worked for mr huckabee since his run for lieutenant governor mr wickers joined the team for mr huckabees first gubernatorial campaign in mr wickers a presbyterian and longtime resident of san francisco doesnt appear to have much in common with a southern baptist running a campaign crafted to appeal to evangelical iowans and southerners mr wickers says he and his candidate have bonded by a shared sense of both faith and struggle he relates to mr huckabees hard scrabble life story recounted at each campaign stop the son of a los angeles police officer mr wickers and his sister were the first generation in their family to attend college like his client he had to work his way through school an internship with then sen pete wilson turned into a job dealing with constituent problems in the senators san francisco office which mr wickers did while finishing his last two years of school after graduation in he was hired to do political work for california senate republicans eventually he opened his own shop until now mr wickerss highest profile clients have been candidates for governor and u s senate he made ads for norm colemans senate win in minnesota and is working on his re election campaign next year he also worked for sen jim jeffords of vermont in and before he left the republican party mr wickers says hes closer to mr huckabee politically than he was to mr jeffords who was on the liberal end of the party one of the keys to the huckabee campaign he says is the small inner circle decisions about tv ads are made by a tiny group mr wickers mr huckabee and chip saltsman the campaign manager who had planned to sit this race out after his longtime boss former sen bill frist decided against a presidential run he changed his mind after mr huckabee persuaded him to come to arkansas for a day of duck hunting by days end he says he was sold mr dresner mr wickerss partner and ed rollins the newly installed national campaign chairman also have input "when things are done by committee you tend to compromise " said mr wickers he suggested that a big committee would never have agreed to put "christian leader" across the screen "most candidates are risk averse and are comforted by more formulaic advertising " mr wickers said "mike lets you go to the edge and pull back if need be others dont allow you to get anywhere near it " mr huckabees first ad was a parody spot featuring the candidate and action star chuck norris it got scarce tv air time but has been viewed more than million times on youtube his christmas ad generated even more attention in it mr huckabee declared that the christmas season should be about celebrating the "birth of christ " then intentionally or not the camera pans to a bookcase whose shelves appear in the shape of a cross mr wickers denies that was intentional either way the cross controversy was debated and digested on tv news shows repeatedly assuring that the huckabee ad was seen many more times than the campaign could ever have afforded if it were paying for the exposure mr wickers traveled with mr huckabee through eastern iowa this month collecting footage for future spots quietly jotting down moments that might make for good ad material he settled on a speech delivered early one morning in manchester "our founding fathers believed that your worth was something that was unique because it was given to you by god and they knew that these inalienable rights that we have came from that creator " mr huckabee says in the spot released at the end of last week it was exactly the sort of passionate moment mr wickers was looking for mr huckabee was in the zone "thematically it taps into exactly what im looking for "
