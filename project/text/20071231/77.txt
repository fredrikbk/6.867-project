why a market driven vaccine plan faces big obstacles nearly million children die every year from diseases for which vaccine development or distribution is faltering drug makers have shown little interest in vaccines that could stem this tide of childhood deaths because they arent profitable now a handful of western nations and international bodies is moving ahead with a market based experiment aimed at tackling two big problems the lack of research on vaccines needed primarily by poor countries only of disease related drug research focuses on maladies that affect of the worlds population and the long distribution time hepatitis b vaccine was developed in but two decades passed before it was introduced in the worlds poorest nations the new approach called the advance market commitment works like this donors commit to buying yet to be developed vaccines in bulk for poor nations if drug makers are able to deliver a product that meets specifications and a price can be settled on in advance the idea is that everyone involved wins drug companies get an incentive to innovate while donors avoid bankrolling dead end research supporters of the plan range from bill gates to pope benedict xvi and include public health officials nongovernmental organizations wealthy nations and some drug makers backers say the beauty of the idea is that it lets the market not governments determine which vaccine will be produced and which company will produce it "if the government were to subsidize research and development ultimately it would be bureaucrats choosing the right avenue to research selecting the right lab the right institution " says carlo monticelli an economist in the italian finance ministry which has been a top financial backer of the initiative advance market commitments are still untested in february donors agreed to the first one for a vaccine for pneumococcal disease which kills children annually in developing countries the gates foundation the united kingdom italy canada norway and russia have committed &# billion for the project backers hope to complete the legal framework by april and to deliver a vaccine to participating countries by but while such commitments are more promising than some alternatives trying to bully drug makers into cooperating with global aid agendas for example or paying them millions of dollars to chase long shot solutions the theory behind them has some serious holes in it for one thing drug companies may not be willing to bet their development budgets on these commitments before a deal can be reached drug makers donors and recipient countries have to agree on a price and specifications for the vaccine "pharmaceutical companies will always be concerned about how reliable those advance market commitments really are whether the plug could be pulled out at the th hour " says peter j hotez a tropical disease specialist at george washington university moreover though advance market commitments were first conceived as a way to spur research and development of vaccines still at an early stage those for hiv tuberculosis and malaria for example which remain years or even decades away from completion they may not be well suited for that science not money presents the biggest hurdles for those diseases says adel mahmoud the former head of vaccines at merck that suggests advance commitments may be better suited to vaccines in the late stages of development where funding is the biggest obstacle at least two companies glaxosmithkline plc and wyeth have late stage vaccines in development that could help control pneumococcal disease in the developing world wyeths existing pneumococcal vaccine prevnar isnt effective against strains of the disease found there the goal of the project is twofold spur final completion of the vaccines and offer financial insurance to drug makers that a market exists for them skeptics contend that the pilot project wont prove that advance market commitments can deliver big scientific breakthroughs because the initiative is targeting a mostly developed vaccine such commitments aim for low hanging fruit they say rather than delivering true scientific innovation oxford economist andrew farlow argues that the opportunity costs of an advance market commitment are too high even if such arrangements save some lives he says they will peel away money and energy that could instead go to less costly treatments for people already afflicted "you may get your success story but its what youll lose in the process that you might have had " he and others say that more people would be helped by paying for things like measles immunizations improved water quality and sanitation or mosquito nets in malarial regions and while the "pull" funding of the commitments isnt meant to replace research grants and other "push" funding some politicians have hailed commitments as a silver bullet that has critics worrying that other policy approaches could be shortchanged another test can advance market commitments encourage competition among drug makers by spurring more than one firm to develop a vaccine the power of the commitments to draw in vaccine makers from developing countries could be crucial given that those companies often best understand how to price and distribute vaccines in those markets these questions dont mean the experiment is without merit if it works it could produce huge societal and economic benefits the world health organization estimates that malaria for example accounts for as much as of public health spending and of outpatient visits in the hardest hit countries and a study by harvard university economists suggests that malaria slows economic growth in the badly hit countries by as much as a year those countries that reduced their disease burden by boosted growth by annually at the heart of an advanced market commitment says michael kremer the harvard economist who came up with the idea in the s is an effort to make markets work for the worlds poor the shortcomings though are a reminder that multiple approaches and some creative thinking will be needed to overcome the worlds most daunting health problems
