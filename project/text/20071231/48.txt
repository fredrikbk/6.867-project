those battles working with a husband and wife team of washington lobbyists it handed out more than &# million in political donations and played a big role in persuading legislators in new jersey and georgia to relax tough new laws those victories in turn helped blunt efforts by other states to crack down on reckless lending critics of the industry contend home loans made by ameriquest and other subprime lenders are defaulting now in large numbers roiling global credit markets and sparking debate about whether regulators and lawmakers should have anticipated the mess and taken action a close look at ameriquests lobbying and political donations shows how the subprime industry maneuvered to defeat legislation that might have contained some of the damage executives at ameriquest based in orange calif acknowledge that the company lobbied heavily against state lending restrictions but say that other subprime lenders did so as well in fact a host of subprime lenders and banking trade groups including citigroup inc wells fargo &amp co countrywide financial corp and the mortgage bankers association spent heavily on lobbying and political giving ameriquest a unit of acc capital

state campaign finance records internal revenue service filings and the national institute on money in state politics show that from through ameriquest its executives and their spouses and business associates donated at least &# million to state and federal political groups in comparison over the same time period countrywide financial another large subprime lender gave about &# million in campaign gifts and spent an additional &# million lobbying in washington records indicate some of the giving by ameriquest executives and associates was high profile president bush received more than

appointed mr arnall ambassador to the netherlands and his wife took over as chairman of ameriquests parent company california gov arnold schwarzeneggers campaigns received at least &# million along with stacks of tickets to a rolling stones concert that were used to lure big donors a spokesman for gov schwarzenegger said his decisions are not influenced by campaign contributions mr arnall declined to comment the white house said mr arnall was nominated because of his qualifications much of ameriquests efforts took place below the national radar at the state level state legislatures wanted to crack down on so called predatory lending which refers to the use of deceptive or unfair practices in the sale of high interest loans often to low income borrowers who cant afford them in new jersey for example lawmakers passed a strong predatory lending law in that made it difficult for ameriquest to continue doing business there washington lobbyist wright andrews and his wife lisa coordinated much of the industrys lobbying mr andrewss firm butera &amp andrews collected at least &# million in fees from the subprime industry from through congressional lobbying reports indicate mr andrews didnt represent ameriquest directly he ran three different subprime industry trade groups the national home equity mortgage association of which ameriquest was a member the coalition for fair and affordable lending which spent &# million lobbying against state laws before it dissolved earlier this year according to federal filings and the responsible mortgage lending coalition in lisa andrews was appointed senior vice president for government affairs at ameriquest her public relations firm washington communications group inc claims credit on its web site for coordinating the industrys victory in new jersey as well as its overall strategy at the state level ms andrews left ameriquest in and returned to her firm ameriquest was founded by mr arnall in as long beach savings &amp loan he later shed all of the thrifts operations except its retail mortgage unit which he renamed ameriquest during the refinancing boom of the s ameriquest became a player in the business of lending to low income homeowners the company persuaded many homeowners to take cash out of their houses by refinancing them for larger amounts than their existing mortgages many of the new loans carried relatively high interest rates last year acc capital its parent company agreed to pay &# million to settle regulators claims that it charged excessively high mortgage rates and didnt adequately disclose loan risks some of the state attorneys general who signed the settlement including greg abbott of texas received campaign donations from the firm utahs attorney general mark shurtleff received a &# contribution and rolling stones tickets a spokesman for mr shurtleff says the attorney general was not directly involved in negotiating the settlement a spokesman for mr abbott notes that the settlement was also negotiated and approved by other state attorneys general ameriquest also handed out rolling stones tickets to state legislators in georgia maryland nevada oregon utah washington and california according to ethics records and local news accounts federal lawmakers didnt pose much of a threat to the subprime industry in recent years members of congress received at least &# in donations from ameriquest and large sums from other big subprime lenders federal election commission records indicate they debated new oversight of the industry but took no action the states were a different matter "what seemed to be developing in the states was that there was going to be a wave of legislation " mr andrews the lobbyist said in an interview in georgia passed the fair lending act among other things it required lenders to be able to prove that a refinancing of any home loan less than five years old would provide a "tangible net benefit" to the borrower ameriquest began lobbying the state legislature to remove that provision arguing the standard was too vague other lenders also complained about the law as did fannie mae the giant buyer of mortgages "ameriquest was very very engaged " recalls georgia state sen vincent fort who authored the law mr fort says that adam bass a lawyer for ameriquest lobbied him directly the state senator says he accused mr bass of victimizing poor minorities which angered mr bass a spokesman for ameriquest speaking on mr basss behalf says the meeting "was a very candid conversation about complex policy issues " mr andrews the industry lobbyist had roots in georgia he had attended college and law school there and in the s had worked for sam nunn then a u s senator from georgia mr andrews got involved directly on the subprime matter lobbying in his capacity as executive director of the responsible mortgage lending coalition one of the subprime mortgage trade groups he ran out of his washington office "i wouldnt say it was a huge effort " he says "we were just part of the overall picture " ameriquest began contributing to georgia politicians in december it donated &# to lt gov mark taylor after he emerged as an influential figure in the debate according to georgia state ethics commission records it followed up with another &# in september mr taylor says he remembers ameriquest as one of the subprime companies that was lobbying but doesnt recall meeting anyone from the company or getting the contributions in october ameriquest announced it would stop doing business in the state until the law changed shortly thereafter standard &amp poors corp announced it would no longer assign credit ratings to many mortgage securities containing subprime loans from georgia the ratings agency said that under the new law such loans if found to be in violation of the law might carry legal risk potentially tainting the securities without credit ratings such securities are virtually unmarketable the change raised the possibility that subprime lenders would simply stop making loans in georgia the subprime industry mounted a campaign against the fair lending act within months the georgia senate voted in favor of a new law that eliminated for nearly all loans the tangible net benefit requirement opposed by the industry the state house passed the law problems were also developing for the industry in new jersey the state assembly there passed a similar law against predatory lending the home ownership security act it too contained a tangible net benefit rule but it didnt provide much guidance on how the standard would be applied "the new jersey law makes it impossible for anyone to be in compliance " mr bass the ameriquest lawyer complained at an industry conference in october ameriquest and mr andrewss lobbying firm contributed &# to five new jersey state senators state campaign reports indicate the american financial services association a subprime industry group that included ameriquest predicted the law would cause lenders to abandon the state nevertheless in the spring of the bill passed the state senate and was signed into law at that point opponents of the new law got some help just as it had done in georgia standard &amp poors said it wouldnt rate some securities containing loans from the state in addition federal banking regulators issued a series of regulatory orders banning states from applying state consumer protection rules to federally chartered banks and thrifts part of a turf battle between federal and state regulators that put pressure on states to soften predatory lending rules so federally chartered banks didnt have an advantage over state chartered ones the subprime industry set to work trying to roll back the new jersey law the national home equity mortgage association one of the subprime groups run by mr andrews released a survey predicting that the law would reduce mortgages in new jersey by &# billion ameriquest and mr andrewss lobbying firm began handing out campaign contributions among the recipients were john adler and gerald cardinale two state senators who had voted for the new law in october mr cardinale a republican received a &# donation from ameriquest according to state election records in november mr adler a democrat received &# from the lobbying firm the records indicate in early december the two senators introduced a bill to make changes sought by the industry "i dont remember ever being lobbied by ameriquest " says mr cardinale "i do recall that we were trying to make it easier for folks to be able to access funds and in general i feel it is a good thing for us to remove barriers to people being able to buy homes " he says he doesnt remember receiving any contributions from ameriquest "you guys think we know all of our contributors but thats usually on a staff level i dont frankly know who ameriquest is " mr adler says he doesnt recall meeting anyone from mr andrewss lobbying firm that december neil cohen a state assemblyman who had voted for the new law received a &# donation from the lobbying firm state records show the assemblys financial institutions committee which was headed by mr cohen offered its own legislation to soften the lending law mr cohen couldnt be reached for comment in as debate over the predatory lending law dragged on ameriquest and mr andrewss lobbying firm together donated an additional &# to mr cohen &# to mr cardinale and &# to mr adler according to state records ameriquest gave &# to the democratic party in the assembly &# to democrats in the senate and &# to senate republicans the records indicate mr andrewss wife lisa then head of government affairs at ameriquest was also focused on new jersey on the web site of her washington public relations firm she says that she "built a coalition of mortgage brokers mortgage bankers appraisers title companies and others involved in home mortgage lending to create a grass roots lobbying campaign that produced emails and faxes to state policymakers in a six week time frame " in june new jerseys assembly and senate unanimously passed bills that rolled back parts of the earlier law including the tangible net benefit rule mr bass the ameriquest lawyer announced that the company would "be offering a full range of loans in new jersey " thousands of new jersey homeowners subsequently refinanced existing mortgages or took out new loans with ameriquest before the subprime market tanked many of those loans are now in foreclosure after the victories in new jersey and georgia the subprime industry and its lobbyists used similar tactics to fend off unfavorable laws in other states texas for example was debating new restrictions on home appraisers whose overly generous valuations contributed to subprime lending problems acc capital ameriquests parent company and its executives gave more than &# to texas politicians in including &# to gov rick perry according to state records no new appraisal restrictions were instituted a spokesman for gov perry says acc did not ask for the governor to take any action on behalf of the industry in the wake of the collapse of the subprime market mr andrewss subprime lobbying business has withered the three trade groups he ran are gone and most of his subprime clients have stopped lobbying "i certainly was not aware of the degree to which many in the industry clearly failed to follow proper underwriting standards the standards which they represented they were following to those of us who were lobbying " mr andrews says but he also faults the federal reserve for letting the industry get out of control "personally i think and have long felt the fed should have done more early on " he says "but i dont think anybody realized the level of problems that were going to come out in the last year or two if you had said to me the industry was going to melt down i would have said you were absolutely insane "
