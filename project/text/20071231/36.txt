growing fury at musharraf deepens crisis pakistans political crisis escalated as the party of assassinated former prime minister benazir bhutto said it would run in next weeks parliamentary elections and urged supporters to channel outrage over her death into opposition to president pervez musharrafs regime following its dynastic tradition the pakistan peoples party also filled the leadership void created by ms bhuttos death by naming as party co chairmen her husband asif ali zardari who faced corruption and murder charges and spent several years in jail and her year old son "my mother always said democracy is the best revenge " the son bilawal bhutto zardari said at an emotionally charged news conference in the familys ancestral village before the dec suicide attack on ms bhutto her secular relatively pro western party was seen as a potential ally of mr musharraf who recently was elected to another five year term as president and who has vowed to restore democracy to pakistan and to fight the spread of islamist extremism but the ppps new leadership indicated yesterday that the party seared by the tragedy has now become a formidable enemy to the embattled mr musharraf "cooperation with him is out of the question now " said taj haider a senior ppp official and former senator "what we are doing is accusing gen musharraf of murdering benazir bhutto " ms bhuttos husband mr zardari yesterday repeatedly referred to the pakistan muslim league q a party affiliated with mr musharraf that controlled the outgoing government as the "murderers league " he also demanded a united nations commission of inquiry into his wifes death that would be modeled after the u n investigation into the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri that commission had the power to interrogate senior government officials in lebanon and syria the pakistani government has angrily rejected such calls for an international inquiry its interior ministry spokesman said that foreign investigators wouldnt understand the pakistani mentality and arent needed in solving a "common criminal case " the government says ms bhutto was killed by an al qaeda linked group led by baitullah mehsud a tribal leader from the waziristan region on the afghan frontier through a spokesman mr mehsud denied any involvement u s officials said they have held regular discussions with ms bhuttos aides as well as the pakistani government on providing assistance to the investigation into the attack the u s stands ready these officials said to allow the federal bureau of investigation to provide any forensic or investigative help requested by the pakistani government "given the suspicions involved having some sort of international component could help in quieting" pakistans political environment said tom casey a state department spokesman he added though that such a move could only move forward if there were "consensus" among the various pakistani political factions the democratic speaker of the house of representatives nancy pelosi said that future u s aid to pakistan could be conditional on islamabad supporting an international probe and that the white house must "ensure that the coming election is free and fair " as conspiracy theories abounded in pakistan even the exact manner of ms bhuttos death has become the subject of heated controversy between the ppp and the government the interior ministry maintains that a shockwave from thursdays blast knocked ms bhuttos head against a lever on her cars sunroof inflicting a fatal skull fracture but mr zardari and other ppp officials insisted that she was killed by the assassins bullets before the explosion as she left a campaign rally in rawalpindi a city near the pakistani capital of islamabad harnessing suspicions of government involvement has become the key campaign plank of the ppp ahead of the national election jan that is set to install a new prime minister to share power with mr musharraf the issue of islamist extremism has virtually disappeared from the public debate meanwhile the prospect that a massive sympathy vote would give the ppp a landslide election victory has caused an abrupt about turn in other pakistani parties positions on the election a centerpiece of mr musharrafs plan for transition to civilian democracy after eight years of military rule the party of former prime minister nawaz sharif which just two days ago declared it would boycott the election indicated yesterday that it will take part in the vote if ppp also participates in contrast mr musharrafs allies until now the most vocal backers of the jan election have started to call for a delay tariq azim information secretary of the pakistan muslim league q told reporters that his party has already suspended campaigning and that he expects the central electoral commission to postpone the vote by "up to three or four months " the commission which has said that voter rolls in many areas were destroyed amid looting in the days after ms bhuttos death is scheduled to meet on the issue today ppp officials yesterday cautioned against any moves to prevent the jan vote from occurring on schedule "if they postpone it once then they can keep postponing again and again " said mr haider the former senator should the government embark on this path he added the ppp will respond "on the streets " with massive unrest even some supporters of mr musharraf agreed saying that a national vote could help defuse tensions and end the continuing violence "preparations are made everything is ready " said muhammad intikhab khan a senior official in the pakistan muslim league q and a candidate for provincial legislature in the northwest frontier province "everything will cool down afterward we shouldnt give suicide bombers a victory " many candidates have pumped personal fortunes into plastering their faces on billboards and leaflets around the country and few have the desire to bear those expenses once again if the election is postponed while pakistans military has repeatedly intervened in pakistani politics in the past including the coup that brought mr musharraf to power it has shown no signs of flexing its muscles as the current political drama has unfolded ms bhuttos only son the new ppp chairman is too young to run in the election himself under pakistani law a candidate must be at least years of age he is likely to be little more than figurehead leader for the foreseeable future a first year student at oxford university his mothers alma mater he said that he intends to remain in britain and complete his studies "when i return i promise to lead the party as my mother wanted me to do " he said in reply to a reporters question at yesterdays news conference visibly irritated mr zardari interrupted asking journalists to abstain from questioning bilawal "he may be the chairman but he is my son and he is at a tender age " mr zardari said he wont be running in the elections himself and wont be a candidate for prime minister that job he said is likely to be occupied in the case of a ppp victory by amin fahim the partys most senior official in pakistan before ms bhuttos return from self imposed exile in october like the bhuttos mr fahim hails from an aristocratic landholding family in pakistans southern sindh province he is known for writing poetry inspired by the mystical sufi current of islam while serving as ppp faction leader in the outgoing parliament he forged consensus with mr musharraf on some key legislative initiatives such as the womens rights protection bill real authority over the party and over any ppp dominated government however is expected to lie with mr zardari known as "mr percent" for allegedly demanding kickbacks on public contracts while ms bhutto served as prime minister in the s and s mr zardari is a divisive figure in pakistan and has little of his wifes broad popular support or charisma mr zardari has always maintained his innocence and ms bhutto herself in an interview last month rejected accusations against her husband of illicit business dealings she has said that those who didnt want to side with extremists in trying to tarnish her image used the corruption card instead but some former officials in ms bhuttos government say her husband was to an uncommon degree involved in detailed business decisions while holding political office while serving as a cabinet minister for his wife he had a diverse portfolio that included appointing heads of utilities and negotiating purchases of commercial aircraft these officials say the charges against him included masterminding the murder of ms bhuttos brother and tying a bomb to a pakistani businessmans leg as part of an extortion scheme he was never convicted of these charges and has always maintained they were politically motivated in choosing its new leadership the ppp had to fall back on ms bhuttos closest relatives says political analyst abdul khalique junejo because she had run the party throughout the years as a family fiefdom "the party has no institutions it was a one woman show " he said as for mr zardari he added "before marrying her he had no political standing he is known just as her husband " before ms bhuttos own ascent to party leadership the ppp was led by her father former prime minister zulfiqar ali bhutto after being removed from office he was hanged by the countrys military rulers in in the city of rawalpindi the same place where ms bhutto died last week the hallowed family name is such a key electoral asset that ms bhuttos son previously known just as bilawal zardari added "bhutto" to his surname as he assumed the partys chairmanship yesterday raised mostly in dubai and britain bilawal bhutto zardari spoke only in english at yesterdays news conference unlike his father who dominated the proceedings and used passionate urdu throughout "if you think of the ppp as a political party it would be a surprise " said frank anderson who served as the u s central intelligence agencys near east division chief in "but if you think of it as a feudal manor the huge bhutto family business then yeah the son is the next in line if they did anything else it would smack of democracy " indeed such a dynastic succession is common among political parties on the indian subcontinent in bangladesh a country that seceded from pakistan in the two main opposition chiefs are respectively the daughter and the widow of the countrys two main independence leaders in india when indian national congress leader and prime minister indira gandhi was gunned down in her position was assumed by her son rajiv ms gandhi herself was the daughter of indias first prime minister after her son was assassinated in the partys leadership eventually passed to his italian born wife sonia such precedents were very much on the mind of mourning ppp activists in the karachi suburb of sachalgoth as they gathered cross legged on a rug around a tv set to watch the latest developments yesterday "so what that bilawal is so young rajiv gandhi was also politically inexperienced when his mother was killed " said the suburbs ppp leader taj muhammad wasan "he will be surrounded by some very senior advisers " zahid hussain in islamabad and siobhan gorman in washington contributed to this
