politics &amp economics stresses from iraqi fathers disappearance strike family hard new york from my cousins description of the badly burned body in the baghdad morgue it sounded like it was father a thin bald man in his s but the face had a notable scar unlike my father burns likely from a bomb obscured the rest "i doubt that the body" is your fathers my cousin told me "but at the same time i would be lying to say im certain it isnt his even if you were here you wouldnt be able to tell anything its charred " my father went missing after he left for work one day last december his disappearance and its immediate aftermath were the subject of a front page wall street journal article early this year i wasnt there in baghdad i couldnt be there i am an iraqi citizen caught between two worlds im a guest in the u s where i have lived since studying and working for this newspaper but i have no u s travel documents and my iraqi passport has been invalidated more unsettling more disruptive than the possibility of my fathers death has been the uncertainty about his fate i mourn close friends who have been killed in baghdads violence but sometimes i envy their families for being able to bury their loved ones my experience the distance and uncertainty that corrupt my ability to grieve isnt unique many people have fled baghdad and left family behind to survive in a war zone in which people go missing and casualties are often unidentifiable over the past year my relatives in baghdad have continued to look for my father without me his oldest son i have grown more distant from them and strains between us have deepened the discovery of a corpse that might be him set off a new wave of panic and recriminations who would go to identify the body my mother and sister never stray far from the house my brother couldnt seem to face the possibility that abuna was gone for good i had foreseen this situation and tried to prevent it i had warned my friends not to approach my family members with rumors or incomplete information in august a friend received a call from a hospital morgue asking him to come examine a body that potentially matched my fathers description my friend called me in new york but when he failed to reach me immediately he took the news to my family none of them could dare or bear to accompany him to the morgue and they sent him to my cousin my fathers absence has taken a heavy toll without his income my mother two sisters and younger brother have had to focus on survival but as hope of finding him has faded so has their strength to cope with the challenges of life in baghdad our old house where my parents were married is falling apart a wall in the living room collapsed in february forcing my sisters and mother to share a bedroom that room has begun to crumble after a nearby market was hit by suicide bombings in april my brother slept on the roof while the weather was warm but now that its cold he has squeezed back inside my brother took on a job as a carpenter soon after my father disappeared making chairs and tables in a workshop but the &# a week he earns isnt enough two months ago to get money for food and medicine my mom sold our old television an old fridge and a bookshelf the only time my mother leaves the house these days is to visit friends a few blocks away to ask them if i have called our phone at home hasnt been working i sent my family money in may but it led to more strains i wanted them to use it to rebuild the house but they said they needed it for buying food gas and clothes i feared they were too hopeless to make repairs or otherwise invest in the future "if you think building the wall would change things for us youre really dreaming " my brother told me "dont keep pushing for things while sitting there it wont make any difference " my older sister who is years old grew depressed after my father went missing she began taking antidepressants and seemed to improve in the spring it was a big relief to talk to her in may and find her able to say a few sentences and recognize my voice but two weeks later she began refusing the medication and retreated into a deep depression i havent spoken to her since then my younger sister who is has been tending to my older sister making sure shes fed and washed she occasionally runs out of patience "sometimes she wakes up in the middle of the night and keeps talking so loudly to herself that i cant even sleep " she told me in the background my older sister was shouting my mother too has struggled with depression and for a time stopped taking her epilepsy medicine she began to suffer from recurrent fits and hallucinations until my sister and some neighbors were able to get her back on her medication its painful for me to be away from them especially because i am the oldest son and so believe that i should be taking my fathers place caring for them my mother has encouraged me to stay in new york and i know that if i were to visit home it is unlikely that i would be able to return to the u s but my brother blames me for not being with the family helping with the search and providing financial and psychological support sometimes he turns off his cellphone the only working phone in my familys possession to avoid talking to me and to deprive me of the chance to talk to my mother and sister he says he cant afford to use it but sometimes he answers the phone and hangs up when he hears my voice i have tried unsuccessfully to get my family out of iraq every step forward seems to be met by an equally large setback iraqs decision to issue electronic passports that meet international standards resulted in huge lines and big delays my family eventually got the documents they needed just as jordan and syria the countries i was hoping to send them to changed their immigration rules they now only admit professionals and businessmen i have been working to get my documents in order so that i could go meet them in syria jordan or even iraq if conditions improve and help them find a place my old iraqi passport has been invalidated by western countries and most arab countries so i cant use it to travel the iraqi embassy in washington has been unable to issue a new internationally recognized passport im also waiting to get a temporary u s travel document to be able leave the u s and come back without trouble the bad news from home has gone beyond my family in june i called a close high school friend in baghdad to check on him and his family after reading about a suicide bombing that hit a shiite mosque close to where he lived i was glad to hear that he and his family were safe but he told me that rabiya a close kurdish shiite friend we had known since middle school was killed in the bombing rabiya was attending prayers at the mosque when the bomber struck at the morgue my cousin and the high school friend stood before the charred corpse and puzzled over whether this man was my father they made several trips to make the identification and after each trip we would talk by phone we tried to locate my fathers dentist to obtain some of his dental records to help make the identification but the dentist had moved and hadnt left a new address in the end they were simply unable to say for certain whether it was my dad they decided to go with the coroners conclusion that because my father didnt have a scar on his face its unlikely that it was him we still dont know for sure
