 noble patriots vs a cowardly congress after plus years it is still apparent that those in congress have not learned the lessons of the past thomas fleming "washingtons gift " op ed dec rightfully shows the courage of individual americans in this case george washington in the background he shows the weakness of a congress not willing to compensate those who put their lives on the line for their country not so much different from today i only hope americans reach out to our returning soldiers and give them the assistance they need to seek the american dream they have fought to preserve for us wm forsthoefel kettering ohio mr flemings christmas eve article "washingtons gift" was at the same time educational insightful and inspirational although "somewhere" in the back of my mind i knew "something" about "some people" wanting george washington to be king but he turned it down i had no inkling of the extent to which our fledgling country had poised itself on the precipice of tyranny only weeks after having won its freedom at a very dear price mr flemings story helped assuage my fears about our countrys current state of affairs my having learned that even in "not a few congressmen and their allies in the press had waged a vitriolic smear campaign against the soldiers " perhaps during this election cycle we the voters will voice our own "hoots of derision and contempt for congress" over its cowardly acts of self interest deborah cowles ashland va mr fleming accurately describes how george washingtons heroic refusal of power in december laid the groundwork for a future republic rather than a monarchy in doing so washington was pointedly following the example of lucius quinctius cincinnatus a hero of the early roman republic who having been appointed dictator circa bc by the senate for a military emergency quickly defeated the enemy then resigned his imperium power and returned to his small farm all of his life washington emulated cincinnatus and when given the chance to act similarly did so america has deep judeo christian roots so too are we blessed with the classical heritage of the roman republic which our founders well knew and as our senate sits in a modern capitol lets not forget those heroes of an earlier age who helped make us what we are today lets not forget too that the liberty dearly won by those republican romans was ultimately lost when its citizens preferred luxury and ease to frugality and service robert d carl iii marietta ga this was truly a moving and magnanimous piece this type of character leadership and sacrifice for the good of the many is extremely rare we see today mostly mifflins thomas mifflin president of the senate was "one of the generals who attempted to humiliate washington into resigning during the grim winter at valley forge" in our congress and our military leadership although the foot soldiers still pursue the honorable cause and sacrifice for our country rolf goehler schaumburg ill mr flemings eloquent account of george washingtons immortal action brought tears to my eyes as that story unfailingly does when i recall or read it washingtons great act was to stand on principle rather than emotion or pragmatism the short term but not morally principled resolution of an issue where are george washington thomas jefferson and thomas paine when you need them david elmore roswell ga
