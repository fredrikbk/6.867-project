school rankings that matter the publication this year of u s news &amp world reports first ranking of high schools has parents in a twitter worrying that their property taxes are too high or too low or that public education has failed them entirely but leaving aside the merits and methodology of these particular rankings we might wonder whether rankings matter at all and more importantly if they should in fact there are some numbers that really matter getting them is the rub to understand this problem consider another set of rankings released about the same time as the high school rankings that didnt garner as much attention bar exam passage rates the school at which i teach new york law school jumped to fifth on the list of new york area law schools with an all time high passage rate of while benjamin n cardozo law school at yeshiva university leapfrogged to third behind only nyu and columbia cardozo however is ranked nd by u s news among all law schools fourth in new york while new york law school is ranked in the "third tier" of law schools along with albany hofstra pace and syracuse so which ranking matters on the one hand the u s news ranking would seem to be more comprehensive because bar passage rate is only one of many factors it considers on the other hand what good is a law degree if a graduate cant practice because he doesnt pass the licensing exam moreover if the bar exam measures a students fitness to practice law as the bar examiners claim a schools bar passage rate should be a pretty good indication of how the school is doing in turning out graduates who know how to practice law nevertheless according to a paper commissioned by the association of american law schools bar passage rate accounts for only of a schools overall rank in the u s news survey this doesnt seem right of course there are other things that matter to law school graduates like getting a job although the u s news rankings purport to measure a schools success at placing its graduates into gainful employment the rankings do not distinguish between success at placing students at high paying corporate law jobs versus low paying paralegal type jobs nor do they distinguish between jobs that graduates want and the jobs that graduates get students who assume that going to a more highly ranked school is more likely to get them a good job are essentially being misled by lazy reporting the u s news rankings are also heavily weighted toward reputation which would seem to have some real world significance but again "reputation" is misleading and often irrelevant beyond the top or so law schools law firms care less about the ranking of a school when making hiring decision and more about the ranking of the students at the schools put a different way there are really two kinds of law schools those at which students decide where they want to interview and those where firms decide the large majority of law schools belong to the latter group hiring partners admit that they use gpa or other bright line criteria like law review membership to interview at tier and schools while taking resumes from nearly everyone at tier schools in short the difference between the th ranked law school and the th law school is of little significance in determining which students are more likely to get a good job at both schools unless a student is in the top or of his class he has little chance of getting a high paying job directly upon graduation students might be better served by going to a lower ranked law school and doing better rather than going to middling law school and not doing as well students and parents are led astray by u s news because in putting a simple number on something that is incredibly complex they are missing the nuances that are likely to be more important but schools themselves high schools and law schools are partly to blame because they resist fully disclosing important information just as law schools would better serve their constituencies by releasing accurate information about numbers that matter bar results jobs and average salaries high schools should make more of an effort to fully disclose test scores college admissions class sizes and other important data more information may put some schools under a harsh light but it will help students and parents decide whether those high taxes and tuition rates are worth it the alternative is letting u s news decide for us mr stracher is publisher of the new york law school law review and author of "dinner with dad how i found my way back to the family table" random house
