follow these instructions and you will go mad would you please pass my compliments on to ned crabb on his wonderfully funny and satirical look at demented instruction writers "twas the day after christmas " leisure &amp arts dec i think manual writers in general have been lobotomized of all common sense and decency for the ultimate customers who have to suffer through their vocabular cesspools of rhetoric it wasnt until the end of the second paragraph that i realized what he was up to and by that time mr crabb had me "hook line and sinker" into his wonderful world satirizing what the real world is like my theory has always been that the people who write the various instruction manuals only do so to show off to their fellow manual writers it seems that "the customer be damned" is the mantra of corporate america today or possibly the top dogs dont realize the havoc they are unleashing on us when shopping i now look at the instruction manual before buying if i cant figure it out within a minute or two i buy something else why go through all that grief when there are simpler things in life bill chabot ontonagon mich
