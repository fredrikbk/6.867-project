china focus may stall bushs trade plans washington president bush starts his last year in office determined to press what is left of his trade agenda including a pact with colombia but the most important item on the list may be blocking legislation that would crack down on trade with china at the dawn of an election year trade skepticism is on the rise in the u s roiling the fights for control of the white house and congress it also clouds much of what mr bush wants to do over the next months much of the anxiety is focused on the competition posed by china which is the u s s second largest trading partner after canada democrats in the house of representatives already are girding for action on legislation to address concerns over chinese counterfeiting product safety and currency policy among other things the administration is pressing china to address those issues across a number of fronts including direct negotiations and through litigation at the world trade organization but its approach will face a political test on capitol hill "youre entering a difficult period here " said karan bhatia until recently a top trade negotiator for mr bush with a focus on asia he said political pressure is understandable but warned legislation is the "least well suited" of the many options for dealing with china "managing that china relationship and keeping it on the rails is going to be a challenge and an important endeavor for the administration over the next months " said mr bhatia the looming china debate could overshadow mr bushs attempts to secure new market opening trade deals he is lobbying the democratic led congress to approve three agreements signed with panama colombia and south korea all face opposition the panama deal has been on ice since a panamanian lawmaker accused in the u s of killing an american soldier in was tapped to lead that nations legislature questions dog the south korea pact about whether it will fully open the korean market to beef and autos from the u s colombia is fighting to overcome doubts among u s lawmakers spurred by violence against labor organizers there congressional approval of any one of pending agreements might help provide momentum for the presidents trade expansion drive similar hopes were voiced after lawmakers approved a free trade deal with peru this past fall but the three pending deals still languish political strategists suggest that one way to proceed would be a bargain under which democratic leaders allow votes on the three pending deals in return for white house support for expanding federal aid for workers who lose their jobs because of foreign competition that would allow both sides to claim political victory but absent any immediate effort at compromise the pending deals will stand on their own merits with colombia appearing most likely to move first some administration allies are pressing for action early in to minimize election year politics "as the campaign intensifies there will be more tough rhetoric on trade " said william rhodes citigroup inc s senior vice chairman and chairman of the council of the americas the business group that promotes trade and democracy in the western hemisphere "its not going to be easy because lets face it next year is an electoral year " mr bush still is pushing to close out the doha round of global trade talks the white house would like to conclude a deal before mr bush leaves office in january hoping to burnish his legacy but those talks launched in after the sept terrorist attacks were beset with problems from the beginning led by the wto the discussions are mired in disputes over cutting farm supports and lowering barriers to trade in manufactured goods in the case of china the bush administration is pursuing engagement over conflict preferring to address u s complaints through dialogue and negotiations where dialogue hasnt made rapid progress the administration has launched formal complaints at the wto and just recently settled a case in which beijing agreed to revoke government export subsidies the u s complained were unfair additional complaints pending at the wto allege china isnt protecting intellectual property from the u s doesnt allow fair trade in auto parts and denies access to chinese markets for a range of u s goods the administration offers the wto complaints as evidence of the maturing u s sino relationship u s trade representative susan schwab said the cases are "a form of engagement " as she put it in a recent speech that helps "prevent trade wars rather than fuel them " she said it is likely that lawmakers "will grapple" with china in the coming year but she urged them to resist intervening through legislation new laws "are crude tools for a complex task " she said adding that action on anti china bills in congress would add friction to u s sino relations and might end up hurting "the american workers farmers and entrepreneurs they purport to help " administration critics dont have to look far to see reasons for legislation the u s trade deficit with china is on pace to exceed &# billion in that would eclipse the previous record of &# billion set in moreover recent talks between the u s and china in beijing produced only modest accomplishments and little or no progress on fundamental issues chief among them complaints about currency critics contend china keeps its currency artificially low creating imbalances that give chinese exporters an unfair advantage in the global marketplace beijing has allowed its currency to strengthen at a faster pace in recent weeks though there is little indication this has satisfied u s critics of its currency policy rep sander levin d mich an important voice on trade policy in the house said the recent negotiations showed the administration is "more talk than action " rep levin chairman of the ways and means trade subcommittee said the talks middling outcome has "increased the notion on the hill that we really need to take a serious look at legislation " members of the senate also are pushing to give the white house new tools to toughen policy toward china mr bhatia warned such actions could strengthen the hands of chinese nationalists who want to slow beijings drive to integrate into the global economy
