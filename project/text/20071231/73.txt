while you were sleeping in the senate was gaveled to order at a m the friday before the christmas weekend and shut down seconds later then on sunday the democrats convened another nanosession and again the day after christmas for nine seconds this affectation will continue through january at least congress is operating with abnormal efficiency whats the point the democrats scheduled these empty pro forma sessions where the senate is technically not adjourned to thwart president bushs power to make recess appointments supposedly his nominees are "controversial " but when majority leader harry reid pulled this stunt over thanksgiving we reported that it actually was spurred by two unobjectionable names for the council of economic advisers the real purpose is to show the democrats moveon org base that the party is "confronting" the white house mr reid now says he wants to prevent the recess installment of steven bradbury acting head of the justice departments office of legal counsel because of his views on allowing cia interrogation techniques that congress has refused to ban mr bradbury remains in committee limbo and has been denied an up or down vote more than nominations currently await senate action this is an abuse by the democrats of their advise and consent power they are trying to dictate executive branch policy and failing that to run out the clock on and prevent the federal government from staffing itself one flagrant example concerns three nominations to the seven member federal reserve board randall kroszner larry klane and elizabeth duke were nominated in may theyre stuck in a holding pattern around senator chris dodd the banking chairman held confirmation hearings in august only after republican members pressured him we hear the fed nominations are not priorities and going nowhere at least anytime soon of course mr dodd is very busy pursuing the democratic presidential nomination that he has no chance of winning mr dodds latest excuse is that hes unhappy with the rules the fed proposed to protect subprime mortgage borrowers from some lending practices if thats the standard why have seven fed governors at all why not make it four instead see related letter "letters to the editor sham senate sessions scoff at the constitution" wsj jan
