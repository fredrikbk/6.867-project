democratic voters fervor stirs republican worries as presidential hopefuls from both parties rally support across iowa ahead of thursdays caucuses democratic voters are showing greater fervor for the race than their republican counterparts a difference that could have repercussions throughout the campaign at its simplest there is a political energy gap democrats appear to be more fired up about their party nominating contest than are republicans democrats in iowa and new hampshire have been turning out at rallies in greater numbers than republicans and giving more money to candidates in iowa polls indicate democrats will be attending the thursday night caucuses in record numbers "there seems to be a little more juice on the democratic side " says republican pollster bill mcinturff "republicans have a lot of work to do to get to the intensity level democrats are at today " agrees terry nelson a republican strategist who previously headed the campaign of arizona sen john mccain thats critical because although the presidential nominating contest is just getting under way republicans are worried the democrats greater enthusiasm could allow them to sustain their wide national lead in overall fund raising and money will play a big role in the outcome of novembers general election some republicans also worry that they could end up having trouble rallying around their partys eventual nominee a problem faced in recent years by the often fractious democrats this time by contrast democratic voters nationally are telling pollsters they like their field of candidates better than republicans say they like theirs mr mcinturff compares this years democrats to the republicans in the last time the presidential race was contested in both parties "republican primary voters were very cranked up because bill clinton put their teeth on edge and they couldnt wait to elect a new president " he says while acknowledging that republicans seem to be lagging by several measures many party insiders say all the party needs to galvanize its voters is time and the right candidate "i just had someone tell me that if we can get mike huckabee back here we could get people " says bob vander plaats mr huckabees iowa chairman after an event in davenport that attracted a standing room only crowd of people mr mccain has also been drawing more enthusiastic republican crowds in recent days in both iowa and new hampshire democratic voters are showing more passion for the race in part due to frustration that their party has been out of the white house for eight years but their fervor also reflects their general approval of the partys three front runners sen hillary clinton sen barack obama and former sen john edwards who are locked in a tight battle in iowa new hampshire and elsewhere broadly agree on most important issues that suggests that their supporters would unite around the eventual nominee by contrast the republican field is deeply divided with candidates attacking each other over social issues tax policies and immigration asked if they could support a democratic candidate "with enthusiasm" in november as opposed to "with reservations " or depending on the opponent half of democratic voters say they could support mrs clinton enthusiastically according to the latest wall street journal nbc poll almost the same number said they could support mr obama enthusiastically and mr edwards among republicans the top rated candidate is former massachusetts gov mitt romney with of republican voters saying they could back him enthusiastically keenness for the other republican candidates trails off after that so far iowans who have donated &# or more to the presidential race have given democrats a total of more than &# compared with &# to republicans thats a sharp reversal from when iowa residents had given &# in &# or more donations to republican candidates and just &# to democrats the iowa figures mirror the big lead democratic presidential candidates have established in overall fund raising nationally democrats have so far raised &# million compared with &# million for republican candidates behind republicans uneasiness are voters like wes von schlotterback of des moines mr von schlotterback served twice in past elections as a county chairman for republican presidential candidate steve forbes but this time he says he plans to stay home the night of the caucuses for lack of any good choices he says he sees the same lack of enthusiasm among many of his republican friends "for the first time ever im thinking of voting for a democrat for obama " he says he describes the illinois senator as "genuine " democrat kathleen clark a year old retiree who supports sen clinton says she doesnt typically go to the caucuses but this year she will she also plans to bring a friend with her concern about rising medical costs is driving her to participate "we can barely make ends meet" because of rising prescription drug costs she says mr von schlotterback ticks off the flaws of the republican field mr romney sometimes talks like a "used car salesman " he says he likes former tennessee sen fred thompsons conservative politics but not his languid style "we have eight good ones and they dont have any good ones thats why the republicans arent excited " says democrat ruth anne petrak a des moines precinct captain for candidate bill richardson "theres tremendous energy around change and that change involves democrats " says mark penn mrs clintons strategist and pollster the republicans says mr penn suffer from "the very rare event when the president is universally disliked and leaving the party without a successor " in iowa that may mean more democrats showing up for the caucuses this week and turning out to vote in november an iowa state university poll says as many as democrats could attend the caucuses a jump from though caucus turnout can be affected by a variety of factors including the weather republican turnout is expected to be about the same as the last contested republican race at around though the poll suggests it could slip the intensity gap could narrow as voters nationally begin to focus more on the election and more states begin their primary voting "if it was october i would be worried " says mr nelson the republican strategist "in order to win we have to have a positive vision for the country there is plenty of time for that " iowa has turned out to be a much more competitive and important race for the democrats than for the republicans the three democratic front runners have poured huge amounts of resources into the state and remain locked in a three way dead heat democratic candidates have spent a total of days campaigning in iowa about more days than republican candidates democrats this fall had paid staffers in the state more than four times the paid republican staffers according to the des moines register on the republican side the contest has become a battle between mr romney and former arkansas gov huckabee with the other candidates shifting resources to states viewed as more favorable to them mr mccain to new hampshire and rudy giuliani to florida and to several states that vote feb if one of the republican candidates catches fire voter enthusiasm could surge republicans also say the nomination of mrs clinton deeply unpopular among republicans could energize republican voters "theres nothing like not liking your opponent for increasing your enthusiasm " says mr mcinturff the republican pollster but there are signs that an energy gap is turning up elsewhere as well when mr mccain recently made a campaign stop at clemson university in south carolina which holds its primary jan there was a "a mood of despair and despondency" among the crowd says david woodard a clemson political science professor who is also a republican strategist mr woodard says that when mr mccain visited clemson during the campaign "there was electricity like before a football game many students got off early from class the room was packed before he arrived he got wild applause " this time says mr woodard mr mccain appearing before a smaller crowd received polite applause when he walked in and no further applause until the end of his speech three weeks ago mr woodard attended a rally held by mr obama with talk show host oprah winfrey at the university of south carolinas football stadium it drew people "i dont think we have ever had an event that drew so many people " says mr woodard laura meckler monica langley and timothy
