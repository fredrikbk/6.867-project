fairtax ok whats fair and workable leo linbecks "fairtax facts" op ed dec was a readers digest version of the so called "fairtax" manifesto and i believe those who viewed his article without knowing the background detail available on the web site fairtax org might have been justifiably amazed by the breathtaking benefits purported to result from adopting this proposal revenue raising at the federal level will no longer be encumbered by politics the underground economy will "come clean " a fairtax on all purchases will eliminate the tax burden "embedded" in all purchases huh etc regrettably for its proponents the fairtax is a dog that wont hunt mr linbeck is correct that "vested interests" will work assiduously against such a proposal and their name is legion but the biggest show stopper will be the boomers when that voting generation comes to understand that shifting to the fairtax means that having been taxed on their income during their major income producing years they are now about to be taxed on their spending during their "golden" spending years they will kill any fairtax proposal quickly and certainly too bad as the current federal tax code is as bad as mr linbeck claims it to be but if the political will required to make as great a change as repealing the th amendment scrapping the irs and establishing the fairtax were present it should be a small matter to curtail the "loopholes gimmicks exemptions and deductions" in the current code that he decries george w schmidt newtown conn thank you so much for publishing "fairtax facts " i sincerely hope that you will continue a dialogue in your paper in which more facts about the fairtax are discussed and debated instead of the many preposterous accusations and misrepresentations that have been published since the end of august once the country becomes educated about the fairtax it will pass into law in about five minutes doug hartlove somerville n j have the fairtax supporters considered the impact this could have on future social security obligations mr linbeck states that the price of consumer goods may include as much as in hidden income and payroll taxes if this were true then the fairtax would actually collect very little additional tax from the underground economy illegal aliens and the million tourists that would seem to take some of the steam out of the "reason" for the tax currently most states compute their personal and corporate taxes using the federal tax returns as the starting point under the fairtax each of these states would now have to implement additional procedures to compute their taxes the fairtax would have the individual states collect the tax the states would have little if any incentive to perform audits which will be necessary for compliance the stark reality is that some merchants "cheat" by not paying all the sales tax they collect one can only imagine the amounts not turned over if the rate is at it appears that the wealthiest individuals will receive the greatest benefit unless they buy a new expensive home every year if they are saving on taxes who is paying the additional tax so this plan can be revenue neutral i firmly believe we need to provide some relief to businesses so they can be more competitive the easiest method would be to reduce the corporate income tax we also need relief on the complexities of the personal and corporate federal tax system edward kay hoschton ga
