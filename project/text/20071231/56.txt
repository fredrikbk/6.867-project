about &# million of value on the of the bank that mr flowers controls rather than cash out the year old mr flowers has doubled down he plans to inject capital into the bank while cutting costs and fine tuning shinseis business model his firm j c flowers &amp co in november said it would begin a two part transaction that would give it of the bank the first part a tender offer for as much as of shinseis shares is scheduled to end on jan that will be followed by a sale of new shares to mr flowers that will put billion yen of new capital into the bank friday shinsei shares closed at yen below the tender offer of yen a share in a recent interview mr flowers conceded that the regulatory environment has gone against a key part of the banks strategy but he says the bank is committed to consumer finance and that the new plan will return the bank to sustainable profit growth "shinsei has the financial resources and the skills to benefit" in this environment he said the stakes are especially high for mr flowers the success of the bank one of japans largest by revenue according to data tracker toyo keizai has given mr flowers a reputation as one of the shrewdest minds in the world of private equity in addition to shinsei his company has invested in hollands nib capital nv and germanys hsh nordbank ag he also has attempted to buy united kingdom based thrift northern rock

installed a new wall street style management team they got rid of dud loans that littered shinseis books and cut off bad borrowers in an aggressive manner that shocked japans genteel banking community the new management also branched out into new businesses like a highly regarded retail bank that provides shinsei with a source of cheap funding it also bought several consumer finance companies that business quickly became a key part of shinseis operations generating of the banks billion yen in revenue for the year ended march the move has since gone sour a few years ago consumer finance was a compelling proposition the businesses made lots of small loans to individuals at rates nearing shinsei wasnt the only bank interested in the area the countrys megabanks also bought consumer finance companies but they treated those operations as a side business while shinsei positioned it as one of its three main pillars for a while shinsei outperformed rival megabanks but in japans government concerned by the sometimes aggressive practices of consumer lenders passed laws slashing the maximum interest rates on consumer loans to and limiting the amount individuals can borrow the move forced shinsei to take write offs that pushed it to a loss of billion yen for the year ended in march compared with a billion yen profit a year earlier analysts say shinsei will have a harder time fixing the consumer finance business than it did cleaning up its balance sheet with its small size they argue shinseis consumer finance unit wont be able to make a meaningful contribution to the banks profit "under the new regulations it is difficult for small consumer finance companies to survive " says shinichi ina an analyst at credit suisse "theyre going to have to be much bigger " mr flowers says the consumer finance business can contribute if costs are managed more effectively for example he thinks that money used for marketing and advertising can be saved as more consumer finance companies consolidate and their products become commoditized while the environment for consumer finance is tougher companies affiliated with banks like shinseis aplus co subsidiary will benefit because they can lend what the bank receives in deposits he says in the meantime other consumer finance companies might find it difficult to access capital rahul gupta shinseis chief financial officer adds the consumer finance arm can also grow by expanding its role helping japanese merchants with their back office functions such as billing collecting and credit applications "it is a sales finance company as against a direct consumer finance company " mr gupta says "you work on principles of profitability not on volume " see related article "abreast of the market after s losses for japanese stocks
