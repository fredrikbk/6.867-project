rival mitt romney who has attacked mr huckabee by land and by air climbing back in response the former arkansas governor called mr romney dishonest and prepared to begin airing his first tv ad directly attacking him starting today the three way democratic race was nearly as tense illinois sen barack obama accused former sen john edwards of hypocrisy for railing against special interests and then allowing an independent labor funded group to run tv ads supporting his bid and mr obama and sen hillary clinton continued their feud over who is better prepared to handle foreign policy on the republican side a mason dixon poll in iowa found mr romney with and mr huckabee with other new surveys had mr romney on top or the race at a statistical tie and romney aides said they were more concerned about arizona sen john mccain in new hampshire than mr huckabee in iowa for the democrats the new polls all found the race among the top three contenders tight mr romney former governor of massachusetts has been hammering mr huckabee in a series of tv ads questioning his record on immigration crime and foreign policy over the weekend the huckabee campaign concluded that it had to answer with an aggressive tv ad of its own "we are going to sharpen our message very quickly and we are going to respond " said a senior huckabee adviser an ad to begin airing today will accuse mr romney of distorting mr huckabees record in order to hide his own record on issues including abortion and fee increases while he was governor "were gonna come after him on his record " the aggressive ad strategy carries risk in a state where voters say they dont like negative campaigning for days mr huckabee has been promising to run a positive campaign asked what he thought about a huckabee tv ad attack rob moran years old said "hed be at this point a little hypocritical to do that " still mr moran allowed that the romney tv ads had made an impression on him and said he came to hear mr huckabee speak saturday in indianola to see how he would respond until now mr huckabee has delivered his defense on the stump and in interviews including one yesterday on nbcs "meet the press " where mr huckabee called mr romneys campaign "very desperate and frankly dishonest " "if you arent being honest in obtaining a job can we trust you to be honest if you get the job " he said romney spokesman kevin madden replied "mike huckabees lashing out with personal attacks against gov romney that have no merit or substance is quite unfortunate campaigns should be about the issues " mr romney fighting a two pronged battle is running ads in iowa against mr huckabee and in new hampshire against sen mccain who has gained in polling there and is now a close second on sunday mr romney noted mr mccains many years of service in washington and said an outsider would be better able to enact change "i dont think you change washington from the inside " he told reporters mr huckabee yesterday also was forced to defend his own misstatement that pakistanis represent the majority of non latin american foreigners trying to enter the country illegally and he was quizzed on his immigration policy in he said that the u s economy "would collapse" without illegal immigrants but now proposes forcing all million of them to leave the country within days "i dont think it would collapse the american economy if people went back and did their process of becoming legal and all of them arent going to go back on the same day " he said yesterday on nbc the democratic race remained a dead heat as the top contenders continued to provoke one another by calling into question opponents experience and ethics mr edwards defended himself yesterday against charges that he derides powerful washington lobbyists and corporate interests in speeches but is accepting help from a &# advertising campaign from alliance for a new america an independent labor group that supports the edwards campaign and is run by his former campaign manager nick baldick mr edwards said on cbss "face the nation" that this group should stop running these ads but said he hasnt called mr baldick to ask that he cease them "ive done exactly what im allowed to do under the law under the law we are not allowed to talk with coordinate or work with these people " he said meanwhile mr obama acknowledged that he had softened his once firm statement that he wouldnt allow any lobbyists to work in his white house "look the terminology may have changed the basic concept remains the same i am going to break the revolving door that has become so commonplace in this administration and in some previous administrations " he said on nbc over the weekend mr obama and mrs clinton continued their dispute over the relevance of her foreign policy experience as first lady friday mr obama suggested that her experience consisted of having tea at an ambassadors house on saturday in dubuque mrs clinton recounted a precarious landing on a visit to war torn bosnia and how she had to run out of the airplane because there might have been sniper fire "i dont remember anybody offering me tea on the tarmac when that was happening " she said
