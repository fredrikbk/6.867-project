for example frequently collaborated other married musicians avoided working openly together perhaps because it would call into question their independence some years ago after cobains death i asked love about some of her husbands unreleased material and she stormed out of the interview she apparently wanted the focus to be on her and her band hole some of the most creatively fruitful musician marriages however have been the ones that have fallen apart its hard to speculate from outside a shattered relationship just what was behind its demise wedded artists often inspire and challenge each other and sometimes the demands of art and romance are just too great for a marriage to contain it may also be that some married artists fall in love with the inspiration they bring to each other more than anything else and when that wellspring of inspiration dries up so does the emotional bond of course there are plenty of happily married artists but perhaps the artistic temperament is a poor match for the stability maturity and affability that a long term relationship requires carl jung once said that that "the artists life cannot be otherwise than full of conflicts for two forces are at war within him on the one hand the common human longing for happiness satisfaction and security in life and on the other a ruthless passion for creation which may go so far as to override every personal desire there are hardly any exceptions to the rule that a person must pay dearly for the divine gift of the creative fire " it may also be that chaos makes a fertile atmosphere for creativity the blues guitarist and singer memphis minnie was married to and divorced from several other blues performers during her career "she was real hard to get along with i mean she be arguing all the time " the blues performer homesick james who may have been one of her paramours was quoted as saying " you aint made that change right you didnt do this you didnt do that she would always get pissed off about it the way i played that woman was tougher than a man " minnies difficult personality nonetheless made for creative pairings she recorded seminal blues records with three of her husbands one of those records "when the levee breaks " made with her second husband kansas joe mccoy in was later covered by led zeppelin listen to memphis minnies version real windows media louis armstrong may have owed much of his early success to his wife pioneering jazz pianist lil hardin when armstrong first arrived in chicago hardin said "everything he had on was too small for him his atrocious tie was dangling down over his protruding stomach all the musicians called him little louis and he weighed pounds " she convinced armstrong to lose weight buy new clothes which she selected and helped them both get divorces they were married to other people when they met sensing that he lacked confidence she also encouraged him to leave king olivers band and strike out on his own hardin was a major contributor to armstrongs groundbreaking hot five and hot seven recordings and he considered her one of the best pianists around although they divorced in she remained devoted to his music for the rest of her life she died in while performing "st louis blues" at an armstrong tribute he had died the month before listen to armstrongs "you made me love you" real windows media one of the most storied relationships in country music was the marriage of george jones and tammy wynette the two met in married in had a daughter in and by the end of were heading up the charts with "take me " a version of jones solo hit they remade as a duet the pair went on to release such classic country duets as " were not the jet set " and "two story house " they tore through six years of marriage a bitter divorce and two reunion albums in and wynette died in at the age of both singers enjoyed solo success throughout their careers but arguably the most vibrant part of their creative lives was the time they spend together listen to " were not the jet set" real windows media a volatile marriage of course often isnt the best way to spark ones musical creativity in many cases one partner blooms and the other is stifled emotionally if not artistically stormy marriages can also overshadow great art ike turners song "rocket " released in under the name "jackie brenston &amp his delta cats " is widely credited as the first rock and roll record but ike is better known for his tempestuous relationship with tina turner and the dramatic movie that was made about their time together "whats love got to do with it" angela bassett played tina laurence fishburne was ike when ike and tina were together her talent was overshadowed after she broke free his reputation was diminished by the fallout from the failed marriage but married musicians even ones who have separated can have a chemistry together that cant be replicated last year jack white released an album with another band the raconteurs while that project received some favorable reviews it didnt garner the accolades hed gotten working with meg white in the white stripes "icky thump " the white stripes new album is being embraced by some critics as a return to form jack white adds on a few instrumental touches but the core of his music is still his interplay with meg white the new album like some of the white stripes material in the past melds the crunch of alternative rock with the wail of the blues listen to "rag and bone" real windows media it may be a thrilling sound but is it a new one in long before "rocket " rock or the white stripes the poet langston hughes wrote an article for the chicago defender about a memphis minnie performance and described her playing music that sounded a lot like what the white stripes are playing now loud electric sharp edged blues hughes wrote "memphis minnie sits on top of the icebox at the club in chicago and beats out the blues on an electric guitar the electric guitar is very loud science having magnified all its softness away the singing the electric guitar and the drums are so hard and so loud amplified as they are by general electric on top of the icebox that sometimes the words the melody get lost under the noise leaving only the rhythm to come through clear " minnie never got the chance to record the kind of wild electric blues that hughes wrote about that night so we can only have the poets description to imagine what it might have sounded like but its hard not to wonder what she would have made of the white stripes would she have heard an echo of the music she never got to put on record would she have seen competitors collaborators or both well never know of course but i bet she and jack white could have made beautiful music together write to
