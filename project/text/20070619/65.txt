iran is spider at center of a middle east web joe liebermans june editorial page commentary "what i saw in iraq"" is thoughtful but he overlooks two strategic issues one iran is changing the entire dynamics of the middle east by controlling lebanon through hezbollah controlling "palestine" through hamas arming the taliban in afghanistan arming al qaeda to fight us in iraq and essentially having syrian as a client state this in addition to building a nuclear capacity this is the beginning of the shiite aryan persians against the sunni arabs while we sit and watch secondly sen lieberman says "no one believes there is a military solution in iraq" when it is precisely a military solution that would work its simply that the political courage is not there does anyone believe a nuclear armed iran will be contained civilization prevailed over barbarism in world war ii was that not a military solution gen david petraeuss surge will work if iran is out of the equation we have here a hostile barbaric government threatening israel with annihilation that could easily be put down if we used our military equipment yet we cant even summon a gasoline boycott on iran let alone strafe its supply lines to iraq reasonable people can disagree about a dramatic overt strike but please dont tell us there is no military solution that is the only solution and no one wants to use it as a former peace corps volunteer in iran who understands the emotional immaturity and the mindset ive watched as irans plan has played out over years beginning with the mullahs in each village conspiring against the shah and with a little u s help usurping him as a refugee from the former soviet union i also saw the u s misjudge communism once again it misjudges iran which will take its place of ascendancy in the next years andrew engelman stuart fla
