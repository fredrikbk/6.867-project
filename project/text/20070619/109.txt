the afternoon report gorging on gadgets online edition the weak housing market has apparently done little to diminish consumers interest in flat tvs laptops and videogames but thanks to a race to the bottom on prices the retailers that sell such gear arent exactly raking in a windfall best buy the nations largest electronics retailer said its earnings dropped in its fiscal first quarter that wasnt quite the bottom line wall street had been hoping for and the numbers demonstrate how electronics retailers are locked in a brutal struggle for market share especially on such popular items as flat panel tvs and laptop computers to be certain best buy has been holding up better than most rival circuit city was battered into a massive restructuring effort partly due to diminished returns from pricey tvs it has been forced to make staff reductions at nearly all levels of the company including a move in march to replace higher paid store level employees with cheaper replacements wal mart has also gotten into consumer electronics in a big way and the giant discounters arrival has had the predictable effect of driving prices to rock bottom levels punishing smaller retailers that dont have the scale to keep up but even if the prices battle is blasting a hole in best buys earnings now the company said that it is still taking market share away from its competitors "our share gains show that our core business is healthy " chief executive officer brad anderson said best buys stock still dropped about anyone who came to best buys earnings report looking for signs that the consumer is getting tuckered out likely walked away disappointed even as its earnings declined the electronics chain noted that shoppers were still snapping up laptops and videogame consoles by the armload indeed

trends will be hard to predict this year outlays appear to be "accelerating in lower margin categories we are confident that flat panel tvs gaming and notebook computers will remain very appealing to our customers " economists have been waiting for spending to slam into a brick wall for a while now as the crumbling housing market and rising interest rates were expected to slow the pace of mortgage equity withdrawal and make homeowners feel less wealthy but shoppers have kept flooding into malls confounding expectations thats certainly not for a lack of fresh gloom from the housing sector the latest report on new residential construction showed housing starts declined last month the first decline in four months for an infamously volatile data set that is hardly a jarring drop further a climb in building permits would seem to suggest home builders have started feeling better about the sales prospects for future projects but richard f moody chief economist at mission residential said the data appeared "eerily calm " pointing to a further decline in confidence about the sector reported yesterday "an anemic spring selling season mounting foreclosures swollen inventories and the recent spike in mortgage rates there is little doubt that the housing market is in for more pain " mr moody wrote economists at nomura securities think the report indicates that construction will remain a drag on growth through the summer and that the "sharp jump in mortgage rates in recent weeks is likely to make this slump longer deeper and more painful for builders and lenders " housing oil
