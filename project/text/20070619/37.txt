contempt in mississippi for years mississippi tort baron dickie scruggs has rampaged his way through the legal system so theres more than a little justice in that system finally holding him to account on friday federal judge william acker asked an alabama u s attorney to prosecute mr scruggs for criminal contempt for his role in the recent shakedown of state farm insurance co "if the government declines this request " judge acker warned "the court will appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt " mr scruggs says hes innocent and will fight any charges but the facts as laid out in judge ackers page ruling make for an instructive lesson in trial bar tactics and mr scruggss legal ethics the tale began when the scruggs law firm sued state farm in the aftermath of hurricane katrina for its flood insurance policies in the process they acquired pages of internal documents that had been surreptitiously photocopied by two sisters who were working for e a renfroe an alabama insurance services company contracted by state farm the sisters cori rigsby moran and kerri rigsby are now "consultants" for the scruggs katrina group to the tune of &# a year renfroe sued the rigsbys for violating confidentiality and trade secret laws and in december judge acker issued an injunction ordering that all parties besides law enforcement return what fridays ruling calls "the purloined documents " instead of complying mr scruggs shipped them over to mississippi attorney general jim hood who was pursuing his own dubious criminal probe of state farm the documents were intended to help mr hood make his case and mr hood in turn encouraged state farm to settle with mr scruggs a sort of tag team mugging state farm eventually settled for more than &# million and only afterward were the documents returned judge acker was not pleased mr scruggs claims he was merely trying to cooperate with law enforcement by handing the documents to mr hood but judge acker calls this "such a strained construction and so contrary to the injunctions clear terms as to lack any credibility whatsoever " and although he does not make a specific ruling on the matter he strongly implies that messrs scruggs and hood "had teamed up to bully state farm into civil and criminal settlements " for students of legal obfuscation we refer readers to mr hoods march letter to the journal responding to our march editorial "mississippi justice " its a classic whatever the depredations of mr hood and they are legion mr scruggs comes under the hardest flogging he sent the documents to mr hood judge acker writes "for the calculated purpose of ensuring noncompliance with or avoidance of the injunctions clear first paragraph " he goes on to slam mr scruggs "an experienced attorney and an officer of the court " for his "brazen disregard of the courts preliminary injunction taking scruggss word for it he was arrogating to himself the right to substitute his judgment for the courts judgment that spells defiance " this is also the kind of arrogance that typifies much of the modern tort industry and it is as judge acker points out "precisely the type of conduct that criminal contempt sanctions were designed to address " mr scruggss humiliation is a public service another instance of a fair minded judge willing to make the trial bar answer for its contempt for the laws it is supposed to uphold
