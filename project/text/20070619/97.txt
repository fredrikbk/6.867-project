politics &amp economics how west bank plan could falter u s eu embrace of fatah risks alienating big portion of palestinians the bush administration has decided that last weeks seizure of the gaza strip by the islamist militant group hamas is good news that optimism will be swiftly tested with israeli prime minister ehud olmert scheduled to meet with president bush today at the white house secretary of state condoleezza rice said the upheaval in the palestinian territories has provided much needed "clarification" by neatly separating the extremists from the moderates that partition u s officials said will allow washington and its allies to heap economic and diplomatic support on the west bank and its newly formed fatah government even as they seek to cordon off hamas in gaza the u s had imposed a diplomatic and aid embargo on the territories after hamas won control of the palestinian government in an election more than a year ago yesterday ms rice said the u s "would resume full assistance to the palestinian government and normal government to government contacts " the u s also hopes to persuade mr olmert to release more than &# million of palestinian tax receipts held since hamas came to power and to loosen israels grip on the west bank which has helped to cripple the palestinian economy the u s and the european union which also said it will renew assistance are seeking to shore up the palestinian economy and government of president mahmoud abbas and his weakened fatah party as they seek to consolidate control in the much larger west bank the hope is that an economic revival would help firmly establish moderates such as mr abbas and his newly appointed prime minister economist salam fayyad as the real stewards of palestinians future yet the bush administrations positive spin on developments brushes over some serious problems by putting all its support behind mr abbas and fatah it risks alienating large portions of the palestinian population especially those marginalized in gaza the strategy is to forge a lasting peace with israel while relying on one end of the palestinian political spectrum isolating gaza could also give an even wider opening to iran which has emerged as hamass main international supporter mr abbas during the weekend outlawed the militia forces of hamas and swore in a new emergency cabinet ending a brief unity government with hamas the palestinian constitution says elections must be called within two months but few expect that to happen mr bush called mr abbas yesterday to express his support israel now faces an increasingly impoverished and radicalized gaza strip less than miles from tel aviv hamas has rapidly built up its military strength by smuggling arms from egypt creating what some are calling a "third front " along with syria and lebanons hezbollah fighters across israels northern border long the dominant power on the palestinian political scene fatah became the target of widespread accusations of ineptness and corruption under the late yasser arafat and even under mr abbas who took over after mr arafats death in hamas rode those sentiments to victory in the january parliamentary elections the u s and europe responded by freezing aid to the territories largely because of hamass refusal to recognize israels right to exist despite forging a unity government in february fatah and hamas factions continued to feud in gaza the core of hamass power the fighting climaxed last week when hamas overran fatah strongholds in gaza ms rice said the u s is as determined as ever "to clarify a political horizon for a palestinian state " to many observers though hamass takeover in gaza and the huge rift within palestinian society it illustrates effectively puts an end to any prospect of securing an overall peace deal between the palestinians and the israelis critics are also skeptical of how far a newly revived partnership between fatah and the west can go especially if it just tries to ignore hamas and its significant power base for many the hamas military victory in gaza dramatized how weakened and disorganized the once powerful fatah movement has become despite efforts by the u s and its arab partners to strengthen its security forces some analysts said the current crisis could mark the movements death knell especially if mr abbas continues to be seen at home as being too close to israel and the u s "one fact that has very clearly emerged is that hamas is a very disciplined organization while fatah is fat and unable to do much " said edward abington a former u s diplomat in the middle east and onetime adviser to mr abbas "its hamas that has the power and the momentum right now " nor will it be easy for the u s to win support and loyalty in the west bank for starters some palestinians even independent ministers in the just dissolved cabinet reject mr abbass emergency government as illegal former justice minister ali sartwai for one said he supports mr abbas but he turned down a seat in the new cabinet because he couldnt as a prominent rule of law advocate abide what he views as its illegality a floundering economy meanwhile could further alienate palestinians and highlight the very issues that drove many voters to hamas in the first place while renewed funding should return full regular paychecks to about palestinian authority civil servants the authoritys payroll remains bloated with fatah security personnel the more than security men on the payroll are the largest single cost covered by palestinian tax revenue "many palestinians are going to view taking this money out of their pockets as a waste " said ali jerbawi a palestinian analyst and former head of the political science faculty at birzeit university in the west bank city of ramallah he said the security services now more than ever are seen by palestinians as "private empires" for some officials for this and other reasons mr jerbawi said money isnt the answer mr abbas can be saved he said only if he can deliver real progress on a permanent land for peace deal with israel european and arab officials also worry that the u s plan to concentrate so heavily on the west bank risks stirring up greater misery and anger among the million people in gaza where unemployment has topped militant groups allied with al qaeda are gaining strength in gaza fueling speculation that israel may soon launch a sustained military offensive against strongholds in the territory the bush administration said it isnt turning its back on gaza ms rice yesterday noted that the u s is giving &# million to the united nations relief agency that provides food for more than of gazas residents "we will not leave one and a half million palestinians at the mercy of terrorist organizations " she said
