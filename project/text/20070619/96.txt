politics &amp economics polands coal mines open soon to investors warsaw poland is opening its large and politically important coal mining industry to private investors in a move that could have a big impact on central european energy supplies a government plan completed last week would enable state owned mining companies to float their shares on the warsaw stock exchange over the next two years to raise money for expansion and investment in new technologies sales of state owned mines and joint ventures would also be permitted for the first time under the economy ministrys plan which is subject to cabinet approval poland is europes largest coal producer mining more than million metric tons last year roughly four times as much as germany the second largest producer more than of the countrys electricity is generated by coal fired power plants polands economy ministry says and other heavy industries in the region such as steel also rely heavily on polish coal as a fuel and a raw material privatization has been high on the list of many of the polish governments that have come to power since the soviet backed communist regime collapsed in but polish coal miners have until now been able to resist those efforts largely because the mining sector was a major employer and politicians were unwilling to alienate its half million workers by allowing foreigners to take over the industry and cut jobs but over the last decade warsaw itself has slowly reduced the number of employees in the sector to about from employees according to the polish economy ministry by slowly phasing out operations that required large capital spending the government reduced bloated staffing and stopped the financial losses of the sector those moves have been crucial in paving the way for private investors to enter the sector without fear of labor union reprisals one result though is that polands coal industry has been starved of capital for decades unable to increase capacity or productivity output has fallen and several mines have closed the mining sector needs an estimated billion zloty &# billion in investment by to remain competitive said krzysztof tchorzewski deputy economy minister in charge of industry at the same time the coal industry is coming under pressure from the european union to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions mr tchorzewski says investors are being sought in part to help polish coal mines improve their practices to help the country meet its long term carbon emissions targets several european power companies such as vattenfall group rwe ag and czech power group cez have recently reiterated their interest in investing in cleaner burning polish power plants whether refurbished or newly built but to date electricity companies are waiting until warsaw decides whether it will renew the privatization of the power sector which it halted in when the current government was elected the eu has said it would welcome modernization of polands coal sector if it leads to eventual use of clean coal power generation technology carbon dioxide storage and coal to gas technologies the fresh investment into coal is also aimed at stabilizing domestic mining levels so poland wont need to rely on energy supplies from russia as its neighbor germany does to fuel its growing demand for power polands rapid growth gross domestic product rose on the year in the first quarter is expected to exacerbate domestic electricity shortfalls some estimates predict domestic power consumption will double over the next years leaving warsaw with no choice but to open the power sector to privatization in coming years "poland will shut down megawatts of electricity generation capacity in the next three to five years due to eu environmental regulations so warsaw needs private investors to fund new electricity generation capacity now " says petr novak energy sector analyst at atlantik financial markets in prague polish officials say they have held talks with several strategic and financial investors in the coal sector privately held mining and energy company new world resources bv or nwr says it is in talks on establishing a joint venture with polish state owned mining company jastrzebska spolka weglowa the talks involve access to an estimated million tons of coking coal reserves on the czech polish border the economy ministry confirms that the talks are continuing the jsw mine is just across the border from nwrs czech operations to reach the coal nwr would extend its underground mining shafts into poland said zdenek bakala the lead investor in nwr polands largest coal mining holding company by revenue kompania weglowa sa says it plans to sell its unprofitable silesia coal mine which still has an estimated million tons of reserves even though it was shut down earlier because it wasnt economically feasible to continue mining with outdated and unsafe equipment the silesian mine requires an estimated million zloty to million zloty to restart mining of new layers company spokesman zbigniew madej says
