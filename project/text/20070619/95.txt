review of b fees may be far reaching sec officials eye problems surrounding pay to brokers but broader study is urged a gamut of mutual fund distribution issues are likely to come up for discussion today as the securities and exchange commission sits down with industry participants at a roundtable to talk about b fees in recent months top sec officials have expressed concern about the use of b fees a type of sales fee paid to brokers but industry observers say the fee cant be looked at in isolation and should involve a review of the various channels of fund distribution the b fee named after the rule that created it in the s for the first time allowed funds to use its assets to pay for marketing and advertising at that time the fund industry was struggling so the rule enabled them to market themselves more effectively now however the industry is robust and the b money is largely used to compensate brokers for selling the funds and related services investors paid nearly &# billion in b fees last year according to trade group investment company institute the b fee is included in a funds expense ratio and is akin to a sales load a one time fee paid to the broker for current and future services but consumer advocates say investors may not always be aware of it barbara roper director of investor protection at the consumer federation of america says brokers like the fee because "it allows them to create an impression that theyre using no load funds " ms roper who will be participating in the discussions today says that to deal with the problems surrounding b the sec must address the broader issue of how brokers are compensated for selling funds this would include a look at other distribution arrangements like revenue sharing which basically involve payments to the broker from the advisers profits these arrangements have come under the regulatory scanner in recent years on the grounds that they werent disclosed properly to investors mutual fund trustees say they would like more industrywide information on revenue sharing and other distribution practices in order to make judgments about their own fund advisers distribution policies including b "resolving b cant be done in a vacuum " says carl frischling an independent fund trustee and a lawyer at kramer levin naftalis &amp frankel llp mutual fund boards are required to review a funds b fee every year to make sure that its reasonable and that its being utilized properly but boards say it can be a challenging task because of a range of factors such as opaque information from the fund adviser or distributor on how the fee is being used for instance the b fee can be used for providing "services" to investors but it may be hard to determine the benefit of those services and whether the amount paid is reasonable in recent months sec officials have expressed concern that the b fee is being used for purposes other than what was originally intended some sec officials have said they would consider repealing the b rule altogether but many in the industry feel it isnt going to happen a widely held view is that the sec would use this opportunity to give more guidance on how the fee should be used philip khinda a lawyer at ropes &amp gray llp says the key would be to have better disclosure to both investors and the boards among options for what can be done with the b fee one is that it can be separated from the expense ratio and charged to each investor individually just like a sales load another option is to have a single management expense ratio without separating the b component as its separated now and the adviser can use the money however he wants
