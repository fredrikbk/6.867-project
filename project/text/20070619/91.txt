politics &amp economics imf to cite currency manipulators washington under pressure from the u s the international monetary fund has promised to identify countries that manipulate their currencies in ways that give them an edge in foreign trade a move that in theory would embarrass these countries into stopping at a time when many u s lawmakers manufacturers and unions accuse china of keeping its currency weak to boost its exports the imf announced new rules yesterday to give "clear guidance to our members on how they should run their exchange rate policies on what is acceptable to the international community and what is not " said rodrigo de rato managing director of the global financial watchdog the new rules give the imf no new enforcement powers that would allow it to strong arm violators into altering currency policies but imf officials say any nation publicly identified as a manipulator will be shamed into changing its practices with an eye on china the bush administration began lobbying for new rules in when a senior treasury official accused the imf which monitors the economic policies of its member nations and steps in with rescue loans when needed of being "asleep at the wheel" when it comes to exchange rates the u s quickly enlisted the backing of its allies among the group of seven leading industrialized nations which besides the u s includes the united kingdom japan germany italy france and canada the imf had been operating under rules drafted in after the collapse of the international gold standard and fixed exchange rate system one u s complaint about those earlier rules was that they required the imf to discern whether a country intentionally uses its exchange rate to make its exports cheaper the new rules dont require the imf to prove ill intent it can find a member nation to be a currency manipulator if the result of its policies is "fundamental exchange rate misalignment" or "large and prolonged current account deficits or surpluses " such guidelines could in principle force the imf to cite china as a currency manipulator beijing tightly controls the international exchange rate of its currency the yuan which many economists consider to be undervalued china posted a &# billion trade surplus with the u s last year "the revised decision sends a strong message that the imf will put exchange rate surveillance back at the core of its duties and rigorously implement its rules on exchange rate surveillance going forward " treasury secretary henry paulson said in its own currency report last week the treasury declined to formally accuse china of manipulating the yuan despite enormous pressure from capitol hill mr paulson has advocated a less confrontational approach to u s china economic relations but the treasury is more enthusiastic about the idea of a multilateral institution such as the imf exerting pressure on beijing
