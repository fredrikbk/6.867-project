boeings nuts and bolts problem shortage of fasteners tests ability to finish dreamliners when boeing co engineers first set about developing their new dreamliner their biggest concern was whether they would be able to make enormous sections of the wings and fuselage out of carbon fiber plastic what they didnt count on was a shortage of nuts and bolts to hold it all together "its amazing what it comes down to at the end of the program " says mike bair the boeing vice president in charge of the multibillion dollar dreamliner program he calls the lack of hardware "a near term nuisance" but conceded that "were getting down to the point that every part even a bolt is important " after more than three years of planning and engineering the major sections of the first dreamliner are in boeings cavernous final assembly bay in everett wash workers are rushing to get the airplane together and painted in time to meet the goal of unveiling it to the public july mr bair said boeing is working closely with its primary fastener supplier alcoa inc to get enough high quality titanium bolts to put the plane together in a logical fashion nevertheless major components such as the wings arrived from japan and other locations such as italy and south carolina held together by thousands of temporary fasteners the unexpected lack of fasteners marks the sort of test boeing will face in coming years as it moves to fill a press of orders for the and other aircraft amid an aerospace boom the chicago based aerospace giant is moving cautiously to avoid the same sort of costly production stumble it faced in the s when it tried to expand output too quickly airbus a unit of european aeronautic defence &amp space co is still suffering fallout with its customers after manufacturing problems led to delays of almost two years in the delivery of the first double deck as while customers are pushing boeing to hurry production boeing officials say suppliers ability to deliver parts will ultimately determine how quickly it can build airplanes boeing needs only a comparative handful of fasteners to roll out its first few planes but alcoa and the small number of companies in the field prefer to make thousands at a time and making such high tech high performance fasteners is a complicated process a titanium fastener one inch in diameter could support the weight of toyota camrys "you will not find our aerospace fasteners in the local hardware store " said olivier jarrault president of alcoa fastening systems during a briefing sunday on the eve of the paris air show boeing commercial airplanes president and chief executive scott carson described the fastener shortage as one of the biggest short term challenges the industry is facing "fasteners are just aggravating as hell " he said noting that such hardware is usually treated as a commodity that is readily available he said boeing is already seeing improvements but expects the supplies to be tight across the board for several months industry officials say the fastener shortage is the result of a consolidation wave that occurred in the fastener industry in the months following the sept terrorist attacks as airlines hit bottom they canceled hundreds of orders for new jetliners in turn boeing laid off more than people which sent similar layoffs cascading throughout its supplier base alcoa said that in its fastener division of all workers were laid off alcoas mr jarrault said the two competitors in fasteners to alcoa are france based lisi groups aerospace division and precision castparts corp of portland ore along with some small players the company expects the aerospace fastener market to grow by about between and driven by production increases in large jets and smaller business jets alcoa spokesman kevin lowery said boeing executives have been visiting alcoas fastener facilities in carson calif to brainstorm ways to develop the fasteners fast enough to keep boeings building plans on course "we have said we will go back and look at what we can do to get these fasteners to them as quickly as possible " mr lowery said alcoa executive vice president bill christopher who heads the engineered products and solutions group that includes aerospace said at a recent investor meeting that the company is adding capacity to fastener plants in mexico and hungary it also plans to open a plant in china next year the aluminum giant which is based in pittsburgh and new york acquired huck fasteners in when it bought cordant technologies inc it purchased fairchild fasteners in the company has said its alcoa fastening systems represents about of the companys aerospace revenue which is about &# billion a year or roughly of alcoas total revenue in unlike previous airplanes the dreamliner is made largely of futuristic composites which cant be held together with traditional aluminum rivets instead the major sections are bolted together with specially coated bolts that fit into brackets at each joint each bolt must be individually made on a lathe a process that cant be hurried because it takes time to set up the lathe alcoa would prefer to make thousands of one type of fastener before breaking the machine down and resetting it "problem is we dont need thousands of bolts right now we might need of one kind " mr bair said he said alcoa has been "very good about working with us on this " with almost orders before the first plane has even been bolted together the dreamliner has become boeings most successful new airplane program but top company officials say they plan to deliver no more than jets in and precisely because of unforeseen events such as the fastener shortage "the worst thing we can do for our customers is to over promise and under deliver " said boeing chairman and chief executive jim mcnerney
