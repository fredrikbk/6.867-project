supremes tort bar in a welcome decision yesterday the supreme court sent the tort bar packing for the second time in a month dismissing an antitrust claim against investment banks in the ipo market during the dot com days stephen breyer wrote the opinion of the court from which only clarence thomas dissented the case credit suisse first boston v billing centered around the activities of several investment banks at the height of the stock market boom and alleged that many of the things they did when building order books and allocating shares in hot ipos violated federal antitrust laws the feds themselves were divided on the case the sec believes it was responsible for regulating brokers in the ipo market and doesnt need private antitrust actions complicating its job the justice department antitrust division was less sure and in the end the bush administration submitted a split the baby amicus brief the supreme court kept the baby whole ruling that the sec was firmly in charge of ipo regulation and that allowing shareholder suits would only lead to contradictory and probably erroneous rulings about what banks were and werent allowed to do john paul stevens who concurred with the majority but offered his own reasoning went even further he argued that price fixing in the ipo market was basically impossible given the markets size and liquidity and so there was no real case here "after the initial purchase the prices of newly issued stocks or bonds are determined by competition among the vast multitude of other securities traded in a free market " justice stevens wrote "to suggest that an underwriting syndicate can restrain trade in that market by manipulating the terms of ipos is frivolous " justice stevenss view of the case may be the most sensible and principled but however the justices got to the answer the high court has batted down yet another bit of "frivolous" antitrust innovation by the trial bar the remaining mystery is how the bush administration wound up with a position on the case more friendly to the trial lawyers than stephen breyer or ruth bader ginsburg
