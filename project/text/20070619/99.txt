romes options for alitalia dwindle as bidders grow wary rome the italian governments effort to auction off control of unprofitable state carrier alitalia spa appears to be in jeopardy as bidders express increasing skepticism over the airlines prospects one of two remaining bidders a group led by oao aeroflot said yesterday it wasnt prepared to invest as much in the airline as it thought the italian government hoped though the russian state owned carrier said it wasnt leaving the auction just yet last week the leader of the other remaining bidding group italys ap holding which controls the countrys no carrier air one complained in a letter to the government that it couldnt formulate its offer because it still hadnt been provided with crucial financial information about alitalia earlier this month the third of three finalists chosen by the government to participate in the bidding process a group led by private equity fund tpg pulled out even in the beleaguered airline industry alitalia is considered an ugly duckling it has recorded only one quarterly profit out of the last it flies an aging inefficient fleet and is plagued by chronic labor unrest if the governments sale process falls apart alitalia could face more severe efforts by either the government or an eventual buyer to turn it around and another effort by the italian government to step in could provoke a political fight with the european union the treasury ministry declined to comment on the sale process the italian governments trouble in orchestrating a sale of alitalia comes as europe deregulates its airline sector however the effort to bring fast and sweeping changes is running into resistance because many of the players are former state monopolies and considered strategic national assets decades old aviation treaties regulating travel between countries are also still a hurdle to fast consolidation air france and klm royal dutch airlines are taking years to merge their operations within air france klm sa while spains iberia lineas aereas de espana sa is slowly trying to find a merger partner bidders have been asked to submit proposals by july that include how they would turn alitalia around and the italian government would judge them accordingly a deal for alitalia is tough to value because of the airlines debt and restructuring needs when the treasury ministry which owns of the carrier announced last december that it was planning to sell off a controlling stake it was considered a landmark moment many of the problems that plague alitalia such as revolving door management and angry strike prone unions are traced to its state ownership with the state always there to kick in extra cash painful restructuring measures were often postponed but in recent years the european union had begun to crack down on romes efforts to prop up its money losing carrier with state funds in when alitalia risked not having enough cash to fund its operations brussels allowed rome to back a million euros or roughly &# million emergency loan in exchange the italian government installed new management and promised to back a tough restructuring plan and eventually reduce its stake the next year brussels allowed rome to buy up nearly half of alitalias &lt euro&gt billion rights offering money that was supposed to give the carrier the funds it needed to launch a successful turnaround however the turnaround plan failed and alitalia again was battling steep quarterly losses treasury minister tommaso padoa schioppa insisted that the only way for the airline to return to financial health was for the state to sell it to a private bidder but from the beginning the sale process was plagued by political uncertainty about how much leeway a potential buyer would have to restructure the airline and its employees unions again crippled the airline with strikes earlier this year the treasury ministry sent the management packing the fourth time in as many years that top executives had been replaced currently the airline is operating without a chief executive instead giancarlo schisano appointed in february as alitalias business coordinator is filling in the newly appointed chairman berardino libonati is holding down several other jobs at the same time including a university professorship senior partnership in a rome law firm and the chairmanship of banca di roma spa part of unicredit spa last week alitalias auditor deloitte touche tohmatsu agreed to sign off on the airlines balance sheet a decision which had been delayed since february in its report deloitte cited "some significant factors of uncertainty" in alitalias operations alitalia ended last year with a net loss of million euros including a fleet write down compared with a loss of million euros in deloitte noted in its report that the treasury ministry had decided to require alitalias new management to come up with a new three year industrial plan previously neither the government nor the new management had prepared any contingency plan for the airline however with the two remaining bidders expressing reservations the government must scramble to come up with a plan b if the sale process falls apart the government has little wiggle room to find a way to inject new funds into the airline to keep it flying
