stock watch sprint nextel no clear call telecom giant banking on wimax but bears fear industry slowdown online edition sprint nextel corp is setting itself up to become the strongest provider of wireless broadband services but some analysts worry that its recent string of buyouts and broadband strategy wont keep competitors from stealing customers the telecom giant agreed last week to buy northern pcs services llc effectively silencing one of its litigious affiliates for &# million including the assumption of &# million in debt the move puts a call out to investors that it is working to put behind it the legal issues that have dogged it since the &# billion merger of sprint and nextel in the stock closed at &# on tuesday off its recent high but still well above the average price over the past weeks but uncertainty remains about financing for its ambitious wimax project and there are still a few remaining affiliates regional suppliers of wireless service that claimed the sprint nextel merger had violated their exclusivity agreements with the separate companies that have not been acquired or settled their legal disputes bears also worry about the companys increasing competition for wireless subscribers which may only get worse when apple inc s iphone rolls out at the end of june the bull case broadband edge some analysts believe the buildout of sprint nextels wimax wireless broadband system though expensive will give it a leg up on its competition sprint verizon wireless and at&amp t already offer high speed wireless services in some areas but wimax promises to be faster and available in much broader areas than the services of its competitors timothy horan of cibc world markets says sprints first to market status will enable it to strike application deals with companies such as google and yahoo he also expects an expansion of the companys business model with wimax capability embedded in new electronic devices such as digital music players which could bring in additional subscription fees or per use charges the company has committed &# billion to the wimax project through next year shaking off subprime sprint nextel increased the credit standards for new wireless customers during the fourth quarter lowering the risk that customers will default on service contracts and providing a safer foundation for revenue going forward timothy horan of cibc notes that sprint still has a "higher subprime customer base" meaning customers with spotty credit records &lt ndash&gt than its peers but philip cusick of bear stearns writes that he expects the companys current "tighter credit metrics" to improve the level at which it keeps subscribers through the rest of pivotal partners sprint nextels joint venture with four cable companies including comcast time warner cox communications and advance newhouse communications allows the cable companies to market sprints wireless service as part of their own service bundles offering sprint a fresh source of revenue some analysts also see the venture renamed pivot in march as another way for the company to take advantage of its eventual broadband capabilities ken custer of a g edwards says the partnership has the potential to drive "strong earnings growth" at sprint the bear case low impact buyout bmo capital markets sees the northern pcs deal which includes the assumption of a whopping chunk of debt as being of little benefit to the companys bottom line "the acquisition has no material impact on our estimates at this time " writes peter rhamer of bmo indicating that overall revenue for the company following the deal expected to close in the third quarter is unchanged and though the purchase does bring the total number of regional affiliates that have been bought out to six that still leaves three more that may be a source of legal headaches and for which the company has not divulged any intent to proceed with buyouts soon tough competitors many analysts see sprint suffering from an overall slowdown in the wireless industry at the same time that competitive pressures intensify from rivals such as at&amp t which will be the sole provider for apples much hyped iphone sprint has already released its own music phone called upstage and produced by samsung but some analysts dont see it as an iphone competitor despite its much lower price simon flannery of morgan stanley writes of the iphone that "our research suggests it will be particularly appealing to sprint users " presenting a risk of lost service contracts for the company he also notes that consumer spending already under pressure from a housing slump and high gas prices will continue to drag on the wireless sector fading lbo hopes after the recent private equity buyout of cellular carrier alltel corp investors ran up several other telecom stocks including sprint in hopes another deal was imminent but greg miller of deutsche bank cites the industrys increasingly competitive environment and the companys size as factors that could turn off potential lbo partners "we believe sprint is an unlikely lbo candidate due to the significant technology risk the company faces in coming years " writes mr miller referring to the high cost of moving customers from the iden technology used by nextel phones to the cdma technology used by sprint write to james willhite at
