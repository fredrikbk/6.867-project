more software deals on horizon the rapid rate of acquisitions of software companies in the first half of likely will continue for the rest of the year before last week the software industry saw some &# billion of mergers and acquisitions compared with &# billion in the same period last year according to group an independent new york technology industry analyst firm the same factors underpinning that deal flow the consolidation of a maturing industry cash rich acquirers and smaller target companies will remain in place for a while according to several observers "we think the pace will continue " said citigroup inc analyst brent thill "the dot com era gave birth to a lot of public software companies many of which dont have the breadth or the capital to survive as stand alone corporations they have good assets but they dont necessarily have a platform " mr thill said among the possible targets industry observers say are small to midsize companies that specialize in security or online software brenon daly of group expects that will set a record thanks in part to record cash holdings by large software companies and private equity firms "first theres innovation and then theres consolidation and software is in consolidation thats not to say that there isnt innovation in open source or on demand but for mainstream enterprise software you dont get venture funding " said mr daly "in a consolidating market efficiencies win and most efficiencies are wrung out by bigger companies " he added at the top of the list of buyers is oracle corp the redwood shores calif software maker has acquired about companies in as many months and oracle chief executive larry ellison has said he will continue to buy even people skeptical about the momentum of software deals such as cowen &amp co analyst peter goldmacher believe him "oracle is a juggernaut theyll keep going " said mr goldmacher oracle aside according to mr goldmacher the continuation of deal making will depend on interest rates remaining low other analysts agreed that may be true for private equity deals but interest rates wont affect larger software companies whose purchases have usually been for cash other potential acquirers include microsoft corp sap ag hewlett packard co international business machines corp cisco systems inc and several private equity funds for willing buyers small and midsize target companies are willing sellers for several reasons amid all the deal activity customers have been reluctant to buy their software until they know whether the company will be bought and if so by whom according to independent technology stock analyst trip chowdhry important customers are telling the large companies which smaller software producers they should buy bea systems inc which makes transaction and message software is an example of this said mr chowdhry who predicted that the deal pace will accelerate in the second half of the year "customers know bea wont remain independent so theyre not buying if bea is acquired by oracle and youre already an oracle customer youll get a good deal on bea software if youre an sap customer probably not " he said bea declined to comment on its potential as an acquisition target as did the other companies mentioned in this article management of the smaller companies are also willing to sell said mr daly because they generally are unhappily beholden to a few large institutional investors regulatory costs under the sarbanes oxley act are disproportionately high for smaller companies and those costs can take a big bite out of relatively small bottom lines he said security software companies will be targeted mr daly said because that is one of the leading software lines that companies continue to spend more money on he cited ibms deal last year for internet security systems inc as an example "we would expect h p to follow suit security has to be a core part of the network " he said mr dalys top pick for a target here is mcafee inc maker of antivirus and network management software "theyve had such a tough run of it on the public market " he said "going private would certainly be an option for them as well they dont have any debt to speak of and they have something like &# billion cash on hand which fits the leveraged buyout model " online software companies such as omniture inc and data integration companies such as informatica corp are also potential targets though not necessarily this year mr thill said "we dont think theres anything near term for omniture or informatica but they certainly have some good assets that bigger companies would like to have " he said mr chowdhry cited informatica as a possible target openwave systems inc which writes programs to enable cellphone access to internet based services could also be a target he said as could sybase inc and lawson software inc smaller makers of enterprise software or the programs with which big companies run themselves "if they dont get acquired they will lose their business either acquire or be acquired thats the only way you can survive the next couple of years " said mr chowdhry lawson software an often discussed takeover target has a year to go to turn things around said mr goldmacher but then it could be for sale though lawson software declined to comment its chief executive has said the st paul minn companys strategy is to become the third largest enterprise software company in the world an alternative to oracle and sap mr goldmacher thinks the best strategic deals in software have been done "every transaction gets further and further down market for quality its now about consolidating market share rather than leveraging synergies and revenue " he said below the midsize companies analysts agreed are dozens of small cap software companies in security data integration and online applications that could be targeted
