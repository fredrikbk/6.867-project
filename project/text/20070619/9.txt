criticism that the company needs new leadership reflects the continuing fallout for technology companies now lagging red hot google inc in crucial areas mr semel years old is widely credited with helping to focus a foundering yahoo following his arrival and helping it ride the recovery in online advertising the sunnyvale calif company is one of the largest sellers of such ads and has played a key role in leading some name brand companies to increase their marketing on the web in recent years though yahoo has been eclipsed by the success of googles search advertising fueled growth faced criticism for a lack of management focus and fumbled some opportunities to capitalize on the latest high growth internet areas such as video and social networking a recent struggle to upgrade its online ad systems to more closely match googles approach suffered delays and yahoo lost executives and failed to fill crucial slots mr semel had also drawn fire for compensation that has been estimated by some at &# million which critics said wasnt warranted amid the companys declining revenue growth rates and share price in all he has garnered more than &# million from pay and stock option exercises since with mr semel becoming nonexecutive chairman yahoo co founder jerry yang was tapped to be ceo susan decker the companys year old former chief financial officer and head of a key operating unit became yahoos president mr semel said he resigned the ceo post voluntarily so yahoo would have "management thats thinking more long term and thats going to help drive the company into the future " now mr yang and ms decker face the task of steering yahoo to capitalize on a massive base of more than million users each month and to narrow the gap with google the companys strong relationships with advertisers and loyal consumers who use its popular services such as email and news will be an asset but there are signs of further challenges ahead as well ms decker said during a conference call with analysts yesterday that yahoos results for the second quarter would come in at the low to mid levels of its projections as slowness in its core graphical display advertising such as banner ads outweighs benefits from an ad systems upgrade it dubbed "panama " yahoo announced the changes after the p m market close its shares rose during regular hours before the ceo announcement then gained an additional &# or to &# in after hours trading the executive shake up could intensify speculation that yahoo is a candidate for acquisition or other combination yahoo in the past year has had conversations of varying intensity with microsoft corp time warner inc and ebay inc about combining at least some of their activities without reaching any deal people familiar with the matter say "jerry yang didnt sound like he wants to sell though that doesnt necessarily mean the company wont be sold " said morris mark of mark asset management a new york money management firm that owns yahoo shares "jerry yang said all the right things for someone who wants to run the business " media companies time warner and news corp recently have separately been considering possible deals to merge their internet activities with yahoo some of those familiar with the situation say though none of the discussions appear to be advanced mr yang told analysts during the conference call that his companys board believes yahoo should remain independent at this point "this is a time for new executive leadership with different skills and strengths " mr semel wrote in a letter to the board released by yahoo "we are again addressing challenges created by dramatic changes in the needs of audiences and advertisers " he said and acknowledged that "none of us is at all satisfied with the companys recent financial performance " but he said "yahoo continues to have tremendous fundamental strengths " mr yang wrote on yahoos web site that his joint vision with ms decker is "a yahoo that executes with speed clarity and discipline " in an interview he said "we see ourselves as having to change to keep pace with the environment but we also have to differentiate and get ahead of it " suggesting yahoo would be more aggressive in trying to pioneer services that would set it apart from rivals some critics have accused yahoo of doing little more than following the lead of google and taking few bold risks of its own exact details of how mr semel came to step down remain in dispute mr semel formally notified yahoo directors during an emergency board meeting conducted by telephone sunday said one person familiar with the matter some board members were surprised by the timing said this person adding that the board has discussed plans for mr semels succession at each meeting over the past year this person said mr yangs position wasnt designed to be only an interim role and that "hes going to be in that job longer than people think " another person familiar with events said directors conferred off and on informally several times last week before concluding friday that mr semel should give up the ceo post because yahoo was "not catching up with google " however this individual added that directors currently intend to conduct a search for a new chief executive ms decker "has the inside track as the internal candidate but there will be external candidates as well " mr semel said in an interview that he wasnt pushed out in any way by the board and that his departure resulted from continuing discussions with directors "no surprise on our end " mr semel said "we thought it was the right time to do it " he said indications that the panama project was yielding positive results played a role in the timing mr yang who co founded the company in has had varying levels of involvement with it since then say people familiar with the matter in an interview he said he isnt serving in merely an interim role as ceo it isnt clear whether a strong protest vote at last weeks annual meeting may have played a role in the management shakeup though mr semel denies that proxy advisory firms had recommended that investors withhold votes from members of yahoos compensation committee though yahoo didnt give the specific vote breakdown it said the full slate of directors was reelected with at least of the overall vote each that relatively high proportion of withheld votes suggests "shareholders want a new direction " said eric jackson a management consultant in naples fla who owns yahoo shares he led a grass roots drive to oppose the reelection of seven of yahoos directors yesterdays change in leadership "no doubt will lead to a shuffling at the board" as well mr jackson predicted since becoming yahoo ceo mr semel has reaped huge stock options packages even though the use of stock options has lost favor in silicon valley according to a study by compensation firm equilar inc mr semel has realized a total of nearly &# million in salary bonus and stock option exercises since including &# million in fiscal &# million in fiscal and &# million in fiscal in addition mr semel was awarded an additional &# million in stock options in the fiscal year according to equilars calculations some of that grant has already vested and mr semel will be able to exercise those options over the next three years but he may not be able to exercise the unvested options equilar says the executive changes harken back to the last big shakeup at yahoo in early at that time as the company was reeling from the dot com meltdown and numerous missteps such as a bungled opportunity to buy internet auctioneer ebay then ceo tim koogle left the company and yahoo said it would search for a new chief executive from outside the company the person it ended up selecting in april was mr semel the former co ceo of warner bros he was considered a surprise choice because while he was known as a top handler of hollywood talent he wasnt seen as the main operational guru running warner bros shortly after his arrival mr semel identified a few major opportunities such as overhauling its online ad sales efforts yahoo laid off staff and allocated more people to core businesses it shut down activities viewed as nonessential the payoff was enormous as online advertising recovered with a vengeance broadband usage proliferated and yahoo led the charge yahoos shares rose more than from mr semels arrival through the end of but have fallen since then revenue rose nearly ninefold from to its &# billion level last year but with googles rise it became clear that yahoo was lagging behind in the fast growing search and search advertising markets yahoo last year suffered from slumping shares slowing revenue growth staff defections and a delay in the crucial panama project aimed at boosting online ad sales executives began fretting that the internet companys top management wasnt prepared to take the strong medicine they felt was needed that dissent sprung into public view in november when the wall street journal published the so called peanut butter manifesto by a senior yahoo executive calling for big changes the company unveiled a reorganization in december and announced the departure of chief operating officer dan rosensweig and other executives recently yahoo has faced competition in its graphical display advertising business from sites such as social networking services that have lots of places for ads they can sell at prices far below yahoos traditional rates "it seems like its about the second stage of a five stage rejuvenation for yahoo " said jordan rohan an analyst at rbc capital markets corp in new york he said further stages would have to include overhauling its graphical display ad business amid the increased competition yesterdays moves mark a new chapter for mr yang until today his official title was "chief yahoo " mr yang recently became interim executive sponsor of yahoos technical staff with the departure of the companys longtime chief technology officer farzad nazem in response to a shareholder question at yahoos june shareholder meeting about whether mr yang might serve as permanent cto mr semel said "if jerry would think hard about being our cto id be very flattered and very honored " at the meeting mr jackson the shareholder activist asked mr semel whether he still had "the fire in the belly for this job " mr semel answered "absolutely i think yahoo has more opportunity going forward than perhaps any other time in its history " ms deckers appointment as yahoo president marks the former financial analysts continued rise the role will test her abilities in managing operations where some believe she needs more experience before she might ascend to the companys top post gregory
