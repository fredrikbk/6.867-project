justices harden wall street armor ipo decision gives brokers broad antitrust exemption in latest hit to plaintiffs washington the supreme court gave wall street a wide exception to antitrust laws throwing out an investor lawsuit against broker syndicates that allegedly colluded to drive up initial public offering prices during the so called internet bubble of the s the ruling marks another milestone in the courts recent movement to free markets from the cost and complications of plaintiff lawsuits the justices have aggressively interpreted congressional acts that limit shareholder lawsuits and in recent years have upended longstanding antitrust rules and narrowed the application of the landmark sherman antitrust act in a decision yesterday the court said the securities markets were a different animal than ordinary commerce and that practices that might seem to violate antitrust laws in other sectors were essential to wall street the court said the job of policing combinations among brokers rests with the securities and exchange commission whose regulators possess the expertise to distinguish permissible arrangements from illegal conspiracies the decision effectively shields the biggest names on wall street including credit suisse groups credit suisse securities goldman sachs group inc s goldman sachs &amp co and morgan stanley from a lawsuit that in the words of a lower court alleged "an epic wall street conspiracy" during the dot com frenzy of the late s while it doesnt protect those firms from shareholder suits brought under the securities laws it does inoculate them from the clayton acts potent remedy treble damages data are hard to come by but legal experts say challenges to wall street on antitrust grounds are rare and that the few that have come up havent succeeded but this case provides more certainty that antitrust challenges in the future will be more difficult for plaintiffs to bring yesterdays ruling follows decisions this term that found no antitrust violation in a predatory bidding case and tightened standards for plaintiffs filing antitrust suits the case related to several practices in the freewheeling market for ipos in the s the practices all gave preferential treatment to favored investors in doling out shares in hot ipos that often soared in price in "laddering " wall street underwriters agreed to offer stock to investors at an artificially low offering price those investors promised to buy more stock later at higher prices thus inflating the value of the shares after the ipo regulators outlawed that and other practices in after widespread scrutiny while bankers and brokers made millions of dollars through ipos in dot com ventures many investors were not so fortunate and in two class action lawsuits accused major investment banks and institutional investors of conspiring to inflate aftermarket stock prices for companies including amazon com inc ebay inc and priceline com inc the lawsuits alleged that underwriters and institutional investors who had first crack at the ipos made agreements for excessive commissions and provided misleading analyst recommendations and "tie in" requirements to increase prices on the securities aftermarket where most individual investors buy stocks defendants argued that congress implicitly exempted wall street from the sherman act by adopting securities laws overseen by the sec that regulatory system they argued differed from antitrust laws because beyond fostering competition to benefit consumers they also contemplate "efficiency " "capital formation" and "protection of investors " with the huge sums complex transactions and tremendous risks involved in the securities markets the industry argued that it must rely on the use of syndicates price agreements and other practices that could be illegal in other fields the sec had sided with the firms it regulates but the justice department advanced a compromise position urging the justices to allow trial courts to determine if the challenged conduct was "inextricably intertwined" with securities regulation or fell outside it and should be subject to antitrust suits the supreme court in an opinion by justice stephen breyer preferred to draw the bright line favored by the banks and the sec "financial experts including the securities regulators consider the general kind of joint underwriting activity at issue in this case including road shows and book building efforts essential to the successful marking of an ipo " justice breyer wrote justice clarence thomas dissented arguing that the securities laws were intended to supplement rather than replace other remedies such as antitrust laws justice anthony kennedy didnt participate in the case and as typical when justices disqualify themselves offered no explanation why some of the challenged practices can be manipulated to abuse the market justice breyer wrote but "only a fine complex detailed line separates" permissible activity from the forbidden allowing individual plaintiffs to sue "in dozens of different courts with different nonexpert judges and different nonexpert juries" would introduce uncertainty to the financial markets he wrote that risk could discourage underwriters from "a wide range of joint conduct that the securities law permits or encourages" but might nonetheless "lead to an antitrust lawsuit and the risk of treble damages " in fact much of the conduct at issue in the case is forbidden by the sec which since the hot ipo market of the late s has brought several enforcement actions against firms in connection with manipulating stock prices in the aftermarket beginning in the commission filed three complaints against morgan stanley goldman sachs and j p morgan chase &amp co alleging that each of the underwriters attempted to force customers who received shares of ipos to place additional orders once the stocks started trading in morgan stanley and goldman sachs each agreed to pay a &# million penalty to settle the allegations without admitting or denying wrongdoing while j p morgan paid &# million in to settle its case the decision marks another blow to the plaintiffs bar which has seen both congress and the court clip its wings last month the justices ruled that an allegation that companies refused to compete with each other each preserving a near monopoly wasnt enough to bring an antitrust lawsuit that ruling tossed out a suit claiming that the so called baby bells the telecom companies that succeeded the bell system had agreed to stay out of each others traditional regions one more major antitrust case remains to be decided before the court takes its summer recess at months end in it the justices are being asked to throw out a century old rule prohibiting manufacturers from imposing minimum price rules on retailers kara scannell contributed to this article
