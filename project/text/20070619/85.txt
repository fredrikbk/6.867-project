ousmane sembene father of african cinema ousmane sembene who died at age on june was often called the "father of african cinema " the senegalese provocateur was also one of the leading thinkers of his generation in africa and a man of militant conviction he both told and shaped the story of the continents difficult postcolonial era mr sembene never shunned taboo subjects in his writing and films both of which brought him international acclaim his first full length feature film "la noire de " "black girl" was made in six years after senegals independence from france it is about a senegalese maid working for french colonialists who dont think anything has really changed his last "moolaade" tells the story of a woman fighting to save her daughter from undergoing female circumcision still practiced in senegal born into a muslim family in ziguinchor the capital of senegals southern casamance region mr sembene was fiercely independent from the beginning he attended both quranic and french schools and claimed he was expelled from the latter for hitting his white teacher his formal education ended in adolescence at he left home to lay bricks in dakar after serving in the french army in niger during world war ii he returned to dakar to take part in a monthlong general workers strike in he migrated to marseille france his first novel "le docker noir " published in was inspired by a stint in that french port city as a dock worker like many intellectuals from the colonies mr sembene gravitated to marxism joining the confederation generale du travail general confederation of labor he opposed wars in indochina and korea and spoke out on behalf of other black immigrants in france when he returned to africa in mr sembene was already a noted author on a trip down the congo river in he said he realized cinema could be the lecole du soir or night school that africans could access more easily than literature in french only film he reasoned could capture the immensity of africas beauty and its problems he was the first sub saharan director to release a film and the first to film a feature entirely in an african language his debut short "borom sarret" follows the daily routine of a donkey cart driver in dakar who is trapped shuttling people who cant or wont pay the minute french language work features everyday characters a beggar a government official an islamic griot storyteller in his films mr sembene also criticized corruption in the new black led governments and what he considered an over reliance on foreign aid "xala " released in depicts a corrupt public official who uses his ill gotten gains to take a third wife on his wedding night the man discovers that he is impotent which in senegalese lore is caused by the "xala curse " he tries countless traditional cures to no avail a walking contradiction he seeks out soothsayers while trying to keep up the appearances of a europeanized african he speaks to his daughter only in french who responds in their native wolof as money passes into his briefcases and he shuttles around in a series of mercedes the official eventually learns that a beggar one of the many who move across the screen on their arms and stomachs cursed him with the xala for an unnamed offense committed years earlier other films are more blunt "ceddo" set in the th century depicts a senegalese king who tries to convert the ceddo or commoner class to islam the ceddo respond by kidnapping the kings daughter "camp de thiaroye" is loosely based on the true story of a massacre carried out by the french military just after world war ii of african soldiers in its ranks who wanted their severance pay popular with the public mr sembene made enemies in official circles the french ambassadors in moscow and dakar walked out during screenings of sembene films and "camp de thiaroye" was briefly banned in france likewise at home mr sembene had an antagonistic relationship with senegalese president leopold senghor one of the best known postcolonial leaders in west africa and a renowned poet and french educated intellectual in his own right though the government funded many sembene films it was eager to censor and critique ten scenes from "xala " which were an unmasked satire of the senghor regime had to be cut before the film was allowed to be released president senghor who relied on close ties with many muslim leaders to keep the country stable banned "ceddo" outright in senegal mr sembene seemed to revel in the controversy his work provoked the shah of iran supposedly asked the filmmaker to screen "ceddo" in iran he declined when ayatollah khomeini came to power it was mr sembene who offered the film and the iranian leader who refused it the filmmaker wasnt an easy man thierry lenouvel co producer of his last film "moolaade " remembers him as brusque and difficult "a militant but also a cinematographer " david murphy who wrote "sembene imagining alternatives in film and fiction" and interviewed him several times in recent years said "he really did see himself as a man of the people " while expats and most government officials have chauffeurs in dakar mr murphy noted "sembene would travel into central dakar on the bus from his neighborhood of yoff he did live by certain ideals and wasnt won over by beauty or wealth " even as his fellow intellectuals retired in europe mr sembene stayed in yoff an impoverished coastal suburb of dakar where he funded libraries and started schools later in life he spoke little about marxism and politics insisting he was merely an artist but he gave no sign he had abandoned his old beliefs mr sembenes greatest contribution remains his "night school of film " yet he was never satisfied with how little he was able to screen his films in rural africa though dvds have now given his work a second life the lack of theaters and at times political openness prevented him from reaching a wide audience at home his films are easier to find in europe than in africa "faat kine" and "moolaade " the first two films in his planned trilogy based on "everyday heroism" in africa depict women who cope with their daily lives one in the city and one in a village "these are the heroes to whom no country no nation gives any medals " mr sembene told his biographer samba gadjigo the third film to be called "the brotherhood of rats " was to have tackled corruption mr lenouvel says it wont be made "only sembene could make that film with his personality and his authority over the politics only he would be capable of surmounting all of the complications of the topic frankly no other cinematographer would be capable of doing that " ms dickinson is a robert l bartley fellow at the journals editorial page based in brussels
