lethal trade as guns flood gaza strip palestinian citizens stock up fears rise prices fall and dealers proliferate the tunnels of rafah gaza city gaza strip for the first time in his years almost everyone mustafa ibrahim knows neighbors shopkeepers even family members owns a firearm "guns are like cellphones here now " says mr ibrahim a field worker for a gaza human rights group in january alone his organization tallied gaza gun deaths more than double the total for all of "if you can afford a mobile you can probably afford a kalashnikov " he says cheap weapons have flooded the territory in the past two years bought not only by militia fighters but also by merchants schoolteachers and other civilians last week some of this arsenal was put to deadly use as fighters from the islamist group hamas wrested control of gaza from forces loyal to the largely secular fatah movement the clashes in densely populated residential streets left an estimated dead and more than wounded a combustive mix of factors feeds the demand for firearms internecine fighting and fear of a security vacuum have heightened anxiety among ordinary palestinians in a territory where of the population relies on food aid economic desperation has created a burgeoning group of arms dealers a porous border between gaza and egypt provides a conduit for more weapons fueling further insecurity and demand the recent arms flow dramatically outstrips anything seen here since the arab israeli war israeli officials say shin bet israels state security agency says about assault rifles poured into the strip during and alone the influx is equivalent per capita to assault rifles entering new york city gazas million palestinians crowd into an area about the size of wichita kan palestinian officials and gun dealers in gaza most of whom declined to speak for attribution confirm the proliferation gaza weapons dealers believe the israeli assault rifle estimate may be conservative israels figures also dont include weapons shipments to fatah within the past year that were coordinated by the u s and israel in addition thousands of handguns are also entering the territory chinese made semiautomatics are the cheapest and most available with reproductions of famous american names such as caliber colt semiautomatic handguns starting at about &# many of these guns bear the counterfeit stamp "made in usa" alongside the logo of norinco a chinese state owned conglomerate with significant interests in arms production "when my father used to bring guns into gaza most people had never seen them before " recalls a member of gazas dogmush family a powerful clan that long dominated the local arms trade he spoke on the condition that only his last name be used "now everyone is bringing in guns " as new vendors and their wares proliferated street prices plummeted a standard kalashnikov style assault rifle that sold for about &# in gaza a little more than two years ago now sells for about &# dealers say so merchants who once had a lock on this market now smuggle and sell even more weapons to maintain their revenues some worry that gaza could be a bellwether in a region roiling with sectarian factional and geopolitical tensions guns are also emerging as a household necessity in parts of southern and western iraq in sections of the palestinian west bank and even jordan there are early signs of similar trends emerging say security officials and human rights groups that monitor weapons and arms dealers in lebanon a heavily armed group sympathetic to al qaeda has killed dozens of lebanese soldiers in a weeks long standoff thanks in part to an ample supply of arms "everybody is getting ready to fight " a senior israeli security official says "no matter how much you have everyone wants more " new sources of supply and trafficking routes are opening to meet middle east demand sudan is flooded with weapons after years of conflict even as the united nations struggles to enforce a security council arms embargo to prevent weapons from flowing into the african countrys darfur region large quantities of generally inexpensive guns are coming out of sudan according to current and former israeli intelligence officials and some top arms dealers who say they are trading in these weapons but unlike in gaza other middle east flashpoints have seen arms prices rise sharply as pent up fears lead to higher demand but antitrafficking controls remain relatively intact in the west bank lebanese and jordanian streets prices have roughly doubled in the past two to three years according salesmen militia leaders who buy large quantities of arms and munitions current and former intelligence and police officials and activists who track proliferation in the wake of last weeks bloody takeover of the gaza strip by hamas mr ibrahim the human rights worker says dramatic action is needed not only to stem the flow of guns but to deal with arms already on the streets hamas must begin "collecting the illegal weapons which have spread in the gaza strip " he says and immediately ban people from carrying arms in public there were reports from gaza early this week that efforts to disarm some groups were already leading to more bloodshed and with israel the u s and other nations saying they will shun hamas in gaza throwing their support behind an emergency government formed over the weekend by fatah leaders in the west bank it appeared gazas troubles would spiral for many years gazas gun bazaar was more constrained through much of the s and s the late palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat worked to keep weapons in the hands of those who were loyal to him and palestinians mostly aimed what firepower they did have at israel israels control over gazas borders also helped stem large scale arms trafficking weapons were smuggled in by a few well connected families arms were rarely seen in the streets except during clashes with the israeli military and the occasional parade by one of gazas many armed factions under a law passed by the palestinian legislative council in owning carrying and selling firearms was supposed to be illegal for nearly everyone punishable by jail terms and fines mr arafats death in left a power vacuum among the palestinians raising tensions the weapons binge started in september say gaza residents and arms dealers when israel withdrew its permanently based soldiers and settler communities from territory it had occupied since as part of the withdrawal israel relinquished its control over gazas southern border with egypt that left the border overseen by the palestinian authority the quasigovernment of the palestinians within hours stockpiles of assault rifles ammunition and explosives amassed for years in the egyptian sinai desert started moving across the border into gaza say senior israeli security officials and dealers here as ordinary gazans were suddenly free to move into egypt virtually anything left in the sinai that would fire a bullet came into the strip arms dealers say "these were all the leftovers they were the worst weapons " says mr dogmush sitting on a plastic lawn chair in his dusty gaza city courtyard surrounded by largely empty high rises and goats scraping for remaining blades of grass following extraordinary pressure from the israeli government the palestinian authority sealed the border after a week beefed up border security pushed the trafficking underground literally the town of rafah straddles the border a foot high concrete wall dividing the city and many of its families into gaza and egyptian sections traffickers have long burrowed tunnels below rafah and these arms pipelines were once largely controlled by the dogmush family and two other powerful gaza clans mr dogmush acknowledged in the past few years however enterprising free lancers built more tunnels many of them are bored by small machines and are just large enough to pull through strings of weapons much of the supply comes from the growing sudan connection say mr dogmush and other dealers who are trading in these weapons a competitor of mr dogmush confirms his trades growing competition showing off russian assault rifles and chinese made mm rocket launchers that entered gaza through rafahs tunnels he says his margins are so thin that he must now move at least pieces of weaponry just to cover his tunneling expenses israel has publicly pondered responding to the smuggling with everything from an international force to a giant moat israeli officials have repeatedly called on egypt to do more to stem the flow egyptian officials say they have been pressing out of concern over chaos on the border and over the growing power of hamas which is an offshoot of the banned egyptian muslim brotherhood but egyptian officials say the hard to detect tunnels make crackdowns difficult "were not talking about the holland tunnel " says a senior egyptian official in cairo who spoke on condition of anonymity meanwhile gaza has also been armed by more formal channels following the stunning victory of hamas in january palestinian elections the groups fighters in gaza began engaging in increasingly violent battles with those loyal to the fatah movement founded by mr arafat it is now headed by mahmoud abbas the separately elected palestinian president mr abbas turned to the u s for help in his struggle against the islamists american and israeli officials have acknowledged they helped coordinate at least two major shipments of arms and munitions to fatah as fighting raged between the factions in gazas streets they have refused to discuss specifics now in the wake of last weeks fighting many of fatahs guns in gaza are likely in the hands of hamas but what concerned mr ibrahim and many other residents was not only guns in the hands of militias but also that weapons on the streets would beget more weapons ordinary people he says "started getting weapons to defend themselves " the thirst for weapons is also apparent miles away in the west bank although the west bank has not witnessed the all out factional fighting of gaza rising tensions between hamas and fatah have helped to drive up the appetite for arms and prices says yousef ozreal commander of the palestinian authoritys civil police in the nablus region the price of decent m has gone from about &# to &# in the west bank says madhi abu ghazali a regional commander of the al aqsa martyrs brigade the militia of the fatah movement prices are also being bolstered by widespread buying among the powerful clans of the west bank as growing instability and chaos has palestinians looking inward for a sense of security say palestinian and israeli security officials palestinian officials and those actively involved in the weapons trade also say most of nabluss thousands of merchants have recently purchased weapons in order to protect their livelihoods in gaza city the palestinian independent commission for citizens rights which employs mr ibrahim as a field investigator wants to move beyond simply documenting the misuse of weapons which is one of its major duties the group hopes to fund a study of gaza arms proliferation then devise and push legislation to address it the plans were up in the air after last weeks armed takeover by hamas mr ibrahim the father of four girls and three boys has seen the impact on his own street "the biggest problem is the weapons come out first in any dispute " he says "now people talk through the barrel of a gun " earlier this year his work followed him home moments after one of his daughters stepped in from the balcony of his tel el hawa flat in gaza city stray gunfire ripped in behind her and into the living room since then mr ibrahim says his children live in terror
