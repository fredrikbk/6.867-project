sort of earnings that shareholders expected however and with its senior leadership preoccupied with integrating its numerous supply purchases into a single entity home depots core business of selling lots of paint and pipe fittings to tinkering homeowners was allowed to languish efforts to trim costs by bringing in more part time workers drove off many of the former electricians and carpenters who once patrolled its aisles service suffered as a result and many of its once loyal customers were driven directly into the arms of rival retailer lowes that upset shareholders helping to speed mr nardellis exit new ceo frank blake made it clear that his priority would be to restore the companys lost customer service luster and that the supply business would follow its architect out the door home depot shares moved higher on the news though only slightly as markets appeared to have baked in expectations for the units sale and the price wasnt as rich as some had hoped when mr blake said the company was considering strategic alternatives for the supply arm earlier this year wall street envisioned it pulling in about &# billion but the housing market has kept fading and as a result

building permits rose in a suggestion that builders are starting to feel better about future projects richard f moody the chief economist at mission residential said the report was "eerily calm " adding that given the decline in confidence "an anemic spring selling season mounting foreclosures swollen inventories and the recent spike in mortgage rates there is little doubt that the housing market is in for more pain " economists at nomura securities think the report shows that home construction will remain a drag on growth through the summer and that the "sharp jump in mortgage rates in recent weeks is likely to make this slump longer deeper and more painful for builders and lenders " add to that list perhaps home improvement retailers after a weak start stocks rise stock prices

deal best buy earnings decline best buy the nations largest electronics retailer said earnings dropped in its first quarter that wasnt quite the bottom line wall street had been hoping for and the numbers demonstrate how electronics retailers are locked in a brutal struggle for market share especially on such popular items as flat panel tvs and laptop computers to be certain best buy has been
