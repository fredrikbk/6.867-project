politics &amp economics long race forces ad ingenuity candidates use cheaper web means to push campaigns washington in the entire campaign the parties and presidential candidates combined spent roughly &# for ads on political blogs during one week last month one presidential candidate alone democrat john edwards spent nearly the same amount on more than liberal blogs asking people to sign an online petition in opposition to the iraq war such spending isnt an anomaly an unusually early start to what has become an unusually competitive presidential race has prompted campaign veterans to look to the internet for new relatively inexpensive ways to reach potential supporters and to raise funds while the amount of money the campaigns are collectively expected to spend online this year wont likely amount to more than a rounding error compared to the hundreds of millions expected to be spent on broadcast ads it marks the beginning of a broader shift away from candidates reliance on traditional media campaigns are following the same pattern with online advertising as they have in the past using traditional media begin by targeting the most active members of the partys base and shift later to more general ads targeting the broader electorate in the first quarter the presidential candidates spent collectively an estimated &# million on internet sites and fund raising including &# on blog ads and collected about &# million online campaign finance reports show web ads have "proven to be a mechanism that allows candidates to target voters in the early primary stage "

it spends to raise money online according to rebecca donatelli a consultant directing the online fund raising strategy for the arizona senator months before many americans begin focusing in earnest on the presidential race candidates are trying to capture the support of the most energized of their partys base all of the candidates now have official campaign web sites and theyre taking advantage of a plethora of free internet services from posting profiles on myspace and facebook to adding videos on youtube and other video sharing sites to promote themselves advertising on internet sites that are popular with activists is another way to get the attention of highly engaged supporters campaign officials say "the internet is such an incredibly fragmented place but in blogs you still have this communal thing going on you can see the faces of everyone else in the firelight " says henry copeland founder of blogads an advertising service that places ads on many of the top read political sports and gossip blogs "theres the sense that there really is a mass of people here you can motivate as a mass instead of just individuals " another major difference between the way candidates are using television ads and internet advertisements is what the campaigns hope to get from their spending former massachusetts gov mitt romney a republican and new mexico gov bill richardson a democrat are among the candidates to have run television ads so far in early primary states those have been mostly biographical spots designed to introduce and define the candidates internet ads by those same candidates however have focused on convincing potential supporters to sign up for email updates and fund raising solicitations on their official web sites "theyre advertising to reach early supporters so they can get email addresses so they can ask them for money and to volunteer there are no candidates using online advertising for really anything other than email acquisition " says michael bassik internet advertising consultant at mhsc partners inc a democratic political consulting firm another increasingly popular form of online political advertising is text ads on search engines mainly google most of the campaigns are now running ads on google that appear when a user searches a particular word mr mccains campaign has been particularly aggressive on the search site running text ads

a "couple hundred" words according to mindy finn director of online strategy for the romney campaign the words used by the campaign change every day based on what sort of response they see and the number of people who click through to the romney web site she says theyve used words like "olympics" mr romney is credited with saving the salt lake city winter games "health care" while governor he pushed through an ambitious health insurance plan in massachusetts and "cutting spending " to help drive traffic to the site she says illinois sen barack obamas campaign for the democratic nomination
