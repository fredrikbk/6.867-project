how chapter can help a ceo top executives of companies that crash into bankruptcy arent always stigmatized by the collapse for some it can be a career enhancing opportunity experts say bankruptcy reorganizations frequently mean layoffs for rank and file workers and they can imperil the jobs of top executives as well a recent academic study suggests for example that ceos who bail out before a business crashes fare better in the labor market than those who stay until the bankruptcy occurs but corporate turnaround experts say executives who can pull off a successful restructuring often gain long term career benefits by sticking with a troubled company the accomplishment can also serve to erase the stain of past executive blunders "to oversee a restructuring is a highly prized commodity " said jeffry davis a bankruptcy lawyer and member at the law firm mintz levin "if i were an executive id like to have a turnaround on my resume " executives often fear theyll be stigmatized by a corporate bankruptcy filing "almost every executive comes to me with a woe is me attitude " said william brandt president and chief executive of development specialists inc a turnaround advisory firm "i administer a swift kick to the back of their rump and tell them its the end of the world or the start of a new galaxy " mr brandt said k j tjon managing director at turnaround firm alvarez &amp marsal in miami knows firsthand how a restructuring can boost a career while working as chief financial officer of winstar communications inc s international division ms tjon found herself in the middle of a bankruptcy proceeding when the telecom filed for chapter protection in rather than flee to a new company ms tjon decided to stay with winstar and she later piloted segments of the companys reorganization "instead of becoming part of a growing company and building an international finance group as i had expected i ended up divesting assets world wide " she said winstar was sold to idt corp for about &# million in late saving the company from piecemeal liquidation ms tjon was soon after approached by a private equity group to become financial chief at always on inc a troubled information technology company that was part of the groups portfolio although always on continued to falter she was promoted to chief executive when she helped close the sale of the underperforming company she later joined alvarez &amp marsal as a turnaround consultant "any time there is a crisis or organizational change there is also an opportunity for people to blossom " said ms tjon who is directing the breakup of a major internet company "people have gone through hard times and become better executives " ms tjon and mr davis of mintz levin said they have coached countless ceos who have successfully led restructurings and benefited tremendously from the experience "when we go to a company its not very productive to sit there and start blaming people for things that may or may not have happened " said ms tjon "i have worked with numerous executives who used their experience at a troubled company to take on more responsibility learn new skills and then go on to bigger and better things " when northwest airlines corp landed in bankruptcy court in its chief executive douglas steenland led the company through a tumultuous month reorganization in which employees wages were slashed and the airlines operating costs were cut by &# billion the newly restructured airline which emerged successfully from bankruptcy in may awarded mr steenland a staggering &# million bonus package last month the northwest board voted to keep mr steenland as a member mr brandt of development specialists said financial downturns are useful for weeding out mediocre executives "at some point everyone makes stupid mistakes " mr brandt said "but if they turn around and handle the bankruptcy well theyll add to their set of skills through the baptism by fire making themselves more valuable " experts say a significant portion of bankruptcy reorganizations fail and many turnaround consultants recommend removal of executives who oversaw the companys descent into bankruptcy but despite the high probability of failure a growing number of executives choose to stay with their companies a recent study by a group of university researchers found that when a large group of texas banks failed in the mid s of the executives decided to lead the businesses through a restructuring while only decided to jump ship but the study by matthew semadeni of indiana university albert cannella of arizona state and donald fraser and d scott lee of texas a&amp m found that many bank executives who attempted a turnaround were publicly stigmatized by the companys failure more than half of the executives who stayed with the foundering company were later demoted and later had to change cities to find a new job the study found "an officer that hung around and waited until the firm collapsed was more likely to end up in inferior position they had to go from a senior to a junior position just to get a job " said mr lee one of the studys authors a similar study by harvard business professor stuart gilson found that executives are more likely to salvage their careers if they leave before the public knows about the companys problems "somebody may be responsible for the bankruptcy but if they leave prior to the filings its more difficult to remember they were the ones responsible " mr gilson said "accusations are much harder to make after the case and more difficult for people to keep in memory " neither study tracked whether the stigmatized executives involved had completed a successful restructuring
