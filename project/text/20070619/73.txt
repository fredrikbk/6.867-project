moving the market world stock markets korea stock rally shows a different picture kospi soars while samsung hyundai drag as economy gets new drivers seoul south korea for years investors in the south korean stock market looked at shares of its biggest companies such as samsung electronics and hyundai motor to get a feel for the whole samsung has long been the biggest stock and accounted for almost a quarter of the market capitalization of the korean stock market in but this year things are different the benchmark korean stock index called the kospi is up so far after the latest rally yesterday and some analysts are so optimistic that they are forecasting growth for the entire year meanwhile samsungs shares are down hurt by price and profit pressure in its chip business and slow recoveries from downturns in other key businesses like cellphones it now represents about of the korean market yesterday the kospi index vaulted over the milestone closing up or points at a record the kospi spent just trading sessions in the s analysts are watching for signs of overheating for example small investors are buying heavily using borrowed money the divergence of samsung and the overall korean market stems from broad structural changes in the country the biggest is a change in where korean companies are finding growth it is no longer just the u s and europe markets where samsung hyundai and other big exporters have long focused on instead it is in places like china central asia and the middle east koreas biggest profit gainers now are old guard industries like steel construction and shipbuilding all of which are doing huge business in the emerging markets the broader trend is that global economic growth is less tied to the u s a phenomenon that has been called "decoupling " and korean companies particularly manufacturers are threading their way through the competitive pressures created by larger neighbors japan and china "tech and auto used to be the driver of korean exports and the driver of the stock market " says terence lim economist for goldman sachs in seoul "but the global economy has become more balanced " in particular he says emerging economies that korea is benefiting from tend to spend a lot more on old economy products such as steel and ships while the kospi has swung wildly in the past the korean market is much larger now with total value nearing &# trillion making its current rise more noteworthy in the past year and a half an analysis by samsung securities found the market value of companies in industrials materials and nonbanking finance sectors has doubled while the tech sector fell and auto sector shaped by the decoupling trend first quarter corporate results in korea were better than expected and many stock analysts spent late april and may revising upward their earnings forecasts for the year in addition to strong exports and signs that capital spending and consumer confidence are picking up korean stocks are benefiting from new players in the market korean individual investors while foreign investors had long been the dominant players in this market many korean consumers are dabbling in stocks for the first time following the arrival of equity based retirement accounts two years ago "its a structural change and a key driver right now " says namuh rhee managing director at merrill lynch in seoul "the stock market gives better returns than property and bank deposits " where koreans have traditionally kept most of their money many of these consumers are buying shares that havent been as well known to foreign investors such as utilities food and beverage companies their rising market value is a key ingredient in the doubling of the overall korean market cap and another reason samsungs influence in the market has diminished the trend is most clear in mutual fund investment where individuals now account for of monthly purchases up from in the amount of money in stock focused mutual funds in korea now exceeds &# billion up from &# billion in according to morgan stanley as a result of the growing base of domestic investors the korean market has turned less volatile between and the kospi swung wildly three times losing nearly of its value in one dramatic plunge "we havent had to fasten our seat belts and put on our crash helmets as frequently in the last two years as we did in the years that proceeded " says henry seggerman president of international investment advisers a new york based hedge fund that focuses on korea to be sure some analysts are watching out for warning signs that the korean market wont be able to sustain its rise one indicator that is drawing a lot of interest is the level of credit use by consumers in the stock market the credit line for brokerages to korean consumers for investments has grown to &# billion now up from &# billion early this year says chanik park analyst at morgan stanley in seoul "this is a potential source of volatility in the market " he says noting that such credit usually must be repaid within three to six months however the bulls are targeting the kospi to surge past the level over the next six months samsung securities earlier this month lifted its year end target to and hyundai securities put its target at "it isnt a bubble " says rhoo yong seok strategist at hyundai securities "we expect the kospi to rise until the end of
