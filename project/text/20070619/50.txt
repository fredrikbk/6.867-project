ge pearson on defensive a bid for dow jones would be designed to thwart murdoch theres an old saying among investment bankers that most deals are done out of weakness rather than strength a new set of potential buyers has emerged for dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal but unlike rupert murdoch whose news corp attacked first by offering &# billion for dow jones these companies appear to be on the defensive talks continued yesterday between general electric co and pearson plc for dow jones that was even as the bancroft family which controls dow jones grappled with how to balance a desire to protect the newspapers editorial independence with the attractiveness of mr murdochs &# a share offer for the company under the ge pearson scenario the wall street journal pearsons financial times and ges cnbc business news network would be combined into a joint venture whose shares wont be traded publicly the companies are trying to construct a deal that values dow jones at or above mr murdochs offer but each of the companies is acting at least in part to block mr murdochs acquisition of dow jones pearson is worried that mr murdoch could strengthen the journals global operations potentially cutting into the financial times strong position in europe for the ft if mr murdoch buys the journal "you have literally got a piranha in the same swimming pool " says simon wallis an analyst at collins stewart in london the risk to ge is that mr murdoch would use the journals brand name to launch a fox business channel that could damage its lucrative cnbc franchise and at least some members of the bancroft family who are against a sale to mr murdoch see ge and pearson as white knights though others are skeptical a person familiar with the discussions said there was "a lot of work going on" between ge and pearson but they werent certain they could come up with a structure that would be able to top the offer from news corp while the bancroft family has indicated it would take a lower price from a buyer it felt would protect the journals editorial independence both ge and pearson recognize that in order to beat out news corp they would need to top or at least come close to mr murdochs offer this person said but a ge pearson deal still wont protect the worlds two best known business newspapers from the harsh reality of weak profits sluggish advertising and growing competition from other news sources that could lead to significant cost cutting to make the deal work at anything close to &# a share analysts estimate the ft group cnbc and dow jones would need to generate as much as &# million a year in savings for pearson to make an return on its investment that is a large sum relative to dow joness total costs which last year were &# billion bancroft family members who havent been briefed on the ge pearson talks were concerned that ge and pearson might cut staff and shut the journals international editions people familiar with the matter said "it wouldnt be optimal at all " one bancroft said "the fact that murdoch wants to commit to dumping capital into the business after a sale is a good thing " other family members said a ge pearson deal sounded like a good fit if ge and pearson were to make a formal approach the family would ask them to commit to preserve dow joness editorial integrity just as it has done with news corp meanwhile the family and its advisers were making progress on honing the proposal on editorial safeguards to send to news corp the advantages of the joint venture company would be a near monopoly on the lucrative business of english language executive recruitment ads it could also end the costly battle pearson and dow jones have been waging for years to fight each other in their respective home markets in the u k and europe the ft is far ahead of the wall street journal europe with a circulation of copies a day compared with the journals in the u s the journal dwarfs the financial times the wall street journals print circulation is million copies a day and the fts is sharing printing plants and distribution networks in europe and the u s could save both papers money there are significant cost savings in the proposed ge pearson tie up that go well beyond the savings explored by pearson and dow jones several years ago in discussions between the two on a joint operating agreement that would have combined operations in europe and asia those discussions involved folding wall street journal content into the financial times in europe and folding the financial times into the wall street journal in asia both sides would have had to agree to "lower the flag" in those respective regions according to a person familiar with the discussions the talks broke down this person said because both sides were ambivalent about giving up their brand power and ceding control to a rival in addition the cost savings less than &# million werent sufficient to override those concerns the easiest way to meet the cost savings goals would be for the newspapers to cut their biggest expense journalists the wall street journal has roughly reporters and editors and about of them work outside the u s while the financial times has journalists the majority of whom are in the united kingdom while it is unlikely the two newspapers would be combined they could share some stories allowing the ft to cut its staff in the u s and the journal to cut back in europe even as pearson and ge work to match mr murdochs bid pearson chief executive marjorie scardino faces a difficult balancing act shareholders are pressuring the company to focus on its most successful business textbook publishing and not get deeper into newspapers the ft has only become profitable in the past two years after a long period of losses while the journal has posted advertising declines in recent months pearson also owns penguin books which has stabilized after recent declines dow jones also owns barrons dow jones newswires and factiva "i think most shareholders probably would have preferred a decision by marjorie scardino to concentrate on what they are good at which is education and dispose of some marginal interests " says ted scott a portfolio manager at f&amp c asset management plc which owns gbp million &# million in pearson shares according to filings "it may come as a bit of a surprise that they may want to defend their investment in the ft " if she goes ahead with a bid and fails that poses risks for mrs scardino a former journalist from texas who was knighted by queen elizabeth ii in private equity firms which covet pearson because the company could easily be broken up and sold off would likely try to take advantage of the turmoil jason singer in london and matthew karnitschnig and kathryn
