new ways to monitor your energy use utilities test prepaid smart cards and high tech meters to help consumers keep tabs on cost and consumption peter and suzanne price havent paid a monthly electricity bill since june but not because theyre living off the grid theyre participating in a pilot program in sacramento calif that lets them buy electricity on a prepaid basis the program is part of a growing trend in which u s utilities are experimenting with pay as you go service that is supposed to encourage energy conservation but also has raised fears about abrupt service shut offs mr price a retired computer programmer drops by the office of his local utility the sacramento municipal utility district every six to eight weeks and pays enough to cover a month or two of service the credit is loaded on a smart card that he uses to download information into his home electric meter the couple keeps track of the credit balance with the help of a small electronic display located in the kitchen which talks to the meter on a recent june morning mr price pushed buttons to see what the display box could tell him about his energy use it said his square foot stucco home was using nine cents of electricity an hour the home built in had used &# of power so far that day &# a day earlier and &# the prior month most importantly it said he had enough credit remaining for about days of use "it tells you things you couldnt have known before " mr price says of the box a half dozen utilities are trying prepaid programs now but that could accelerate quickly if texas utility regulators approve rules this summer allowing it experimentation with prepaid service meters is part of a broader trend that is changing the electric meter from a dumb recorder of kilowatt hours consumed into a conservation tool capable of helping people monitor their use and which will allow utilities to talk directly to customers billions of dollars are being spent by utilities to install advanced meters that track the amount of energy consumed at different times of the day a capability that is expected to lead to rate plans that include higher prices when wholesale energy costs are higher and cheaper prices at times of slack demand but its also possible that utilities trying to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in response to looming global warming legislation could use the meters to encourage conservation if more people paid for electricity in advance like they do for gasoline they might want to make it stretch further salt river project a phoenix utility with the largest prepaid program in the u s said it has observed a conservation effect among its prepaid customers with a reduction in average bills its not due to disconnections says customer service analyst jennie king "because most prepaid customers never suffer disconnections " in the next few years some experts expect prepaid electric service to become a standard feature of u s utilities as it already is in the u k china and south africa some customers however are wary that the prepaid service could leave them in a lurch if they are late on their bills steven smalley another participant in the sacramento program and a retired employee of the states foster care system says his electricity was cut off after he lost track of his account balance "now i worry about being shut off " he says "it was so much easier to just write a check once a month " mr smalley says he doesnt like going to the utility office to reload his smart card a utility manager said he agrees that broader deployment hinges on giving consumers a way to deposit money in their accounts via telephone or the internet options not currently available under the tiny pilot program the maker of the meter used by the sacramento municipal utility district ampy technology inc of peterborough england is working on a meter that will have the two way communication capability needed for remote payments such as over the internet a company spokeswoman said its not far off one reason prepaid service is gaining support among utilities is because it can help relieve an accounts receivable problem when customers consume more energy than they can afford with prepaid service the customer is in control and doesnt face a monthly surprise when the bill arrives if an account zeroes out the flow of electricity stops most utilities keep power flowing on nights and weekends but people usually arent allowed to get more than a couple of days behind before service shuts off experts say people quickly learn to ration their use just as people learn to eliminate unnecessary car trips when gasoline is expensive this "tough love" approach can be good for consumers in some cases for the first time it gives many consumers a tool that allows them to see what electricity costs as its being consumed and utilities typically eliminate an array of annoying fees for those on prepaid service there usually are no security deposits late fees disconnection fees or reconnection fees "we have some customers who owe us &# or more " says hugh fowler a customer service manager at the sacramento district "but none of our prepaid customers is behind " salt river project says it has of its metered customers on prepaid service it initially offered the program to customers who were having trouble paying their bills as an alternative to being shut off customers were given the option of prepaid service and the standard security deposit of &# was waived now some people are asking for prepaid meters because they can buy electricity in increments as small as &# or &# at some kiosks in the phoenix area "we think this gives people their dignity back " says ms king "it gives them more control over their use and payment than they ever had before " so far its mostly municipal utilities that are offering prepaid service in part because they do not need approval from state utility commissions to bypass the usual rules governing disconnections customer owned utilities typically report to local elected officials not state utility commissions the texas public utility commission is creating rules for prepaid service exposing differences about what consumer protections should apply many states restrict shut offs for nonpayment for example during periods of extreme heat or cold thus utility regulators will need to decide whether prepaid customers should retain that protection the commission is expected to take up the issue in late july txu corp a dallas based utility thinks power sellers should be allowed to shut off service at night provided a payment kiosk is within five miles of a customers home and keep it off until a prepaid account has &# or more some competitors think thats too harsh watching the meter some of the advantages of prepaid electricity meters for consumers helps you keep better tabs on energy use eliminates unpleasant surprises like big monthly bills puts an end to big security deposits late fees some disadvantages abrupt shut off of power if your prepayments run out many programs require you to make payment in person to reload smart card
