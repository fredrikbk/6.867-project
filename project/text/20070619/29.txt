business technology linux shoots for big league of servers low cost operating system pushes into microsoft sun strongholds linux has had a great run but to keep the growth the upstart operating system needs to please more people like jim walsh mr walsh chief information officer for the tyco international ltd unit earth tech wanted to do more than the simple chores that are most often handled by linux he decided to shift one of the companys most crucial pieces of software an oracle corp enterprise resource planning system off sun microsystems inc servers and its solaris operating system earth tech an engineering and consulting company specializing in water environmental cleanup transportation and facilities industries opted to run the software on dell inc servers running linux while mr walsh declined to reveal dollar figures he estimated that lower hardware and maintenance costs associated with the move reduced the cost to run his so called enterprise resource or erp systems by half money earth tech is using for a second data center to act as a back up if operations at its first center are interrupted "i have run solaris for years i like sun " mr walsh says he adds "linux is significantly more cost efficient " such moves are still the exception not the rule since the s linux which comes in free versions and is also sold by companies such as red hat inc and novell inc has been an important force in holding down computing costs one reason is that the software runs on inexpensive servers that use chip technology that evolved from personal computers those x machines a designation for the microprocessor design popularized by intel corp and advanced micro devices inc have continued to deliver improvements in price and performance the combination of those systems and linux are particularly suited for jobs such as serving up web pages and running email systems but other kinds of servers and operating systems particularly the unix system offered by many computer makers have advantages in handling some big computing jobs such as running databases and erp systems many hardware and software companies are trying to change that picture but it wont be easy linux is "in a little bit of a transition " says matt eastwood an analyst at the market research firm idc he adds that linux needs to "become more of a central component of the overall data center strategy and that is a hard thing to do " for one thing mr eastwood notes microsoft corp is determined to push its windows operating system into the same fields though linux based servers now account for of server revenue up from just in windows based servers account for three times the revenue of linux servers idc estimates and for the first time this decade windows hardware grew at a slightly faster pace in the first quarter up to &# billion while revenue from linux based servers grew to &# billion "in the enterprise its not enough just to be a cheap operating system " says bill hilf general manager platform strategy for microsoft he adds "you need to have applications for it and it needs to be highly supported " sun meanwhile is also determined to make its solaris software a variant of unix that it has long sold on machines that use its sparc chips a potent rival to linux on x systems the computer maker for example offers free downloads of solaris whose underlying programming instructions can be studied and enhanced under a similar "open source" scheme as linux "the world is continuing to shift toward open source technologies and operating systems and sun has embraced that movement toward community driven development its a key reason we released solaris into open source " marc hamilton vice president of solaris marketing said in a statement but other big server makers are pushing linux aggressively some of them including international business machines corp and hewlett packard co also offer the operating system on high end hardware as well as x servers that is also a focus of intel which is working with h p and others to popularize its itanium chip line for running heavy duty computing jobs along with linux h p is pushing services and support to help customers use linux to run open source database software such as mysql in addition to application server software from companies such as jboss a unit of red hat ibm also offers services and support to help customers use linux to run open source application development software such as eclipse in addition to application server software from the open source organization apache in may dell established a marketing and services program to help migrate existing linux users who are not dell linux customers to novells version of linux such services came in handy for tony parziale chief information officer for palm beach community college in lake worth fla in early the college moved its erp system which runs on an ibm mainframe to linux from the mainframes operating system mr parziale says the shift aided by specialized services from ibm reduced the colleges monthly costs of running the erp system to &# from &# in part because it no longer pays the license fee associated with the mainframe operating system "the savings were considerable for the college " says mr parziale "its going well linux runs great " other moves could make linux more attractive for customers to use for big jobs software giant oracle for example recently started selling its own technical support for red hats version of linux microsoft and novell are working together to make it easier for customers to use both windows and linux software in their data centers linux is "an operating system that is growing up " says judy chavis director of enterprise marketing at dell
