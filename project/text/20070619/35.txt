dont dismiss putins missile defense proposal although russian president putins proposal that the u s use a radar in azerbaijan and install missile defenses closer to iran rather than in eastern europe is politically motivated it is not as wrongheaded as your editorial "putins missile gambit " june makes it seem midcourse interception can be foiled by relatively simply countermeasures and decoys mr putins proposal that radars and abms be installed closer to iran in turkey iraq or at sea could make it possible to intercept the launch vehicles in "boost phase " when they can be more readily identified by their rocket plumes and before deceptive measures could be deployed whether it will prove feasible to develop systems capable of spotting and destroying missiles in the very short time needed to launch them remains to be seen but the proposal is not far fetched your editorial misses the point in asserting that azerbaijan and turkey are too close to iran to offer good radar and launch sites or that ship based interceptors "are designed to shoot down short range and medium range missiles " these sites would be appropriate for boost phase interception a potentially better option than midcourse defense even if the mda can ever get the interceptors to work reliably under realistic conditions sanford lakoff research professor of political science university of california san diego san diego mr lakoff is author of "strategic defense in the nuclear age" praeger security international
