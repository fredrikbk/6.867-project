how licensing helped an artist pull a rabbit out of his hat its happy bunny in true rabbit fashion has multiplied quickly thousands of products feature the rude cartoon his quips have slipped onto socks "i just realized i dont care" wafted onto air fresheners "lets focus on me" and slid onto key rings "its cute how stupid you are" the bunny and his creator have hippity hopped into licensing lore jim benton a year old writer and artist created the its happy bunny franchise more than years ago as one of many designs he hoped would get him a licensing contract it took a few years for the bunny to catch on but once it did he started racking up sales in the hundreds of millions of dollars mr bentons intellectual properties including the rabbit and a cluster of other characters have made him stand out in an industry dominated by big entertainment companies its happy bunny alone is licensed to more than companies world wide last year retail sales for the rabbit reached nearly &# million this fall kohls corp discount stores will display its happy bunny apparel such as underwear for teen girls alongside merchandise featuring the likes of licensing heavyweight walt disney co s "pirates of the caribbean" and "high school musical " thanks to licensing mr benton says "a twerp like me can go shoulder to shoulder with a company like disney " but its not that easy the licensing industry is a massively profitable tangled web of artists agents and merchandisers its a dance helping products sell and characters get noticed if it works both sides win in manufacturers paid more than &# billion in royalties in the u s to people who hold copyrights to a character or brand according to the international licensing industry merchandisers association entertainment properties and characters are by far the leaders accounting for nearly a third of those royalty payments many of the deals or contacts for future deals are consummated at the licensing international a speed dating event of sorts for people with characters to license manufacturers with products to sell and retailers looking for the next big thing the three day get together in new york which begins today draws more than people to see the exhibitors and their over the top displays "everyone wants to have the next its happy bunny " says cindy levitt a former vice president of licensing at teen retailer hot topic inc based in city of industry calif mr benton who lives in bloomfield mich first attended the licensing show in with "the misters " a series of individual drawings that pokes fun at the habits of men his by foot booth had only a card table "with my dumb little suit and my alert little brief case " he says "i masqueraded as an intellectual property owner " while the licensing of intellectual property has been around for decades sophisticated marketing and merchandising plans are a fairly recent development rather than licensing a t shirt here and a lunch box there entertainment companies now plan their merchandising strategy with as much care as the entertainment vehicle behind it says charles riotto president of the international licensing industry merchandisers association a new york based trade group the first modern merchandising effort came after the release of "star wars" in the creators responded to heavy demand from fans "we just started cranking it out " said howard roffman president of lucas licensing it remains a hot property it has hit &# billion in retail sales according to lucasfilm ltd through licensing creators can make money without the financial risk and hassle of manufacturing storing or shipping products the vast majority of licensing contracts some pay royalties of between and of the wholesale price out of which middlemen such as licensing agents are often paid says mr riotto high profile properties can bring in significantly more mr benton averages around entertainment companies with heavily marketed properties such as movies or tv shows are the major force behind licensing retail sales of licensed disney merchandise think hannah montana and disney princess reached &# billion in according to license magazine warner bros consumer products which licenses harry potter goods had &# billion and nickelodeon viacom consumer products which lays claim to dora the explorer had &# billion but theres a healthy slice of independent licensors like mr benton who have built a following in whats called the art category several artists such as thomas kinkade and mary engelbreit have found success licensing their work to home decor manufacturers art licensing saw the biggest increase in royalty revenues rising to &# million in from &# million in its happy bunny and other art that is aimed at teens and so called tweens on the cusp of adolescence are a much tougher sell the consumer has to like what he or she sees almost immediately in an unknown property because theres no automatic affiliation "without a buzz behind it or groundswell coming up ahead of it its hard to throw a new character out there " says ms levitt the former hot topic executive and timing is everything mr benton paired his drawings with snarky sayings before so called attitude art started appearing en masse nobody got the joke when he first created its happy bunny says mr benton so he tucked the character away in his portfolio he dabbled with licensing it but didnt get serious interest until when he hired licensing agent carole postal president of new york based copcorp licensing she knew executives at hot topic and introduced them to both mr benton and his bunny they loved the attitude of both mr benton is as animated as his character and ms postal brokered a licensing deal between mr benton and some manufacturers who supplied t shirts buttons magnets and key chains to hot topic by september its happy bunny was in several hundred stores hot topic had the character exclusively for nearly two years "you have to be real careful about how you manage a property " says mr benton "the temptation is to sell it to anyone as fast as you can " the disciplined strategy worked says marty brochstein executive editor of the licensing letter a trade publication customers sought out the merchandise at hot topic stores displayed in a boutique type setting "we treated it like it was our property " says ms levitt at one time hot topic sold around different its happy bunny products its happy bunny has since expanded to the mass market mr riotto says the product has done well because it lends itself to so many categories target carries greeting cards claires accessory stores sell purses wal mart has posters globally the brand is just as widespread customers can buy its happy bunny pajamas in peru stickers in canada toothbrushes in japan within the industry a propertys success is judged typically by retail sales its happy bunny will reach about &# million in retail sales this year according to projections from copcorp in its happy bunny sales brought in about &# million in licensing revenue this year copcorp projects a increase to about &# million thats not to say its easy to turn a drawing into a million dollar brand although thats the perception in january the new york post compiled a list of " ways to make it to the top " mr benton and its happy bunny got mentioned at no under the headline "make a pile of money for doing very little " ms postal still bristles "if it were that easy everyone would do it " keeping track of the character especially the quality of production is a huge undertaking says ms postal its not slapping the bunny wherever it fits every product is closely developed and produced for example when mr benton and ms postal were working with a beverage manufacturer on an energy drink mr benton suggested calling it "spaz juice " of course franchises like its happy bunny dont come along very often jay foreman who runs play along a toy making division of the consumer products company jakks pacific inc says the likelihood that an artist can create and capitalize on several different characters is slim "many of these guys will never ever have another property like the one they created " says mr foreman mr benton believes he has a few more rabbits in his hat its happy bunny remains his top licensed property but other characters continue to make their mark meany doodles a cartoon of a little girl in a bad mood has several licensed products including a t shirt that says "obey me youll be happier " his line called just jimmy of cartoon animals runs the gamut of properties from buttons to hooded sweatshirts mr benton has also licensed merchandise off of a series of "franny k stein" books he wrote for tweens about a little girl who is a mad scientist and he has ventured into the entertainment industry with a movie in the works for franny aware of the fickle nature of his target audience mr benton continues to revise his work striving to make it age appropriate and funny at the same time as one of his ubiquitous bunnys slogans points out on a t shirt "im not saying im cool thats your job "
