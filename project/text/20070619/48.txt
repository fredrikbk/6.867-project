finally rescued chinas slaves detail their plight parents grass roots efforts forced media police to act beatings and hour shifts dinggou china in early march li yaokai a skinny year old from this small mountainside village in central china embarked on his first trip to the provincial capital it didnt take long for him to get dragged into a huge forced labor scandal whose gruesome details are now coming to light mr li had set out in search of work to help support his family instead the teenager ended up being sold into bondage at a brick factory moments after he stepped off the train in zhengzhous cavernous rail station he says a middle aged man appeared and asked if he was interested in a job mr li followed the stranger outside where two others emerged from the shadows grabbing him and shoving him into a white minivan "i screamed but no one heard me " says mr li one of the first victims to give an extended interview to the foreign press at dawn the next day his abductors dumped him at an isolated brick kiln an operation he later learned that was set up by the local communist party boss for nearly three months he says he spent or more hours a day hauling bricks surrounded by guard dogs and menaced by overseers wielding iron bars mr li is one of hundreds of former captives dubbed "slave workers" by the chinese media many of them are children and disabled people rescued by police as part of a broad assault on a vast underworld of brick factories and coal mines in two of chinas provinces and regions with more details emerging including the alleged complicity of government and communist party officials the scandal threatens to sully the countrys international image as it prepares to host the olympic games in beijing news of the abuses has hit hard among chinese people disillusioned by the social and economic inequities that have often gone hand in hand with the countrys shift to capitalism but the recent events show how chinas citizens and media are increasingly willing to exert pressure on political leaders "in the end the government had to pay attention and find our boys " says mr lis father li runzhi his son returned home last week his hands burned by scorching hot bricks pulled from the kilns his body was infested with lice "now i just want to sleep all the time " the younger mr li quietly said sunday during an interview at his parents tiny spartan home he wore a loose fitting orange t shirt decorated with cartoon panda bears his hair was newly cropped "i feel happy he is back but he doesnt talk to us " says zhang yuqin the teens mother "he used to be a very lively boy we are not going to send him to work anywhere for a while " much of mr lis account has been corroborated by reports carried by chinas official xinhua news agency and the communist partys own flagship newspaper peoples daily chinas state controlled press has been filled with graphic photos of injured slave laborers in tattered clothing and detailed accounts of their dickensian plight more than people have been freed by the police so far the brick factory where li yaokai and others toiled was set up by the communist party chief of the village and run by his son according to authorities last week xinhua and peoples daily both ran stories trumpeting the arrest of the son and several employees yesterday xinhua reported that the party chief had been sacked the police raid that freed mr li was one of the first in a sweep of hundreds of brick factories and mines the operation was prompted in large part by a grass roots movement driven by people like mr lis father and other parents of abducted children another catalyst a may report broadcast on the henan provincial television station in zhengzhou that detailed the abduction of workers and featured a videotape of laborers at one of the brickyards after the story aired parents of missing children gathered at the tv stations offices swapped stories and began working together to find their children hundreds ended up traveling to shanxi to search brick kilns prodding the police to act the campaign spread to the internet and sparked a media outcry that forced the government to tackle a long ignored problem so far factory operators and others have been arrested in henan and shanxi provinces according to xinhua forced labor appears to have become a widespread problem in china over the past decade activists say as more than million people have left the security of their villages and hometowns to hunt for work many go to the distant and unfamiliar reaches of the countrys big cities traffickers either abduct people or lure them to work with false promises of good pay their targets are often the young and disabled since they are the least likely to escape chinas vast migrant work force plays to their advantage families may go for months without realizing their loved ones are missing most have no practical way to look for them if they do disappear the u s state department which recently published its annual report on human trafficking and forced labor estimates that a minimum of to people fall prey to human traffickers each year china remains on the state departments "watch list " in part the report says because the country hasnt made "concerted efforts to investigate and punish government officials specifically for complicity in trafficking " mr li and his wife are part of a group of six families working together to find their missing sons so far they are the only ones whose boy has been found "i think its very common " mr li says "i hope we can solve this problem once and for all and recover all of our lost boys " li yaokais odyssey began at the zhengzhou rail station one of the largest in china nearly people pass through the station every day and it has become a notorious hub for human traffickers according to a report on china central television last year after the kidnappers grabbed mr li he says he was thrown into a small room with barred windows that served as a holding cell in time he was joined by four other abductees ranging in age from to the five of them were crammed into the back of a van with darkened windows and guarded by two men armed with crowbars they were ordered to remain silent the van drove all night and they were delivered to the brickyard early the next morning mr li who is feet inches tall and at the time weighed about pounds says he was immediately put to work carting heavy loads of bricks he was forbidden to talk to the other workers and initially didnt even know where he was in a remote county in shanxi province more than miles from his home in henan province his father says that he initially had no idea that his son was in trouble he had left home in high spirits determined to earn money and gain experience outside the village the elder mr li recalls but as time dragged on with no word from his son mr li says he grew concerned last year another boy from the village had been kidnapped and taken to a brick factory in shanxi province but managed to escape after a few days mr li says he began to wonder if his son had met a similar fate other parents whose children went missing from the zhengzhou train station worried too prompting local tv reporters to search for clues on may the zhengzhou television station aired the first of its stories about children being sold into bondage mr li saw the news and called the station looking for information more than different families also called according to the tv station groups of parents banded together and went to the authorities calling for action initially the response was tepid the police advised mr li to file a missing persons report and suggested that he and the other parents should look for their sons themselves "i was very unhappy and disappointed " mr li says mr li spent weeks traveling to brick kilns in henan and shanxi discovering what he believes were hundreds of children and adults being forced to work against their will he was still searching when he received a call saying the police had found his son scores of other parents launched their own rescue efforts reporting what they found to the police and the media early this month fathers signed a letter demanding that the government take action and posted it online all the attention appears to have finally resonated with the government which called for sweeping police action on may police raided the brick kiln where mr li was working freeing people and arresting three including the son of the party boss the foreman and his wife fled but were apprehended over the weekend in another province government propaganda officials meanwhile sought to rein in media coverage web sites were ordered to block discussion of the events but coverage in the chinese press all of which is ultimately controlled by the state in china has continued unabated some chinese government officials had financial interests in the mostly illegal operations authorities say the younger mr li recalls that once while being held captive he saw government figures visit the kiln to collect bribe money from the foreman mr li says that he did his best to avoid invoking the ire of the overseers "i worked hard when i was ordered to do something i did it " says mr li he subsisted on a diet of bread noodles and water he says he was beaten twice when he became too exhausted and weak to work quickly "i was always looking for some way to escape " mr li says but he knew such an effort was fraught with risk one boy who tried to run away was captured and beaten by the guards they broke the boys leg with iron bars mr li says as mr li told his story of captivity liu yunqi the mother of a missing deaf boy sat on a stool hugging herself her year old son cheng xiaopeng was abducted at the end of february after traveling to zhengzhou with some classmates for vacation his friends said two older men seized mr cheng in the train station and dragged him off ms liu has crisscrossed shanxi looking for her son after another parent reported seeing a deaf boy who resembled mr cheng at a brickyard she rushed there only to find that the boy had been sent elsewhere "hes had such a hard life " ms liu says of her son last year he was hospitalized for months with a kidney disease and she worries that he may be sick again since he doesnt have his medicine "these people have no mercy he cant even hear " she sobbed "please help me find my son " ellen zhu and tang hanting in shanghai and kersten zhang in beijing contributed to this article
