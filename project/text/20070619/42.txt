eyes on the road us vs them marketing takes over as auto makers vie for consideration online edition have you seen the ad showing a saturn dealer unloading a toyota camry and a honda accord to display on the lot next to the saturn aura link looks a bit nuts doesnt it only if you dont know todays word in the auto industry "consideration " everywhere you turn these days a car maker is calling out a rival for a head to head duel koreas hyundai motor corp is promoting its new veracruz sport utility by comparing it to the lexus rx &lt ndash&gt a crossover priced &# more than the hyundai general motors corp s saturn brand is indeed acquiring camrys and accords for its showrooms and daring shoppers to compare its midsized aura sedan with those best selling midsized sedans ford motor co for several months has been disrespecting the accord and camry in a series of ads that contend real driving enthusiasts preferred the ford fusion to the leading brands in head to head comparisons do i even need to mention the trash talk in the pickup segment the surge of us vs them marketing in the car business where conventional wisdom is that mentioning the other guy is just free advertising illustrates the chaos and hyper competition engulfing the business depending on whos counting there are more than different models on the u s vehicle market within many of those model lines there are several different variants &lt ndash&gt coupes sedans wagons five seaters seven seaters v v four cylinder hybrid and on and on simple math means that most cars wont sell enough to support a factory or even half a factory for an industry that still relies on mass economies of scale to turn profits this is a multi billion dollar problem the biggest challenge for auto marketers trying to get a profitable slice of the pie is simply to get on shopping lists im paid to pay attention to new cars and i cant keep track of all the new launches most people arent paid to care and dont it can take months sometimes years for a new model name to gain a critical mass of awareness in the market even that isnt a guarantee that consumers will be interested the accord and camry in particular have been safe reliable choices that held their value over the years the drop off to no or in the mid size sedan segment is steep jeremy anwyl chief executive officer of automotive shopping site edmunds com says his companys analysts have been digging into data generated as consumers surf edmunds gathering information about different vehicles they watch as "consideration" for models waxes and wanes and they can see as "consideration " which usually reflects awareness of a brand and advertising transforms into "purchase intent " edmunds is even gearing up to alert consumers when interest in a model is hot or cold the better to anticipate price changes a sample of edmunds traffic analysis on a selection of vehicles illustrates how critical "consideration" is take the saturn aura in january a panel of automotive journalists voted the aura the north american car of the year saturn trumpeted the award in its ads but sales didnt take off as gm had hoped in january according to edmunds data information about the aura gathered unique visitors on the edmunds site the ford fusion attracted unique visitors and the toyota camry unique visitors instead of parking a camry at the saturn stores they could just park a cage with an pound gorilla inside and a "camry" sign on the bars the risk that visitors to the saturn store who drive both cars will like the camry better is real but its not greater than the risk that the aura will just vanish in the swarm of cars chasing the camry so gm has little to lose by bopping the gorilla on the nose edmunds data indicates that the aura has gained traction since january as gm has kept trying new ways to position the car as an equal of the best sellers in may aura "consideration" traffic rose to unique visitors down somewhat from march but still twice as good as january the fusion however had slipped to unique visitors the camry still the gorilla at visits a more intriguing tale of shifting consideration patterns is unfolding in the hotly competitive "crossover" wagon market in january gm was launching the first of what will be four large crossover wagons the gmc acadia in that month visitors to the edmunds site gave consideration to the acadia compared to visitors for the acura mdx crossover and visitors for the lexus rx the hyundai veracruz wasnt on the market fast forward to may the acadia got looks from edmunds visitors and was no in this four wagon race the mdx was no at the rx fell to lookers and the veracruz was pitching in with lookers purchase intentions followed a similar track with the acadia no in may with visitors exhibiting behavior consistent with buying an acadia within four to six weeks you might think if consumers knew whether a given model was gaining or losing in the consideration derby theyd have a better idea of whether they should wait a bit to buy to see if a manufacturer doled out more rebate cash to prop up a slumping model mr anwyl the edmunds ceo says he has had exactly that thought and intends by the end of this year to translate site traffic data into a simple visual cue such as an arrow that can alert shoppers when a vehicle is likely to get a markdown in the meantime toyota and honda will need to get used to those bullseyes on their backs and they may want to drive a little faster to dodge the arrows send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
