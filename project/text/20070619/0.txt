did i really have a root canal more dentists offer drugs to sedate nervous patients finding a designated driver like millions of people in the u s christopher dammer hates visiting the dentist haunted by memories of painful experiences from childhood he would go for long stretches without seeking dental care a lapse that once led to a root canal when he did get checkups he was an onerous patient to deal with clenching his jaw moving his head and gagging he says "every time im in the dentist chair i start tightening up " says mr dammer a year old mortgage banker from scottsdale ariz finally after years of anxiety ridden sessions his dentist scott irwin recommended a solution "conscious sedation " last month mr dammer downed a series of oral sedatives before a routine teeth cleaning and a filling he spent the session drowsy and relaxed and now "i have no memory about it " he says dr irwin is one of a growing number of dentists around the country offering so called sedation dentistry targeted at the most fearful patients the approach uses a variety of medications to bring about a state of conscious sedation in which a patient isnt fully unconscious but remains drowsy and only semi aware during procedures dentists trained in the practice say the fastest growing method involves oral sedatives such as insomnia drugs which they say offer more anxiety relief than nitrous oxide aka laughing gas and because memory loss is a common side effect of these drugs patients typically dont remember the experience the practice has spread as more doctors seek training in administering sedating drugs some practices are specializing in it and launching ad campaigns to attract patients who otherwise avoid the dentist michael silverman founder of the for profit dental organization for conscious sedation in seattle says nearly dentists have taken his groups courses in oral sedation since docs was founded in but sedation dentistry sometimes called sleep dentistry is also drawing criticism from some dentists spurring lawmakers and professional groups to address concerns about the potential for over sedation oral sedatives such as the insomnia drug triazolam sold under the brand name halcion are growing in popularity in part because dentists can learn to administer them relatively quickly intravenous drugs require more specialized training however sedation experts say that even with oral sedatives practitioners must still be able to determine the proper dosage assess the level of sedation assist a patient with breathing if there are respiratory problems and bring the patient out of sedation with a reversal agent if necessary since at least states have amended regulations or laws to address the use of anesthesia and sedation in dentistry according to the american dental association california florida iowa idaho minnesota and wisconsin for instance have adopted rules covering training certification and equipment last week the ada released a draft update of its guidelines on sedation and anesthesia the updates which will be finalized in the fall would change the adas definitions for the levels of sedation to match those used in the rest of medicine among other changes joel weaver ada spokesman for anesthesia affairs adds that under the new guidelines dentists would have to be able to pass a competency course when receiving training several states that require certification for dentists using sedation adhere to the adas guidelines some dentists say that the addition of sedating medication which typically isnt covered by insurance is unnecessary eleanore awadalla a dentist in toledo ohio and former member of ohios dental board says " of patients really dont need sleeping pills " she is concerned that patients may misunderstand the sedation they are getting believing they will be completely unconscious under general anesthesia but she says conscious sedation isnt much different from what she can achieve with traditional nitrous oxide which might be included in the covered cost of the procedure "its all about what you sell " says dr awadalla nevertheless many patients and dentists say the technique is invaluable some million americans avoid the dentist out of dread according to the journal of the american dental association and dentists who use sedation say it may be the only way to get certain patients into the dental chair at all "the big draw is that it reduces the anxiety " says dr irwin who has been using oral sedation since dr irwin charges &# to sedate patients dr silverman of the sedation dentistry group says that while each patient is different a typical case works like this a nervous patient takes an oral sedative the night before a procedure to help him or her sleep the morning of the dental appointment the patient takes another dose and is driven by someone else to the dentists office at the office the dentist may up the dosage depending on the patients level of sedation dosages depend on the age weight health and anxiety level of the patient once the patient is adequately sedated nearly asleep perhaps with slurred speech but still able to respond to commands and breathe on his or her own an anesthetic like novocain is administered for the pain the dentist then begins the procedure afterward the patient may remain sleepy for several hours and must be driven home the sedation "is not a euphoria or a high " says dr silverman triazolam or halcion is approved by the food and drug administration to treat insomnia but doctors can prescribe drugs "off label" for other uses john yagiela division chair for diagnostic and surgical sciences at the university of california los angeles school of dentistry says the oral drugs require strict training to administer triazolam is "a very safe drug " dr yagiela says but he notes that if multiple doses are given before the first one has reached its peak there is the chance for over sedation the dentist needs to be trained in how to spot over sedation manage any respiratory problems that may arise and use a reversal agent to bring the patient out of sedation the reversal agent typically is an injection of a drug called flumazenil in a survey of dentists trained by the dental organization for conscious sedation using triazolam on cases there were adverse cases of which involved the administration of flumazenil none resulted in the need for hospitalization according to the study which was conducted by docs and presented at a conference pfizer inc maker of halcion says signs of overdose may occur at four times the maximum recommended dose which is milligram this includes "somnolence confusion impaired coordination slurred speech and ultimately coma " according to the companys web site the adas new draft guidelines recommend use of no more than times the maximum recommended dose to achieve what it calls "minimal sedation " still some dentists take extra precautions kevin sands a dentist who practices in beverly hills has offered oral sedatives for the past six years charging &# and up dr sands says he uses an anesthesiologist to orally sedate patients even though he has been trained to do so himself "theyre experts at it " he says patient information resources on the web www ada org public american dental association click on "anesthesia" under a z topics www agd org consumer academy of general dentistry
