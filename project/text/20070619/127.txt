when economies go to war the wages of destruction by adam tooze viking pages &# the world in which medium size european powers could think themselves capable of standing up to america is now unthinkably remote in world war i and still more in world war ii american superiority in weaponry and in general inventiveness was enormous it is among adam toozes many virtues in "the wages of destruction the making and breaking of the nazi economy " that he can write about such matters with authority explaining the technicalities of bombers and battleships hovering over his chronicle are two extraordinary questions how germany managed to last as long as it did before the collapse of and why under hitler it thought it could achieve supremacy at all germany had great weaknesses that were perfectly well known to anyone with a brain and there were of course german businessmen who knew perfectly well what the american economy was capable of in americas "liberty ships" were turned out in a mere six weeks for instance and carried the supplies and men for the normandy invasion while at the same time helping to wage a full scale war against japan during the war the germans maximum strength in the air was combat aircraft compared with the americans not to mention the british and the russians once america produced its daytime fighter plane in u s bombers could fly protected against german fighters and bomb tons at a time more or less at will germanys railway and canal system was wrecked and its synthetic fuel plants were smashed there was a symbol of this in germany produced the prototypes for jet aircraft but they had to be towed onto the tarmac at the munich airport by oxen to save fuel how do you explain such a mismatch and the attempt on germanys part to defy it mr tooze studies the ups and downs of the german economy in the hitler period "the aggression of hitlers regime can be rationalized as an intelligible response to the tensions stirred up by the uneven development of global capitalism " he claims germany he says was quite a poor country in comparison with england and the u s where a certain consumer prosperity was already developing in the s the ownership of automobiles in the u s was widespread and increasingly so in england whereas in germany a car was still a rich mans toy the german masses were also stung by agricultural tariffs which made a sausage in berlin about half more expensive than in london the germans wanted their share of the modern eras prosperity and hitler aimed to exploit the vast resources of russia and the ukraine in germany had made a bid for world power and failed in the s a few european leaders began to see that some sort of united europe would be a more sensible way forward making all european states less vulnerable to the will of one mr tooze ably presents the ins and outs of this debate there was an idea for instance for an organization that vaguely anticipated the european coal and steel community of linking france and germany but in the s such an idea ran up against fervid nationalist resentments meanwhile wall street still in a freewheeling unregulated form was not yet prepared to take on the responsibilities that matched its new importance to the world this brief period of hope came to an end with the crash and it hit germany hard indeed mass despair meant that by a majority of germans voted against democracy whether in a nazi or a communist sense hitler came to power with a definite program of nationalist self assertion internal and external it amounted to old fashioned imperialism of a type common among the great powers before but hitler added a vicious touch whereas the older imperialists at least justified what they were doing in terms of the good it supposedly did hitler did not mean any good at all his empire would be what george orwell said of it millions of blond beasts stamping around it involved racialism rearmament and soon enough plans for foreign aggression when hitler took power in germany could not feed its population properly and lacked essential raw materials hitlers eyes were thus fixed on the east on what russia and the ukraine could provide in the mid to late s germany experienced a kind of economic miracle curiously enough that was the title of a swedish book on germany in and unemployment declined fast at the time partly under marxist influence the orthodoxy was to say that germany was overheating that there was a crisis under way the british expected in war to strangle germany with a blockade not everyone agreed in a sharp sighted cambridge economist named claude guillebaud published "the economic recovery of germany " he ascribed the recovery to a version of keynesian economics with government spending leading the way he argued that germany would not collapse if it came to a war as a j p taylor later remarked guillebauds reputation "never recovered from this recognition of the truth " years later guillebaud himself ruefully told me that he had very nearly been interned in under a regulation that was used for fascist sympathizers mr tooze does not refer to guillebaud more important he does not have any time for taylor a pity because all of a j p taylors works are still in print for very good reasons taylor did not think that nazi rearmament was anything like as fearsome as mr tooze says it was much of it taylor argued in "the origins of the second world war" was either poorly executed or a pretense the allies in were stronger to paraphrase taylor the only thing that was proved by the french defeat in is that armies will lose battles if they are led badly enough taylor reckoned that world war ii broke out because hitler gambled that the british would back down mr tooze is rather more "structural" the german economy he says was indeed overheating and german rearmament had reached a level of comparative advantage that would only decline as the western powers caught up but do we have to enter this territory at all there are other explanations hitler regarded himself and in was widely regarded by others as the greatest german of all time but he was aging and was worried about his own health without hitler where would germany be he was therefore pledged to success and gambling for it became his pattern as mr tooze shows the german war economy even with support from occupied europe had great difficulties by it was collapsing hitler refused to acknowledge such truths if he displayed enough willpower he thought something would turn up he was close enough in his judgment to bring the world to the brink of disaster time and again an apparently deadly crisis would occur think only of moscow in december or the fall of mussolini in summer and then nazi germany would bounce back but by the end those comparative output statistics did hitler in a german industrialist told me how as a young flier he had taken his plane up on june into the normandy clouds he had seen an armada of ships and landing craft coming over the english channel protected by a great cluster of aircraft he knew then that the war was lost mr stone teaches at koc university in istanbul turkey and is professor of
