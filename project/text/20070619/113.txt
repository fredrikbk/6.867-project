taking note lufthansa swiss and klm royal dutch airlines offer all business class flights on several routes between the u s and europe subcontracting the flying to a charter carrier called privatair prices are comparable to regular business class on those carriers virgin and british airways have said recently they are working on plans for all premium service flights using planes smaller than the wide bodies they fly between the u s and london now its not known what fares will be for those services to check out the new entrants i recently flew silverjet and lavion heres a review silverjet at a private lounge an employee takes your passport and your baggage and sends you to the bar before boarding the same silverjet attendant returns with your boarding pass and passport and sends you on to the first class security screening line its a bit like having an airport nanny you can show up only minutes ahead of departure silverjet claims silverjet flies between londons luton airport miles north of central london and newark liberty international airport with one aircraft a year old boeing silverjet has acquired a second plane that will be used to start a second daily newark london trip three additional s are under contract a one airplane airline has a unique problem when maintenance gremlins strike the airline is grounded that happened june and silverjet booked passengers on virgin atlantic flights some in coach some in "upper class " "there were quite a lot of angry passengers " said peter stonier of london one of the lucky customers upgraded he was traveling with six colleagues for meetings at a pharmaceutical company three of the group flew virgins business class four traveled in virgins premium economy silverjet says when it has to cancel a flight it buys as many "upper class" tickets and gives those to passengers who paid the most for their silverjet tickets chief executive lawrence hunt says silverjet also refunds its tickets and gives customers a complimentary ticket for a future silverjet flight there have been two canceled round trips in total on his return flight to london on silverjet mr stonier was impressed "the happy medium in travel is some sort of reasonably priced business class " he said "people want to work they want to be able to open a computer they want to get off the plane ready to go " silverjet outfitted its with brown and tan seats that recline into foot inch flat beds though overhead bins are still small and original the seats are inches wide three inches wider than coach and standard for business class on most airlines like the other start ups in flight entertainment comes in a portable viewer loaded with movies and tv shows that plugs into the seats power outlet at luton silverjet has its own terminal with showers food and work areas the facility gets crowded when arriving passengers mingle with departing travelers in the morning and mr hunt says the airline has space to double the lounges size michael samson who teaches economics at williams college in williamstown mass found the service ok not up to typical business class standards but the price was great he would have paid &# to continental airlines for a coach ticket that was upgradeable to continentals business class cabin but instead paid about &# round trip to silverjet silverjets fares currently range from &# to &# round trip "the lounge was crowded in newark the wifi wasnt working the seats on the plane were old and the service was slow " he said "theyve got a few kinks to work out but it was a very good value " lavion lavion flies between orly airport in paris and newark six days a week with a single boeing outfitted with business class seats and prices starting at &# orly is closer to downtown paris than charles de gaulle airport where all other flights from the u s land after checking in at a counter travelers on a recent day trudged up stairs with their bags because escalators werent working and waited in long passport control lines then it was down stairs escalators not working again to security screening a screener directed lavion passengers down a long corridor to a lounge which turned out to be shared by about other carriers including cubana and royal air maroc an hour before departure every seat in the lounge was filled lavion doesnt have access to a gate with a jet bridge at orly so passengers are bused out to the plane after security screening and another trip down stairs toting baggage once on the plane the experience vastly improves lavions jet a year old that flew charters for a german carrier and still has signs in german in the bathrooms has four seats in each row standard for domestic first class on a with more legroom than domestic first class the purple seats recline but not to fully horizontal the single aisle on the plane is wide enough to squeeze past a food service cart a major plus for travelers norman feinberg and his wife arline travel often between their home in new york and paris on delta air lines or air france but mr feinberg gave lavion a try for &# a person round trip the couple found the lavion seats not as plush as other business class seats with buttons a bit difficult to maneuver the airline had only one choice left for dinner on their flight from new york to paris and ran out of cheese by the time they were served "you give up a little bit with this service but not enough to matter for the difference in price " mr feinberg said lavion hopes to sign a lease for its second this week chief executive marc rochet said lavion will move to a new terminal at orly in july mr rochet said improving its airport experience though it may not land its own gate until the fall the carrier doesnt have access to shower facilities in either paris or newark "we are not premium first class but we are a new business class " said mr rochet "the value we offer is very good "
