artificial knee makes strides for women strong enough for a man but made for a woman a company selling a new artificial knee designed specifically for female anatomy says the device fits better and provides more natural movement than standard knees made to be used by both sexes so far there are no data to prove that claim but some surgeons say women who get the new knee appear to have less pain and better movement when a knee becomes unbearably painful generally either from arthritis or injury it may be time for a total replacement in the surgery the natural knee is replaced by one made of metal and plastic nearly half a million knee replacements were done in according to the centers for disease control and prevention the majority of knee replacements are done in women partly because they live longer and partly because their wider hips tend to put more stress on the joint traditionally surgeons have provided women with smaller versions of the same knees used in men last year a top maker of traditional knees zimmer holdings inc began selling a new product it calls the "gender solutions" knee the warsaw ind company says it worked with surgeons to develop the knee based on some ct scans of male and female knees the result is a thinner more contoured device zimmer says the device is less bulky in front and narrower better simulating womens natural knee structure and preventing the implant from overhanging the thigh bone side to side also to accommodate the wider angle of womens hips the knees tracking mechanism is designed to operate at a slightly wider angle to function more smoothly johnson &amp johnson unit depuy orthopaedics inc which sells a popular rival knee says it offers a "wide range of sizes that allows" for customization for each patient another competitor stryker corp of kalamazoo mich says its triathalon knee is used in both sexes but is proportionally narrow in smaller sizes used in women so far theres no clinical trial data that suggest the gender solutions knee yields better results the company received clearance from the food and drug administration to sell it simply by showing it was similar to its successful standard knee clinical trials on the new knee are beginning now in the meantime some surgeons say that women with the new knee appear to suffer less pain and enjoy better tracking and a more complete bend of the knee skeptics say the evidence is anecdotal and add that changes made in the new knee to accommodate female anatomy are likely too subtle to make much difference william goldstein a chicago surgeon who is a paid consultant to competitor depuy says hes keeping an open mind his early experience with the gender solutions device in knees replacements suggests the new knee is "as good" as traditional knees says but more study is needed to determine if its better email aches wsj com corrections &amp amplifications wayne m goldstein is a chicago surgeon he was misidentified in yesterdays aches &amp claims column as william goldstein wsj june
