hazardous course for uaw chief a bid to forestall waterloo amid industrys pain ron gettelfinger seeks smaller concessions as detroits struggling auto giants enter an epic battle with their unionized workers to reduce costs they contend they either must win a profound restructuring or face catastrophe ron gettelfingers plan is to allow neither the head of the united auto workers union is trying to avoid becoming the union leader who ends seven decades of nearly unbroken advances in workers wages and benefits he is under unprecedented pressure to give back as much as &# billion a year to help u s car companies stop losing to their lower cost asian counterparts or see the u s companies build more and more of their cars overseas former uaw president doug fraser calls this "the most difficult time in the history of our union period " mr gettelfingers strategy so far skirt big do or die conflicts as long as possible while focusing on numerous smaller ones where he can live with concessions "the big three need want something transformational " says david cole president of the michigan based center for auto research "they will have their waterloo now ron and the union think incrementally and would prefer death by a thousand cuts " in a defiant television interview to be aired this weekend he blames currency imbalances and unfair foreign trade practices for u s auto makers competitive problems and calls on the federal government to fix them "we cant resolve those issues at the bargaining table " he says on the locally broadcast show autoline detroit as union leaders meet with general motors corp executives today in preparation for a summer of contract talks the u s car companies have aggressive expectations they want to go far toward eliminating a &# per hour gap in compensation they see between their workers and those of foreign based rivals and they want workers braced for a deal full of fundamental changes including increasing what they pay for health care costs and sharply reducing the time they can be paid after their jobs are eliminated mr gettelfinger a onetime assembly line worker with an accounting degree has a delicate balancing act uaw membership has been dwindling along with u s car companies fortunes while the union has been virtually unable to sign up workers in plants of foreign based companies a pivotal failure hurting its overall bargaining power this year fewer than half of cars made in the u s are being built by uaw members recent pacts on retiree health care concessions have squeaked through with as little as of the vote possibly leaving mr gettelfinger with little room to maneuver on further cuts ron lare a tool and die worker nearing retirement from ford motor co s dearborn truck plant after years at ford was among the "no" votes when retiree benefits were reduced in partly because he feels givebacks may hurt the unions future "im not a militant i dont think you always have to fight " he says but he adds of mr gettelfinger "i think its pretty obvious he has to fight concessions if he ever wants to organize workers at toyota " mr gettelfinger rose to his post through a relentless attention to detail and not through an outsized personality unlike many uaw leaders mr gettelfinger has a minimal entourage and seems close to few people he doesnt drink quit smoking doesnt gamble and usually takes his wife judy with him on business trips he banned traditional friday golf outings for uaw officials and their management counterparts to avoid the impression union officials were working less than the people they represent "i consider him a friend but its all business with ron " says al coven who retired in july after six years as president of uaw delphi local in saginaw mich auto company executives call mr gettelfinger a shrewd and pragmatic bargainer who has brought a new level of sophistication to the uaws strategy by digging into the auto makers finances almost as a private equity investor or creditor would to help vet the companies claims about their predicament he hired a wall street investment bank and law firm to advise him a departure for the union and has reached out to certain wall street analysts and private equity fund executives he keeps a meticulous watch on the uaws many parallel contract talks each bargaining team updates the status of proposals and company responses on three column charts that his company counterparts call his "tracking documents " in a uaw war room at the unions "solidarity house" headquarters in downtown detroit the unions economists use the sheets to adjust proposals at each of the talks he likes to outlast opponents by starting early and finishing late and often drags out meetings by pushing people to support their figures and assertions "people around the room will look at each other and sigh silently because he asks so many questions and wont let something go " says a person who has been in recent labor negotiations with mr gettelfinger the union head is extremely cautious about showing his hand in the media and rarely grants interviews except on a friendly morning radio show on detroits wjr that blankets the uaws southeast michigan heartland there mr gettelfinger often hits his consistent themes the case for nationalizing health care the need to get tougher on trade rather than get into negotiating details but some of the givebacks he may accept and trade offs he would demand are becoming clearer from discussions with current and former uaw officials familiar with his thinking the insiders say mr gettelfinger is increasingly open to lump sum payments for workers in place of some wage increases which are far more costly to auto makers in part because they increase workers pensions mr gettelfinger has begun signaling that the union may need to make work rule concessions at gm and soon to be independent chrysler groups plants to match those already allowed in the past two years at ford which he viewed as the most distressed of the three ford has been able to hire nonunion workers for functions such as janitors halving their wages and benefits fords job classifications also were pared allowing fewer workers and more flexible duties in reworking health care coverage mr gettelfinger wants to limit the burden for new retirees those too young to be covered by medicare who would feel the biggest hit he feels retirees already gave enough in difficult agreements with both gm and ford uaw insiders say but on the wjr radio show yesterday mr gettelfinger said he now thinks chrysler needs the same retiree health care deal which he refused to give the company before some chrysler officials believe mr gettelfingers reluctance influenced daimlerchrysler ags decision this year to sell off the u s arm to private equity firm cerberus capital management llc though he and daimlerchrysler publicly dispute that was a factor uaw insiders say mr gettelfinger is willing to let auto makers cut back a wide range of so called joint programs that provide union jobs but cost auto makers hundreds of millions of dollars a year they include company sponsored day care and sponsorship of nascar races to slow or stop the membership decline mr gettelfinger is expected to demand a bigger role for union members in building new innovations such as hybrid engines and clean diesel technology uaw membership could sink below this year half the unions numbers years ago mr gettelfinger is said to want to tie the union to a potentially growing part of the auto industry most makers hybrid engines are built outside the u s the smaller steps can add up cost of living raises which arent matched at toyota motor corp and other foreign makers cost &# million at gm alone according to gms estimate uaw workers also get an average more minutes a day in break time compared with toyota or hondas plant workers according to the u s companies that costs ford for instance about &# million a year or &# a vehicle mr gettelfinger has been preparing the ground for change by lowering union members expectations says one former senior uaw official in a speech he made at the uaws constitutional convention in las vegas in june mr gettelfinger told members "the kind of challenges we face arent the kind that can be ridden out theyre structural challenges and they require new and farsighted solutions " but the u s auto makers have bigger ideas in mind to get closer to &# billion in savings one major objective especially for gm and ford is getting some or all of &# billion in retiree health care liabilities off their books by spinning it into a separate off balance sheet trust that would be protected from losses even if an auto maker went into bankruptcy proceedings that alone they say could close almost half the gap in labor costs about of which comes from retiree pensions and health care management in detroit has talked tough about pushing back uaw labor costs many times only to accept the status quo but the last two years have been different after the bankruptcy of auto parts making giant delphi corp buyouts of more than auto workers a steep sales slide at ford and the cerberus deal last month most importantly car makers once virtually hostage to uaw strike threats have advanced the globalization of their operations to the point where the unions power to control production is rapidly diminishing chrysler recently announced plans to build a &# million engine factory in mexico and gm and ford also have been building more of their mainstream u s models there chrysler has a deal to build small cars in china ford plans to build a forthcoming subcompact sedan in brazil in years past uaw presidents would rally the rank and file ahead of a bargaining year by vowing to battle for substantial gains in wages and benefits but that suits neither the situation nor mr gettelfingers style some union and industry officials say raised on a farm outside depauw ind near the kentucky border mr gettelfinger often talks tough about management and sometimes spices his barbs with barnyard images he once called executives of delphi "hogs slopping at the trough " he started his career as a chassis line repairman at fords louisville ky assembly plant in earned his accounting degree at indiana university in the s and became the uaw plant chairman in he emphasized quality improvement issues and is credited by ford managers at the plant with saving it from closure in he was elected a uaw international vice president and was voted into the top job in the favored candidate of the fiery outgoing president steve yokich "he thought ron was very bright very capable and what he lacked in ward heeling he more than made up for in hard work " says pete pestillo former head of ford labor relations who has worked closely with both men in mr gettelfinger was able to win a relatively flush contract with all three auto makers along with overall wage increases of during the four year deal mr gettelfinger preserved a program called the jobs bank which since the s has effectively required the detroit auto makers to pay laid off workers nearly full wages for years even if their jobs were clearly and permanently gone an early riser who likes to start work as early as a m mr gettelfinger saw his endurance as a bargaining advantage say uaw officials "ron negotiated for straight hours in september during national talks with chrysler then he called the meeting done at a m " said a person involved in the negotiations "two hours later he was banging on doors saying ok lets get it going he is indefatigable " but events overtook the deal and forced mr gettelfinger into a painful retreat by march gm chairman and ceo rick wagoner warned that the companys results would be far worse than expected when the last contract was signed as gms u s sales were slumping despite costly discounts mr wagoner blamed the huge debts owed to retired employees and hinted gm might impose cuts in retiree benefits unilaterally and let the union fight them in court after the fact an uncertain proposition mr gettelfinger demanded time to conduct his own review he took the unusual step for the uaw of hiring an investment banking firm lazard ltd along with the new york based law firm cleary gottlieb steen &amp hamilton and milliman a washington d c based actuary to study gms finances and economic projections the point was to convince uaw skeptics that gm needed the help say uaw insiders mr gettelfinger also toured the companys normally secret design studios to study clay models of vehicles that gm had planned for the coming years his conclusion and lazards despite a potential uptick from the new car models gm was in even worse shape than it wanted to admit mr gettelfinger took months to agree to a package of health care concessions and then almost upended the deal when his negotiators proposed that the auto maker shift its health care liabilities to a uaw managed fund gm negotiators at the time decided to take the health care deal they had in hand rather than spend weeks or months diving into mr gettelfingers new proposal uaw retirees now pay as much as &# a year per family for coverage they had no out of pocket expenses before the deal was expected to save gm &# billion over six years in the tv interview to air this weekend mr gettelfinger calls the agreement "the most difficult decision i ever had to make in all of the years i have been involved with the union " and adds "maybe not doing anything in would have been the right thing to do is there ever any end to it " at the time mr gettelfinger warned members the alternative outcome could be a bankruptcy filing for gm the deal passed in october with in favor a close vote by union standards then a similar pact with ford squeaked by with less than of the vote the uaw said mr gettelfinger then dragged out similar talks with chrysler and never concluded a deal
