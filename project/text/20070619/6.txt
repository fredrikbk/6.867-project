albanias high regard for america has a long history your june editorial "why albanians love america" is only partially correct its quite true albanians hold america in high esteem because of the u s led military intervention that stopped the serbs from ethnically cleansing kosovo and president bushs strong support for kosovos independence further warmed albanian affections but there is more to this love affair albanians will never forget president woodrow wilsons intercession at the paris peace conference to save albania from being devoured by greece and serbia however the key reason for this admiration is that after suffering through five decades of communist repression under a brutal dictator followed by a succession of corrupt governments as a fledgling democracy albanians view america as a beacon of freedom and hope and as one albanian so fittingly stated during the presidents historic visit "those people who protest against bush do not understand what evil means because they never had communism " to albanians life in a totalitarian state enforced by terrorism is clearly not just a "bumper sticker slogan " gary q kokalari president albanian heritage foundation new york your editorials have often lamented about liberals "rewriting history " so i think a little clarification might be in order about your take on kosovo and albanians in march president clinton and prime minister blair did a bold end run around the u n security council after it refused to support their planned "air war" on kosovo their decision to then use nato in an aerial bombing campaign was prematurely derided by several media pundits including commentaries on your editorial pages as insufficient since it lacked an accompanying ground invasion nonetheless the punitive air strikes lasted long days and eventually "forced out slobodan milosevics ethnic cleansers " less than six months later the u n high commissioner for refugees reported that more than of the displaced albanian refugees had returned home to kosovo this is the main reason why albanians love america jack nargundkar germantown md your editorial describes accurately the basis for albanians gratitude toward the u s on the basis of u s support for kosovos independence from serbia however your assessment of the situation ignores the very important basis for serbias outrage over losing kosovo namely kosovo had been an integral part of orthodox christian serbia for centuries before the nazis in world war ii "relieved" our serbian allies from their historic lands and handed over the region to their obsequious albanian collaborators in this situation loving america is insufficient justification for rewarding what most serious serbs view as treachery the deep sensitivities driving this issue cannot be ignored just to support preconceived notions of justice david bour cupertino calif
