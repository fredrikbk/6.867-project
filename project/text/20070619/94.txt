reflections on the glass house new canaan conn i have been an observer and participant in the history of philip johnsons glass house during its entire well publicized life cycle but i was unprepared for the overwhelming sense of loss i experienced when visiting recently while the house was being readied for its opening to the public as a national trust property on june philip johnson died in and his partner david whitney in but the house and its acre complex of land and buildings here had already been willed in to the national trust for historic preservation a formidable challenge for an organization with a comfort zone somewhere between the th and th centuries the glass house of course is a house like no other an iconic landmark of th century modernism that played a vital role in the creative culture of its day although it possesses a singular fame of its own it is not an isolated artifact it is part of an intensely personal unique collection of art and architecture in a meticulously landscaped setting buildings philip johnson designed and constructed and artworks acquired and installed over half a century from the s through the s this constantly growing and changing complex was the lifework of a man of keen intelligence and insatiable curiosity who cultivated all that was new interesting provocative and entertaining in the art intellectual and social worlds the first two buildings the glass house and the brick house both completed in were a counterpoint to each other transparent and solid open and closed with a courtyard between additions soon followed painting and sculpture galleries a library and study a diminutive lake pavilion and assorted follies and delights each reflected philip johnsons fascination with someone or something at the time or a riff on the latest thing the entrance to his underground painting gallery was inspired by the archaic greek lion gate at mycenae the multilevel skylit sculpture gallery paid homage to the early work of the brilliant th century maverick english architect james stirling all expressed the elegant discerning and idiosyncratic tastes of a man who did much to shape and define the arts of the th century through his creative patronage and impeccable connoisseurship in retrospect what he built for his own pleasure not only mirrored his continuous eclectic search for aesthetic stimulation but helped to validate the historical license of later postmodernism a movement he joined enthusiastically the glass house was incubator and salon a place where talent was fostered and conversation dazzled where plots and parties and pure enchantment filled magic summer afternoons not exactly your historic house with hoopskirts in spite of a sense of full stop and finality to all that and the haunting emptiness of the silent house and its plastic shrouded furniture the day i visited there was an air of excitement and anticipation as the staff dealt with structural repairs and fading memorabilia juggled dates of opening festivities and trial run tours and prepared schedules of programs and activities far out into the future nor will the opening be less than gala an inaugural picnic on the grounds will feature the restaging of a merce cunningham dance performance with gourmet basket lunches and tours of the property my own tour was pure nostalgia my first job was with philip johnson at the museum of modern art when he was building the house and i have visited often over the years i have watched the glass house become the glass house as it settled into modernist history the national trust has only recently ventured seriously into the thorny terrain of th century modernism with properties like this one and mies van der rohes farnsworth house in plano ill earlier national trust acquisitions of th century houses by frank lloyd wright fit more easily into the model house mode of appropriately furnished restored rooms with a few well chosen personal accessories christy maclear executive director of philip johnsons glass house for the national trust recognizes the unprecedented nature of the project but finds it neither sad nor daunting ms maclear has had to face two major challenges how to keep something that was always on the lively edge of the new from becoming a lifeless simulacrum and the even more difficult problem that goes straight to the heart of the matter how to deal with a period and a style for which no models exist and standards are only evolving at a time when the modernist architecture of the th century is being rapidly and thoughtlessly demolished obviously the glass house could not follow the formula of a tastefully reinvented past you cant reinvent philip johnson the solution has been to present the glass house as more than a historic house using it as a catalyst for the appreciation and preservation of th century architecture art and landscape much as messrs johnson and whitney promoted those arts while they were alive events at the house will focus on other modernist buildings and causes as a way of addressing the current crisis in preservation and modernism an artist in residence program will stress the kind of creative design intended to carry on the two mens encouragement of new talent there will be no "authentic reproductions" those genteel knockoffs and certified fakes that are the staples of museum and historic house gift shops everywhere since a gift shop is as de rigueur in a visitors center as the restrooms it has been decreed that only commissioned original products will be carried the question of where to put the visitors center loomed large philip johnsons last building completed in and affectionately known as da monsta for its bold eccentricity reflective of his admiration for the architecture of frank gehry or the work of the artist frank stella or both take your pick was built with that in mind but its small ski slope interior seemed less suited to the rites of tourism than to a tipsy tearoom suggested by a couple of anticipatory tables and chairs the wise decision was made to put the building off site eliminating arriving and departing buses and activities not conducive to a pastoral experience the new visitors center is in town next to the railroad station and tours also wisely will be limited to small groups to say the decisions that have been made about the meaning and message of the glass house are sensitive and enlightened does not begin to do the process justice this is an innovative and important preservation breakthrough arrived at after rigorous thought and study every aspect of the presentation has received the same careful attention the glass houses public image known in marketing speak as "branding" yes a lot of upscale marketing is involved depends on the right graphics for all printed and visual matter supplied by pentagram studios the "visitors guide" is a handsome set of cards each a superb photograph of a single feature with a description on the back i suspect there was considerable discussion about the elimination of the apostrophe in "visitors " it would have been a snap decision for philip johnson repairs were made including a new roof that were skipped as the two men grew older there were works of art and furnishings that required restoration access for the handicapped has been provided as invisibly as possible the routes carefully plotted and covered with grass to be indistinguishable from the setting but some things remain undone only a miracle can restore the painting that was as iconic as the house itself nicolas poussins "burial of phocion " the th century classical landscape on a freestanding easel that was central to the life and look of the house and backdrop to every conversation timeless in its beauty it affirmed the enduring compatibility of great art and echoed the embracing seasons that mr johnson called his "wallpaper " i first knew the painting when it was on the wall of the office where i worked in mr johnsons architecture department at moma he had it hanging there temporarily while he built the house it was an unforgettable part of my coming of age when i saw it on my visit it had become a heartbreaking murky ruin paint flaking colors vanished and figures barely discernable destroyed by time sunlight and neglect the house will live on as philip johnson intended but some things are gone forever ms huxtable is the journals architecture critic
