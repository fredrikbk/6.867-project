flash fortress time waster strategy game pits players against desktop invasion online edition for every online hit like second life there are hundreds of smaller web based games that make a brief splash and fade into the digital background "desktop tower defense " a no budget game made by a first time designer has kept its audience hooked the strategy game challenges players to craft elaborate fortress style defenses against waves of attackers since its march release "desktop td" has been played more than million times according to its creator paul preece a programmer for a british company that makes automated testing software it has also brought in more than &# in ad revenue and donations he says even though the hand sketched game started as a hobby project with few costs the tower defense game genre doesnt involve "playing" in the most obvious sense there are no button mashing kills instead the goal is to strategically build a military defense infrastructure to thwart invaders the "desktop td" battlefield is literally mr preeces home office workstation stray pens and loose currency included "it took me two evenings to get the mess right " says the year old resident of basingstoke u k the player deploys a series of tower shaped weapons to halt the advance of "creep" hordes across the messy domain for each creep that completes its migration the player loses a life as a tower defense general players are confined to a budget and a limited arsenal killing creeps rewards players with more gold that can be spent on additional weapons and upgrades ranging from slow shooting pellet guns to cannons that emit icy blasts placing the weapons is a point and click process creeps appear every half minute from the left and top sides of the screen simultaneously as the game progresses variations on the standard blob like enemy appear some spawn two smaller creeps when shot others fly over or zip past defenses at high speed the "easy" level cuts the number of creeps in half and provides players a fat budget on "expert " creeps can sustain more damage at the highest levels players are asked to survive levels or oppressive time limits among other tortures choosing the right weapons and upgrades is important but placing them is vital weapons also act as roadblocks which divert the progress of the mindless creeps or lead them to their demise there are myriad ways to play but every successful strategy requires the construction of an elaborate deadly maze "desktop td" is mr preeces first game design effort he chose to write the game in flash which has little in common with the visual basic he uses at work "programming is programming " he says "flash is just one of these technologies that make games look good " he thought flash would be easy to learn after a friend in january released a tower defense game called "flash element td " but making "desktop" attractive was a challenge "im not an artist and i cant do much with graphics " mr preece says as an alternative to pc graphics he scanned pencil drawings of creeps and towers which ultimately gives "desktop td" its low fidelity charm handdrawngames com the name of mr preeces web site is a nod to his artistic workaround mr preece spread the word about "desktop td" using a social web browsing tool called stumbleupon from there avid players took over the promotional duties posting on digg and game clearinghouses like i am bored com and kongregate com "desktop tower defense should be banned " tech blogger michael arrington wrote in mid april on his popular blog techcrunch in april and may "desktop td" was played more than million times mr preece says citing his own statistics over that stretch he found as many as people playing at the same time finding gamers was the easy part keeping players connected to his web site was mr preeces real challenge flash games are famously easy to reproduce on outside web sites often without the game creators permission mr preeces solution include code that launches his web site at the end of each game no matter where it is hosted players are then given the option to post their final score as an added incentive mr preece made the scoreboard public to stoke competition co workers and friends can also set up private group scoreboards "the scoreboard is one of the main reasons for the games appeal " he thinks players can launch a new game from the scoreboard a sort of magnet that lures players back to his site the strategy seems to be working even though "desktop td" has been reposted elsewhere mr preece estimates a large majority of "desktop td" games are played on his site he included coding in his game to help him track where completed games are launched mr preece has given up trying to own the top score and avid competitors have long since surpassed his best score hes focused on rolling out "desktop td" updates that keep obsessive players busy new weapons new challenges and soon a multiplayer version of the game but the biggest change has been in mr preeces professional ambitions what started out as a hobby bloomed into a career change earlier this month mr preece left his software job to become a self employed game creator along with dave scott the friend whose game first lured mr preece into the field write to aaron rutkoff at aaron rutkoff wsj com
