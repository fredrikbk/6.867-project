biofuel or bust on the road with e as debate over the viability of ethanol as an alternative energy source continues few drivers know exactly what it is or where to get the biofuel along with an estimated million other americans i spent memorial day weekend on the road but i was determined to use only e a blend of ethanol and gasoline on a mile trip from new york city to indianapolis and back the trip in a flexfuel chevrolet suburban confirmed some of es shortcomings including limited availability but also shed light on its potential as a money saving gas alternative just finding e can be a challenge of the gas stations in the u s a little more than pump e that may be more than triple the in early reported by the national ethanol vehicle coalition but its still just of all stations that meant planning working out the trip using a map and the department of energys alternative fueling station locator www eere energy gov afdc showed i would have to make concessions instead of shooting straight toward ohio from new york along interstate i had to detour through philadelphia and pittsburgh where e was available adding about miles to the trip a high concentration of stations in the midwest made it easier to gas up farther into the trip but i couldnt afford to wing it in the eastern portions where e is rare so i called before my trip to double check supply and station hours a new experience my first stop in philadelphia was at a small shell station just outside center city i spent &# paying &# per gallon for just under gallons the highest per gallon price i paid for e the station attendant had some initial difficulty turning on the pump the only old fashioned manual kind of the stations five back in the car my passenger and i debated the generally accepted pros and cons of e ethanol discussions often head into complex territory but for consumers the basics are simple enough pros e is a renewable energy source growing the feedstock usually corn recycles carbon emissions are fewer gas engines require only minor changes to burn e and none for e a blend of gas and ethanol the cost premium of an e capable vehicle is a small fraction of diesel or hybrid technology flex fuel vehicles can run on either gas or ethanol cons es low energy content cuts flex fuel vehicles fuel economy by about availability is limited concerns loom over water used to grow crops corn prices are soaring a lack of appealing vehicles is another serious problem exhibit a the massive suburban borrowed from general motors for the trip at first glance www fueleconomy gov spits out a list of nearly e compatible vehicles in reality there are models since the environmental protection agency lists each trim level and drive train option as a separate line item most of the vehicles are heavy suvs pickups or big vans or less than exciting models like the ford crown victoria and saturn relay vehicles not long for the market but still available in there are no efficient high tech compact sedans like the prius favored by many eco conscious drivers on the list according to auto makers the surplus of big thirsty vehicles like the chevy suburban and others including the ford f nissan armada jeep commander and dodge durango has to do with the types of vehicles desired by customers in markets where e is most readily available still its difficult to find an attractive poster child for e when the most efficient models barely crack miles to the gallon on the highway my excitement at having a full tank of e was quickly dulled by the lack of perceptible performance difference between the renewable fuel and regular gas the driving experience was in fact indistinguishable no electrical whine of a hybrid motor no gurgling growl of a diesel nothing to let me know i was driving greener reduced fuel economy was noticeable a suburban gets between and mpg whereas on e the same vehicle earns just to mpg the difference in efficiency ethanol proponents are quick to point out is counterbalanced by several factors including a federal cent price subsidy per gallon also a suburban running on e pollutes less according to the epa government figures show it produces less than half as much air pollution and cuts greenhouse gas emissions by about a year on the highway where gms active fuel management technology deactivates four of the eight cylinders the suburban got around mpg slightly higher than the epas rating but when traffic slowed or i turned off onto a busy street mileage plummeted often to below mpg in monroeville pa a busy suburb of pittsburgh the biggest current benefit of e was evident regular gasoline was nearly &# a gallon more than a dollar above the &# per gallon for e as a long line formed at the e pump drivers said they were drawn to the lower price and two of the four i chatted with said they were filling up with ethanol for the first time most shrugged off the environmental benefits as a bonus about miles into the trip in oberlin ohio i ran into my biggest problem a station was unexpectedly closed leaving me on "e" with no e in driving range i got half a tank of regular gasoline and continued toward indianapolis waiting for me in indianapolis was the indy this year the entire field of cars was fueled by pure ethanol and racing at speeds of more than miles per hour the hope is that such promotion will inspire diehard fans and gear heads and create a small but motivated constituency of evangelists say representatives from the ethanol promotion and information council a group of producers and suppliers thoughts of ethanol quickly vanished once the green flag dropped and the race began still one jolt from the cars thundering by went a long way toward confirming ethanols compatibility with high performance environments the trip back gave me time to think about e for many consumers in parts of the midwest with access to the fuel its a no brainer even factoring in hot button issues like the price of corn and the effect demand has on local economies the bottom line is price matters my experience indicated that a lower price drives traffic to e pumps most of the ethanol consumers i met were only mildly interested in the environmental benefits let alone the foreign policy implications until availability becomes much more widespread the debate is likely to remain nebulous for most consumers popular events like the indy may help ethanol earn some goodwill among car enthusiasts but broad based acceptance likely lies at the end of a very long road email matt vella wsj com
