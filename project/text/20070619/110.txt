the daily fix has auto racing discovered its version of tiger woods online edition lewis hamilton the year old briton who has finished in the top three in his first seven formula one races is provoking some unusual comparisons from columnists the indianapolis stars bob kravitz after watching mr hamilton win his second straight race in indy sees another tiger woods "he is tiger woods with horsepower " mr kravitz writes "hes got tigers toothy smile hes got tigers disarmingly easy manner with the public hes got tigers multi racial lineage and most of all hes got tigers preternatural talent flowering at such a maddeningly early age " but the independents james lawton cautions that great talent at a young age can be squandered pointing to mike tyson once convicted of rape in indy site of mr hamiltons latest triumph "in the case of hamilton though the portents are so promising his nature and character apparently so strong and the support of his father anthony so all encompassing that by comparison the sense is of a kind of miracle " mr lawton writes all the attention paid to mr hamilton the only black driver in any major racing circuit prompts florida times union columnist sam borden to tell the tale of wendell scott "the only black driver ever to win a top level nascar race " only mr scott was robbed of his rightful on track celebration by a nominal scoring error years ago "scott didnt get to party like hamilton did last week up in montreal didnt get to party at all really and certainly didnt get to lift a trophy " mr borden writes "he didnt even get a trophy until a month later at a race in savannah ga and it wasnt the real one " don barnette feels that racism also cost him a sporting chance at playing basketball for cincinnati back in the school accepted his white high school co captain but rejected him mr barnette shrugged off the slight starred at miami of ohio and went on to play for the harlem globetrotters today as tom archdeacon recounts in the dayton daily news mr barnette makes it his mission to teach young basketball players about black players who "paid their dues" to make todays riches possible in all sports for all comers with the requisite skill the fixs tour of bad baseball teams none of whom have made the playoffs for years begins in baltimore where as noted here yesterday the orioles canned manager sam perlozzo baltimore sun columnist peter schmuck focuses on what might be the clubs next big change owner peter angelos is expected to hire former twins and cubs executive andy macphail as chief operating officer why might mr angelos be rethinking his organizations questionable management structure "the continuing decline in gate receipts and other ballpark revenue is blunting the positive economic impact of the mid atlantic sports network " mr schmuck writes "the fans are becoming increasingly vocal in their discontent in short the team has become a personal embarrassment at just the point when angelos believed it would be ready to turn a corner " the colorado rockies parked in fourth place in the nl west are charging &# for tickets to see the new york yankees come to town this week "guess this is not the dusty old cowtown it once was " mark kiszla writes in the denver post "even mediocrity no longer comes cheap around here diners who have more money than sense can fork over &# bucks for a steak in a local restaurant it seems criminal to pay &# per day for the privilege of parking your car in a little garage on the prairie at our airport but the biggest rip off of consumers in denver the rockies win the rockies win " sometimes badness is all about location location location a decade ago when baseball reshuffled into six divisions the kansas city royals had the chance to move from the al into the nl central instead the milwaukee brewers made the jump now the royals are against the nl in interleague play but against their own league meanwhile the brewers are just against the al but have feasted on the weak nl central to build up a seven game division lead "over the last three seasons the royals are against the american league which is sensationally bad " joe posnanski writes in the kansas city star "but against the national league they are a winning record and them some its a winning percentage higher than any team in the national league central right now " mr posnanski concludes that the royals should have made the switch even if a certain local columnist argued otherwise back in the usually cynical los angeles times columnist t j simers cant muster much bite about local philanthropist paul salata years old and full of energy and generosity "he likes to buy lottery scratch offs and just give them to people when he hears about a newborn baby he makes a point of sending a gift business cards with the babys name and address under the title professional kid " the sports angle here is an annual charity event " years ago he began to honor the last player selected in the nfl draft with a free trip to newport beach " mr simers writes "this year the no player picked bought himself a &# watch so hearing that salata will now make sure mr irrelevant gets a &# gold watch too since the arrival party takes place at the beach mr irrelevant is seated on a lifeguard stand and one by one gifts donated by local businesses are placed in his lap ultimately burying him the northern trust bank makes mr irrelevant a millionaire for the day and presents him with a check for &# the one day interest on &# million its just one more crazy salata idea " the madcap festivities have raised roughly &# million for charities a while back we passed along a question for fix readers from our print colleague jonathan eig who has tickets for the san francisco giants july game at wrigley field against the chicago cubs what would you do if barry bonds was sitting on or and you had tickets go to the game sell the tickets throw them away yesterday jonathan acknowledged some of his favorite responses from fix readers he writes us today with his response to your responses and his choice of two winners dear fix your wise and passionate readers have spoken and cursed and screamed and rambled the overwhelming majority tried to convince me i should go see the game regardless of how i feel about bonds some said i should boo some said i should sit in silence some said i should hold up a sign with a big asterisk one of my buddies suggested i go wearing a atlanta braves cap all these fans made the same basic argument that the game is bigger than bonds and that a true fan should never miss a chance to witness baseball history i was almost convinced but not quite and heres why my presence at the game whether i cheer or sit in silence wont make any difference if the ghost of babe ruth were to show up at the ballpark belching and shouting "fraud" into a megaphone bonds wouldnt care if bud selig shows up or stays away bonds wont care nor should he the decision not to attend is about me not bonds id rather he didnt break aarons record if he does break it id rather not see it happen its that simple so im giving the first signed copy of my book "opening day the story of jackie robinsons first season " to chris bergman who suggested that i send my unused tickets to cooperstown so that the national baseball hall of fame will have evidence of fans distaste for the home run king im also sending a book to frank luby who said he would take his five year old son to the game and try to explain to him the controversy surrounding bonds good luck with that conversation frank as for my two tickets if bonds has a shot ill give them to my year old son he can bring along anybody he wants maybe ill ask him to save me the stubs best jonathan eig found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your find for inclusion in the daily fix
