the numbers guy sorry you may have gone over your limit of network friends is there a numerical cap on how many friends we can have as users of facebook myspace and other social networking sites pile up hundreds even thousands of "friends " several commentators and news articles have cautioned that there is a natural limit to a friendship circle they typically cite the so called dunbars number as a ceiling on our personal contacts this limit was derived by extrapolating from social groups in nonhuman primates and then crediting people with greater capacity because of our larger neocortex the part of the brain used for conscious thought and language but there is reason to believe that the social networking sites will enable their users to burst past dunbars number for friends just as humans have developed and harnessed technology to surpass their physical limits on speed strength and the ability to process information robin dunbar an oxford anthropologist whose research gave rise to the magical count of doesnt use social networking sites himself but he says they could "in principle" allow users to push past the limit "its perfectly possible that the technology will increase your memory capacity " he says the question is whether those who keep ties to hundreds of people do so to the detriment of their closest relationships defined by prof dunbar as those formed with people you turn to when in severe distress "technology doesnt change that a whole bunch you really do need to be touchy feely with people " adds alistair sutcliffe who studies human computer interaction at the university of manchester the researchers are part of a u k group studying the impact of technology on personal relationships that sentiment also was corroborated by an online survey managed by will reader a sheffield hallam university lecturer in psychology dr reader announced the results of the first surveys of young people and their networking habits in september to much fanfare the news was spun as proof that friendships still generally start offline less close friendships and acquaintanceships however also die offline while the web can help sustain them at the outer edges of your friend group are the people you dont talk to regularly but who count toward dunbars number if youre likely to swap tales or more should your paths cross a couple of former colleagues you run into at an airport bar and have a drink with might qualify so would a long lost high school friend passing through town and asking for a place to stay "you would probably have to do a lot of catching up but they know you fit into their social world and you know they fit into yours " prof dunbar says "you have a history " similar sorts of contacts can be managed on an online social network which helps you to keep ties with people who have moved far enough away that they might otherwise have fallen away from your social group "you can communicate with people on facebook in a very low cost way " dr reader says even before facebook dunbars number never represented a true limit to friends other primates mostly inhabit single coherent groups as did our ancestors in that case may be the cap on effective group interactions at least in contexts like business units or self governing villages but modern man moves among several groups in a fragmented world often with little or no overlap between work play school and family also prof dunbars research has focused on average friend circle sizes not maxima there is a wide variation in the size and makeup of peoples friend groups he cited a range of to in a paper with low tech help politicians and business leaders long have been able to exceed so called friends christopher allen a berkeley calif social software consultant points out aides can jot down notes on a long list of constituents that a politician can refer to when needed facebook and its ilk have democratized that system by making it free and easy for everyone to do the same going beyond simple email and personal web sites in the past new friends and contacts might have replaced old ones as you graduated from college switched jobs or moved to a new city now old friends can stick around alongside the new ones on your myspace when you have occasion to call on one of them a page contains all the vital stats youll need to renew the acquaintance if the numbers game sounds tawdry to you youd fit in with the u k researchers who are looking at the effects of such friend hoarding "the cheapness of communication is a double edged sword " dr reader says whereas you might enrich your life with more contacts the things that are "important for intimate friendships " such as presents meals and a ride in your car he says dont exist prof dunbar isnt sold on the idea that social networks make his number outdated the research he says "made us realize people dont know what these wretched things called relationships are and that helps explain why were so bad at them " email me at numbersguy wsj com read daily commentary about numbers and join a discussion with readers at my free blog wsj com numbersguy
