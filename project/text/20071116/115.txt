weekend journal the drivers seat ford focus ford focus getting more mileage from an old favorite i live a half hours drive from ford motor co s dearborn mich headquarters close enough that on the list of appropriate conversation topics with strangers "whats wrong with ford " ranks just behind the weather sadly michigans soggy fall and gloomy winter tend to be cheerier subjects fords "significant progress" in the third quarter losing less money than last year may have placated wall street for the time being but in these parts were still fretting over the future of the blue oval fords financial improvement has come more by shrinking than by selling cars fords rationalization is that it has stemmed the bleeding and can now go ahead and start getting better job one is resuscitating its namesake brand by building new wonderful vehicles ones that americans really want to buy this sounds smart but it bears asking whether a company that is making deep cuts just to stay afloat will have the talent and resources to deliver even if it can and thats a big "if" the fact that lead times in the auto industry tend to run months or so means the wonderful stuff wont be here next year so for the ford brand will instead make do with more of the same like its speciously "new" focus this is the latest version of fords compact car which dates to the model year when it debuted to critical acclaim that focus was a revelation for ford the successful culmination of two decades of attempts at building a "world car " a single model that could be sold in north america europe or elsewhere more important it was a truly great car with a fresh design that offered sporty handling and impressive value it stood out in the u s market because of its hatchback body which came to be offered in both three and five door models these were sold alongside more conventional sedans and station wagons the focus underwent several changes over the years but marks the first time the car has been comprehensively redesigned at least thats part of the story ford actually created a completely new focus for but chose not to sell that car in north america for our market ford stuck with the original focus platform and has only now reworked it for the model that went on sale in late september while the changes to the car are significant some of them are also problematic chief among them is a new coupe body style the two hatchbacks and the wagon were eighty sixed which ford says will better match competitive offerings in the segment that means the honda civic which is unquestionably the best compact coupe sold in america but the new focus is as ungainly as the civic is sleek and futuristic thats because ford didnt spend the money to change the focuss underlying structure but instead grafted on a new exterior fords executive director for design peter horbury admits that the cars resultant proportions are not as ideal as they would have been in a "clean sheet of paper" design fords stylists seem to have worked overtime to mitigate this situation by frantically adding numerous "character lines" on the hood and side panels bumpers that look like they were sawed off at strange angles and a silly plastic "applique" on the front fender the overall design is disjointed and gives the impression that change was made simply for changes sake not only is the honda better looking it has also caught up to the ford in terms of driving dynamics the focus is still a nimble handler but so too is the newest civic on the other hand ford has improved the efficiency of the focuss two liter four cylinder engine and its mpg epa combined fuel economy is now just one mile per gallon short of the civics of note is fords continuing use of a four speed automatic transmission when some in the industry have moved on to automatics with an extra cog or two this hurts the focuss highway economy which is mpg compared to for the civic with a five speed automatic inside the interior layout is now a model of simplicity and function one of the few areas in which this focus trumps its forebearer another improvement is safety equipment the focus has standard seat mounted side airbags as well as side curtain airbags unfortunately ford continues to use antiquated led look displays for the radio and other instrument panel functions these date to the s look even older and betray fords big marketing push behind the microsoft sync technology that graces the top of the line focus trim level sync is both a hands free bluetooth based phone system and a voice activated music player thats compatible with ipods and plenty of other media devices its a neat idea but the software is buggy and the interface is inconsistent the most annoying problem during my week of testing was that the car kept switching on the bluetooth music function of my cellphone even after i had turned it off sync also had a problem finding some of the music on my ipod nano ford said that if the song artist album and genre data tags for a song are not all filled in sync will ignore the track but even fords chief engineer for sync couldnt explain why the system could play the same files from my ipod shuffle the irony of all ironies is that i was entirely unable to call my main public relations contact at ford using sync because the voice recognition system couldnt parse his two syllable name no matter how i said it it seems that ford has bought into the common software industry practice of beta testing new technology on early adopters ford maintains that syncs software has the potential to be updated and engineers are already busy working on version of the system however the company remains undecided on what if any upgrade path will be offered to customers perhaps the bigger question is whether anyone will buy a &# car the base coupe starts at &# less just to get sync even if they do it doesnt change the fact that ford is using electronics as a marketing band aid for an aging platform by comparison the honda civic has been completely re engineered not once but twice since fords original focus rolled into dealerships that this new focus is still almost competitive with the civic is more a testament to the original product development and design team than a compliment to anyone making decisions at ford today contact me at jeff sabatini wsj com
