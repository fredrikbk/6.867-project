russia oil output to rise modestly tax breaks are weighed to encourage production as supply worries grow rome russian oil output will grow only modestly over the next few years but the government is considering new tax breaks to stimulate investment and boost production russias energy minister said in an interview viktor khristenko said russia the worlds no crude exporter after saudi arabia would produce around million barrels per day of oil by up from million barrels a day this year as new projects in eastern siberia offshore sakhalin island and the arctic north come on stream but he warned there would be no return to the stellar production growth of earlier this decade when output soared by more than a year his remarks suggest production growth in russia one of the worlds most important sources of oil will continue to be strained at a time of rising concerns about supplies in global energy markets worries about tight supply have helped push oil to just shy of &# a barrel this month though it has retreated slightly in the past few days the benchmark oil futures price on the new york mercantile exchange closed yesterday at &# a one day drop of cents driven by an unexpectedly large buildup in u s oil inventories russia became a major source of new crude earlier this decade as companies applied cheap technology to boost output at existing wells but those easy productivity gains have played themselves out and mature fields in places like western siberia are in decline growth must now come from remote areas like the arctic that will require huge investments something the countrys current tax regime doesnt encourage but russia is still one of the few oil rich nations outside the organization of petroleum exporting countries that is pumping more oil every year in contrast to mature oil provinces like the north sea which are petering out "with oil production expected to grow by barrels a day this year russia is still outperforming the rest of non opec " said paul horsnell an oil analyst at barclays capital mr khristenko said moscow was planning new tax breaks for the industry "i see a need to fine tune the tax system to create conditions for the development of new projects for example on the continental shelf and in remote areas " he said on the sidelines of an energy conference in rome russian ministers are considering a proposal to extend a tax holiday currently enjoyed by companies working in eastern siberia to offshore regions he said the break has already been applied to mature oilfields requiring costly enhanced oil recovery techniques to make sure they keep producing the government also wants to reduce a domestic excise tax on refined products he said but these moves may not be enough to quell the chorus of protests recently raised against russias tax regime the russian states marginal tax take on revenue from oil above &# a barrel is almost cents on the dollar a vestige of a time when oil prices were much lower those sums are collected in a rainy day stabilization fund which now stands at &# billion russian oil companies say the high tax rate leaves them with little upside to profit from the recent price surge addressing an oil conference in london last month bob dudley chief executive of tnk bp ltd bp plcs russian joint venture called for "a genuine review of taxes and rates in an era when costs and risks of investing in major new green field projects are historically greater than ever " but mr khristenko dismissed the oil companies complaints "ive never met a taxpayer who was happy about paying taxes " he said noting that russia lowered crude production taxes earlier this year analysts say the problem with russias tax system is that it is based on revenue not profits so there is no distinction made for example between the first and th year of production in contrast the norm elsewhere is that oil companies enjoy accelerated capital allowances and pay substantial taxes only when they start making profit from a venture the first major attempt to ease the fiscal burden came earlier this year with the eastern siberia tax holiday which exempts a project from tax during the first years of production or the first million tons of crude output a tax discount was introduced on depleted oil fields then too oil industry officials say the tax breaks havent had much of a positive impact to date because of a range of administrative and technical problems the high marginal tax rate hasnt prevented russian corporations from making bumper profits this year gregory l white in london contributed to this article
