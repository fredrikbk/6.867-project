day sign up for the e mail here a federal appeals court ruled the bush administrations attempts to improve the fuel economy standards of suvs and light trucks an "arbitrary and capricious" failure ordering the transportation department to try again the decision included the latest step by the courts to assert the importance of dealing with greenhouse gases and interestingly enough relied on law established during the countrys last big energy crises of the s the panel of the ninth circuit court of appeals in california sided with states two cities and four environmental advocacy groups which had challenged new corporate average fuel economy standards cafe set last year by the national highway traffic safety administration the new cafe standards for suvs minivans and pickup trucks produced in the model years would rise to miles per gallon in from the current miles per gallon the appellate judges held that nhtsas so called "final rule" was contrary to the energy policy and conservation act of which was passed by congress in the aftermath of the mideast oil embargo nhtsa failed to "to monetize the value of carbon emissions" and thus figure out the "maximum feasible" level of cafe standards the court said and it failed to close the "suv loophole" that allows the vehicles in questions to get away with lower fuel economy standards "we also hold that the environmental assessment was inadequate and that petitioners have raised a substantial question as to whether the final rule may have a significant impact on the environment " the court said it then ordered nhtsa to come up with new standards as quickly as possible and prepare a full environmental impact statement that takes into account the implications of greenhouse gas emissions the ninth circuit has somewhat of a liberal reputation but since the supreme court in april accused the bush administration of not adequately protecting americans from greenhouse gas emission through the environmental protection agencys lack of action several court decisions have added to the body of law involving climate change risks "what this says to me is that the courts are catching up with climate change and the law is catching up with climate change " said patrick a parenteau an environmental law professor at vermont law school tells the new york times auto industry analyst tom odell describes the decision to the washington post as "another one of the federal courts saying hey greenhouse gas is something that needs to be considered as were dealing with the auto industry and emissions and mileage " and if the supreme court upholds the decision should the bush administration appeal it "means auto makers who have already planned their fleets through the next three years may have to incorporate stricter standards " the detroit news adds the industry has been fighting tighter standards on several fronts with the senate in june approving a more significant rise by and the house currently looking at the measure as the los angeles times notes the alliance of automobile manufacturers criticized the ruling as a blow to improving standards saying changes to the cafe rules "would only delay the progress that manufacturers have made " the wall street journal reports the journal says the bush administration is currently considering its options and adds "the ruling also represents a political setback for the white house at a time of &# a gallon gasoline and mounting public concern about global warming " so what are the iranians up to yesterdays report from the international atomic energy agency marked a win for the u s in its simmering fight for global backing against iran the iaea said iran "had made new but incomplete disclosures about its past nuclear activities missing a critical deadline under an agreement with the agency and virtually assuring a new push by the united states to impose stricter international sanctions " as the new york times reports and the iaea "made clear that even while providing some answers iran has continued to shield many aspects of its nuclear program " referring to irans cooperation as "reactive rather than proactive " the times adds the iaeas report sets the stage for renewed debate at the u n security council at a time when the u s and britain are pushing for tighter sanctions the los angeles times notes and newsweeks christopher dickey argues irans recent strategy with the u n watchdog isnt going to help it "do irans leaders want to be punished do they want china and russia to fall in with the united states france britain and germany to impose tougher sanctions do they want to see the leaders of the arab world united against them do they want to mix it up with israel and the united states " mr dickey asks "of course iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his gang dont say that but the juvenile games theyre playing with the international community make them look more like dangerous delinquents every day " a tough time in germany the financial times has decided to rank germanys peer steinbruck as this years "fairest finance minister of them all " crediting the way he presided over the "significant improvement in his countrys fiscal position while pirouetting gracefully through the complexities of operating in a grand coalition government comprising representatives of the two main political parties " but the ft picked a curious week to announce that honor earlier this week that coalition was shaken when vice chancellor franz muntefering who was also labor minister decided to quit the government and just yesterday mr steinbruck was forced to cancel a planned visit to beijing because chinas finance minister refused to meet with him as the ft reports china is piqued that mr steinbrucks boss chancellor angela merkel met with the dalai lama in september adding insult to injury or maybe the other way around "beijings stance could also worsen relations within ms merkels unruly grand coalition since frank walter steinmeier foreign minister and newly named vice chancellor has openly attacked the chancellor over the dalai lama meeting " the ft adds the diplomatic and political bickering comes amid a much bigger problem for many germans "a bitter three day strike by train drivers in germany has tied up freight traffic shut down an auto factory and stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers in what has become the largest work stoppage in the history of the german state railroad system " as the new york times reports the strike began with freight trains and then spread to commuter and long distance rail service giving germans "a taste of the chaos in france where the public rail transport also remains paralyzed " the times adds at the same time germany inc has been jolted by the scandals at engineering conglomerate siemens the latest development a court ruling that depicts a pattern of bribery by one manager describes siemens paying "millions of euros in bribes to cabinet ministers and dozens of other officials in nigeria russia and libya as it sought to win lucrative contracts for telecommunications equipment " the wall street journal reports that ruling the journal says "offers the most detailed picture to date of the scandal that has ensnared one of the worlds biggest conglomerates in investigations across the globe " rio tinto to take the offensive yes a combination of british mining giant rio tinto and australian rival bhp billiton would create a commodities goliath and be one of the biggest deals of all time and as rio tinto has made clear it hates the idea but
