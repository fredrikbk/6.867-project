rudys gamble give rudy giuliani this hes living his campaign slogans the flinty ex mayor keeps telling america hes fearless a risk taker the guy who can accomplish the impossible say cleaning up sin city as if to prove it hes betting the shop on a high stakes path to the republican nomination ever since a relatively unknown georgia peanut farmer used the early primary states to garner the national spotlight the track to the presidential nomination has run square through iowa new hampshire and more recently south carolina go to des moines get famous yet there was giuliani campaign manager mike duhaime this week telling reporters that times have changed his boss is doing it his way its been clear for some time that mr giuliani was putting his chips on bigger if later primary states such as florida california and new york where a less ideological republican electorate might prove more open to his social record still there was something about mr duhaime confirming this approach and by extension dissing the usual three state slingshot that had a national press corps blinking it also earned the giuliani camp a scoffing dismissal from rival mitt romney himself running a textbook and so far winning campaign in every early race some scoff is in order theres a reason presidential hopefuls have for so long genuflected at the davenport and concord and columbia altars it works the momentum that accompanies those early wins is often unstoppable and it makes the giuliani plan an audacious gamble then again theres a pragmatism to hizzoners approach one that has wisely recognized that times have indeed changed if there were ever a chance of shattering the old primary mold this is the year and mr giuliani is the man to do it lets be clear some of this is simple necessity you might even say mr giuliani didnt have a choice iowas caucus system dominated by social conservatives was never going to blow kisses at the pro choice antigun new yorker pat robertson notwithstanding especially so if presented with a true blue social conservative like mike huckabee who in the latest polls is nipping mr romneys shoes south carolinas southern conservatives present a similar challenge add to this that if mr giuliani had vowed to conquer those citadels and failed his campaign wouldve taken a blow you cant lose what you never said youd win at the same time this years primary fight and in particular the republican race are unique the giuliani wisdom if thats what it proves to be has been in recognizing those differences early on and toiling ever since to ply them to the mayors advantage changed circumstance no is this years hypercompressed primary season whereas winners once got to bask in the glow of their early victories and rake in the cash for many weeks before super tuesday this year theyll get to bask a few hours mr giulianis florida his "firewall" where he has spent his biggest chunk of cash and currently holds a point lead over mr romney will take place on jan just days after south carolina meanwhile the races on giga tuesday feb alone which include other big giuliani prospects such as california new york new jersey and illinois represent nearly half the delegates necessary to secure the nomination the giuliani bet is that the time frame has collapsed enough that he can check any rival "momentum" by cleaning up big in the mega states changed circumstance no is the unusual nature of the republican field itself in which there is no clear front runner and voter confusion evangelical endorsements are scattered terrorism is also making its debut in a republican primary and has splintered the usual cohesion of social conservatives and single issue voters no one candidate has been able to break away which means no one is likely to emerge with early landslide victories mr giuliani is counting that this muddle will deny a mr romney or fred thompson the decisive victories theyd need to later challenge in bigger states it might also allow the mayor some respectable finishes in the early races finally theres mr giuliani superstar the big seduction of the early primaries is that they allow candidates who arent well known to catapult into the news thereby becoming household names thanks to september mr giuliani is right up there in household names with kraft macaroni and cheese while a onetime southern governor like mr huckabee has to get a ticket out of iowa if he wants a shot mr giuliani may have more flexibility the caveats the new yorkers ability to pull this off hinges on his ability to truly clean up in the mega states his campaign is already boasting that his leads in some of those places are "momentum proof " but thats the sort of bold statement that borders on hubris even with a sped up primary schedule five hard fought contests the usual three plus nevada and michigan will still go down before the nation ever bats an eye at florida allowing a campaign to go for in the run up to that big day gives a new meaning to the word "risk " the very idea is apparently giving even the giuliani campaign the cold sweats so much so that now that the mayor has built up his position in the bigger states hes working backward yesterday the campaign unveiled its first television ad and its home will be new hampshire its even hinting it hopes to take the state this is itself risky of all the early plays new hampshires the best bet for mr giuliani and his tv spot about his economic and crime success in new york is designed to appeal to state republicans looking for a fiscally sound tough guy think of it too as a potential death blow to one or more competitors mr giuliani sure is mr romney needs to show he can win in his own backyard and he currently holds a double digit lead while john mccain continues to count on the state he won by points in the downside is that the giuliani campaign is now playing the expectations game and losing will only give a boost to the winner primaries are inherently unpredictable and mr giulianis foes have no intention of letting the mayor set the rules but win or lose mr giuliani deserves marks for daring to play big
