global accounting effort gains a step sec drops requirement on foreign companies but other challenges loom the securities and exchange commission took an important step toward what many hope will eventually lead to a global accounting standard dropping a requirement that non u s companies with u s listings reconcile their results to u s rules that sets the stage for the sec to consider whether u s companies should be able to choose between u s and international rules as well if that happens it could potentially pave the way for the abandonment of u s generally accepted accounting principles the idea is that a single set of global accounting rules would make life simpler for investors and companies alike companies wouldnt have to spend as much to compile accounts for their operations around the world while investors would find it easier to compare corporate results for companies on a global basis but even as the drive toward a global standard gains steam potential problems loom while markets are global individual countries and regions differ on whether they should operate to benefit investors companies or in some cases governments that could ultimately undermine a single set of standards if countries and regions take different approaches to formulating and applying the rules a thicket of different interpretations could make a single set of rules unreliable for investors that is why some critics say it is too early to move in this direction concerns over dropping the reconciliation requirement were raised by some large u s investors including the california public employees retirement system which manages &# billion in a letter calpers expressed concern about consistent auditing and enforcement of international rules to ensure credible financial statements while acknowledging the opposition and "tremendous" hurdles including educating auditors and investors to reaching a global accounting standard the secs commissioners voted to drop the reconciliation requirement chairman christopher cox called the step "significant" and said the agencys acceptance of international rules signaled the continued convergence between these standards and u s gaap non u s companies with financial years ending in will now be able to stop reconciling their results with u s gaap immediately if their results comply with rules set by the international accounting standards board while the secs move opens the possibility that u s companies could choose between international and u s standards the commission hasnt formally proposed a rule to allow this the agency is still studying the issue some commissioners still worry it is too soon for a complete embrace of international rules "if there is wide latitude investors will not only lose confidence in the reliability of financial statements but also will lose the consistency that u s gaap provides " commissioner annette nazareth said despite the growing connections among international markets countries and regions still differ sharply in who those markets are intended to serve first in the u s and the united kingdom markets are generally investor driven financial statements and the rules that govern them are designed with investors needs generally taking priority over those of companies and auditors elsewhere in europe investors needs often take a back seat to corporate or political goals in china meanwhile companies markets and investors are all subservient to the needs of the ruling communist party "i think you could have one set of standards but given the differences in countries institutions and perceptions and views the implementation is going to be different and the enforcement is going to be different " said teri lombardi yohn an associate professor of accounting at indiana university who testified last month at a senate subcommittee hearing on international standards proponents of a single global accounting system say sufficient protections could assure that the body that crafts international rules the iasb is buffered from political interference separately the sec voted to propose overhauling offering documents or prospectuses issued by mutual fund companies the proposal if adopted would require fund companies to state in plain english a summary of the funds investment objectives costs and risks as well as briefly detail the funds top holdings at the front of the document the fund industrys investment company institute applauded the secs move the sec also finalized rules to make it easier for small businesses to raise money
