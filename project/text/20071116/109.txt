weekend journal review theater getting along without broadway the glorious ones lincoln center theater mitzi e newhouse theater w th st &# &# closes jan things we want the new group theatre row the acorn w nd st &# extended through dec new york now that the lights of broadway have been dimmed if not altogether darkened by a stagehands strike how are local playgoers spending their nights off the wise ones are looking to off broadway which has long been the true center of creative vitality in the new york theater no sooner were this weeks broadway previews canceled than i switched without regret to a pair of off broadway shows whose first nights i had missed one is a musical with the best new score ive heard since "the light in the piazza " the other a straight play with a cast whose names any producer would kill to put on a marquee lincoln center theater is mounting "the glorious ones" in its cozy seat downstairs house mark lamoss production of "cymbeline " which opens in two weeks is playing in previews upstairs its the most satisfying show that lynn ahrens and stephen flaherty have given us since "ragtime " which put them on the musical comedy map a decade ago and one of the things that make it so pleasurable is that it makes no effort whatsoever to impress unlike "dessa rose " their preachathon about the evils of slavery "the glorious ones" is a small scale fast paced entertainment about the commedia dellarte the barnstorming outdoor theatrical troupes of th century italy whose bawdy improvised farces left a lasting mark on the later history of comedy it is by turns touching and dirty very very dirty and the rapid and unpredictable alternation of these two extremes is part of its charm ms ahrenss script which is based on a novel by francine prose a sometime contributor to the wall street journals leisure &amp arts page is a loosely woven string of skits that tells the stories of the members of a band of strolling players led by flaminio scala marc kudisch a charismatic comedian who has grown too old to play romantic leads it isnt especially original nor is it meant to be the players are all archetypical stock characters who cavort atop mr flahertys festive score which carries the action with gaiety and grace think "the fantasticks " only with codpieces no doubt some will find it too precious for words i saw the show in the company of a friend who hated every second of it but if you go in for sondheim style musical comedy i cant imagine your finding it other than captivating the seven actors who make up the ensemble cast are all outstanding especially mr kudisch natalie venetia belcon lately of "avenue q" and julyana soelistyo and graciela daniele puts them through their paces with the same lively physicality she brought to her equally persuasive staging of michael john lachiusas "bernarda alba " "the glorious ones" is of course theater about theater a genre that too often runs to self indulgence and sentimentality and i wont deny that ms ahrens sometimes sinks to that level on the other hand im a sucker for just that sort of sentimentality and the best of the lyrics she has written for mr flaherty rise above it to paint an affecting portrait of the passion without which no curtain goes up "youll probably say that im crazy to do what i do my only reply is to sigh its entirely true ive only met one man as crazy as i am its you " i couldnt help but compare "the glorious ones" with "young frankenstein " one of the few big budget broadway musicals to have been spared by the strike both shows are exceedingly and self consciously naughty but unlike mel brookss protracted tribute to himself "the glorious ones" is played out on a near bare stage in the space of intermission free minutes instead of costly sets and chorus lines it offers the viewer honest emotion superior acting and well wrought music played by a fine nine piece band michael starobins orchestrations incidentally are just right care to guess which one is better heres the scorecard for "things we want " jonathan marc shermans new play ethan hawke was prominently featured in tom stoppards "the coast of utopia " last seasons big event zoe kazan elias year old granddaughter knocked out everyone who saw her last fall in the new groups revival of "the prime of miss jean brodie " and not just because she took it all off either peter dinklage best known for such superior indie flicks as "the station agent" and "living in oblivion " made an equally memorable impression in the title role of the public theaters production of "richard iii " to be sure mr hawke the director is nowhere to be seen on the far side of the proscenium but his guiding hand is constantly in evidence in the new groups latest production which is so smartly played and staged as to make its long list of shortcomings tolerable since mr sherman has made it known that he is a recovering alcoholic whose mother committed suicide i think its safe to say that "things we want " which is about three brothers two of them alcoholics whose parents committed suicide is not unautobiographical it is also very much the sort of play brian cox the british star of tom stoppards "rock n roll " had in mind when he recently told a reporter that "the american theater is slightly locked in the th century everything is psychologically based and ive seen some really good stuff recently but ive seen some plays that in england would have been called television drama " like every self respecting tv drama "things we want" is about things alcoholism suicide addictive personalities and it puts them on stage so schematically as to occasionally suggest a lecture demonstration nor are mr shermans punch lines sharp enough to compensate though he has his moments "you drink too much " "ive accepted that " what makes "things we want" worth seeing is the cast not only does mr dinklage play the best drunk ive seen on stage in years but ms kazan is ferally frighteningly sexy as a troublemaking neighbor who barges in on the folie a trois of the three brothers mr dinklage paul dano and josh hamilton who are living together in the th floor apartment out of whose living room window their mother and father jumped not simultaneously im sure that mr hawke deserves some of the credit for their tautly paced performances which hold your attention from start to finish even when mr shermans script doesnt mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com still open on
