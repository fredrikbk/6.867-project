u s maps scenarios for pakistan strategists fear nation could become a pariah bhutto is reported freed washington americas no diplomat arrives in pakistan today in a high profile bid to push the countrys military ruler gen pervez musharraf back on a democratic path but behind the scenes a number of current and former u s officials are mapping out other scenarios for the nuclear armed south asian nation should its leader ignore washingtons counsel in the worst case u s strategists increasingly fear pakistan could become a pariah state where gen musharrafs repressive policies drastically feed an islamist uprising one that derails islamabads place as a pro western state set in the strategically important pivot point between china and central asia the analogy they commonly cite is iran whose pro american leader shah reza pahlavi was overthrown in and replaced with a revolutionary islamist government that has destabilized the region exporting terrorism and anti western policies for nearly three decades even if gen musharraf does lift the state of emergency many south asia analysts feel his continued role in government in any form could jeopardize washingtons longer term interests politically weakened the year old leader could prove unable to carry forward aggressive counterterrorism operations against al qaeda and the taliban they say and if he is seen remaining in power largely because of american support this could fuel further anti americanism inside pakistan threatening the nations stability "i liked musharraf but the way hes mishandled this martial law i dont see how he has a political future " said wendy chamberlin washingtons ambassador to pakistan from to "our relationship now has to be with the people we cant personalize it " yet ahead of the arrival of deputy secretary of state john negroponte in islamabad today u s officials continued to offer little sign that washington is preparing to pull its support for pakistans military rule state department officials said mr negroponte during a two day stay would push gen musharraf to lift the state of the emergency push forward with scheduled parliamentary elections and resign his post of army chief of state u s officials said they hoped such actions could allow a new pakistani parliament to elect a new government in which gen musharraf plays a role u s officials said that in recent days they have kept in regular contact with leading opposition leaders such as benazir bhutto who yesterday was reported to have been freed from house arrest as well as the militarys top brass but these officials stress that there havent been any moves to empower any political forces that could challenge gen musharraf they said that in such a volatile political environment such steps have the potential to create even a worse situation should gen musharraf push ahead with the state of emergency the opposition could decide to boycott the parliamentary elections judging them slanted in the governments favor such a development they say could fuel even greater protests and unrest across pakistan creating an environment in which extremist elements could work to further destabilize the government or a less dire situation may emerge gen musharraf could leave the military lift the state of emergency and create a political alliance that lets him continue serving as president in a coalition government while that could defuse some tensions in the longer term it could be seen to undermine pakistans democratic institutions while continuing to feed resentment that washington is manipulating the nation in such a crisis environment some south asia analysts believe support for pakistans islamist parties and for other opposition leaders like nawaz sharif could also grow "these parties wouldnt create the type of government that would tackle the issues of extremism and islamist militancy " said daniel markey who served as a senior state department official on south asia until earlier this year the u s military has its own concerns about the situation in pakistan the most alarming is the prospect that islamic militants could gain control of pakistans sizable nuclear arsenal the u s has contingency plans in place under which american special forces operatives would deploy to pakistan to secure nuclear weapons sites in the event of an islamic takeover but some u s military and intelligence personnel fear that there may be additional weapons sites that the u s doesnt know about that said senior u s officials say that pakistan has fairly sophisticated protective measures in place to prevent the weapons and missiles from falling into the wrong hands or being used without the express permission of gen musharraf and a small handful of his trusted aides adm michael mullen chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said the u s doesnt "see any indication right now that the security of those weapons is in jeopardy " the second and in some ways more immediate concern is that the unrest in pakistan could make it difficult for the u s to send ammunition fuel and other supplies to afghanistan approximately of the u s supplies in afghanistan including of the vehicle fuel pass through or over pakistan and pentagon officials say they have begun honing contingency plans for sending those supplies through other countries
