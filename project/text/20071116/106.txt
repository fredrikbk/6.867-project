weekend journal review books the business of fighting a deadly disease augies quest by augie nieto and t r pearson bloomsbury pages &# augie nieto first noticed that something was going wrong in the summer of an athlete and a businessman who had made his fortune marketing the lifecycle stationary bike mr nieto was feeling weaker and weaker the pound weights he used to lift easily in his workouts suddenly became too difficult to wield he tried to dismiss or ignore his first symptoms but as the months went on he began to slur his speech and his right arm started to twitch in march his visits to doctors offices in search of an explanation culminated in a dreaded diagnosis at age he had the fatal motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als also known as lou gehrigs disease mr nieto decided to confront his disease just as he would any other problem with a ceos hard charging drive to streamline the research process break through bottlenecks and drive toward a cure in time to save his own life mr nieto records his progress so far in "augies quest " a mixture of business inspiration personal biography and self promotion like other activist patients mr nieto believed that no matter how dedicated and talented researchers or doctors may be the demands on their time are too great and the obstacles placed in their way by unwieldy bureaucracies too challenging to match the single minded focus and dedication of a patient facing a life threatening illness mr nieto surveyed the landscape of als research and advocacy assessed its shortcomings and wondered whether "the quest for a cure for als wasnt simply a business problem awaiting a solution " with only an estimated patients diagnosed with als every year advocates for a cure encounter many of the hurdles faced by others seeking help with fighting rare and overlooked diseases but unlike some diseases such as cancer that might allow terminally ill patients to live for years in relative good health als is particularly devastating stripping patients of their ability to move and speak and killing most people within five years of diagnosis many families and patients find themselves too overwhelmed with daily coping to mount the kind of sustained advocacy that has advanced the research of many other diseases mr nietos education in these challenges and the loss of his physical abilities is wrenchingly described in "augies quest " written with t r pearson realizing that in his words "there was no cure to be bought at any price " mr nieto at first sinks into despair even attempting suicide but then he bounces back with a new resolve his idea is straightforward he decides to "brand" himself as the face of als he partners with the muscular dystrophy association mda which funds als clinics around the country and with an already existing group the als therapy development foundation which had tested hundreds of drugs on genetically engineered mice in its search for an effective therapy he insists on spending the money that he raises exclusively on research he and his wife lynne control how the money will be spent they sign contracts with institutes and researchers to work on specific projects that can help them accelerate the search for a cure the business model approach yields some early achievements after they agree to pay &# apiece for dna samples of patients in the mdas als clinics they launch a &# million project to find genes that are common in people with als but rare in the general population mr nieto using his contacts in the fitness industry and his fund raising prowess puts up the money for half the cost of the work and gets a partner institute to foot the rest the researchers find genes that appear to play a role in als the number has since been narrowed to genetic "targets of interest" and present the findings nine months later at a major medical conference in mr nieto then brokers a deal whereby he provides sustained funding to the newly renamed als therapy development institute gets the institute access to als patients through the mdas network of clinics and recruits a prominent scientist from the biotech world to head up the drug discovery program "whos in charge of curing als " the book asks audaciously answering "augie is " the notion that a business model is what is needed to bring better therapies to patients faster has been widely embraced in recent years at a summit on innovation in disease research held in by fastercures the organization itself the brainchild of junk bond king michael milken a prostate cancer survivor and another champion of the business model approach to disease research nonprofits discussed the paths they have taken to accelerate the discovery of cures for diseases as varied as alzheimers epilepsy multiple sclerosis cystic fibrosis and als the tactics of these groups are remarkable not only for their ambition and scope but also for the innovative ways their proponents draw from their business experience to get around many of the obstacles that mr nieto confronts these include drug companies that do not see rare diseases as a lucrative market researchers who are discouraged from sharing their best ideas and are often unaware of what is going on elsewhere in their field and patients who are too sick or scared to enroll in clinical trials if there is a weakness in "augies quest " it is that mr nieto doesnt set his approach in a wider context one of the problems that advocates often fail to address is the time and money wasted by overlapping studies conducted by competing research efforts mr nieto complains that researchers work in silos not sharing information but the silo approach characterizes patient advocacy as well mr nietos book never mentions project als or the als association both of which have raised substantial sums of money and launched their own recent efforts to study als genetics and the molecular underpinnings of the disease it is not clear that the jockeying in rare disease research is worthwhile in the way that business competition is will it lead to a faster cure or create donor fatigue and dissipate limited resources what makes mr nietos story so compelling is not so much his approach to finding a cure for als as his willingness to be involved in an operation like this even as he is dealing with such a debilitating disease the book could have used more examples of what a challenging effort that must be instead mr nieto describes a speech he gave to a group of young business people exhorting them with the catchphrase "life isnt measured by the number of breaths you take but by the number of times your breath is taken away " one of the listeners was so moved that he had the line tattooed across his chest there is no denying mr nietos charisma but he knows better than anyone that in life as in business the bottom line comes first ms dockser marcus a journal reporter won the pulitzer prize in beat reporting
