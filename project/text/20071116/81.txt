splits emerge among key backers of striking writers since the writers guild of america went on strike nearly two weeks ago an important bloc of support has come from an elite group of television writers those with some of the biggest paychecks but divisions have begun to emerge within this core these writers called "showrunners" because theyre also producers responsible for running their tv shows have taken to picket lines and generally refused to participate in shooting or editing episodes of their series but tv studios are sending showrunners breach of contract letters and many showrunners are anxious about the fates of their series so some are returning to perform some of their producing but not writing duties one of the most high profile to return to producing is carlton cuse a member of the wgas negotiating committee who is a showrunner and writer for abcs "lost " he plans to do some postproduction for the eight episodes of "lost" that have been shot he says "we feel we owe that to our fans " he says "we would harm our franchise if we didnt do it ourselves " mr cuses position highlights the awkward position many showrunners are in as the strike is poised to stretch into a third week unlike the vast majority of writers showrunners must balance fealty to their cause with other priorities including loyalty to nonwriting staffers on their shows who will soon be laid off and the desire to retain creative control of their own work how they resolve their competing loyalties could be a factor in how and when the strike ends in the last time the wga went on strike a large number of showrunners began to waver in their support of the strike after about five months according to brian walton who was the wgas executive director and chief negotiator at the time "they started to say look this looks really bad is there some way we could go back and take that last offer " he recalls the strike was resolved soon thereafter this time showrunners hadnt initially planned to stop producing in the event of a strike the wgas strike rule no prohibits writers from providing "writing services " such as "minor adjustments" to a script before and during production the guild says it doesnt interpret that rule to prohibit postproduction editing that doesnt alter the script but it has made a "moral appeal" for showrunners to support the strike in any way they can says jeff hermanson assistant executive director of the wga west "theres been a real difference of opinion" about whether writers should act as producers during the strike says mr cuse of "lost " "im in the moderate camp i strongly believe that each showrunner should make a decision based on his own conscience and circumstance " many showrunners decisions to stop producing grew out of a meeting of more than showrunners on the saturday before the strike began according to guild representatives and three showrunners who were there steve levitan creator of foxs "back to you " helped run the meeting and has become an unofficial organizer of a loose group dubbed "united showrunners " a name that has since been embroidered on baseball caps distributed at showrunner pickets meanwhile tv studios have been applying pressure to showrunners several including cbs paramount network television a unit of cbs corp have sent "breach of contract" letters to showrunners twentieth century fox television a division of news corp has sent letters suspending the lucrative production deals of at least some showrunners who havent showed up to work marc graboff co chairman of general electric co s nbc entertainment and universal media studios sent a memo to showrunners and producers before the strike in the form of a list of frequently asked questions the memo reviewed by the wall street journal says that anyone with producing duties must fulfill them and includes the group of writing tasks prohibited by wgas strike rule no the memo also says showrunners are prohibited from turning in scripts to the union something that wga strike rule no says they are obliged to do because the scripts are company property last week as pressure mounted a large group of showrunners gathered at a lunch organized by united showrunners engaged in a spirited three hour debate about whether to return to producing some there decided theyd return to producing tasks permitted under the strike if the studios and wga restarted good faith negotiations "we wanted to offer a carrot " mr levitan says "we want to go back and do our shows " next on the calendar a social gathering in los angeles early next week intended to boost showrunner morale mr levitan acknowledges that some showrunners have returned to producing even though no negotiations have been scheduled "this is not a binding organization " he says nevertheless many showrunners are still doing no production work according to showrunners and people at studios mark gordon whose production company works with walt disney co s abc studios to make abcs "greys anatomy" and "private practice " cbss "criminal minds" and the cws "reaper " says his non writing producers are finishing up shooting and postproduction of his shows without the help of showrunners "its the first time ive had my own show on tv " says michele fazekas co creator of "reaper " a freshman series that hasnt yet been ordered for a full season "im potentially sacrificing that "
