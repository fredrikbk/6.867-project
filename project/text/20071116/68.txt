embroiled in a messy internal struggle that could affect the direction of africas largest economy for years president thabo mbeki has come under fire in recent months for what critics say is his authoritarian leadership style that has sparked a broader debate within the african national congress about whether he is the right choice to continue guiding nelson mandelas party the anc holds its leadership vote in december as the most powerful political party in the country its leader is all but assured of victory in presidential polling in mr mbeki cant run for president again because of term limits but if he continues to lead the party he will be in a powerful position to influence the ancs choice of candidate after a series of recent controversies jacob zuma the partys deputy president whom mr mbeki fired from the government in is now a popular choice to succeed him that is despite the fact mr zuma faces the threat of criminal corruption charges "what were seeing is just frustration and anger with mbekis autocracy and his aloof leadership style " said andrew feinstein a former anc parliament member who resigned in the power struggle has economic ramifications outside south africa amid a global commodities boom foreign companies hedge funds and private equity outfits are rushing to do deals on the continent though crime ridden johannesburg has become southern africas commercial hub and its capital markets have attracted deep pocketed investors interested in buying into mines and banks alike that boom is in some measure thanks to the political stability and business friendly policies ushered in by the anc recently mr zuma has sought to reassure investors concerned about his left leaning allies that he wont upset the status quo south africas animated media have harangued mr mbeki for a seeming reluctance to address the political and economic crisis in neighboring zimbabwe a problem that is spilling over into south africa driving up crime and unemployment rates the president has also been blasted at home and abroad for standing by his controversial health minister who has advocated natural remedies such as beetroot and garlic over antiretroviral drugs for people with the aids virus more recently mr mbeki caused a stir here by suspending the countrys chief prosecutor amid a high profile murder case investigators pursuing the shooting death of a mining magnate uncovered evidence they believed linked the suspect an alleged mobster to the national police commissioner jackie selebi an mbeki ally vusi pikoli the top prosecutor obtained a warrant in september to arrest mr selebi and search his home but mr mbeki abruptly suspended mr pikoli and the arrest warrant has been canceled mr selebi has said he has done nothing wrong mr mbekis supporters say he is naturally reserved and often misunderstood "there are people who do not present cogent arguments and when the president does not agree with them they go around saying oh no no no hes authoritarian " said mukoni ratshitanga mr mbekis spokesman "its such a nonsensical story really " the government in an october statement attributed mr mbekis decision to suspend mr pikoli to a "breakdown in the working relationship" between the prosecutor and the minister of justice mr ratshitanga the presidential spokesman declined to address the issue further mr mbekis troubles have opened the door for mr zumas presidential ambitions mr mbeki fired him as the governments deputy president in after mr zuma went to court on fraud and bribery charges related to a deal
