after u s air strike fear of casualties at afghan bazaar in american command post a sergeant awaits report did his jets miss mark orgun e afghanistan dustin hatfields first thought after the u s jet strafed the ridge was thats perfect minutes later his confidence gave way to alarm initially the air strike on a taliban fighting position looked flawless air force tech sgt hatfield had confirmed the precise location of the target and passed word to the pilot circling in the night sky "youre cleared hot " the jet pointed its nose down and let loose a barrage of cannon fire geysers of dirt erupted along the ridge as if the ground itself had been put to a boil in a bunker like command post miles away sgt hatfield watched the attack unfold via spy plane video on a giant flat screen tv then u s soldiers at the scene radioed an urgent message the kind a front line air controller fears the most some rounds had landed near a marketplace below afghanistans war has become a struggle for popular support and nothing does worse damage to the u s led coalitions reputation or provides better fodder for insurgent propaganda than an air strike that kills civilians coalition forces and insurgents were each responsible for about half of the war related civilian deaths during the first half of this year according to an estimate by the afghanistan ngo safety office a european union funded organization that advises charities on security issues "the patience of the afghan people is wearing thin with the continued killing of innocent civilians " afghan president hamid karzais office warned this spring air force controllers who go into combat with the infantry share the prime responsibility for making sure airborne munitions hit their targets sgt hatfield is on his third tour in afghanistan in his first two he guided aerial missions but never ordered an actual strike with insurgent attacks on the rise this tour has been tougher in missions since may on occasions he has relayed orders to drop bombs fire rockets or strafe enemy positions sgt hatfield tries not to dwell on the implications of his work "there will be time to think about it when we get home " says the year old alaskan but sometimes after directing an air strike he will sit on the steps outside his barracks smoke a cigar and think about the lives he helped save and those he helped end "i dont have any problem pulling the trigger" to kill enemy attackers he says then he adds "i think sometimes theres a little regret that my job has to exist " sgt hatfield is air liaison for first battalion rd infantry regiment an man unit that operates in paktika province a hotly contested area on the pakistani border a big man with reddish blond hair and a superhero style cleft chin he almost always speaks in calm measured tones in his small plywood barracks room he is teaching himself to play bach melodies on a mandolin although he finds it difficult to work the small frets with his thick fingers he is taking online classes in physiology and the philosophy of law although he sometimes drops his books to call in an air strike american commanders say they go to great lengths to avoid civilian deaths euphemistically called collateral damage but when u s or allied troops are under attack those commanders decide whether the risk to civilian lives is acceptable sgt hatfield offers a range of firing options to his commander lt col michael fenzel from a relatively mild show of force buzzing a village or dropping harmless flares to a full attack with pound bombs the air strike last week was only the second in which the sergeant has choreographed a strafing run events began to unfold at p m in the battalions command post or tactical operations center at its main base in orgun e the toc as its known is the size of a large living room facing rows of long desks flat screen tvs show battle updates and live video feeds from unmanned spy planes that circle the battlefield "attention in the toc " said first lt matthew svensson a year old from mission viejo calif the battalions outpost at margah a small base close to the village bazaar was taking rifle and rocket propelled grenade fire he said sgt hatfield sat with radios at his side to connect him to a pair of navy pilots in the air on a routine patrol an unmanned spy plane hovered over a low two humped ridge just over half a mile from the outpost between the peaks was a smooth saddle almost barren of trees the drones infrared technology lit up the scene anything warm including a person would glow either ghostly white against the dark background or the opposite depending on the settings "we have hotspots running across the base of the hill " said first lt seth parker of williamsburg va he asked whether close air support was on the way "working on it " sgt hatfield responded soldiers at the outpost began pounding the ridge with mortars and on the tv screen black flashes glowed then faded in twenty minutes sgt hatfield had the two navy jets approaching the site but he didnt want the planes accidentally shot down by u s artillery or mortar rounds being lobbed at the taliban positions "let me know when youre guns cold " he said to the soldier monitoring ground fire at p m the jets arrived on the scene the outpost reported that an insurgent grenade had slammed into a guard tower wounding one of the soldiers over the radio the outpost commander asked for artillery powerful explosive rounds fired from howitzers many miles away "weve got something nicer for them " said lt col fenzel he pointed to the mountain peaks and told sgt hatfield that he wanted to drop two pound bombs on the saddle between them sgt hatfield passed the target coordinates to the first pilot "bring him in " the colonel told sgt hatfield "youre cleared hot " the sergeant said there was a minute of watchful silence in the command post then the big screen flashed white until a thick smoke column rose from the saddle moments later the second bomb hit lt col fenzel stood close to the screen and pointed to small white figures apparently fleeing the scene "id like an immediate re attack with guns " the colonel said sgt hatfield relayed the new coordinates and told the pilots to start strafing he knew there were buildings below the ridge but was confident they were a safe distance away the outpost commander radioed that his men had seen secondary explosions on the ridge a sign that the bombs had hit a stash of insurgent rockets mortars or grenades at p m the first jet spat cannon fire into a site about yards east of the original bombing targets the rounds were tipped with explosives so each bullet hit like a high speed hand grenade soon another line of flashing bullets sprayed the ridge sgt hatfield ordered a third strafing run "as quick as possible " and the side of the ridge blistered with exploding shells in three minutes the planes had fired rounds less than two minutes later the outpost commander radioed with the news that his men thought the planes had hit the market the colonel immediately cut off the attack "thats it " he said he turned to the officer manning the radio "is there any chance of collateral damage " the colonel asked he ordered the outpost commander to send a foot patrol to see if anyone there was hurt sgt hatfield watched the colonel uneasily on the big screen he could see the market it was now pm and the bazaar had closed at p m but at least eight trucks were parked nearby alongside the loose rectangle of low buildings suggesting people could be around on a laptop the sergeant called up a satellite view that included both the ridge and the bazaar below it clicking on the target and stretching a line to the corner of the bazaar sgt hatfield measured three tenths of a mile between the two "its way too far" to have been hit by the cannon fire he said strafing "is the most accurate thing they have it doesnt make sense " he muttered but as more minutes passed without word from the outpost he worried that he might have missed something "when is this ground patrol ready to go " he asked lt parker "why " the lieutenant asked "i want to know what they find " sgt hatfield responded his quiet voice turned emphatic "its my ass " just after p m lt col fenzel stared at the view of the bazaar from the spy drone "you guys havent seen any movement at all " he asked everyone they hadnt which either meant there was nobody there or those who were there were dead wounded or hiding the colonel suspected a pilot had pulled up too soon while his gun was still firing and that about a quarter of the rounds had hit beyond the target area he hoped they hadnt hit the market either way he said the fault wasnt sgt hatfields lt col fenzel then called the governor of paktika province akram khapalwak and warned him that the strafing run might have gone awry "right now we dont believe theres any collateral damage but i wanted to call right away to let you know there is the possibility of collateral damage " he said through an interpreter meanwhile the outpost commander called back with the report of the patrol to the bazaar lt col fenzel repeated the report aloud "you went through the entire area where you observed rounds and theres no damage you could see " he said the colonel shared the news with the governor hung up and let out an audible sigh the next day soldiers from the outpost held a meeting with village elders and nobody reported any damage the colonel says the battalion has caused no civilian deaths in its six months of duty after ending his conversation with the governor he walked back into the command post "hattie " he said "yes sir " the sergeant responded "no collateral damage " sgt hatfield walked to his room he tried to do some school work but found he couldnt concentrate he soon fell asleep the next day he had more planes in the air
