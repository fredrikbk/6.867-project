court rejects bushs fuel economy plan a federal appeals court ruled the bush administrations fuel economy standards for light trucks are too lax a setback for the auto industry and white house efforts to address political concerns over oil consumption and global warming the ninth u s circuit court of appeals in san francisco rejected new fuel economy rules from the administration for sport utility vehicles minivans and pickup trucks sold starting next year the ruling sided with environmental groups and states and cities that argued the new rules though more stringent than current standards still wont do enough to curb oil consumption or emissions of carbon dioxide a global warming gas a justice department spokesman said the administration is "reviewing the decision and we will consider all of our options " he declined to elaborate the government could go back to the appeals court or go to the supreme court the alliance of automobile manufacturers a trade group criticized the ruling it said the administrations rules mark "the largest fuel economy increase in the history" of federal mileage standards further changes to that rule "would only delay the progress that manufacturers have made" toward improving fuel economy the group said the ruling isnt likely to affect vehicles sold before the or model year because the government is required to give auto makers lead time for any fuel economy rule change still the ruling is a blow to the auto industry the fuel economy mandate that the administrations national highway traffic safety administration adopted for the through auto model years is one that the auto industry decided it could live with though the rule toughens the mileage standards for trucks it maintains the current system in which trucks are subject to less stringent fuel economy standards than cars and it gives the auto industry several years to meet the tougher rules the court cited the less stringent requirement for trucks as part of the reason it struck down the rules the ruling raises the possibility that auto makers will have to change their new vehicle designs on what amounts to short notice given the industrys long product development lead times the ruling also represents a political setback for the white house at a time of &# a gallon gasoline and mounting public concern about global warming bush administration officials often have noted that they have done more to toughen federal auto mileage standards than preceding administrations democrat or republican now going into an election year in which energy is sure to be a hot button issue a federal court has ruled the administration hasnt gone far enough there is no assurance that the auto industry would find a friendlier hearing in higher courts this spring the supreme court ruled that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are air pollutants under federal environmental law and that the bush administration acted illegally in refusing to limit emissions of those gases as a result of that ruling the administration now is developing new fuel economy rules to take effect further down the road yesterdays decision is the latest sign of how the fast changing politics of global warming in the u s are buffeting multiple industry sectors congress is debating multiple proposals for tougher auto mileage standards and for an economywide cap on u s global warming emissions the auto industry has thrown its support behind the notion of a cap and trade system largely because it figures that by spreading the pain to other sectors it will be able to lessen the fuel economy hit to the industry itself the appeals court cited several reasons for rejecting the bush administrations pending fuel economy rule in addition to failing to take into account the "value" of reduced greenhouse gas emissions the court said the pending rule maintains the "suv loophole" holding suvs and other light trucks to a less stringent fuel economy standard than cars and fails to regulate the fuel economy of most larger pickup trucks whose gross vehicle weight is between pounds and pounds environmentalists praised yesterdays court ruling it "may not dramatically change the next couple of years of fuel economy standards but i think it clearly will have an effect on how fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas standards are set by this administration for a long time to come " said david friedman of the union of concerned scientists an environmental group the ninth u s circuit court of appeals is known within legal circles for some high profile decisions often construed as liberal that have been reversed on appeal carl tobias a law professor at the university of richmond speculated that if the bush administration appealed the decision it probably would ask first for a rehearing by the ninth circuit rather than go directly to the supreme court "it might be a close vote" if it were reheard by a larger panel of ninth circuit judges he said
