weekend journal review television its no joke when the writing fails their current walkout is as good a time as any to consider what tv writers do for good and ill in that latter category this season no case has been as striking or as irritating or as clear about what went wrong as "back to you" wednesdays p m est on fox we can begin with irritating a word that doesnt quite do justice to the aura of grimness in the atmosphere every time the shows male star kelsey grammer surely one of the subtlest and most gifted of comic actors begins bellowing the unsalvageably witless lines the shows writers have produced in episode after episode mr grammer who plays chuck darling a crassly ambitious thug of a co anchor at a local news station in pittsburgh throws himself around bellows glares and makes faces as the role demands yet he still manages despite all the physical action to look frozen faced much of the time the face of suffering perhaps if not some desperate notion of how a chuck darling is supposed to look what look that would be its hard to know since neither chuck nor any other of the cartoonish figures the shows creators dreamed up for this sitcom about a newsroom a highly specific comedy setting we have god knows seen before resemble human characters of any kind much less the sort audiences can see on their own tv sets every day what they can find thats recognizable in the open hatred the primitive warfare that characterizes newsroom relationships in "back to you" is hard to imagine viewers who absorb daily the mutually affectionate mindless prattle of real local news anchors and their teams their endless compliments ditherings about birthdays and good looking new ties earnest admonitions to colleagues out reporting the weather hurry back in and get warm will you please wont have an easy time crediting the reality of this newsroom all this is to say the obvious perhaps that nothing can avail when the writing is bad but its a truth worth remembering particularly in this case when this much anticipated series with its considerable enticements mr grammer of "frasier" and the talented patricia heaton of "everybody loves raymond" onscreen again finally began critical opinion was nearly unanimous the writing clearly belonged in the not so hot category it was agreed but there was hope that mr grammer and ms heaton in the role of kelly an embittered co anchor were pros who could make it all work nonetheless as it turned out they cant and they dont nor could the odds have been in their favor given the screeching emptiness of the characters and the shows mirth free vulgarity what is she doing tonight the female weather reporter asks kelly "staying in " comes the answer "unlike your breasts apparently " thats as sharp as the repartee gets in its negative way the series is a reminder of the qualities that make for sitcom success particularly the kind of comedy set in the workplace whose society and mores everyone knows that society and its foibles its rules and characters were well known to the people behind "the mary tyler moore show " which is what enabled the shows writers to deliver subtlety even to a character who was also a caricature as they did so superbly in the persona of anchorman ted baxter ted knight that pompous vain self seeking professional cutthroat but a figure still credibly human all in all that kind of knowledge is precisely what ensured success decades later for the writers of "the office " that merciless british series about the werner hogg paper company focused on the massively deluded middle manager david brent portrayed by the shows creator ricky gervais and what a creation this devourer of all the latest and worst cant one of those bosses numerous in the world who view their role as head of the family all seeing adviser and counselor the ultimate narcissist brent holds forth regularly to employees on his numerous and fictitious prior successes in the world all of which he abandoned to come to slough and the paper company hed had enough of it all "been there done that " he characteristically explains been that is a successful actor a singer a musician and songwriter hes a wholly devastating creation a caricature yes but also the embodiment of a personality who feels altogether too real even those guitar accompanied solos performed by this fraud who claims to have composed important music unfortunately known only in the u s dont sound completely fraudulent theres just enough wily confidence in them to keep the captive audience of werner hogg staffers humming tentatively along and clapping their hands it could be something good theyre not sure the staff isnt that easily flummoxed in the immensely successful american adaptation of "the office" thursdays p m est on nbc but then neither is michael scott the manager who steve carell so flawlessly portrays quite in the same pathological class as his british counterpart hes too obvious a bumbler to succeed in convincing anyone on his staff of anything except perhaps for the wonderfully strange dwight rainn wilson and even he has now graduated from yes man to broken hearted lover abandoned by the girlfriend whose cat he killed all that notwithstanding michael another devoted imbiber of all the pieties of the times comes through with a cutting power all the sharper for his mysterious charm hes the perfect creation for showing how the most well meaning sorts can be at the same time terminal fools chronically in thrall to the worst ideas ever conceived for that alone the series would be worth cherishing but as the shows fans hardly need telling there is everything else including the scripts wit and invention perhaps when the walkout ends some scriptwriter can be found who can do something with "back to you " the most recent episode it should be noted yielded the series first moments of humor if not exactly wit an occasion involving a raccoon that had found its way into kellys apartment and caused the men on the news team to try their inept hands at getting the thing out in short when the writers didnt have to come up with a lot of dialogue but could focus instead on pure physical farce the show delivered laughs unfortunately writers lines are what tv comedy depends on on the rosier side there are all those "frasier" reruns that make it possible to watch mr grammer to our hearts content and without wincing a word each evening beginning at p m est the invaluable turner classic movies channel is providing four favorite films picked by one of an assortment of directors writers and others theres something distinctly intriguing in hearing the reasons for these choices last thursday i tuned in casually as writer charles busch told host robert osborne about his four film choices three of which id never seen and every one worth watching as it turned out tonights schedule calls for paul mazurskys four picks which include "brief encounter" and that great sophisticated now all too little known treasure about an illicit romance "dodsworth "
