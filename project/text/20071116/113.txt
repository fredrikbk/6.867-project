weekend journal taste a boys life no contemporary literary eminence wrote as many bad books as norman mailer "ten thousand words a minute" was both the title of his essay on the patterson liston fight and his approximate output in "marilyn a biography " he wrote that the fbi and cia killed marilyn monroe because she had had an affair with robert f kennedy the novel "why are we in vietnam" is a shaggy dog story about a hunting trip written in a yahooing hipster yokel twang that suggests proust guest hosting "hee haw " the first paragraph contains these lines "hip hole and hupmobile braunschweiger you didnt invite geiger and his counter for nothing here is d j the friendlee voice at your service hold tight young america introductions come let go of my d g shakespeare i have gone too long it is too late to tell my tale may batman tell it " sure sounds like a texas bear hunter to me the year before he died of kidney failure saturday mr mailer published "the castle in the forest " an explosively awful novel told by a devil who raised hitler that recast history at the level of "the omen " this year he followed with "on god an uncommon conversation " in which he declared that "one of the very few times i felt god was speaking to me" was when the almighty commanded the drunken young writer to leave a diner without paying cents for his coffee and doughnut was any serious writer ever so comical for "the gospel according to the son " mr mailer placed himself in the mind of jesus christ which he must have viewed as a demotion though mr mailer published more than volumes the quantity of those that will survive is equivalent to the number of children he leaves behind nine even one undisputed masterpiece carries an asterisk the cold grip of his nonfiction novel about the murderer gary gilmore "the executioners song " depends so heavily on the reporting contribution of lawrence schiller that it ought to have two bylines vainglorious fatuous fractious and breathtakingly pretentious a rake a mystic and a fool mr mailer wanted to be hemingway plus dostoevski times tolstoy instead he found his fame steadily eclipsed by his infamy having stabbed his second wife adele morales nearly to death and having used the new york review of books to launch a campaign for the release of a killer prisoner jack henry abbott on grounds that the desperados writing talent must be uncaged released on parole abbott stabbed a waiter to death and no leftist literary figures policy directives would ever go unmocked again predictably in mr mailer said america probably deserved the world trade center attacks and called the rubble of ground zero "more beautiful than the buildings" it replaced evelyn waugh referred to mr mailer as "an american pornographer" and reported that mr mailer tried to feed vodka to a horse which bit him in return mr mailer would subsequently take a bite out of actor rip torns ear on the set of the movie "maidstone " he sat on truman capote and head butted gore vidal mr mailer "was by nature bound to a style of excess " said e l doctorow this week and yet the great works of journalism "the executioners song " "the armies of the night" and "miami and the siege of chicago" are still there "executioners" is the equal of "in cold blood " a book whose author mr capote justifiably but irrelevantly claimed to be the source of mr mailers uncharacteristically hushed and clinical approach "the naked and the dead " a sensation upon its publication when mr mailer was remains one of the most visceral world war ii novels and christopher hitchens is not alone in dubbing the cia novel "harlots ghost" "a masterpiece " besides a man who made as many enemies as norman mailer did must have been doing something right he was on to something when he declared that any journalism claiming objectivity was "one of the great lies of all time " not least among his achievements was inspiring kate millett to coin the epithet "male chauvinist pig " is not gore vidal deserving of an occasional head butt as for the cushiony and sofa high mr capote the man was made to be sat upon when mr mailer approached mcgeorge bundy at a party and invited him to step outside so they could settle the vietnam war with their fists the gesture was touching in the way it shrank world affairs to fit in the schoolyard a mailerist reading of mailer throwing a dash of freud into a vat of speculation might be that he never grew up an overapproving mother declared him "perfect" and "our king " and off he went to harvard at away from his mother he continued to do a mothers work in such books as "advertisements for myself " many a writer has been his own subject but few have dared to write about themselves by name and nickname in the third person mr mailer styled himself mailer the prisoner of sex aquarius gen marijuana and kid integrity like a kid mr mailer was fascinated by his own naughtiness his earliest critics castigated him for the vulgarity of his language though his editors insisted that he use the word "fug" in "the naked and the dead " mr hitchens writing in slate notes that mr mailer exhibited a peculiar lifelong fascination with sodomy money women drink and drugs he used without limit at least until a calming wave came over him in his late s found the six time groom half a million dollars in debt having blown a &# advance for his next novel and with annual expenses totaling some &# in tuition and alimony in bill paying mode he wrote in two months a diverting little trash novel "tough guys dont dance " that he made into an even trashier movie starring ryan oneal critics snorted what did he care he was perfect the occasion of writing about madonna in esquire in inspired this thought "there is nothing comparable to living with a phenomenon when the phenomenon is you you could be more interesting than anyone youve encountered " one pictures madonna reading this and thinking fine but say more about me his vigor was fed by the conviction that any thought that creased his brow would replenish his acclaim and that the first duty of a writer is to have something to say mr vidal who reacted with equanimity to mr mailers attacks "i saw this tiny fist coming at me " he recalled of one cocktail party fracas said upon his passing "he was interesting because he was interested he had a radical imagination a way of approaching subjects that was never boring " look at the pages of the latest novel by mr mailers contemporary philip roth and you see that they crackle with a shrill hatred of youth not the first time mr roth has been more crabby than incisive mr mailer by contrast had been working before his death on a follow up to his absurd hitler novel that was to be the second in a series of seven he lived to be but never grew old mr smith is a film critic for the new york post who blogs at www kylesmithonline com
