citgo scales back in u s to fund chavezs goals venezuelan owners put own team in and take refiners profits home in one of every gallons of gasoline u s drivers bought came from a venezuelan owned refiner citgo petroleum corp that year a student at oxford university wrote a thesis saying citgo was cheating venezuelas people by investing too much in the u s and should send more cash home the student juan carlos boue drew scant attention until four years ago when venezuelas populist president hugo chavez took control of the state oil apparatus today mr boue is an influential member of citgos board and citgo which venezuela bought two decades ago to market its hard to refine heavy oil now has a different focus feeding cash to mr chavezs program to build socialism in venezuela in recent years while other u s refiners have invested heavily to take advantage of historically wide profit margins in the business citgo has been slimming down it has slashed its investment and sold off u s assets most recently by agreeing last week to shed a unit that turns crude oil into asphalt in keeping with mr boues nostrums citgo has sent the extra money to its sole shareholder the venezuelan government citgo has raised its annual dividend to more than &# billion from &# million in the changes at citgo are altering the u s fuel landscape citgo owns of u s refining capacity a significant chunk at a time when u s demand for fuel is growing faster than domestic production and no new refinery has been built in three decades citgos production will stagnate adding to pressure on pump prices and fuel imports citgos u turn mimics changes at its corporate parent petroleos de venezuela sa known as pdvsa mr chavez has staffed the national oil company with political allies and spends some &# billion a year of its profits on social programs shorn of investment pdvsa has seen its oil output plunge the strategy also contrasts with those of some other national oil companies such as saudi arabias and brazils which invest heavily in both production and refining citgo declined to reply to questions about its strategy neither pdvsa nor venezuelas ministry of energy and mines responded to requests for comment mr boue who is years old said in an email that "an objective is certainly to maximize dividends but never at the expense of the integrity of the operations " speaking of venezuelas ownership of citgo he said "during years we put in huge amounts of money without receiving anything in return " in the past citgo has said selling assets allows it to focus on its most profitable ventures industry experts say citgo is a moneymaker citgo has not disclosed financial data since when publicly traded bonds were paid off ending the need to report to the securities and exchange commission citgos last public filing showed profit of &# million on revenue of just under &# billion in the first nine months of the downsizing is part of broader changes at citgo after first investing in citgo years ago venezuela for years let americans run it but under the chavez regime citgo has had four venezuelan ceos in six years one a former general from the army where mr chavez began his career gracing citgos houston offices today is a large statue of an oil worker a woman and a machete wielding peasant a symbol of the chavez revolution citgo has a new board that includes besides mr boue a cousin of mr chavez and a french born marxist mathematician this board has become the key policy making body keeping u s managers in the dark about long term strategy say some current and former employees when venezuela relocated citgos headquarters to houston from tulsa okla in nearly half of the employees chose not to move almost all high ranking american executives have since left when they go they must sign agreements promising not to criticize citgo in public former executives say in accord with what some describe as a growing culture of secrecy at the company "its like a police state " said one a venezuelan taking its cue from pdvsa citgo has increased its social spending last winter citgo provided cut rate heating oil to million low income americans the program enabled mr chavez to score political points about continuing poverty in one of the worlds richest countries the fiery venezuelans political grandstanding has been a headache for some who run franchised citgo gas stations after he labeled president bush "the devil" in a speech at the united nations last year an internet led movement arose to boycott citgo stations in rural alabama a billboard put up in recent weeks picturing mr chavez read "dont buy gas from this ass " its hard to tell how much effect the movement has had but in monroe la bennie evans owner of citgo stations is switching many to other brands "customers were not coming back we got tons of hate emails " he says citgos relationship with venezuela began in the mid s when the country was finding its heavy grade of crude a tough sell because many refineries couldnt process it and lighter oil was plentiful the state oil company pdvsa decided the oil would be an easier sell if first turned into products like gasoline it went looking for a refiner and found citgo then a one plant company owned by the operator of eleven stores southland corp pdvsa bought half of citgo in and the rest four years later pdvsa agreed to supply citgo with crude the contract based the price citgo paid not on spot market prices as many such deals do but on the prices of refined products former executives say this was to ensure a profit for citgo which was going to have to make extensive refinery upgrades at first the deal brought venezuela a higher price for its oil than it could have gotten on the spot market and venezuela left citgo alone "we were very careful to keep the fewest number of venezuelans there because it was a u s company " says luis giusti president of pdvsa in the s besides investing in its plant in lake charles la citgo acquired five more u s refineries it expanded its fleet of franchised citgo branded gasoline stations to reinvesting profits in the u s made sense for tax reasons according to former executives they say sending the profits to venezuela would have resulted in double taxation because the u s and venezuela didnt have a treaty to offset each others taxes mr boue says they could have avoided the tax hit by sending the profits via a pdvsa subsidiary in the netherlands which did have a tax treaty with america and then on through to venezuela by way of curacao the economics shifted in the mid s the price of refined products dropped with the result that pdvsa started getting less for its crude oil by marketing it through citgo than it could have on the spot market from to pdvsa got about cents to &# below the spot market price from citgo under the supply arrangement with three of its refineries according to company documents reviewed by the wall street journal the documents indicate that the discounts amounted to &# billion over most of those supply contracts life in venezuela where the popular mood was sour after a series of economic crises a perception grew that citgo was a bad deal even before mr chavezs election in it had become harder for citgo to get approval for new projects in his campaign mr chavez suggested that venezuelan oil men were using citgo to hide money from the country his views fed into a debate that had raged for years between the oil establishment and the countrys left wing which said pdvsa should focus its investments at home mr boue as a student in his home country of mexico had weighed in on this in a thesis that was published in while he was working at mexican state company petroleos mexicanos he argued that venezuela didnt need foreign refineries and should simply sell its oil on global markets two years later mr boue elaborated in a dissertation he wrote for his ph d at oxford he said any oil producer that wants to guarantee the sale of a certain amount of crude can simply offer it at a slightly lower price than others "acquiring and managing refineries is a very expensive enterprise " mr boue wrote "selling crude by means of discounts is both simple and cheap " he pitched his ideas to pdvsa but was ignored former officials there say mr boue hadnt taken into account how trying to sell a large amount of heavy crude on the spot market would affect the price namely by driving it lower "boues arguments were simply wrong " contends ramon espinasa a former pdvsa chief economist mr boue citing his own experience at pemex says its untrue that pdvsa would have depressed the market by placing its heavy oil in the market adding that he never advocated selling it on the spot market but instead by contract former pdvsa officials also say that in criticizing venezuelas ownership of a u s refining operation mr boue didnt take into account its value as an investment pdvsa bought citgo for &# million a former citgo executive says its value is now about &# billion mr boues reply to that is that pdvsa paid much more than &# million for citgo if one takes into account the oil price discounts the interest pdvsa could have earned on money lost through the discounts and investments made in citgo mr chavez as venezuelas president initially had difficulty changing citgo his envoys to the company usually ended up supporting it for instance in the venezuelan oil ministry sent an executive named luis marin to run citgo urging him to sell it but mr marin saw that the refining business was improving and urged that citgo be expanded instead mr boue meanwhile had joined a think tank called the oxford institute for energy studies there he met bernard mommer a french born marxist academician who was part of the chavez political entourage thanks to mr mommer mr boues ideas finally caught the eye of venezuelas energy minister rafael ramirez and mr ramirez hired him to do a study of citgo mr boues conclusions published in echoed what hed been saying all along about citgo not sending home enough of its profits early the following year mr chavez fired mr marin the citgo chief who wanted to expand the company and replaced its entire five member board putting messrs boue and mommer on it the new board changed things quickly u s executives of citgo had always participated in board meetings now they make brief presentations and must leave former executives say the former executives contend the goal of maximizing payments to venezuela is so strong that many worthwhile investments are scrapped in u s executives wanted to invest in a project involving cogeneration a process that produces heat and power at once and claimed the project would produce a return on investment the board rejected it mr boue said many of the arguments to support the project were "very feeble " and "the executives could not convince the board " he added "im only a director at citgo and certainly not an eminence grise pulling the strings backstage " citgo has delayed refinery upgrades required by the u s government to produce cleaner fuels some analysts say this raises a risk of citgos not being able to finish in time because projects are becoming more expensive and materials and labor harder to come by citgo has sold interests in pipelines and terminals and last year got rid of its share of a refinery co owned with another refiner now it is selling its asphalt business for &# million citgo had started that operation in to refine super heavy grades of venezuelan oil into material to coat u s roads and rooftops citgo asphalt refining co became the largest asphalt supplier on the east coast and citgo set plans to expand it further after mr boue arrived at the citgo board the plans were scrapped former executives say now instead of making asphalt out of a sludgy crude called boscan venezuela mixes the sludgy material with light crude and sells it to china a former executive says the strategy has faltered shipping crude to china is costly and using valuable light oil to thin out boscan results in a mixed crude that doesnt fetch high prices boscan inventories are piling up mr boue says the accumulation is seasonal and isnt related to the decision not to expand the asphalt refiner by largely avoiding u s investment citgo didnt fully exploit a refining boom of which other companies took full advantage citgos capacity barely grew and then declined with last years sale of a co owned refinery citgo found itself having to buy gasoline on the open market to supply some gas stations so last year it shed about of the franchised stations they now total about down about from their s peak citgos strategy is in sharp contrast to that of for instance the big refiner valero energy corp valero expanded its capacity twentyfold during the past few years boom acquiring numerous additional refineries says one former high executive at citgo "the sad thing is we had a chance to become the valero of the refining industry and we missed it "
