new veto loss may spur democratic spending cuts washington democrats prepared to scale back their demands for more domestic spending after the house narrowly failed to override president bushs veto of a popular &# billion bill for education labor and medical research the vote fell two short of the two thirds majority required and dashed what many saw as the democrats best hope of making a dent in the presidents position as lawmakers head home for the thanksgiving recess the leadership concedes it must take a different approach if there is to be any chance of a year end settlement senate majority leader harry reid of nevada has reached out to white house chief of staff joshua bolten to try to open negotiations and democrats are offering to cut about &# billion from proposed domestic spending for the new fiscal year that began oct this would appear to fall about midway between the presidents budget and an added &# billion in democratic bills if the new top line can be agreed upon house and senate appropriations clerks could use the coming recess to begin crafting a single omnibus bill to meet the target which will require cuts of about if spread evenly across the board the initial white house reaction yesterday was cool and the offer comes amid increased tensions between congress and mr bush over funding for the war in iraq much will depend on the pressure exerted by moderate republicans who have stood by mr bush so far in the spending battle but are also anxious to avoid a repeat of the collapse of the budget process last year at this time mississippi sen thad cochran the ranking republican on the senate appropriations panel said he would urge mr bush to consider the offer which mr cochran said is "as good an outcome as were going to get " california rep jerry lewis the ranking republican on house appropriations was more cautious but also is open to talks "id be surprised if there isnt room for negotiation " the same dynamics are reflected in the house stalemate over a second democratic initiative to expand health care coverage for millions of working class children here also moderate republicans hold the balance of power but thus far the administration has been able to peel back the extra votes democrats need to succeed for example as many as house republicans had voted for the education and labor bill as it moved through congress this summer and fall but under pressure from party leaders this number fell to last night dooming the democratic effort the child health care initiative was also successfully vetoed by mr bush last month but democrats and a handful of senate republican allies have devoted weeks since to trying to find a deal that will win more house votes substantial progress has been made but democrats fear the administration is pulling republicans back or engineering new demands that the majority will find hard to accept a central principle for the moderates is that the increased federal investment for child care about &# billion over five years be targeted to the most needy democrats have agreed to cap the program to exclude households with a gross income above of the poverty line but in an exchange of proposals yesterday moderates asked that a similar cap be applied to the much larger state federal medicaid health care program
