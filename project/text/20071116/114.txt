weekend journal tastings discovering american bubbly u s sparklers make a great first act to a holiday feast when it comes to real champagne its easy to figure out which ones were made by the little guys if you have good eyesight theres a tiny code on the label that begins with rm which means its a growers own wine when it comes to american sparkling wines however even perfect vision doesnt help because theres rarely a hint on the label this is a shame because all over the country committed vintners are making small batches of handcrafted highly personal and often excellent bubbly now is a good time to explore these hidden gems because american sparklers are perfect for thanksgiving last week we suggested cabernet sauvignon for thanksgiving and a couple of weeks before that we recommended a light muscat wine for dessert after any big meal the way to start your celebration however is with a sparkling wine because thanksgiving is an american celebration we think an american bubbly is the way to go when we were young that usually meant korbel from california or perhaps great western from new york we both grew up in households where wine was rarely consumed and when our fathers gathered all of us around to verrrrry carefully open that bottle on thanksgiving the big pop signified the beginning of a warm holiday season even more than the sight of santa at the end of the macys parade since then there has been a revolution in american bubbly now big producers such as domaine chandon roederer estate and mumm napa produce tons of very good sparkling wine at excellent prices smaller producers such as scharffenberger cellars and the pioneering schramsberg vineyards have helped to set a standard for sparkling wine that is very good and fairly widely available and its not just california gruet winery in new mexico and domaine ste michelle in washington for instance each produce a significant amount of good well priced bubbly americas bounty of bubbly doesnt stop there the u s has about wineries and youd be amazed how many of these produce a little bit of bubbly often made pretty much just for fun and often sold only at the winery or at a limited number of stores or restaurants the bubblies are sometimes excellent and for a good reason really fine sparkling wine requires a tremendous amount of time consuming hands on care the grapes chardonnay pinot noir and pinot meunier are the classics must be just right and when they are they convey the qualities of the soil and climate in which they thrive the wine must be slowly turned in the bottle so that during the second fermentation the sediment works its way to the top and its disgorged a process that sometimes takes years this is the classic method of producing champagne and the labels on american bubblies made that way will proudly say methode champenoise or perhaps something like "fermented in this bottle " this is a sign of great care compared to the bulk process in which the wine is made in large fermentation tanks fine bubbly requires passion and commitment and that often is the result of a vintner producing a small amount of sparkling wine because its fun or because well ask tony soter mr soter is a well known winemaker who now owns a winery in oregon we were surprised to find a soter sparkling rose at a store recently and so we picked it up the wine was marvelous soulful with good weight great acidity and impressive austerity when we called mr soter to ask why he made a bubbly he immediately responded "i make it for my wife its a small part of our production the deal was id be delighted to make it for her and if i couldnt sell it shed have to drink it im not trying to get rich with it im making it for the love of it " in fact every winemaker we interviewed spoke of love when discussing their sparklers adding that their still wines are far more profitable said rollin soles the winemaker at argyle "i love drinking the stuff and i love making the stuff " during our recent quick visit to the santa cruz mountains of california we dropped into thomas fogarty winery and bought a bottle of bubbly that we drank at our hotel it was one of the best american sparklers weve had to us great sparkling wine isnt just wine with bubbles the reason champagne is the classic sparkling wine is that it gets the balance just right among all of the elements the fruit the acidity the soil and the fine bubbles themselves become part of the taste not incidental to it too many american bubblies simply taste like wine sometimes very good wine to be sure with bubbles the fogarty &# got it just right as we wrote in our notes "exceptionally good with yeast chalk nuttiness and rich fruit someone made this who cares a lot about bubbly very classy and elegant " the winery makes only cases of it and its available for sale at the winery and online and at a small number of wine stores and restaurants in the san francisco area of all the vintages made by fogartys long time winemaker michael martella the his most recent vintage is his favorite "everything just kind of came together " he said "luck plays a big part of it but having really good fruit is key " the grapes have to be just right with perfect levels of acidity and ripeness "sometimes " he said "theyre not ripe enough for dry still wines and too ripe for sparkling wines to know when to pick you sort of need a crystal ball " mr martella has a couple hundred cases of the vintage sitting on its yeast obviously not all american bubblies are good some taste like simple wine that has been pumped full of bubbles others have an overlay of sweetness that seems designed to hide flaws and leaves the wine cloying and heavy heres the bottom line we cant tell you what small production highly personal american bubbly you might find thats kind of the whole point they are very small and highly personal chances are though you live near a winery that makes a little bubbly or you know a good wine merchant who brings in a few bottles of a special bubbly youve never seen before from somewhere in the u s now is the perfect time to search a little harder than usual and try one of these with your friends family and thanksgiving dinner a sampling of small production american sparklers we collected a large sample of handcrafted small production american sparkling wines and tasted them over two weeks these were our favorites although we bought these from retail stores all are made in very small quantities and are hard to find outside of the winery or the immediate area where they are made we list them simply to give an idea of the very special small production wines made across the u s if you live near a winery and chances are that you do wed guess it makes a sparkling wine that might be
