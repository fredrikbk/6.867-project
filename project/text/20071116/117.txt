weekend journal the wealth report what drought palm beach is an island of green rich pay surcharge to keep lawn lush jimmy buffetts fine the american southeast has been suffering from one of its worst droughts in years but you wouldnt know it from looking at the emerald green estates of palm beach there despite water restrictions and low reservoirs lush lawns and verdant hedges line the florida islands biggest mansions awaiting the start of the annual winter "season" after thanksgiving to keep their thirsty estates running over the summer and fall palm beachers have been more than willing to pay water surcharges and even fines and many have found a loophole in the local water rules allowing them to spritz more often if they pay up to plant new lawns and shrubs consider nelson peltz the investor and food magnates oceanfront estate called montsorrel is among the islands biggest water consumers his acre spread which combines two properties used not quite million gallons of water over the past months or about gallons a day on average at a cost of more than &# according to records obtained from the local water utility that compares with gallons a year for an average single family residence in palm beach says ken rearden assistant city administrator of west palm beach west palm beach supplies palm beachs water to be sure mr peltz is cutting back during the previous month period he used million gallons through a spokeswoman mr peltz said water usage at his florida is estate is "under review with the intent of identifying ways to significantly lower consumption " then theres dwight schar executive chairman of home builder nvr his six acre estate with more than a dozen bathrooms guzzled million gallons of water over the past months a spokesman for mr schar declined to comment palm beachs water world highlights the drain on natural resources caused by todays wealthy and their ever bigger estates efforts by everyday families to take shorter showers and let their lawns go brown are a drop in the bucket compared with the water use of mansion owners even when theyre "conserving " "its an outrage that so much water is being used for single residences " says eric draper deputy director of audubon of florida an environmental group "our water supplies are at historically low levels and yet you see these big homes with perfectly green lawns " mr draper added that its "very difficult to tell joe homeowner to cut back on his water use if he knows that in palm beach theyre not cutting back at all " while not as severe as atlantas drought floridas dry spell the state has labeled it a "rainfall deficit" has forced locals to curb lawn watering and caused palm beach to impose "phase iii" restrictions palm beachs main backup supply for water lake okeechobee is about five feet below desired levels for this time of year and weather experts predict more dry conditions in the coming months the water rules which border on the arcane state that residents with odd numbered addresses can water their lawns and wash vehicles from a m to a m on saturdays only residents with even numbered addresses can do so during those same hours on sundays the city recommends that lawns be watered for only to minutes during each four hour watering period separately hand watering with one hose and "an automatic shut off nozzle" is allowed from p m to p m on peoples regular watering day so how are wealthy palm beachers using so much water the restrictions dont cap total water use only the times of use and todays mansions have high tech irrigation systems that can douse an entire estate at once most wealthy residents say they are honoring the restrictions and that their water usage while large is still within the rules many also point out that they have reduced their water use since last year an estate owned by william l koch president of mining and energy company oxbow corp used about million gallons over the past months down from more than six million in the prior month period a spokesman for mr koch says he has "taken significant steps to reduce water usage" over the past year and that "we follow all of the water restrictions and abide by the law " still many palm beachers seem happy to pay the surcharge on their water bill that is imposed when a resident consumes more than gallons a month others are violating the phase iii restrictions and incurring fines to keep their grounds green the palm beach police whose officers hand out water citations during their daily rounds say that over the past three months alone theyve written citations totaling &# singer jimmy buffett who owns a mansion in town was fined &# for unspecified water violations as was buyout king stephen schwarzman according to city records a spokesman for mr schwarzman said the blackstone group ceo wasnt available to comment a representative for mr buffett didnt return a call other palm beach residents have found a loophole according to the rules residents who put in "new landscaping" can water three days a week instead of the usual one for days after the planting once that period ends homeowners can plant yet again and resume the thrice a week watering that has led some palm beachers to put in new trees shrubs and turf often at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars per residence just so they can run their irrigation systems more frequently one resident who asked not to be named said he returned to palm beach after the summer and found that he had the only brown lawn on the block "when i asked everyone how they were watering they all said new plantings " he said "so thats the loophole were all just ripping out the old lawn and shrubs and putting in new ones "
