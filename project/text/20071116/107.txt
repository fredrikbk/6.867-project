weekend journal review film old english goes new hollywood in epic beowulf high tech wizardry makes classic sing redacted is dismal please note the following disclaimer before reading the review i have seen "beowulf" only in d first at a screening in digital d the eye popping version thats being shown at conventional theaters around the country then at a screening in the eye popping plus jaw dropping d version that is filling the giant screens of more than imax theaters as well its possible that the pleasures of this added dimension have skewed my judgment by turning me into a d junkie and that readers who see only the d version will find the film or my review one dimensional if so i apologize in advance but due diligence has its limits as kids in high school english class we all struggled to make sense of "beowulf " the epic poem from mankinds wintry past that stands as the oldest surviving work of its kind in the english language "beowulf" the movie makes that past pop present with bloody battles a bibulous king in a torch lit mead hall a slobbering monster his demonically sexy mother and a viking hero who in the ancient tradition of the hero trade is brilliant at blowing his own horn robert zemeckiss production may not be poetic in the literary sense but its sumptuous visuals smart script by neil gaiman and roger avary and spirited performances come together in a spectacle thats impressive occasionally bawdy and often thrilling whats more as if more is needed the movies animation and d techniques offer a seductive vision of the mediums future weve seen a glimpse of that future before and it didnt work mr zemeckis used an earlier version of "beowulfs" motion capture technology or digitally enhanced live action in "the polar express " a ponderous christmas fantasy that seemed to be populated by overachieving glove puppets with dead eyes but that was then and this is now the passing years all three of them have brought significant changes facial features moving with a subtlety thats near human rather than nonhuman bodies conducting cross border raids between the concrete and the abstract lapses still occur an occasional face will make you wonder if they had plastic surgery in the seventh century but the look of the film as a whole is literally captivating since physical movement doesnt equate with dramatic motion not a lot happens in that mead hall the movie could lose a few minutes without bloodletting until the monstrous grendel barges in from his subterranean lair once he does "beowulf" is fully engaged and engaging because grendel voiced by crispin hellion glover is a majestically misshapen monument to inhuman misery his left profile looks preferable only because he doesnt have a right one hes a mommas boy whose father but you remember how the story goes and if you dont the movie will bring you up to speed suffice it to say that grendels momma is not merely voiced but sinuously bodied by angelina jolie and that one of the triumphs of this brave new motion capture technology is to make ms jolies long tailed devil in stiletto heels look buff naked without being undressed the buffed up warrior beowulf makes his entrance from the sea as soon as he does he is challenged by a soldier whose pointed pike reached the row ahead of me in digital d projection and nearly grazed my left shoulder in d imax beowulf is voiced rousingly by ray winstone with a cockney accent and the whole concept of this fairly complex character works like dragonbusters when our hero strips for mano a mano combat with grendel mr zemeckiss direction agile and playful throughout plays especially ingenious games in order to keep beowulfs privates private anthony hopkins is the cursed king hrothgar robin wright penn is wealthow hrothgars young restive queen and john malkovich is beowulfs rival the lordly ironist unferth to anyone whos familiar with mr malkovichs speech patterns they are instantly recognizable and eerily effective his hesitations alone are rivaled only by jeff goldblums "beowulf" deserves to be taken semiseriously its eye candy is mixed with narrative fiber and dramatic protein but it begs to be taken frivolously effects have grown so exciting in the realm of the third dimension that you just sit there all agog behind your polarizing glasses rain spills into the theater coins flung at you make you duck a dragon invades your life as it dominates the screen at one and the same time you have a sense of what spectators must have felt at the dawn of motion pictures and a feeling that youre watching something new and really big redacted brian de palmas "redacted" argues that the horrors of the iraq war are being kept from us by inept or venal news media and the governments propaganda machine thats a tenable premise for a provocative documentary the horrors of every war elude description and mr de palma is clearly desperate to get a purchase on the chaotic nature of this one but his film isnt a documentary its a work of propaganda in its turn a digitally photographed meditation on our media saturated age in which our men in uniform like the news crews that cover them create their own realities by shooting digital video of their exploits the films core is a speculative and utterly unconvincing reconstruction of an incident that reportedly involved among many horrors the rape and savage killing of a year old iraqi girl by members of a u s army squad the americans are portrayed with varying degrees of loathsomeness but theres not much variety in the film its all an awful aberration dvd tip when "killer of sheep" played a brief run in a few theaters last spring i wrote about it briefly but promised to revisit charles burnetts debut feature when it made its debut on dvd that debut was this week the film has been released by milestone film and steven soderbergh in an impeccable two disc set that contains a tough minded essay by the critic armond white he sees the film as peerless which it is but resists calling it a masterpiece which it is out of fear that such a classy conventional term might camouflage its tragic view of life in the black suburb of watts mr burnett shot "killer of sheep " in mm black and white as his thesis film when he was a graduate student at ucla in the s im not so resistant i think the film should be called anything that will call attention to its singular mix of formal beauty quasi anthropology an appearance of realism caught on the fly and powerfully felt anguish for a culture thats going nowhere the protagonist a slaughterhouse worker named stan seems chronically depressed but stan doesnt suffer from depression hes got the blues in the deepest cultural sense of the word in a cinematic tone poem thats truly about the blues as for the films children at their games they too are going nowhere though with unquenchable heartbreaking energy "killer of sheep" has been declared a national treasure by the library of congress and one of the essential films of all time by the national society of film critics get the dvd to see why corrections &amp amplifications more than conventional theaters nationwide are showing "beowulf" in digital d in fridays film review the figure was misstated as wsj nov
