will rio play pac man miner considers use of takeover defense to fend off bhp bid there is a potential new character on the scene of the globe spanning mining takeover battle pac man british mining giant rio tinto plc fighting off an unsolicited &# billion takeover bid from australian rival bhp billiton plc is considering turning the tables on its rival and launching a counterbid for bhp according to people close to the matter the gambit is called the pac man defense and has a relatively checkered history in the annals of mergers and acquisitions maneuvers coined after the videogame in which the pursued character can turn and eat its attackers the pac man defense still is being studied as part of rio tintos defense plan to bhps all stock offer made earlier this month rio rejected the bid as too low the possibility underscores the high stakes involved where potentially one of the largest m&amp a deals in history hangs in the balance and it shows rios somewhat limited options it is too big to be acquired by another firm beyond bhp and would be hard pressed to start a bidding war in essence it has to whip up a competing plan that is why even if unsuccessful pac man moves can have some beneficial side effects helping rio highlight its own value and perhaps helping preserve its management should a friendly deal come together a combined bhp and rio two of the worlds largest mining companies would be unprecedented in its global reach with operations on six continents and a leading market share in iron ore copper aluminum and other natural resources rio based in london plans to outline its defense at an already scheduled day of investor meetings nov the people familiar with the matter said bhp based in melbourne australia is pressing ahead with its proposal and this week set out on a global tour to meet with shareholders to ask for support in combining the two miners its market capitalization is around &# billion which would make a takeover possibly the largest in history to fight off bhp rio is considering an array of options including selling assets and other moves that could increase value for shareholders people involved in the discussion said the defense doesnt include the participation of any chinese entities china is bhps largest customer and a top buyer for rios products rios defense is being pursued by a special board committee headed by company chairman paul skinner the committee includes nonexecutive director david mayhew a london investment banker who heads j p morgan cazenove a joint venture between j p morgan chase &amp co and cazenove group the pac man defense is relatively rare it was first used in by nlt corp to fend off an attempted takeover by insurer american general nlt eventually agreed on a friendly basis to be acquired by american general for &# billion in that case the pac man move had "the effect of bringing the parties to the table because of the price escalation potential" of each companys stock was beginning to make any deal prohibitive said peter r douglas a partner at davis polk &amp wardwell who devised the strategy for nlt french oil company elfaquitaine turned on franco belgian suitor totalfina in but lost and was acquired by totalfina more recently the tactic was used in the music industry when emi group plc of the united kingdom and warner music group corp of new york each bid for the other both deals failed for regulatory reasons and emi was later purchased by a private equity firm for a pac man defense to work rio would need to persuade its shareholders that instead of receiving a premium for their stock rio should instead pay a premium to bhp holders shareholders would need to be persuaded that rios management was superior to bhps and able to extract more cost savings and other synergies from a combination bhp said this week that a deal would lead to &# billion of cost savings by the third year and &# billion of additional earnings by the seventh year from the ability to boost the volume of iron ore and other commodities a combined company could sell both companies are the product of large scale mergers at the center of such a move would likely be bhps petroleum arm a unit that some shareholders have said doesnt fit in the company rio could bid for bhp and agree to sell the oil business money from a sale could be returned to shareholders the crux of rios presentation this month will be the relative value of rios assets compared with those of bhp the two companies operate mines close to one another in many parts of the world including north america africa and australia rio is known as a conservative operator while bhp has been more aggressive at investing money in large and complicated projects with mixed results a counterbid by rio for bhp would lead to a clash between the companies the two companies held preliminary merger talks earlier this year according to people close to the matter but the talks went nowhere rio then purchased alcan corp for &# billion and bhp made its unsolicited proposal days before the alcan deal closed
