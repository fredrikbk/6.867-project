tv hosts push for end to writers strike late night talkers eager to get back divided loyalties late night television talk show hosts are assuming an unlikely central role in the stalled negotiations between hollywood writers and producers as the strike approaches its third week the hosts are ramping up efforts to resolve the crisis and get back on the air according to people who work on the late night shows the hosts are reaching out to media executives to try to get the networks back to the negotiating table under increasing pressure to return to their shows without their writing staffs some late night hosts are considering crossing the picket lines and going back on the air as early as the week after thanksgiving shows including cbs corp s "late show with david letterman " nbcs "the tonight show with jay leno " and viacom inc unit comedy centrals "the daily show with jon stewart" went into reruns when the strike started nov the late night hosts join others in the entertainment industry in a precarious position of divided loyalty with allegiances to both writers and their productions some tv writers who produce their own shows known as showrunners are planning to return to work in a nonwriting capacity to finish post production on existing episodes the hosts are in a unique position of power they have close relationships with the networks and media executives who have spent years wooing them with huge salaries and fancy perks late night shows are extremely lucrative for the networks while costing little to produce their biggest costs by far are the hosts salaries these hosts have personal motivations to return to work conan obrien of "late night with conan obrien " has a contract with nbc a unit of general electric co that entitles him to inherit "the tonight show" by the network must pay him a multimillion dollar penalty if it doesnt give him the spot mr leno who agreed to retire in is said by people close to him to be unhappy with that agreement and eager to stay on both want to remain on the best terms with viewers and with their bosses meanwhile mr letterman and jimmy kimmel host of walt disney co unit abcs "jimmy kimmel live " may see an opening for their lower rated broadcasts to capture more of the viewing audience if any of the hosts do cross the picket line it could undercut the writers although the hosts generally support their staffs and would likely advocate for the writers on air the return of those shows would weaken the writers leverage and provide the media companies with a way to promote coming feature films "i think theyre struggling with this morally on what the best thing is to do for both their staff and the writers " said chris albers a monologue writer on "late night with conan obrien " behind the scenes the hosts are playing an elaborate game of chicken calls fly daily among the producing and writing staffs of each program trying to feel out who is most inclined to return each hopes one of the others will do so first easing the way for the rest this week mr letterman had a meeting with his entire staff at which he told them he plans to continue paying them directly from his production company worldwide pants likely until the end of the year if not longer mr letterman is paying them on a sliding scale with the highest earners receiving a percentage of their pay and the lowest receiving their full pay last friday nbc informed the nonwriting staffs of its late night shows that they will lose their jobs if the shows dont return next week networks and studios have also warned there will be cuts among nonwriting staff on prime time shows a development that has put pressure on showrunners to return to their shows one of the most high profile to return to producing is carlton cuse a member of the wgas negotiating committee who is a showrunner and writer for abcs "lost " he plans to do some post production work although no writing for the eight episodes of "lost" that have been shot he says "we feel we owe that to our fans " he said "we would harm our franchise if we didnt do it ourselves " in the last time the wga went on strike a large number of showrunners began to waver after about five months according to brian walton who was the wgas executive director and chief negotiator at the time "they started to say look this looks really bad is there some way we could go back and take that last offer " he recalled the strike was resolved soon thereafter "it had an impact " he said this time the wgas strike rule no prohibits writers from providing any "writing services " including "minor adjustments" to a script before and during production the guild says it doesnt interpret that rule to prohibit post production editing that doesnt alter the script but it has made a "moral appeal" for showrunners to support the strike in any way they can says jeff hermanson assistant executive director of the wga west "theres been a real difference of opinion" about whether writers should act as producers during the strike said mr cuse of "lost " "im in the moderate camp i strongly believe that each showrunner should make a decision based on his own conscience and circumstance " meanwhile tv studios have been applying pressure to showrunners several including cbs paramount network television a unit of cbs corp have sent "breach of contract" letters to showrunners twentieth century fox television part of news corp has sent letters suspending the lucrative production deals of at least some showrunners who havent showed up to work marc graboff co chairman of general electrics nbc entertainment and universal media studios sent a memo to showrunners and producers before the strike in the form of a list of frequently asked questions the memo reviewed by the wall street journal says that anyone with producing duties must fulfill them and that includes the group of writing tasks prohibited by wgas strike rule no the memo also says showrunners are prohibited from turning in scripts to the union something that wga strike rule no says they are obliged to do because the scripts are company property last week as pressure mounted a large group of showrunners engaged in a spirited three hour debate at wga wests headquarters about whether to return to producing some there decided they would be willing to return to producing tasks permitted under the strike but not to writing if the studios and wga restarted good faith negotiations "we wanted to offer a carrot to the studios " said steve levitan creator of foxs "back to you " "we want to go back and do our shows "
