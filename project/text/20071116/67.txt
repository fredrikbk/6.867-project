williams years old is a conservative christian whose biggest political fear is that fellow republicans might nominate abortion rights supporter rudy giuliani for president mr kelley is writing big campaign checks for barack obama and other democrats and taxes dont make his top list of critical political issues in this newly competitive state and elsewhere republicans are struggling to reassure their nervous religious right base while democrats are profiting from increasing support among high income voters and that support may be more impervious to warnings of higher taxes than some republicans assume "the democratic party stands more for creating equal opportunity " says mr kelley he says the party "speaks more to me on issues of the environment and even more to me on national security " while he criticizes republican stands on "so called moral issues" such as gay marriage as for proposals by democratic congressional leaders and presidential contenders to raise taxes on high earners mr kelley says "the pocketbook the taxes thats issue and the balance has swayed so far in favor of the other things " in the election exit surveys showed president bush defeated john

million "theres a difference in the type of giver that ive seen " observes kirk dornbush a veteran democratic fund raiser who runs an atlanta based biotechnology firm in the past he explains affluent donors from business or the professions were often "people that needed access " now he says democrats are benefiting from concerns over americas "loss of standing in the world " mr bushs environmental policies and concern over the possibility of recession an increasing number of high income americans "are yearning for something different and something different is the democrats " as mr kelleys disdain for "so called moral issues" suggests the roles he and ms williams play in politics are connected since the reagan era conservative christians have grown in prominence as republican foot soldiers voters like ms williams have elevated "values" concerns in a party once associated more with the chamber of commerce than the church "im pro life basically thats why im republican " ms williams says she also agrees with republican criticism of democrats economic policies "democrats are all for social programs which raise my taxes " says ms williams who lives in a working class neighborhood "im not working to pay for people to sit at home watching cable all day " over time both those concerns have generated a backlash in colorado among affluent secular voters with different priorities "twenty five years ago business could safely vote republican and believe that their interests in business were going to be taken care of " says neil westergaard editor of the denver business journal "as the republican party has changed i think that became less true " while business leaders still generally favor holding down taxes he says "colorado already has low taxes and has always and we began in the s to start feeling the effects of limited tax support for things like higher education and transportation which coincidentally became more important as economic development issues for the business community " democrats cashed in on that shift here in when gubernatorial candidate bill ritter won business support by opposing stringent tax limitation measures backed by his republican rivals "we found a way to talk about investing in infrastructure that makes sense to the affluent and it makes sense to the business community " mr ritter now governor says in an interview democrats aim to repeat that success in the presidential race with mr kelley helping to provide the financial fuel his wife amie a documentary filmmaker jokes that they seem to hold fund raisers at their elegant denver home at the rate of "one a month " since the private equity executive has donated more than &# to federal candidates more than twice as much as he had given in the previous years according to the center for responsive politics scott reed who managed republican bob doles presidential campaign sees three overlapping problems for republicans among business leaders and high income voters one is desire to go with the winning side at a time when democrats have captured congress a second is loss of confidence in the bush administrations competence and a third is "a sense that the leadership of the republican party is too beholden to a small group of self appointed social conservative leaders " in mr reed adds "republicans have to go back to the basics and use the new presidential nominee to rebrand the entire party "
