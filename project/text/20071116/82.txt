stalled condo projects tarnish trumps name buyers lambaste developer whose coffers seem secure even the trump name isnt bigger than the calamitous condo market donald trumps reputation as a real estate developer could take a hit as some condominium projects emblazoned with his famous name run into trouble in recent years mr trump has lent his name and in some cases his own money to at least projects in the u s and another half dozen abroad including buildings in dubai of the united arab emirates and seoul south korea while in some cities such projects are doing fine others face slow sales project delays and cancellations and irate buyers in tampa fla buyers who placed deposits of &# to &# million on units in the story trump tower tampa are fuming nearly three years after the &# million skyscraper was started construction has stopped meantime a fort lauderdale fla tower with mr trumps name on it was put on hold indefinitely last month and a west palm beach project could be put on the shelf shortly construction on a trump tower in toronto is just getting under way after years of delays and a reduction in height and at trump tower chicago a hotel and condo project set to be the second tallest building in the city after the sears tower of the units remain unsold as the condo market there slows mr trump is known for focusing on the positive "all of my stuff has been a great success " he said in an interview wednesday "nobody has even come close to the track record that i have " he points to many other projects he is involved in that he considers outsized successes including ones in las vegas hollywood fla miami new york hawaii and the dominican republic "somebody says hows the market i say not good except for trump " he says but the recent problems at developments bearing his name are evidence that no one is immune from the downdraft in the housing market new housing projects throughout the country are suffering from weak demand and falling prices as banks tighten credit standards and a glut of empty units swells this time around mr trump personally is in little danger financially during the last real estate collapse in the early s he was pushed to the brink of bankruptcy because he was personally on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of debt he later restructured his debt with the banks and worked his way back to doing real estate deals in some recent condo projects mr trump has sold his name to developers for a fee and in certain cases he gets a portion of the sales in the building as well in some he has contributed a minority slice of equity this means even if the projects fail his financial exposure is limited although his reputation may suffer in other projects such as in chicago and las vegas he says he is the lead investor at trump tower tampa which began its marketing in sales initially soared the local development company simdag llc sold all units and then as the market skyrocketed returned buyers deposits raised the units prices and sold out again then in august a city inspector examining a key part of the foundation known as the caissons discovered the plot of land wasnt solid enough to support design construction never resumed in may mr trump sued simdag in federal court in tampa charging the developer with failing to pay him much of his licensing fee and failing to execute on construction and sales milestones promised in the contract court documents filed by mr trumps lawyers say his involvement was limited to licensing his name to the developer for &# million plus a cut of the sales but many of the buyers feel that they were led to believe that he had a much larger stake "the only reason we bought into this was because of trump " says don wallace a local restaurant owner whose wife elaine lucadano has interests in two units "hes bashing rosie odonnell and were twisting in the wind " referring to mr trumps tabloid spat with the talk show host jugal and maju teneja who paid &# to reserve a unit in october filed a suit against mr trump and simdag in hillsborough county circuit court claiming they deceived buyers into thinking mr trump was closely involved in the development of the tower mr trump says his role as a licensor was disclosed in offering documents given to buyers a point mr wallace disputes mr trump also noted that his ability to deal with construction problems has been limited "when i license my name to somebody i dont have the same power over a job " he says "i could have pulled the tampa job off easily other people cant pull it off easily " now mr trump says the tampa project has become a victim of the deteriorating financing and sales climate "if there was a job today that was going to start i would most likely say lets wait a little while " he says overall though he says his projects are successful even in markets that are suffering problems noting his name indeed sells units "how many times is trump supposed to be selling out a building before they move forward " mr trump asks as for his brand image he says "tampa doesnt hurt me " simdag pins the delays on construction problems "this wasnt a story about a bad market its a story about bad soil " says david hooks a spokesman for simdag the developer says it is now being held up by a delay in obtaining construction financing and that the company is close to getting financing from a hedge fund it declined to identify the trump name has driven the success of numerous condo projects mr trump says six months ago he received nonrefundable deposits for every unit on a project in honolulu in one day his says his interest in the project goes beyond licensing his name but declined to give details a condo hotel tower in new yorks soho that he is affiliated with has inquiries of interest for slots though they arent for sale yet he says but not all of mr trumps ventures have been runaway successes his casino company was forced to seek bankruptcy court protection in it emerged in as trump entertainment resorts inc but has since struggled in the condo market some of mr trumps projects may be suffering in part from brand dilution one person familiar with the fort lauderdale project trump las olas said it was shelved partly because mr trump has lent his name to two other projects nearby mr trump denies there was any brand dilution though he says trump las olas didnt make it because it "cant compete with the graves site " a hotel and tower project that also bears his name in fort lauderdale designed by architect michael graves "frankly its a better site its a more impressive building " mr trump says mr trumps delayed condo hotel project in toronto fell behind a competing ritz carlton and the building now going up has
