weekend journal breaking the grass ceiling susan myers quit her job as an investment banker and became one of the nations few female high school football coaches on a friday night in late october the prince of peace eagles are about to lose to rockwall christian as she paces the sidelines susan myers isnt thinking about gender roles shes a coach for an team whose players seem to be losing faith in themselves as quarterback austin smith shuffles off the field ms myers grabs his jersey and pulls him close until her nose is just a couple of inches from his facemask before the season the eagles had pointed to their next opponent a small catholic school in irving texas called the highlands as one they should beat she wanted mr smith to send a message to the team "thats the game weve got to win " she shouted "theyve got to know thats the game " as the wide receivers coach for prince of peace a private christian school near dallas ms myers years old is one of only a few women in the nation coaching high school football so far as the american football coaches association knows shes the only one plying her trade in texas a state where the boys who play the game and the men who lead them form a current that powers the egos of entire towns women operate on the fringes of the football world mostly to support and validate they rarely step on the field without a set of pompons morgan schwab a wide receiver had never heard of a female football coach before prince of peace hired ms myers he says he got over the novelty on the second day of spring practice when during agility and footwork drills she took a plastic bat to the legs of any players with poor form ms myers grew up in kansas city her father a hospital administrator gave her the nickname chuck because she reminded him of his uncle charlie she attended wellesley earned an m b a from harvard and spent years as an investment banker for j p morgan she spent most of her career living and working in europe where she conducted business in three languages after the fall of the berlin wall she specialized in helping state run companies make the transition to capitalism then she put her career on hold to become a trailing spouse in she followed her husband richard a developer shed met in london to dallas where he was starting a real estate company ms myers knew next to nothing about football when she arrived but was amazed by its cultural significance "the tonight show" would be delayed minutes so the local news could give a report from the dallas cowboys training camp and nearly everyone referred to the teams players by their first names "like they were your neighbors " she says that same year she attended a cowboys game with her husband and spent the entire game scanning the sidelines through binoculars she was transfixed by the interactions between coaches and players some months later her husband handed her a clipping about a summer football camp at the university of north texas and suggested half jokingly that she should go she called the camp and told them she was way too old and the wrong gender but wanted to attend the camp in order to shadow the coaches they obliged ms myers has had eight football jobs in the past eight years which is a lot even in a nomadic business in one case she switched jobs for a better opportunity in another because a new head coach replaced the schools entire staff while undergoing treatment for breast cancer three years ago she helped her daughters school start a football program being a female football coach in texas isnt easy when ms myers interviewed for her first serious coaching position at covenant christian academy in colleyville in some board members thought hiring a woman would undermine the programs credibility "the concern was that we would look amateurish " said one trustee although she got the covenant job and the team won all of its games but one ms myers said the head coach chris dodd pulled her aside one day late in the season to tell her she wouldnt be invited back and that the decision had a good deal to do with her gender mr dodd who has since left covenant declined to comment on the incident but said he never made any decisions in that job by himself this spring ms myers interviewed for a job at bishop lynch high school in dallas where she had served as the tight ends coach in the year the team won a texas state championship for private and parochial schools she said the teams new head coach bill persinger told her he couldnt hire her because there are too many people who doubt that a woman truly understands the physical and aggressive nature of football or could be capable of imparting it to the players mr persinger said he mainly wanted to hire someone with more experience in his offensive system but that ms myerss gender and the likely protests that would come from parents if she was hired were factors in the decision too to get her current job at prince of peace she disguised her gender by applying under the name s "chuck" myers doug pevehouse who had just been hired to start a football program at the private christian school in the dallas suburb of carrollton said he had no idea what the initial stood for "if it would have said susan i probably wouldnt have called " he said off the field ms myers drives a gold mercedes wears diamond earrings and buys designer clothes hand picked by a personal shopper for games she rejects the khaki pants uniform of the other coaches in favor of white tights and a skirt but on the field shes as buttoned down as they come coach myers believes the key to success in high school football isnt a complex playbook but a practice regimen that emphasizes blocking tackling throwing and catching for receivers shes invented exercises to strengthen their fingers and employs drills to improve everything from stances and starts to cuts and releases "for most coaches their comfort zone is xs and os " she said "mine is fundamentals " in january her book "the complete handbook of coaching wide receivers " was published by coaches choice which says it has become one of its bestselling titles mike leach the head coach at texas tech university said he uses some of the books drills on releasing the method receivers use to separate themselves from defenders who crowd them at the line of scrimmage "you dont find a lot of harvard m b a s that have expertise on receivers " mr leach says most modern coaches view football as a battle of strategy to avoid being outsmarted they look for answers in sophisticated schemes if ms myers had her way she would shrink the offensive playbook to about five plays isolate the skills they require and make sure the players master them through exhaustive drills its a philosophy that sometimes puts her at odds with her colleagues at the coaches film session after the rockwall loss the subject turned to kickoff returns ms myers said the team might score more touchdowns on returns if the players improved their blocking techniques and suggested working on this in practice after a silence mr pevehouse popped up and told the group hed devised a perfect play a kickoff return that would send most of the eagles players weaving through traffic to block defenders on opposite sides of the field "i like it " ms myers said "but my only devils advocate question is whether our time is better spent teaching them something new or working on what weve been doing " her point hung in the air for a moment until one of her fellow assistants joined in "they like this kind of stuff " he said "they get excited about the trick plays " ms myers looked down and jotted something on her pad taking a moment to compose herself "yeah " she said finally "this is a good plan " as she stepped into her car after the meeting ms myers acknowledged this wasnt the first disagreement over tactics "i know were going to have two new offenses by monday " that same afternoon coach myers sat on her family room sofa with her feet propped on a coffee table the television was tuned to a college game between tulsa and southern methodist richard myers sat on a nearby chair he had spent most of the morning helping their daughter christina with her science homework and buying food for her schools halloween party later that night hed asked his wife if he could change the channel to a better game but shed refused shes close to several members of the smu coaching staff while hes glad to have a wife who likes football mr myers said "she likes it a little more than i do sometimes i want to go to a movie " after a short gain by tulsa on a running play ms myers whod been studying the receivers at the edges of the frame broke a silence "you knew that was a run because the receiver jogged off the line " she said "sometimes they do that to get a better angle on the block " a few minutes later mr myers headed upstairs for a nap "wake me up at six " he said that evening christina myers was preparing for the halloween party shed decided to go dressed as a football player her costume consisted of a white helmet a navy blue jersey with the number matching pants knee high socks and a pair of pink tennis shoes she ran over to the couch and asked her mother if she could use some of her fathers cologne "i need to smell like a man " she said soon she was standing in front of a mirror flexing her muscles like a bodybuilder "im feeling good " she said to her reflection "i like this " ms myers popped up from the couch and offered to show her daughter how to hold the football she was carrying "so the boys dont strip it " christina held the ball like she was about to throw it "no not like that " her mother said she reached out and tucked the ball between christinas right elbow and palm most people think you squeeze the ball with your hand but you actually apply pressure with your elbow she explained before this season nobody had expected much from the prince of peace eagles it was the schools first football team and some of its players hadnt worn a helmet before showing up for practice but nobody imagined how bad the losing would make them feel least of all coach myers if the eagles werent able to beat highlands the weakest opponent on their schedule the seniors on the team would graduate without ever knowing what its like to win a high school football game in texas for ms myers the urge to win inspired her to recommend a play though shes not the teams offensive coordinator she does occasionally slip a call into the mix and that night she planned to insist based on her film study of the highlands defensive scheme she knew the team often used one deep safety by sending two receivers deep she thought the eagles could open up a gap in the middle of the field between the linebackers and the safety where a third receiver could come open shed found a play called "doubles left hbo window" that might do the trick ms myers liked the play for another reason it was a chance for mr smith and mr schwab two players shed bonded with to make a big play tall and reflective with close cropped brown hair mr schwab had shown flashes of talent but barely touched the ball in the rockwall game and spent most of his time stewing in her play mr schwab would run a route right into the open spot on the field the din of two dozen teenage boys crammed into a school bus softened as the vehicle pulled up to the field at highlands ms myers gathered her receiving corps for a speech tears welled up as she told them they deserved a win that theyd worked too hard to miss out on the reward about four minutes before halftime the eagles had taken a commanding lead but highlands scored again to make it at halftime mr pevehouse sensed his team had started to let up "guys " he said during his speech "when we start coasting were going to get beat " to make matters worse the teams starting center whod taken a blow to the head in the first half had been taken to the hospital for observation "were in trouble " she said as prince of peace took over the ball ms myers wanted to call doubles left hbo window she asked david clay the teams offensive coordinator to send it through "time to light up the airways " she said mr smith took the snap dropped back and surveyed the field the two outside receivers ran their deep routes bringing the safety with them mr schwab who had lined up on the left side had run a perfect route right into the opening mr smith let a pass go and mr schwab snared it turned upfield and ran yards for a touchdown the play had worked perfectly the score was in favor of prince of peace and the sideline erupted the rest of the second half was wrenching with a little more than two minutes to go highlands had the ball at the prince of peace nine yard line and was threatening to take the lead ms myers was hunched over with her hands on her knees yelling to her players "gut check baby " highlands final pass was deflected by a prince of peace defender and the ball landed harmlessly on the turf the eagles players and fans rushed from the sidelines to form a triumphant scrum at midfield instead of joining them mr schwab went looking for his coach he spotted her and without saying a word lifted her into the air and twirled her around a half dozen times when shed returned to earth tears were gathering in the corners of her eyes "winning a game like that " ms myers would say later "is one of the most intense life experiences there is "
