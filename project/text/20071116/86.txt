customers prompted its second forecast cut since september "less than truckload freight trends in the fedex freight segment remain weak despite economic signs that the decline in u s industrial production has hit bottom " chief financial officer alan b graf said in a statement interestingly fedex made the reference to industrial production right before octobers numbers were released by the federal reserve which said output dropped last month below analysts forecasts for a increase and while fedex said production has hit bottom it may be there for a while "we expect manufacturing output to decline in the fourth quarter " economist nigel gault of global insight said looking at the numbers mr gault saw "a broadly based decline that indicates a weakening economy " and in a speech today fed governor randall kroszner conceded that the economy is facing a "rough patch " however he also indicated that the fed doesnt have any more rate cuts up its sleeve saying weaker data in coming months "would not by themselves suggest to me that the current stance of monetary policy is inappropriate " the fed already has an economic downturn factored into its forecasts and officials have made clear that inflation continues to be a major concern "looking forward one feature of monetary policy to keep in mind is that all else equal each successive action in the same direction tends to lower the incremental benefits and to raise the incremental costs of additional actions " mr kroszner said increasingly the fed may find itself between a rock and a hard place fedexs statement today raises the specter of the feds nightmare scenario stagflation where higher inflation and economic weakness go hand in hand thats because while the company warned of slowing volume it also blamed rising costs which could be passed on to the consumer "while we have dynamic fuel surcharges in place they cannot keep pace in the short term with rapidly rising fuel prices " mr graf said in midday trading fedex
