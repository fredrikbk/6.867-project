some handy scanners can trim that pile of business cards three cards needed major retyping replacing missing numbers and redoing a name that got scrambled into a phone number new business card scanners are coming onto the market making it easier than ever to organize those cards piled high on our desks or stuffed into our wallets the latest versions of the devices are getting smaller in size compared with the old ones and have more features you can use them to scan photos id cards and checks among other things just so the item is no more than slightly bigger than card size i have been testing two products the opticard from plustek technology of cerritos calif and the iriscard pro from belgium based image recognition integrated systems or i r i s i found that both scanners have a quick and easy way to organize business card information but their software isnt as easy to work with when manipulating the resulting digital images also the machines work best at their originally intended task and so are better at scanning business cards than at scanning photos for example the software in both devices overall created clear images of the names and numbers from most of the typical cards that is those cards written with dark ink against a light background the scanners did a poor job when they had to read cards that were printed on dark colored stock installing the software was easy enough and took only a few minutes after inserting the software cd into your computer small pop up windows open to guide you through the process when the installation is finished you connect the scanner to your computers usb port with the cord provided to begin scanning you just feed the cards into a front slot on the devices and push the scan button the scanners pull the cards across the scanning head and spit them out the back saving the cards in the process the first time you use the scanners you will be asked to calibrate them to set the parameters for color shadows and light its an easy task you just insert a special card that comes with the packages the scanners software can recognize and categorize cards written in several languages including spanish french german italian arabic and chinese scanning a business card using either machine didnt take more than five seconds photo scanning took much longer both machines have two buttons on the top for scanning and for further customizing the scan the scan button has a few standard configurations for capturing the image from the card and transforming it into a pdf file the custom button begins with the same process but then allows you to manipulate the results when i inserted a card into one of the scanners and pressed the custom button a window pop up opened for me to choose details such as language color dimensions the specific file to which i wanted to send the image and the storage format you can edit the cards as you store them and make any fixes you might have from botched scans the images are saved in the folder you chose when you configured your scanning options you can opt to arrange them just alphabetically too the scanners come with software that can help make the scanning and organizing process more efficient but could also be a bit confusing for some users because of all the choices to test the new opticard which costs &# i processed random business cards with white backgrounds i found that scanning was swift white background cards came out perfectly or with such minor glitches that they didnt require any editing an additional four needed some editing but fixing them didnt take more than a few minutes three cards needed major retyping replacing missing numbers and redoing a name that got scrambled into a phone number i also tried scanning two dark background cards but to no avail one didnt come out at all and the other had black splotches i found the &# iriscard pro slightly more accurate in scanning textual information from the same cards only two needed minor editing replacing a hyphen with a comma for example and just one card required major retyping replacing skipped information the scanner however was no better at the dark cards i also scanned a couple photos in both devices but the copies were too blurry to save both scanners are smaller than many tv remote controls the opticard is inches high inches wide and inches deep the iriscard pro is by inches and is two inches deep i was able to take them to work in one of my jacket pockets i could imagine bringing the device along for a days long seminar to keep up with card collecting both are compatible with windows pcs and macs while the interface between the scanners and the users contact data program could offer more features to make organizing easier these tools are worth a try at least you can get those cards off your desk before the pile topples email me at sarmad ali wsj com walt mossberg is on vacation
