liquidity open market operations can be used to inject cash at the federal funds rate which is relatively cheap but only against a limited range of collateral the discount rate on the other hand is a

billion and potentially far more in four separate auctions starting this week though the loans will be at rates far below what the fed charges on direct loans to banks from its so called discount window banks will still be able to use the same broad variety of collateral that they can pledge for discount window loans the ecb has already undertaken moves similar to those the fed unveiled to
