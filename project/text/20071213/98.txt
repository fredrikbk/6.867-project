politics &amp economics stoking the immigration fire passionate minority drives issue to fore politicians worry jim kessler vice president of third way a democratic think tank that has polled extensively on immigration dismisses the notion that the anger is rooted in fear illegal immigrants are taking jobs from americans merrimack n h only of the new hampshire population is foreign born but even here illegal immigration is among the most volatile issues in the presidential primary campaign dennis williams is one reason why mr williams a retired computer project manager says he has faxed his senators representative and the presidential candidates times in the past months about his opposition to illegal immigration he has made dozens of phone calls to washington he emails immigration news to a circle of friends "have i ever felt so empowered politically no " says mr williams in his living room here which is crowded with christmas decorations "something is finally happening " mr williams who calls himself a conservative republican is a member of what political scientists call the "issue public" people whose passion about an issue elevates it to prominence and keeps it there issue voters usually are in the minority but they worry politicians because of their tenacity says university of iowa political scientist david redlawsk in past campaigns such focused activists have driven issues such as abortion and gun control onto the national agenda even as polls showed that large majorities of the public didnt share their intense feelings for the campaign illegal immigration is emerging as a driving issue even though only one in nine americans tells pollsters it is their "priority " "politicians are afraid of groups that care deeply and people who care the most about illegal immigration are against it " says mr redlawsk the issue is particularly hot in the republican race this week former massachusetts gov mitt romney launched blistering attacks against former arkansas gov mike huckabee for supporting some college benefits for illegal immigrants mr huckabee in turn trumpeted the endorsement he received by the leader of a controversial citizens border surveillance group raising the temperature of the party battle over who is tougher on the issue as intense as the issue is in new hampshire it is likely to be more pivotal in socially conservative south carolina where the immigrant population has risen since and where republicans will hold their next major electoral test on jan in iowa which holds its caucuses jan of republicans and of democrats said in an october poll that all illegal immigrants should be deported arizona republican sen john mccain who once seemed a shoo in to win the jan new hampshire primary lost more than half his standing after supporting a senate bill that would have given legal status to millions of unlawful immigrants illegal immigration has struck "a real emotional chord " says mr mccain the reasons why are murky jim kessler vice president of third way a democratic think tank that has polled extensively on immigration dismisses the notion that the anger is rooted in fear illegal immigrants are taking jobs from americans voters know most illegal immigrants do unskilled low paying work that few others want he says instead third ways polling shows voters are angry because they believe illegal immigrants are getting a better deal from the government than they are that would explain the uproar over proposals to give illegal immigrants drivers licenses or access to in state tuition rates at public universities the "unfairness" argument extends to worries that illegal immigrants about of whom are hispanic use more in public services than they contribute in local taxes "theres no money tree behind any state capitol hard working natives are being taxed away " says dianne gilbert a selectman in tiny epping n h who says her internet circle of immigration opponents sends her as many as emails a day the sense of being overwhelmed by another language and culture adds more sparks to the debate but equally powerful for immigration activists is the sense that the government largely created the problem by not penalizing employers for hiring illegal immigrants which lured more to the u s "theres something that has been done behind the scene to sell away our laws " says mr williams the merrimack retiree expressing a common suspicion mr williams years old says he hasnt been politically active before but became worried about illegal immigration because of the terrorist attacks two senate bills that would have given most illegal immigrants a path to citizenship spurred him to action and ignited the current debate he stumbled on a web site that linked him to other activists provided him with his senators phone numbers and voting records and schooled him in the legislative process pro immigration activists now concede that any attempt to revive a legalization bill is dead for perhaps five years but that hasnt muted the anger that candidates are facing mr williams says he checks his email twice daily for immigration alerts and advisories and sends perhaps a dozen faxes a month to keep the issue front and center on a recent afternoon he composed a note warning that illegal immigration makes legal immigrants less welcome sent it to the eight democratic presidential candidates and helped ensure that immigration will remain a big issue at least through next november
