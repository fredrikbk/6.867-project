a better fed idea yesterdays announcement that the federal reserve and four other central banks are offering a new way for banks to borrow is the kind of creative regulatory plumbing weve been waiting to see in this credit imbroglio maybe were finally getting somewhere yesterdays announcement that the federal reserve and four other central banks are offering a new way for banks to borrow is the kind of creative regulatory plumbing weve been waiting to see in this credit imbroglio while news reports described this as one more "liquidity" injection it is important to distinguish yesterdays move from the overall monetary easing the fed continued a day before the latter is a blunt instrument that amounts to flooding the entire economy with dollars it carries substantial risks for the value of the dollar and future inflation especially the way the fed has been so willing to respond to wall street pleading to cut interest rates yesterdays move is a more surgical strike aimed at offering short term assistance to the financial institutions hit hardest by the mortgage mess banks will have access to a new "term auction facility" of at least &# billion that will be a cousin of the "discount window" that allows banks to borrow using a variety of collateral banks will be able to tap the facility at lower rates than they can at the discount window which banks sometimes prefer not to use lest it signal they are in trouble the core of the problems in the current mess are solvency and uncertainty everyone knows banks are going to take tens of billions of dollars in losses but no one is sure precisely of their magnitude or location so everyone gets wary of lending and puts their money in safer t bills the fed move should help to ease that anxiety though with far less risk of debasing the currency meanwhile the fed and treasury should be working on longer term solvency plans for the banks with the worst credit problems this beats dropping more money from helicopters
