intraparty feuds dog democrats stall congress unfinished work is piling up legislation to aid borrowers affected by the housing mess rescue millions of middle class families from a big tax increase and put stricter gas mileage limits on the auto industry democrats are hoping to get a boost by enacting the tougher auto mileage standards before christmas but other matters such as a farm bill to continue government price supports are likely to wait for the new year washington democrats took control of congress last january promising a "new direction " a year later the image that haunts them most is one symbolizing no direction at all gridlock unfinished work is piling up legislation to aid borrowers affected by the housing mess rescue millions of middle class families from a big tax increase and put stricter gas mileage limits on the auto industry two months into the new fiscal year democrats are still scrambling just to keep the government open president bush and republicans are contributing to the impasse but theres another factor intraparty squabbling between house democrats and senate democrats is sometimes almost as fierce as the partisan battling a fracas between democrats this week over a proposed &# billion spending package is the latest example the spending would keep the government running through the current fiscal year which ends sept but it has opened party divisions over funding the iraq war and lawmakers home state projects after enjoying an early rise congresss approval ratings have fallen since the spring amid the rancor in the latest wall street journal nbc poll just of respondents said they approved of the job congress is doing while disapproved democrats are hoping to get a boost by enacting the tougher auto mileage standards before christmas but other matters such as a farm bill to continue government price supports are likely to wait for the new year republicans suffered from the same house senate tensions in their years of rule in congress but the situation is more acute now for democrats who must cope with both mr bushs vetoes and the narrowest of margins in the senate leaving them vulnerable to republican filibusters democrats in the house interpret the elections as a mandate for change they are more antiwar and more willing to shed old ways such as "earmarks" for legislators pet projects to confront the white house senate democrats by comparison remain more tied to tradition and institutional rules that demand consensus before taking action "the senate and house are out of phase with one another " says rep barney frank chairman of the house financial services committee "there was a big change last year a big change that affected the whole house and one third of the senate thats the fundamental disconnect " rather than move to the center after president bush has moved right to shore up his conservative base he has also adopted a confrontational veto strategy calculated to disrupt the new congress and reduce its effectiveness in challenging him on iraq just yesterday the president issued his second veto of democrat backed legislation to expand government provided health insurance for the children of working class families in his first six years as president mr bush issued only one veto since democrats took over congress he has issued six vetoes and threats of more hang over the budget talks now for democrats teamwork is vital to challenging the president and its not always forthcoming a comment by charles rangel a new york democrat who is chairman of the house ways and means committee suggests the distant relationship between the two houses "we have a constitutional responsibility to send legislation over there " said rep rangel "quite frankly i dont give a damn what they feel " adds wisconsin rep david obey the chairman of the house appropriations committee "i can tell you when bills will move and you can tell me when the senate will sell us out " with an election year overseen by a lame duck president its unlikely that congress will be able to break out of its slump sometimes the disputes resemble play acting senate majority leader harry reid d nev has quietly invited house speaker nancy pelosi d cal to blame the senate if it suits her purpose to explain the slow pace of legislation according to a person close to sen reid at the same time he can use her as his foil to fend off republican demands in the senate "i cant control speaker pelosi " he said last week in debate on an energy bill "she is a strong independent woman she runs the house with an iron hand " still the interchamber differences have real consequences as seen in the fight over the budget senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd of west virginia long argued against creating a big package that would combine all the main spending bills he preferred to confront mr bush with a series of targeted individual bills where he could gain some republican support and maintain leverage over the president but mr byrd was undercut by his leaderships failure to allow more time for debate on the senate floor after labor day the house began pressing for a single large package the &# billion proposed bill ultimately emerged from weeks of talks that included moderate republicans the bill cut &# billion from earlier spending proposals moving closer to mr bush while giving him new money he wanted for the state department as well as a border security initiative no new money was provided specifically for iraq but the bill gives the pentagon an additional &# billion for the war in afghanistan and body armor for troops in the field the goal was to provide enough money for army accounts so its funding would be adequate into april when a fuller debate could be held on the u s s plans in iraq for senate democrats and mr byrd the effort was a gamble that a moderate center could be found to stand up to mr bush the more combative mr obey the house appropriations chairman was never persuaded this could happen after the white house announced its opposition over the weekend mr obey said monday that the budget proposal was dead unless changes were made the effect was to divide democrats again instead of putting up a united front against the white houses resistance mr obey suggested that lawmakers should be willing to strip out home state projects acceding to mr bushs tight line on spending if thats what it took to make a tough stand on iraq "i am perfectly willing to lose every dollar on the domestic side of the ledger in order to avoid giving them money for the war without conditions " mr obey said his suggestion met strong resistance from senate democrats at a party luncheon senators were almost comic in their anger said one colleague who was present loudly complaining of being reduced to being "puppets" or "slaves " on the senate floor yesterday texas republican sen john cornyn said democrats were showing signs of "attention deficit disorder " senate minority leader mitch mcconnell a kentucky republican accused the new majority of being more interested in "finger pointing" and "headlines" than legislation "it wont get bills signed into law " he said while ms pelosi had personally supported mr obeys approach she instructed the house committee to preserve the projects as it began a second round of spending reductions yesterday cutting an additional &# billion from the &# billion package the senate committees democratic staff joined in the discussions by evening but the white house denied reports that a deal had been reached at a spending ceiling above the presidents initial request if agreement is not reached by the end of next week lawmakers may have to resort again to a yearlong funding resolution that effectively freezes most agencies at their current levels this would be a repeat of the collapse of the budget process last year under republican rule not the "new direction" democrats had hoped for tied in knots the house and senate are struggling to complete several matters before they head home this month appropriations only the pentagon budget is in place for the new fiscal year that began oct the house and senate are struggling to finish a bill covering the rest of the government farm bill the senate still hopes to complete its version of a farm bill but negotiations with the house will wait until next year amt relief the house and senate have passed legislation limiting the alternative minimum taxs hit on millions of middle class taxpayers but they differ about whether to offset the lost revenue medicare doctors are set to see a cut in medicare payments in which lawmakers want to prevent the house acted but senate hasnt yet housing several bills addressing the housing crisis have passed the house but are languishing in the senate
