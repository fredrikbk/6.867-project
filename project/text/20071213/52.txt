home &amp family cranky consumer gift sos we enlist personal shoppers free services ease holiday mall woes but silver sandals short on ideas and grumpy at the prospect of spending many unproductive hours at the mall we decided to outsource our task to specialists personal shoppers in response to our query to neiman marcuss "online personal shopper" including a list of people we needed gifts for we were directed to look at their catalogue web site and specifically the part of the site that lists "gifts and electronics " we knew we were in trouble when the holiday cards started coming in the mail we had a frighteningly long gift list with everyone from great aunts and nieces and nephews to teachers tennis coaches and babysitters on it but hadnt even started shopping short on ideas and grumpy at the prospect of spending many unproductive hours at the mall we decided to outsource our task to specialists personal shoppers we picked five two were with department stores macys and bloomingdales two online personalshopper com and neimanmarcus com and one independent ella goldin of chic inspiration chicinspiration com all of the services except for chic inspirations were free two weeks later we had a lot of gifts to give plus some things we had no idea we needed our first stop was the personal shopper at macys harriet katz with macys by appointment when we called she called right back we made an appointment for the next morning at macys in stamford conn minutes from our house it all felt very easy ms katz asked us basic questions about the people on our list age gender relationship and gave us a "friends and family" discount card to use then we headed into the store some of her picks worked some didnt we liked the long loosely knit sweater with big buttons that she chose for a year old girl who lives in nashville as well as the green dachshund shaped purse for her younger sister and our next stop the mens cashmere sweaters on sale were perfect at &# with all the discounts down from &# each we didnt love her idea of a purse or hand bag as a teacher gift so we passed on those but we liked the cute scarves she showed us nearby ms katz disappeared a few times during our hour to deal with another unscheduled client though she was very apologetic when she returned and sent a note later apologizing again when we were done shopping she just rang up our purchases in her office next stop bloomingdales in white plains n y cheryl effren of bloomingdales at your service asked us the gender and age of our recipients and some specifics about their interests her specific recommendations werent all on target but the departments she took us to were just right though the platter she strongly suggested as a hostess gift for a friend seemed too large the wine coaster we spotted nearby was perfect we also bought a childs sweater in a slightly larger size since ms effren said they ran small a tennis jacket for one family member and a grey cashmere cable knit long sweater this one was for us ms effren was clearly more than willing to steer us to the sale items when we were done all our gifts were boxed and be ribboned ms effren had an assistant standing by who pulled them together while ms effren didnt push us to buy anything we did feel some self imposed pressure since we didnt want to waste her time next we went online and tried out personalshopper com we went to the "my gifts" section and tried to create profiles of the people on our gift list but that turned out to be a little difficult there werent enough categories in "relationships the babysitter and kids tennis coach became "business associates" and we didnt know everybodys birthdays a requirement to complete the profile the recommendations were uneven we searched for a present for an office manager a woman and the site recommended a pair of high heeled silver sandals among other things which seemed a bit too personal and off beat but we really liked the cool sharper image clock suggested for a spouse when we tried to buy it there is a link to the sharper image site however it wasnt actually available the site was easier to use when we ditched the profiles and simply looked through the sites categories such as product brand names or "personality " where you can put in specifics like "adult male golfer " personalshopper com said "my gifts" is a recent addition to the site and is still being tinkered with neiman marcus com was far more straightforward but didnt offer us any specific information in response to our query to neiman marcuss "online personal shopper" including a list of people we needed gifts for we were directed to look at their catalogue web site and specifically the part of the site that lists "gifts and electronics " a company spokesman later explained that we were supposed to have received follow up emails with specific gift ideas and that the company would work to fix the problem we never received the follow ups wanting a bit more hand holding we decided to try one of the many independent personal shoppers who can shop in a wide array of stores we headed to manhattan to meet with ella goldin of chic inspiration a personal shopper with a business background who works with individuals and corporate clients ms goldin does everything from buying gifts to reshaping wardrobes to organizing what she calls a day of style for her clients while ms goldin says she usually does her shopping without her clients then sends the purchases to them we agreed that it was a good idea to shop together the first time so she could get a sense of what we were looking for ms goldin led us to the museum of modern art store a design store tiffany and lees art store in less than two hours we got through the major gifts still on our list not all of her suggestions were a hit a serving bowl for mom didnt seem quite right nor did a modern carafe for an office manager but we kept talking and came up with a bunch of gifts that worked including a very modern magnetic table calendar &# a tiffany silver beaded bracelet &# and two booklights &# each ms goldin gets paid only by her clients &# per hour as well as a commission so we felt pressure to be efficient but we didnt feel pushed into buying pricey items company shopper macys by appointment stamford conn harriet katz cost free what they offer ms katz enabled us to zip through the store in a targeted way pointing out items suitable for our gift list and directing us to discounts and sales we never had to search for a sales person even in the holiday rush ms katz rang up our purchases in her office comment we were limited by the store rather than by the personal shopper invariably one store wasnt going to have something for everybody on our list company shopper bloomingdales at your service white plains n y cheryl effren cost free what they offer the same targeted service as macys with a gift selection that worked a little better for us a dedicated salesperson who goes from department to department rings up the purchases and has an assistant to gift wrap comment we liked the bloomingdales broader and more eclectic gift selection but still found we couldnt find everything on our list at one store company shopper personalshopper com cost free what they offer a wide selection of products ability to research by brand price or a host of other categories also delivers recommendations based on profiles of gift recipients that users create comment we had a little trouble figuring out how to create the profiles in the "my gifts" section then the recommendations were mixed one item wasnt available shopping by category worked much better company shopper neimanmarcus com cost free what they offer an email address for a personal shopper who gets back to you with gift suggestions based on the list theyre given as well as links to the appropriate parts of neimanmarcus com comment we emailed part of our gifts needed list and received a stock response directing us to the neimanmarcus com gift and electronics site a spokesman said we should have received a series of follow up emails with specific suggestions but we never did company shopper chic inspiration chicinspiration com manhattan n y ella goldin cost &# per hour plus of the gifts purchase prices paid by the client what they offer personal attention along with the ability to go to any store comment the only service we paid for but a great way to complete our gift list ms goldin worked with us to find gifts that fit the people she seemed equally comfortable in tiffany and lees art shop
