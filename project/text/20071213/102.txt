purchased sunflowerguy com for &# in the aftermarket after constantly being referred to as "the sunflower guy" at parties he says the name stuck when it came time to build a web community which may grow into a platform for a consumer driven flower business he says "we were flexible with the name but we thought gosh if we could get it thatd be great " though he admits if the price was any higher he might have reconsidered the name when it comes to domain name strategies not every option will be right for your business for instance buying a name with a " cn" extension makes no sense unless you do business in china also choosing a kooky name think yahoo and amazon that has nothing to do with what your business does may require a lot of marketing dollars that many small businesses dont have here are some other considerations to make before naming that domain pick pithy phrases since must have web sites can cost thousands if not millions of dollars in the aftermarket "the most valuable domains are going to be the ones that are short easy to spell and memorable " says jeremiah johnston chief operating officer for sedo com an online marketplace for buying and selling domain names and web sites in cambridge mass additionally picking natural and easy to remember phrases that arent already registered can save you a bundle as the average resale price for already registered domain names in the aftermarket is about &# according to johnston unregistered domains usually cost between &# and &# plus a small annual fee however going this route is definitely a judgment call he says johnston provides the example of wifi com which recently sold for around &# and regularly receives about unique visitors every month "if you were to go through a search engine advertiser like yahoo or google and then pay them for key words that might compel unique visitors a month that would cost a pretty penny " he says monte cahn co founder of moniker com in pompano beach fla says previously registered sites tend to have other attractive characteristics such as page rank on google and traffic ratings from web site tracker alexa com cahn added that already registered sites might have back links embedded in other web sites that still connect to your site which also could drive traffic "it gives you a head start if you are trying to brand an online business " he says choose words wisely when dealing with phrases rather than one word domains be conscious of how they look suggests cahn longer and combined words often have words within them for instance the two word combination of "therapist" and "finder" could be misinterpreted as "therapistfinder com " additionally he says "stay away from domains that have double meanings and if they do be careful they dont work against you " also stay away from mistypes of popular web sites and brands "a lot of people dont know that they may get in trouble for using words similar to trademarked brands " he says for instance if you pick a domain name confusingly similar to "pepsi" and you also sell soft drinks you may wind up in court cahn says instead make sure you arent infringing on anyones trademarks do a search at the u s patent office web site but you might want to purchase your own sites misspellings cahn suggests when people type directly into the web address field mistakes invariably occur one missed key stroke or errant underscore can for example land a potential customer at someone elses web site or an error page a good exercise once you settle on a domain name is to ask your friends and family to type it out times each and then buy all the misspellings he says otherwise "that customer who is trying to get to you may or may not come back to you " he says for most individuals and businesses "the com is still the ruler of the world as is org if youre a nonprofit " says larry kutscher chief executive of register com in new york still it might be smart to buy up other extensions such as " biz " " info" and " us " as well the last thing you want to do is "spend money marketing your web address to have your customer get lost or wind up at a competitors site " he says since this can be costly choose extensions
