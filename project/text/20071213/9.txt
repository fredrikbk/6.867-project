its core product the treo smart phone has changed only incrementally at the same time apple and rim have invaded palms turf with sleek new gadgets such as the iphone and blackberry curve as a result palms world wide smart phone market share has dropped to down from a year ago according to gartner inc palms stock has also languished "i knew i couldnt turn the company around by myself " says mr

phone "there was a perception our products had gotten a little stale " says mr colligan "well break out of that " a chunk of mr rubinsteins compensation depends on it according to palms filings one
