as gene tests spread questions follow providers promise to tell you your risk of illness but science doesnt back many of the claims poor predictive value some of the most popular tests claim to identify a persons risk of getting a common ailment such as heart disease or diabetes the pitch on the firms web site "did you know that your daily caffeine consumption may put you at risk for a nonfatal heart attack but if you have a certain gene having cups of coffee may reduce your risk by " the cost of caffeinegen &# for a standard test with results in seven business days or &# for "express" results in three ever since the human genome was deciphered seven years ago companies have been rushing to sell genetic tests directly to consumers but buyers beware many of the claims that accompany these tests are not fully supported by science some genetic tests are currently available there are tests that aim to identify the gender of a fetus as early as seven weeks after conception some companies test for traits such as a "sweet tooth gene " and then sell tailored supplements to hasten weight loss and there are disease specific tests to predict a persons risk of cancer diabetes and numerous other afflictions but often the link between certain genes and a condition can be fuzzy for instance some of the most popular tests claim to identify a persons risk of getting a common ailment such as heart disease or diabetes the roots of these conditions often lie in multiple genes many of which scientists think havent even been discovered yet lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise can have an impact on risk too a person may also carry several other genes whose workings counteract the ill effects of the gene being tested for some genetic counselors also note that people may be no better off when they learn the results if a man finds out for instance that he is at marginally higher risk of getting prostate cancer its not clear what he should do with the information "the significance of the risks uncovered by these tests is very very small " says stuart hogarth a fellow at the institute for science and society at the university of nottingham england who has studied the genetic testing industry "commercialization of genetics tests at this stage is premature " genetic testing can be a useful diagnostic tool for some diseases such as cystic fibrosis would be parents can learn if they risk passing on a gene for cf to their children and perhaps opt for in vitro fertilization where embryos can be screened for the mutation but many experts note that most genetic tests are only loosely regulated and arent required to provide the type of rigorous scientific studies to back up their claims that the pharmaceutical industry must provide a handful of companies are starting to offer a genome scanning service to reveal details about a customers ancestry and disease risk such services are expected to run from a few hundred dollars to nearly &# a newcomer called knome of cambridge mass hopes to cash in with an even bigger project it will identify every single one of the six billion alphabets in a customers genome place it on a cd and get specialists to analyze the result and offer medical advice the price tag &# "we can look for groups of genes that have been associated with cancer predisposition or genes that tell you whether youll have a reaction to a drug " says jorge conde chief executive officer of knome which has fewer than employees and was started just six months ago given the current state of genetic knowledge in which there often arent clear cut associations between genes and disease knomes test "sounds like a genetic horoscope " says gail javitt who leads a genetic testing quality initiative at the genetics and public policy center at johns hopkins university some tests are based on relatively obscure links consumer genetics inc of sunnyvale calif offers a test called caffeinegen to tell whether a person has a "slow" or "fast" caffeine metabolizing gene the pitch on the firms web site "did you know that your daily caffeine consumption may put you at risk for a nonfatal heart attack but if you have a certain gene having cups of coffee may reduce your risk by " the cost of caffeinegen &# for a standard test with results in seven business days or &# for "express" results in three consumer genetics says the test is largely based on a study published last year in jama the journal of the american medical association ahmed el sohemy a professor of nutrigenomics at the university of toronto and a co author of the jama research says the study provides "the best evidence yet" that caffeine may trigger nonfatal heart attacks in some people however prof el sohemy who has no connection to consumer genetics says was surprised when he learned that his research which hasnt been replicated by anyone else was the basis for a consumer test "its premature to sell these tests " he says "id like to see further validation " lily nguyen product manager for consumer genetics says the company stands by the test "were not making a recommendation to drink two to three cups or not to " she says "thats in the consumers hands " icelands decode genetics sells a &# test that looks for the variant of a gene associated with type diabetes while about other genes have also been linked to the disease the current version of the test incorporates only one even if a person tests positive for the variant tcfl the risk of getting diabetes rises to roughly from about in the general population "the predictive value of the genetic test is pretty poor " says david melzer a professor of epidemiology at the university of exeter england last year prof melzer and colleagues published a study based on data collected from more than elderly people in villages near florence italy they found that of the people who tested positive for tcfl didnt get type diabetes in old age and nearly of the people who had diabetes didnt carry the gene variant at all kari stefansson the ceo of decode says the test is useful he says that people who carry the diabetes gene variant will respond better to lifestyle changes improved diet more exercise than those who dont "knowing your risk relative to others provides an incentive to seek treatment " he says genelex corp of seattle sells a &# test for three genes known as cyp variants studies have shown that the genes play some role in determining how a persons body metabolizes antidepressants but last year the u s governments agency for healthcare research and quality published a report indicating that past data didnt support a strong link says a genelex spokeswoman "genelex agrees that randomized trials are important and should be done but there is no reason to not have testing available in the interim " genetic tests are regulated on the basis of whether a lab uses its own chemicals and experimental formulas or whether it uses a "kit" that is manufactured and sold to labs and clinics that perform the test such test kits are regulated by the food and drug administration as "in vitro diagnostic devices " including those used to check for pregnancy or diagnose hiv very few genetic tests are marketed as kits "for the consumer theres no vetting for clinical validity for most of these tests " says ms javitt of johns hopkins there are growing calls for tougher regulation in the united kingdom the human genetics commission wants new rules requiring companies to prove the validity of their dna tests before selling them to the public in the u s two bills were introduced in congress this year that if enacted could lead to greater regulation of genetic tests by the fda an area of particular scrutiny is the growth of "nutrigenetics" vitamins and supplements tailored to a patients dna profile for example one company salugen inc of san diego offers a &# test called genotrim which will analyze your "sweet tooth gene " "nervous eating gene " "fat regulator gene" and others then for &# per month you can buy the firms "dna customized nutritional supplements " including pilot studies more than people have done the tests and bought the supplements since march the company says "each of the genes has been associated with weight problems and each of the supplements have been linked to the particular genes " says brian meshkin ceo of salugen however he concedes that there are hundreds and possibly thousands of other genes that play a role in weight gain but arent included in the test salugen says that an "observational study" of people who took both test and supplements yielded "statistically significant" results but according to the study which wasnt randomized and hasnt been published people lost an average of only of their body weight mr meshkin says the effect could have been greater if the company tried to control what the participants ate in the future the company plans to provide dietary recommendations as well in august the u s government accountability office looked at several nutrigenetic tests sold on four web sites genotrim wasnt one of them the agencys conclusion "the results from all the tests gao purchased mislead consumers by making predictions that are medically unproven and so ambiguous that they do not provide meaningful information to consumers " the gao found that results on one test also suggested that the ingredients for "personalized" supplements which cost about &# a year were substantially the same as typical vitamins and antioxidants found at any grocery store for about &# a year behind the genes some genetic tests and questions surrounding the science consumer genetics caffeinegen test for caffeine metabolizing genes results of a study linking genes
