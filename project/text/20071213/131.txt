wonder land at last a vote after nigh a year of magic bus tours through the state by the presidentially ambitious and after the jan caucuses finish the most arcane voting game on the planet two people will have won iowa and most of the rest will be gagging down their losses if barack comes a close second to hillarys dream team this first name game will be elaborated on in a moment then hell have the iowa caucuss famous second fiddle momentum which carried iowa second place finishers george mcgovern to the party nomination in and jimmy carter in the iowa caucuses are in earshot so naturally ones thoughts turn to fairy tales joy comes from entering the fairy tale world only if one chooses to believe oz worked only so long as the locals believed the wizard was real which means were in iowa now with huck hillary obama oprah rudy mitt and all the political dreams that money and muscle can muster three weeks from today jan while youre watching the fedex orange bowl between kansas and virginia tech iowas most politicized citizens will caucus and vote when theyre done well know whether mike huckabee really has become the wizard of iowa as we all know too well its been a long hard slog during mitt romneys visit to the journals offices last month he told us with pride that hed done events in iowa and new hampshire this year more than a few eyes widened at the thought last weekend even hillarys mom campaigned for her in iowa and oprah was somewhere else in the state for barack a few days ago bill clinton was in ames where he said that years ago he told hillary to dump him so she could run for office "i thought it would be wrong for me to rob her of the chance to be what i thought she should be " the former president said "she laughed and said first i love you and second im not going to run for anything im too hardheaded " you have to ask yourself no matter how many times iowans have been down this path what can they make of it all what can anyone make of it iowa matters after nigh a year of magic bus tours through the state by the presidentially ambitious and after the jan caucuses finish the most arcane voting game on the planet two people will have won iowa and most of the rest will be gagging down their losses if huck beats mitt mitts campaign is an empty husk if barack comes a close second to hillarys dream team this first name game will be elaborated on in a moment then hell have the iowa caucuss famous second fiddle momentum which carried iowa second place finishers george mcgovern to the party nomination in and jimmy carter in if you were an iowan what would be the basis for your vote that frosty night would you vote the man gender pigment or an issue nonstop across nearly the whole of the candidates and our ever malleable political "system" have thrown all of these at the american electorate hoping some of it will stick for most of the year barack obama has tried to prevent the inevitable hillary ascension by running as a reasonable intelligent young man with the clock running down team obama decided to throw oprah the length of the field who knows it might work gallup a few days ago reported what its polls say are on peoples mind the war in iraq remains no at with the interest level then dropping by half to for the economy immigration the great gop catfight is said to be at only for the general population a washington post poll yesterday put the economy at the war at and oh yes immigration at there is a plausible school of thought in our politics which says that most voters wait until the final week to look out the window discern what strikes them as important check out the candidates press the two pieces issues and candidates against the template of their own beliefs and vote this is probably as good a way as any to run a democracy but politics risks turning to glue if the voters moment of decision is preceded by nearly weeks of constant campaigning like wary olympic cyclists pedaling side by side around the velodrome these front runners arent going to get out in front of the pack with a strong theme or issue with a race this long the whole world could change ask the democrats they thought theyd ride into the white house aboard one issue national disaffection over iraq thats not going to happen now what afraid that a turn in the economy a terrorist bomb or an october surprise will turn a commitment way back when into an embarrassment months later most of the candidates are running campaigns more or less about nothing hillary clinton is especially famous for having no set opinion about anything other than that its all george bushs fault there was palpable excitement as fred thompsons candidacy rumbled down the runway but now that hes aloft few can make out what hes about other than joining most of the other republican candidates to pistol whip the mexicans occasionally rudy giuliani published a piece on this page dec "the meaning of fiscal conservatism " a correct but careful tour dhorizon as an astute friend described the piece "it was without a galvanizing theme to put it kindly " the huckabee fair tax and the thompson voluntary flat tax are more punch list talking points than a defining core commitment with the issues seen by these long campaigns as mercurial or dangerous what does one run on for a year or two years yourself in an age in which media and marketing sell everything else as celebrity or self there is logic in reducing ones campaign to biography nearly all these candidates want to be on a first name basis with the nation the washington post currently has a series running each day on the candidates in which one of the articles is done by the papers fashion writer "how he looks" why not its a perfect fit for the shape of our politics now voters will play the hand theyve been dealt and at last with iowa the big moment has arrived we should all be pumped but the press reports disinterest and waning enthusiasm for the candidates before a single vote is cast much of the electorate is experiencing issues fatigue and face fatigue hillary most of all didnt need this much face time with the voters no one does lets not do this two year run again heres how dump the federal campaign finance law which forces candidates to raise millions in &# dribs and drabs that is why theyve been running since last winter the campaign isnt about us its designed as a sales pitch its about their fund raising imperative the result mike huckabee may win iowa in large part because he gives people a good laugh not funny
