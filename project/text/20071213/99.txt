politics &amp economics where bloomberg fits in election opportunity for run could evolve based on how primaries play out shifts atop the polls for both parties in early voting states suggest uncertainty among some voters about the current crop of candidates while an increasingly nasty campaign could badly bruise whomever comes out on top mr bloombergs supporters said friends and advisers said mr bloomberg hasnt ruled out a run against any of the leading candidates and such a bid would be more likely if the primaries leave the nominees bloodied and voters looking for other options as democratic and republican presidential hopefuls stumped in iowa and new hampshire monday new york mayor michael bloomberg was in china talking about entrepreneurship the setting was different but the goal may have been the same those close to mr bloomberg said the year old billionaire is considering a white house bid despite his repeated denials moreover friends and advisers said developments make a candidacy more conceivable shifts atop the polls for both parties in early voting states suggest uncertainty among some voters about the current crop of candidates while an increasingly nasty campaign could badly bruise whomever comes out on top mr bloombergs supporters said gridlock in congress could open the door for mr bloombergs nonpartisan message at the same time national polls show voters worrying more about the economy and less about iraq a trend that plays to mr bloombergs strengths by all accounts mr bloomberg remains a long shot he is an independent a longtime democrat he ran for mayor as a republican and then left that party in june and no third party candidate has ever won the presidency he often jokes about the electoral chances of a foot inch jewish divorce his record of raising taxes banning smoking in bars and clamping down on guns could hurt him among libertarian republicans and independents who are among his likely supporters and mr bloomberg doesnt want to be a spoiler or a protest candidate friends said "i think he likes the challenge " said mitchell moss a new york university professor who has served as an adviser to mr bloomberg "but hell only run if he can win " mr bloomberg and top aides declined to comment the mayor who is barred by term limits from seeking another re election likely wont make up his mind until after the republican and democratic nominees are known but his advisers led by chief political strategist kevin sheekey are planning for different scenarios insiders said one scenario and the one aides are hoping for would be a race between fellow new yorkers hillary clinton and former mayor rudy giuliani sen clintons negative rating is the highest in either party while mr giulianis is the highest among republicans that match up could make what supporters see as mr bloombergs "above the fray" image more appealing mrs clinton and mr giuliani are also seen as moderate on social issues which could mute opposition to mr bloomberg from the religious right "if the parties nominate polarizing candidates then theres plenty of room" for mr bloomberg independent pollster john zogby said another scenario that would provide an opening would be if both parties nominate candidates from outside the center john edwards on the democratic side for example or republican mike huckabee who leads polls in iowa and is surging in national surveys in such a case mr bloomberg would seek to appeal to moderates "the terrain that he would look to run on is dead center of the highway " said william cunningham mr bloombergs first term communications director if both parties nominate less divisive candidates a bloomberg candidacy would be less likely he might stay on the sidelines if republicans nominate john mccain whom mr bloomberg has praised in the past or mitt romney another businessman turned politician democrat barack obama whose attempt to portray himself as transcending partisan warfare is similar to mr bloombergs stance also could pose problems for the new york mayor when mr bloomberg ate breakfast with sen obama in new york last month some interpreted the move as a signal that he wont run against the illinois democrat but friends and advisers said mr bloomberg hasnt ruled out a run against any of the leading candidates and such a bid would be more likely if the primaries leave the nominees bloodied and voters looking for other options unlike most recent elections where at least one party had a clear standard bearer from the start both nominees will likely have faced bruising primary battles the front loaded primary season could further open the door for mr bloomberg because voters may grow weary of an unusually long nine month general election battle "were going to see two presumptive nominees from the two major parties in early february " mr zogby said "what are they going to do except become tiresome " another scenario that could prompt a bloomberg bid would revolve around how polls frame the nations mood and priorities early next year recent polls have shown voters as more concerned about the economy and health care than iraq that could benefit mr bloomberg who has little foreign policy experience but has won plaudits for his management of new yorks economy "the worse the economy gets the more the election is up for grabs " prof moss said partisan battles in congress have already created an "anti institutional mood" that could provide an opening for an independent candidate mr zogby said those urging mr bloomberg to run draw comparisons to when an unsettled economy and battles between a republican president and a democratic congress helped billionaire ross perot win of the vote hamilton jordan who briefly ran mr perots campaign and has met with bloomberg strategist mr sheekey noted that the texas technology entrepreneur drew nearly million votes despite a disjointed campaign mr bloomberg has also shown a greater willingness to spend his own money mr perot spent an estimated &# million nationally in compared to the &# million mr bloomberg spent to get elected mayor in and the &# million he spent on his re election four years later mr sheekey has floated the notion of a "billion dollar campaign " and insiders said he has dedicated much of mr bloombergs second term to figuring out how to use that money mr sheekeys first challenge would be getting mr bloomberg on the ballot in as many states as possible mr sheekey who ran both of mr bloombergs mayoral campaigns has met with unity a group promoting an independent or bipartisan presidential campaign and has his own ballot access team ready to get to work as soon as mr bloomberg decides to run mr bloombergs billions would also be instrumental in spreading his name and message
