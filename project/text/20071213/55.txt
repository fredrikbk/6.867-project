how painters undermined weavers uncommon artistry raphael prince of painters issued an early challenge with his full size color drawings for a piece series of the acts of the apostles commissioned in the early th century by pope leo x for the sistine chapel tapestry in the baroque metropolitan museum of art through jan new york apart from beloved curiosities like the unicorn cycle at the cloisters the medium of tapestry had long been regarded as an antiquarian taste not worth acquiring heavy dusty dark and dull five years ago the metropolitan museum of art changed many minds with "tapestry in the renaissance art and magnificence " a sweeping survey of some masterpieces dating from to mostly from european sources some illustrious some obscure the current "tapestry in the baroque threads of splendor" through jan applies the same template to the period from to if the sense of novelty this time isnt what it was in thats partly because the first show did its job so well for one thing it made the academic point that tapestries in their heyday "woven frescoes " philippe de montebello has called them were prized far above paintings which established a certain snob appeal much more important the chosen examples dazzled the eye with color pageantry and high definition detail exploding seemingly once and for all the notion of tapestry as the stepsister of painting strangely enough the baroque show may make you reconsider it is worth pondering why this is so though in some sense tapestry and painting are alternate mutually exclusive realities in another sense they compete for the same niche what sets them apart in painting the mind that conceives an image and the hand that executes it typically belong to the same artist a tapestry by contrast is an industrial artifact manufactured from the creative artists design by small armies at the loom at the same time and for reasons not unrelated painting is an analog medium the brushstrokes of which a painting is composed may be of any size or form the artist chooses they may carry a huge expressive charge tapestries by contrast are digital every gesture and field is built up point by single color point technically sharp edges are impossible and so is blur instead tapestries can possess a granular sparkle that plays across their entire surface each stitch as it were a pixel for these technical reasons certain motifs flat objects strong patterns simple color schemes translate more "naturally" to tapestry than others but as time went on artists came into the process who did not appreciate the limitations of the medium or simply did not care and weavers were pushed to ever greater feats of painterly illusion raphael prince of painters issued an early challenge with his full size color drawings for a piece series of the acts of the apostles commissioned in the early th century by pope leo x for the sistine chapel several rooms into the baroque show we come upon "the miraculous draft of fishes " perhaps the most wondrous of the set a particularly lovely passage shows the glassy reflection of a fishermans face on the limpid waters of the sea of galilee a painterly touch beyond the vocabulary of conventional tapestry design raphaels cartoons were completed in by the tapestries were on view at the vatican woven by pieter van aelst of brussels his "miraculous draft" came to the met a quarter century ago in the context of "the vatican collections the papacy and art " where it held its own among supreme achievements of the greatest painters and sculptors the renaissance show in included a weaving of raphaels "miraculous draft" made three decades later than van aelsts at a different brussels workshop the version now making a splash among the baroque treasures is yet another one english and ordered up by charles i in the s much as the two dozen odd libretti of pietro metastasio served over the course of a century for operas by more than composers a single cartoon could spawn numerous "originals " not all are created equal memory may play tricks but to my mind the subsequent weavings as ravishing as they are pale beside the wizardly grace of van aelsts in the renaissance show raphael was pretty much the only painter of stature to show up as a tapestry designer in the baroque show he has quite a bit of company simon vouet is on hand with "moses rescued from the nile " transposed to some french arcadia jacob jordaens best known for the coarse hearty spin he put on the sublime style of his senior contemporary peter paul rubens weighs in with the mythological "creation of the horse " a composition as transparent as it is heroic from pietro da cortona theres "constantine fighting the lion " like a terrestrial archangel michael the urbane vigorous charles le brun premier peintre du roi by order of louis xiv comes in not only with low key diplomatic scenes starring his patron but also with the hurly burly of "the battle of the granicus " from a cycle on alexander the great rubens himself appears here both in his crashing historic and his plush ecclesiastical modes he of them all held the needs of the weavers in the lordliest disregard he handed them cartoons painted in oil eliciting virtuoso performances that verge on ersatz oil paintings and as such they seem at the same time wrongheaded ostentatious and somehow routine against such adventurous signature pieces the productions of tapestry specialists whose names only scholars would recognize may look retro but harmonious perfectly realized true to the character of the medium trace if you will the arc of whipped up waves patterns sharp detail from the maritime disaster of "siege of zierikzee" at the beginning of the show through the maritime disaster of "a naval battle" in the final gallery as much as or even more than "water " a grandiloquent allegory from a design by le brun that comes midway through these now virtually anonymous creations sum up a technique and a tradition every bit as magnificent and splendid as the titles of the met surveys declare they were the celestially tranquil "siege of bouchon " also in the final gallery will likewise reward a lingering look like those scenes of disaster at sea it is the work of proud professionals whose names were written in water but what wonders they were capable of history buffs will want to know that the rider on the white horse just left of center is john churchill first duke of marlborough notice the platinum highlights in his powdered periwig a look through opera glasses indispensable equipment for this show will reveal that they are no more than irregularly shaped patches of pure white thread but from the distance of just a few steps they glow like a tungsten filament lit up by an electric current their incandescence alone is worth the mets full suggested entrance fee of &# if space permitted this would be the moment to roll the credits for the weavers as it is blanket acknowledgment must suffice but we must not sign off without a word of gratitude to thomas p campbell curator of the mets last tapestry show as well as of the current one and let us hope the next and the next mr gurewitsch writes
