green projects generate splits in activist groups the concept which appeared to wither during negotiations over a big energy bill is currently being pushed by house democrats in an end of year challenge to president bush who has threatened to veto the legislation the project gained momentum in when maine mountain power llc a partnership between maines endless energy co and a california based subsidiary of edison international proposed a turbine project on redington and black nubble mountains on capitol hill the audubon society is leading the fight to increase production of climate friendly power so why are audubon enthusiasts battling a wind farm that could help meet that goal for one thing there are trout in nearby streams which activists say are at risk from chemical and sediment runoff from construction of turbines each soaring about feet taller than the statue of liberty then there are the bats and hawks which might be pureed by the giant blades that would catch the wind gusting along the allegheny mountains of western pennsylvania "theyre enormous " says tom dick a retired veterinarian who founded the local audubon chapter "when you start looking at this its like hell this is not right " even as americans become convinced they need to change the way they power their lives the environmental community is splintering over how to do that does ethanol promote clean fuel or destroy the rural landscape is emission free electricity worth turning mountains into wind farms thomas kuhn president of the edison electric institute which represents investor owned utilities says he sees "a disturbing disconnect on this issue " eei is quarreling with audubon the sierra club and other groups over a proposal requiring utilities to use more renewable energy the concept which appeared to wither during negotiations over a big energy bill is currently being pushed by house democrats in an end of year challenge to president bush who has threatened to veto the legislation dan becker a former top lobbyist at the sierra club one of the leading u s environmental groups concedes that local fights can undercut the groups national goals "it doesnt help " he says mr becker says local activism is a source of the movements strength "id rather have the debate than to have a stalinist approach and say you cannot speak " he says in southern california a project to expand solar power is imperiled because activists dont trust san diego gas &amp electric co the local utility which has proposed building a mile transmission line chief operating officer michael niggli says the line which will help his company meet californias own environmental and energy mandates will connect to a substation near the arizona border mr niggli said it will also draw and transmit power from a solar field in the desert san diego gas &amp electric is a subsidiary of california based sempra energy which actually supported the renewable fuels mandate approved by the house the bill is now pending in the senate micah mitrosky a sierra club community organizer complains the line would run through the anza borrego desert state park she also isnt comfortable with the idea that it would be used to transmit power generated by fossil fuels and questions whether the line will ever be used to carry alternative energy local sierra club officials enlisted opponents at concerts farmers markets and street fairs and in late october escorted a delegation of community leaders to sacramento mr niggli says the sierra club is missing the point "we dont understand their opposition " he says "this is a transmission line that will clearly help meet the goals they have " because the line will carry solar power david hamilton head of the sierra clubs effort in washington to curb global warming says hes not aware of the fight or the project in san diego he says his group wants to cooperate with companies when it has "some confidence" projects will boost green energy "weve realized you have to give a little " he says in maine the audubon society founded more than a century ago to protect birds has worked with developers to draw up guidelines for wind projects but even this cooperation has limits a proposed site near sugarloaf ski resort has been a potential location for wind power generation for years the project gained momentum in when maine mountain power llc a partnership between maines endless energy co and a california based subsidiary of edison international proposed a turbine project on redington and black nubble mountains the audubon society worried about the impact to bicknells thrush a bird that lives at high elevations in northeastern u s and old growth fir trees jody jones an ecologist for maine audubon says the group has supported wind projects elsewhere but adds "not every location is appropriate " over the summer maine mountain offered a scaled back project with turbines now the same fight is unfolding some environmental groups have decided to support the revised project audubon remains opposed charley parnell spokesman for the edison unit backing the plant says the company is "disappointed" given the "clamor for this type of technology from a whole host of folks " edison international backed the house mandate on renewable fuels betsy loyless audubons senior vice president for policy in washington says she isnt aware of details of the maine and pennsylvania fights she says local offices "are largely supportive of renewable energy " but she stresses the importance of responding to local concerns "its a tough situation " she says in pennsylvania democratic governor ed rendell has made wind power a priority in he persuaded gamesa sa a spanish energy company to establish its u s headquarters in his state gamesas shaffer mountain project in somerset county was proposed last year among those leading the opposition is mr dick who worries about the hawks and eagles the mountains ridges form a sort of highway for migrating birds says mr dick who founded a "hawk watch" staffed by audubon volunteers along with audubon society allies and others he has put out signs circulated petitions lobbied state officials and set about fighting a water drainage permit gamesa says the project will have "minimal or no impact" on birds and bats the company says it will use tubular towers on which birds cant perch and will set turbines to the less trafficked west and no closer than feet to the mountain top "the birds are not actually flying directly above" the ridge top says tim vought gamesas manager for the project mr dick says he understands the pressure to shift electricty production from fossil fuels to renewable sources but wants to use care in placing projects "the problem to me is worse than urban sprawl " he says see related letter "letters to the editor getting the green right" wsj dec
