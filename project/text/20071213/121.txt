day sign up for the e mail here the balance of power in washington has once again befuddled the democratic majority in washington and its at least partly democrats own fault yesterday majority democrats in the house and senate backed down from the showdown over spending with president bush and his republican allies conceding they will keep total u s spending in the current fiscal year to the strict &# billion limit set by the white house as the hill reports democratic leaders did voice intentions to "shuffle the investment in certain programs within the spending conditions set by the president putting more money into health care medical research veterans benefits home heating programs law enforcement and border security " the new york times adds but also facing opposition from powerful members of her own caucus house speaker nancy pelosi had to abandon a proposal to eliminate legislators earmarks from spending bills and in a surrender likely to upset their political base the democrats "appeared poised to accept a &# billion package of spending for the wars in iraq and afghanistan with no strings attached " roll call reports "democrats had been considering a trade of war funding for &# billion in domestic spending and &# billion in emergency spending but bushs veto threat now has democrats on the verge of approving another fat check for the war that they have repeatedly sought and failed to end with little in return except the ability to go home for christmas " the paper says on another painful front for the democrats mr bush vetoed another version of the childrens health bill "effectively killing democrats hopes of expanding a popular government program aimed at providing insurance to youngsters in lower and middle income families " as the times describes it but democrats seem to be doing as much damage to themselves as their adversary in the white house the party had promised a "new direction" with momentum fresh from an election victory when it took charge in january instead as the wall street journal points out "unfinished work is piling up legislation to aid borrowers affected by the housing mess rescue millions of middle class families from a big tax increase and put stricter gas mileage limits on the auto industry " the "democrats are still scrambling just to keep the government open " the journal says amid "intraparty squabbling between house democrats and senate democrats that is sometimes almost as fierce as the partisan battling " democrats in the two houses have fought over the proposed spending package as well as the earmarks and the war funding house ways and means committee chairman charles b rangel has gone so far as accusing senate democratic leaders "of developing stockholm syndrome showing sympathy to their republican captors by caving in on legislation to provide middle class tax cuts paid for with tax increases on the super rich tying war funding to troop withdrawal timelines and mandating renewable energy quotas " the washington post reports in turn senate majority leader harry reid has gone to the senate floor to slam what he called speaker pelosis "iron hand" style of governance the next victim of either democrats inability to push their priorities past mr bush or the presidents power to hold them off with help from the republican minority at the capitol is the energy bill the bill "would mark the first congressional action to raise automotive fuel economy in years and is a centerpiece of the democrats legislative agenda headed into the elections " the journal notes and the white house indicated yesterday that mr bush would veto the latest version because of the way it would take away billions of dollars in tax incentives for big oil companies energy also happens to be one of mr bushs biggest points of friction with american allies in europe european union negotiators at the bali climate change conference today threatened to boycott u s led talks on the issue set for washington next month unless the u s backs off its resistance to setting targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases what was up the feds sleeve joined by central banking counterparts overseas the federal reserve yesterday announced a multifront offensive against the global credit crunch aimed at easing the way for banks to boost the amount of cash available to businesses and other financial institutions the fed will lend up to &# billion to banks through two auctions in december and two more in january with rates set through bidding as businessweek explains "they probably will be at least as high as the federal funds rate which banks charge each other for overnight loans of reserves but lower than the discount rate the fed itself charges for loans " the magazine adds "the key is that the fed will lend to any healthy bank and will accept many types of collateral including mortgage backed securities perhaps placing a higher value on it than the banks would be able to get on the open market the fed also arranged to swap currencies with the european central bank and the swiss central bank allowing those institutions to lend up to &# billion to banks that have trouble borrowing dollars on the open market " the policy moves announced yesterday had been up the feds sleeve when it cut the benchmark federal funds rate on tuesday by only a quarter point prompting a stock market sell off and widespread criticism by investors who wanted more clearly policy makers had been looking for something more creative to deal with so big a problem "the fed has faced two intertwined challenges since the financial crisis hit in august one has been to cut rates enough to cushion the economy from a collapsing housing bubble without igniting inflation the other has been to overcome the credit crunch that stems from the housing woes and has muffled the impact of the rate cuts " the wall street journal notes but that hadnt done the job consumer lending rates have stayed high including the london interbank offered rate the peg for the cost of banks own funds and many adjustable rate loans the journal adds in response to yesterdays move libor did indeed fall but as the journal points out "financial institutions remain suspicious of each other after multiple rounds of announcements of mortgage linked losses and are anticipating more " and they have good reason to be the ecb warned yesterday that the euro zones biggest banks still hold &# billion in off balance sheet assets "that may have to be brought back on to their balance sheets and could trigger a credit squeeze in the wider economy " as the financial times reports and fears about those assets have helped to fuel the liquidity squeeze five french banks bnp paribas societe generale calyon natixis and hsbc france have been working on a so called "superconduit" that would maintain liquidity if their reserves run low amid the crunch and hope to launch it at the beginning of next year les echos adds back across the atlantic the "drumbeat of dour news from large u s banks deepened" with bank of america saying profit in the current quarter will again disappoint wachovia executives saying

state department plans to cut by the posts in washington and embassies around the world to deal with the difficult staffing demands of u s missions in iraq and afghanistan the washington post reports "the decision to eliminate the positions reflects the reality that state does not have enough people to fill them " the post says "nearly one quarter of all diplomatic posts are vacant after hundreds of foreign service officers were sent to embassies in baghdad and kabul and congress has not provided funding for new hires many of the unfilled jobs will no longer be listed as vacancies " also of note new york times the first comprehensive public opinion poll conducted in pakistan since president pervez musharraf declared a state of emergency last month has found that of pakistanis want him to resign immediately and that say his government doesnt deserve re election the poll suggests that mr musharraf will have to engage in substantial vote rigging to have the government of his choice win
