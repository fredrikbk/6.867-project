myspace aims for trickier markets in india israel turkey web speeds and culture require special touches in other countries such as turkey social networking is a less familiar concept requiring myspace to design on site tutorials that explain to users how to navigate the site find profiles for music bands and search for friends russia based internet company sup recently paid an undisclosed amount for u s blogging and social networking service livejournal which has nearly million unique monthly visitors world wide according to comscore when myspace com invaded parts of western europe last year it launched customized versions of its site that looked very similar to the original american one the result it caught up with and in many cases surpassed local competitors now myspace is embarking on a tougher assignment moving into countries where internet conditions require a much more individualized approach having already built local versions for countries and territories outside the u s the news corp owned internet giant starting this month and into next year has plans to launch custom sites in india russia poland south korea and turkey according to travis katz managing director of international for myspace in each of these countries web cultures vary dramatically from that in the u s and much of europe in some countries such as india and parts of latin america average internet speeds are comparatively very slow so myspace is developing a less sophisticated version that probably wont automatically stream video and music while users are surfing the site although users could launch such features manually at the other end of the spectrum south korea boasts average internet speeds many times faster than the u s and a much savvier web culture blogging being hugely popular myspace is recasting its south korean version as more of a blogging service with new tools that make it easier for users to publish and promote their blogs through their profiles in other countries such as turkey social networking is a less familiar concept requiring myspace to design on site tutorials that explain to users how to navigate the site find profiles for music bands and search for friends language differences pose different problems elsewhere myspace is contemplating a move into israel but the predominant use of hebrew there would require a site redesign for users who read right to left myspace executives say launching in these countries wont generate much revenue anytime soon but establishing a presence in countries such as india and russia is important for the day when internet conditions improve "we are placing strategic bets " says mr katz "we are looking at places where there is not a ton of money to be made in the next five or years but we want to be well positioned when things get there " myspace parent news corp has agreed to buy dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal expanding its global footprint is a top priority for myspace fighting intensifying competition from rivals such as facebook inc while myspace retains a big lead in the u s facebook is growing quickly and outside the u s facebook has passed myspace drawing million unique non u s visitors in october to myspaces million according to comscore inc while myspace has a strong lead over facebook in europe facebook is the no social networking site in a combined category for africa and the middle east according to comscore and facebook is likely to become a bigger threat elsewhere the company also has announced it is translating the site into new languages myspace faces competition from other players elsewhere in latin america where myspace is a relatively small player rivals such as google inc s social networking site orkut and fotolog and hi have loyal followings fotolog was recently acquired by french internet company hi media sa which intends to market the site aggressively throughout europe and latin america russia based internet company sup recently paid an undisclosed amount for u s blogging and social networking service livejournal which has nearly million unique monthly visitors world wide according to comscore richard greenfield an analyst with pali research estimates myspaces non u s revenue makes up roughly of the social networks expected &# million in annual sales the company declined to comment on the amount but said it expects its non u s revenue to more than triple this fiscal year over last year but international growth is sure to get tougher as myspace moves into new areas myspace was one of the first u s social networking sites to roll out local versions beginning in europe last year the company launched customized sites in the united kingdom france spain italy and germany since expanding to austria sweden and denmark among others in europe myspace widened its lead over rivals like bebo and hi by making connections among the local music film and fashion markets new launches featured high profile concerts and partnerships with local radio and television shows "myspace did it perfectly " says cyril zimmermann chief executive of hi media based in paris myspace has found the going a little tougher elsewhere the company launched a japanese site last year with softbank corp a japanese internet and technology company and it quickly made some adjustments it learned that users were generally bashful about listing their interests like a favorite band in their profile but they had no problem joining fan groups so they raised the prominence of the groups section of the site nevertheless in october the local site still was only the th most popular social networking site in the country by unique visitors according to comscore which includes some blogging sites in the category in china a far trickier market the company launched a site under a different corporate entity licensing its technology and brand to a local chinese company myspace cn the local site is relatively small compared with competitors but it is growing with million unique monthly visitors in october up from million in september according to comscore mr katz of myspace says learning from these latest markets will prepare the company for what it faces next among the new challenges will be new business models online advertising has translated well throughout most of europe as large brands like adidas ag and lacoste sa launch pricey international campaigns but advertising alone wont support myspaces growth into india and russia where the online advertising markets are far smaller than in the u s overseas competitors rely on alternative revenue streams like transactional fees from classifieds or charging for premium features mr katz says the company knows it has to be creative and will focus on other business models such as deals with mobile carriers at the same time myspace is taking extra steps to get the publics attention in mumbai india for instance myspace is sending employees to meet with bollywood film industry executives hoping to lure stars to create profiles and share news and videos with fans sergio monsalve a principal with norwest venture partners a palo alto calif based venture capital fund thinks that to be a truly global player myspace may have to acquire some local competitors a strategy that has worked well for ebay inc and google "myspace appears to have a good lead " he says "but it is the very early innings "
