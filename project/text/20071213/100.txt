an art installation donald crowhurst was his own perfect storm visionary clever and self confident he could talk himself and others into doing things they had no business doing such as him trying to sail around the world nonstop and alone his family friends and the media played along he persuaded a corporate sponsor to pay for his boat none of them came to their senses until mr crowhurst threw himself into the atlantic ocean in june "the strange last voyage of donald crowhurst" by nicholas tomalin and ron hall is simply put a great sea story its got thrilling weather and equipment catastrophes frisky porpoises and shimmering sunsets but its also the chronicle of an astounding hoax carried out by mr crowhurst and abetted by credulous reporters and editors in the spring of mr crowhurst one of nine sailors competing in a round the world race the golden globe sponsored by the sunday times of london claimed he had circled the earth without stopping in fact he had been hanging out in the southern atlantic for five months waiting to rejoin the pack as they rounded cape horn and headed north to england mr crowhurst didnt set out intending to cheat indeed he believed that with his three hulled boat and its state of the art electronic equipment he was the favorite but his boat was built and outfitted hastily to meet a sailing deadline and it began springing leaks a few hundred miles into the course here then was mr crowhursts dilemma if he quit according to his contract he would go bankrupt and have to sell the house where he and his wife and four small children lived if he sailed into the dangerous "roaring forties" of the south indian ocean his boat would sink him almost certainly with it the third alternative was to fake the voyage four decades later jonathan raban wrote in his introduction to the sailors classics edition published by international marine mcgraw hill that would no longer be possible mr crowhurst "sailed into a void of a kind that no longer exists except in the outer reaches of outer space " today beacons transmit a boats every tack and jibe to race headquarters "and the boats exact position on the globe to within a hundred feet or less is constantly monitored " mr raban doesnt believe mr crowhurst initially make a conscious decision to lie "deception sneaked up on him from behind " mr raban wrote "it began as mild inexactitude a fudging of his reported positions every amateur sailor who has described foot waves as foot waves has been similarly guilty " aggravating his predicament the media in a hero worshipping frenzy failed to do their jobs the story as the saying goes was too good to check there were obvious errors in the few reports mr crowhurst was able to get to england not to mention that many reporters had witnessed mr crowhurst struggling to handle his unfamiliar boat even in his home waters only one other boat remained in the race when mr crowhurst rejoined it in may another had already finished and claimed one of the two prizes mr crowhurst figured that if the other boat won no one would bother scrutinizing his logbooks and he could fade into obscurity no such luck the front runner sank if mr crowhurst made it home he would win the prize "the strange last voyage" is more journalism than literature but its high class reporting and writing the authors who were both sunday times reporters at the time of the race are forthright about which parts of the story they can prove and which theyre surmising mr crowhurst was after all alone and out of radio contact for most of the race fortunately many other players in the story especially mr crowhursts widow clare contributed their memories and observations mr crowhursts life has inspired a novel "outerbridge reach" by robert stone as well as a stage play an opera and an art installation a film documentary about him "deep water " was released in many of the other golden globe sailors were also odd ducks bernard moitessier of france succeeded in rounding the earth then decided he didnt want to return to civilization and began a second lap "make money make money to do what " mr moitessier later wrote "to change your car when it is still going well to pay for the right to moor your boat in a port for almost the price of a servants room in paris i am going where you can tie up a boat where you want and the sun is free and so is the air you breathe and the sea where you swim " the only man to finish the race was robin knox johnston who described the month voyage as "the severest test i have ever faced both physically and mentally " he donated the &lt pound&gt purse to clare crowhurst "no one should rush to criticize donald crowhurst " mr knox johnston wrote in "let the ending not obscure the courage and resourcefulness of the man donald crowhursts worst crime was falling short of his own vision "
