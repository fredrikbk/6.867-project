for religious group true charity begins on operating table sects kidney donations pose dilemma for doctors a members mom objects critics particularly parents of members call the group a cult and charge that members are under undue influence of its charismatic leader ashwyn falkingham wanted to donate one of his kidneys but didnt know anyone who needed one with the help of a web site he met a woman in toronto who was seeking a transplant the two were a medical match and he traveled from his home in sydney australia to canada for final testing and he hoped for the surgery its a "simple thing that can help someone " says mr falkingham now years old but it wasnt simple largely because mr falkingham is a member of a tiny religious group calling itself the jesus christians the groups members who eschew many of societys conventions have embraced kidney donation more than half have given a kidney they describe the act as a gift of love that implements jesuss teachings but critics particularly parents of members call the group a cult and charge that members are under undue influence of its charismatic leader in the end the hospital in toronto had to decide whether mr falkinghams offer was a simple expression of altruism as he had represented it to be or an offer from a man no longer capable of independent thought as his mother and stepfather alleged more than people have given kidneys anonymously in the u s over the past decade and many others have donated to strangers they met online amid a huge shortage of available kidneys nearly people in the u s are waiting for kidney transplants many hospitals arent interested in donors who dont have an established personal relationship with the recipient that is partly because of fears that such donors may be secretly and illegally paid other concerns stranger donors may be psychologically disturbed unrealistically hopeful that donating a kidney will improve their own lives or likely to back out the university of minnesota has handled transplants involving anonymous donors including two jesus christians catherine garvey a transplant coordinator there says neither case caused concerns "theres definitely a religious reasoning to it " she says "but people often quote a spiritual or religious reason " the jesus christians were founded in by david mckay a year old native of rochester n y who moved to australia in the jesus christians expect members to turn over their savings to the group and to forsake family friends and possessions "were people who have strong christian ideals and are prepared to do outrageous things to express our love for god and others " mr mckay says members scattered over australia the u s england and kenya live communally sometimes in campers they scrounge in dumpsters for wastefully discarded food they spend their days handing out copies of "survivors " a novel mr mckay wrote about events leading to the return of jesus and asking for money in return the group courts publicity members have cooperated with producers of tv documentaries done in australia and england last year at the transplant games for donors and recipients several jesus christians participated wearing red jesus christian t shirts mr mckay said he became interested in living kidney donation after watching "a gift of love " the movie about a high school kid who donates a kidney to his grandmother mr mckay preaches the value of donation to his group and mr mckay has given a kidney himself some jesus christians like susan gianstefani a year old mother living in london found recipients online she read a posting about larry rosenfield of aspen colo who had a genetic kidney disease and donated a kidney to him in at the university of wisconsin mr rosenfield later referred others who needed transplants to the jesus christians and seven more transplants resulted "good people are good people and i dont care what they believe in " mr rosenfield said soon after mr rosenfield got his kidney ashwyn falkingham discovered the jesus christians then a year old student in graphic design he was becoming disillusioned with the consumerism he saw in the advertising related courses he was taking passing through the railroad station in central sydney on his way to class one day in mid he met a jesus christian who was passing out books mr falkingham read the material studied the groups web site and began spending time with members he had always been close to his mother kate croft as she and his stepfather nick croft departed for a week long vacation later that year mr falkingham promised not to join the group in their absence but mrs croft said that while she was away she received the same email message from her son three days in a row "what if i made a promise jesus didnt want me to keep " when they returned he had moved his things out of their house and joined the jesus christians by the end of he had decided to be a donor his first intended recipient died before the transplant could be arranged then last year sandi sabloff a former sales executive from toronto who had suffered kidney disease for years noticed a post written by mr mckay on a u s web site livingdonorsonline org she had had no luck finding a living donor and nobody in her family was a suitable match "i kind of ran out of people" to ask she said she contacted mr mckay who put her in touch with mr falkingham after a phone interview with the hospital mr falkingham flew to toronto in march mr mckay accompanied him and mr falkingham said he made it clear to the hospital from the start that he was a jesus christian during the visit mr falkingham says he met with a psychologist a social worker and the hospitals bioethicist who sought to discern his motives and make sure he understood the risks of the surgery they asked whether he would receive any special status in the jesus christians after donating he said he wouldnt they asked whether he had been coerced in any way he replied that he hadnt by mid april he and ms sabloff said the hospital had cleared him as a donor and set a date for the transplant april around that time mr falkinghams mother learned of his plans she had at first accepted his decision to donate a kidney but she and her husband developed reservations about the jesus christians among the concerns mrs croft said her son refused to attend a family christmas gathering without at least one other group member and he wouldnt discuss his kidney donation plans without mr mckay present "we need to hear from you and not anybody else " she said she told her son he refused mr mckay doesnt deny that he and the jesus christians exerted "enormous influence" over mr falkingham but he says it wasnt improper "anyone who has spoken to ash knows that he is a man of character and strong will " mr mckay said in an email when the crofts found out in april that their adult son was planning to donate in canada mr croft wrote to transplant programs across the country and to the health ministers office in ontario laying out his concerns the jesus christians "do publicity stunts to get attention the kidney donation is part of this " that same month toronto general hospital put the transplant on hold mr falkingham asked his mother to write a note to the hospital saying that she believed he could make an independent decision instead she wrote the chief of the hospitals transplantation program gary levy "ashwyn has not had the opportunity to make an independent decision since his recruitment into this group and i do not believe he is genuinely able to do so at this time " she added "no hospital with any concern for its integrity" should accept a jesus christian organ donor the hospital canceled the surgery and ruled out mr falkingham as a donor ms sabloff who now needs kidney dialysis was devastated "im not saying it was that easy for the hospital " she said "but they were more concerned about their reputation and everything else than worried about someones life " the hospital declined to comment on the case in general officials said each donor is evaluated on a case by case basis and the hospitals approval can be withdrawn weeks after the decision mr falkingham said the hospital wrote him with the official reason for rejecting him he was motivated by the desire for publicity it concluded not by altruism a news crew from the australian broadcasting co had been following mr falkingham around but the hospital had been aware of that mr falkingham and ms sabloff are now searching in the u s for a hospital that might be willing to perform the transplant
