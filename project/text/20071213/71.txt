look whos watching please note that this is a very different question from the one most parents would actually admit to asking that one being the rather more high minded "is screen time bad for little children " with "into the minds of babes " author lisa guernsey manages in a balanced lucid and practical way to address both of these questions along with other screen related concerns whether about tv or computer games or video game consoles or hand held devices that lurk worryingly because of the way people live nowadays into the minds of babes by lisa guernsey basic books pages &# here is a book that seeks to answer the question that burns guiltily in the back of almost every modern parents mind am i a bad person for sticking my toddler in front of the tv so that i can get a little peace and quiet around here already please note that this is a very different question from the one most parents would actually admit to asking that one being the rather more high minded "is screen time bad for little children " with "into the minds of babes " author lisa guernsey manages in a balanced lucid and practical way to address both of these questions along with other screen related concerns whether about tv or computer games or video game consoles or hand held devices that lurk worryingly because of the way people live nowadays we are after all in the era of baby einstein when multimedia packages are sold to the parents of newborns with the idea that infants may get an edge on their peers if they begin building "cognitive skills" and absorbing the rudiments of bilingualism before theyve begun eating solid food it is an era in which millions of small children spend all day apart from their parents in facilities that feature screens and are staffed by "caregivers" for whom english is not necessarily the native tongue we live furthermore in a time of rising juvenile obesity and inactivity in a country where children seem sometimes to have fallen wholesale into an alphabet soup of scary initials such as add and adhd afflictions for which frenetic childrens tv shows and computer games have been partly blamed ms guernsey is not a purist and shes not on a campaign she doesnt ask us to consider what an amish style childhood free of screens might be like or how children raised in such an old fashioned environment might compare with the legions of day care kids goggling at "dora the explorer " instead she starts with the sensible assumption that most american families routinely make television and other screens available to their young children that being the case well what about it relying on dozens of scientific studies ms guernsey explores the intricacies of trying to unpick the complicated weave of what goes on inside the head of a or year old child crouched before a glowing screen can a person yet to speak in full sentences understand flashbacks or rapid scene changes what about vocabulary will that child be quicker to absorb new words or having been overwhelmed slower how researchers go about forming conclusions is neither simple nor always satisfying but a great deal of inquiry has been pursued in the past few years and more is under way even as purveyors of dubious "educational" media are pushing electronic keypads into ever younger plump little palms it turns out that some children particularly those in single parent or low income households may benefit from some television programs "sesame street " "blues clues" but not necessarily others "teletubbies " "veggie tales" what makes one show superior to another is almost chilling in its simplicity given that tv commonly serves as a substitute babysitter "the closer the product comes to simulating the way a good nursery school teacher or attentive parent talks to a young child the better " ms guernsey writes a stunning number of families with babies and young children in one study keep the tv on constantly and the effect on small children is appalling "always on" television has been shown to damage their ability to play imaginatively and to develop language and it reduces the number of nurturing interactions between parents and children one researcher told ms guernsey that little children trying to learn words in the presence of constant noise are "devastatingly impaired " parents may not want to be told this they can be prickly if they think youre criticizing their child rearing practices ms guernsey uses her experience as the mother of two girls to deflect any sense that shes some sort of hard eyed reporter type coming to lecture weaker parents about their shortcomings she knows how grueling it can be to spend hours with colicky infants and restless toddlers and to cast about for some way to distract them long enough for mommy to take a shower she is clearly hoping to smuggle in a few good parenting lessons by being nonjudgmental and more culpable than thou its probably a smart approach for selling a worthwhile book but i cant help wishing that ms guernsey had been less understanding and more forceful for what her extensive research turns up is hardly any recommendation for putting small children in front of screens whether televisions computers or electronic teaching gadgets it is true that studies have found that toddlers show more recognition of numbers and letters when theyve spent time watching "sesame street " and young children who watched "barney" were judged to be more polite and socially cooperative than their peers who watched turbulent superhero shows thats lovely and good for them though again we dont get comparisons with children raised in tv free households but over and over ms guernseys findings point away from the beneficence of the screen and toward the irreplaceable value of loving and engaged contact between parents and children and between children and their own imaginations "it is play plain and simple play that affords many of the most essential intellectual and social advantages for children " ms guernsey says quoting from a book called "einstein never used flashcards " at another point she writes "video exposure is no match for the stimulation children experience in real life scientists have so far come up with nothing to suggest that babies are better off watching a baby video than say watching dad fold laundry " ms guernsey is tolerant and circumspect about what she has found i dont have to be if you have small children at home please turn off that wretched tv mrs gurdon writes about childrens books for the journal
