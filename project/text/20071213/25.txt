crimson in clover when the hearings began kevin casey the senior director of federal and state relations at harvard told the crimson student newspaper that "it may not be the best thing for congress to dictate the formulas by which financial aid and endowment spend out should be connected " harvard university got some nice press this week by announcing it will reduce tuition for middle class families it already allows students whose parents earn less than &# a year to attend harvard free now it promises that families making up to &# will pay no more than of their annual income to finance the &# that a year in cambridge now costs drew gilpin faust the schools new president said the policy is designed to help families facing "increasing pressures as middle class lives have become more stressed " before applauding harvards altruism too loudly however readers should know that the school also had its back against a wall in september republican senator chuck grassley held hearings on whether colleges should be forced to spend a higher percentage of their endowments each year while private foundations have been required for decades to shell out of their total assets annually universities decide for themselves and average close to the difference may seem small but the money at stake is very large harvards endowment is &# billion and growing with implications that fay vincent illuminates nearby mr grassley wants to know why rich schools dont spend more of their money to reduce ballooning tuition when the hearings began kevin casey the senior director of federal and state relations at harvard told the crimson student newspaper that "it may not be the best thing for congress to dictate the formulas by which financial aid and endowment spend out should be connected " mr casey is right but given the hundreds of millions of dollars that the university receives from the government each year senators inevitably start to think that harvards business is their business ironically these government handouts are creating the tuition problem tuition has risen about three percentage points faster than inflation every year for the past quarter century at the same time the feds have put more and more money behind student loans and other financial aid the government is slowly becoming a third party tuition payer with all the price distortions one would expect every time tuition rises the government makes up the difference colleges thus cheerfully raise tuition and budgets knowing the government will step in as a result "colleges have little incentive to cut costs " says economist richard vedder the author of "going broke by degree why college costs too much " mr vedder explains that there are now twice as many university administrators per student as there were in the s faculty members are paid more to teach fewer hours and colleges have turned their campuses into "country clubs " princetons new &# million dorm according to businessweek has "triple glazed mahogany casement windows made of leaded glass" and "the dining hall boasts a foot ceiling gabled in oak and a state of the art servery " whatever a servery is our financial aid system also hurts middle class applicants parents who have saved money for their childs tuition quickly find that by the strange calculus of financial aid they are charged more for college tuition than if they had blown their savings on a bigger house mr vedder wonders why universities should get to ask the income of their students before telling them how much theyll be charged that sounds like price discrimination if a car dealer tried to make you fill out the form students have to fill out for financial aid he notes "youd run to a consumer protection agency " so is college still worth it though academic standards have certainly fallen college graduates still on average make about twice as much over the course of their lifetimes as people with only a high school diploma so if the government got out of the higher education business a lot of families might decide to make the sacrifice anyway even without the tuition aid but they might also decide that they can live without the mahogany windows see related letters "letters to the editor college endowments cohorts gleaming in crimson and gold" wsj dec
