some lending pressures ease a bit the asset backed commercial paper market has used large heapings of subprime mortgages as underlying collateral the source of its stress the difference between interest rates on some asset backed commercial paper issues and libor narrowed by around percentage point yesterday a sizable move said john kodweis a managing director in j p morgans short term fixed income group a crucial corner of the financial markets short term lending showed glimmers of improvement after the fed stepped in to help yesterday but deep problems persist since the summer banks have been less willing to make short term loans to each other and other financial companies yesterday some short term lending rates such as the london interbank offered rate and rates on some commercial paper eased on the feds action while investors showed some willingness to venture away from super safe treasurys thus far multiple efforts by policy makers to mitigate the problem have had limited impact in addition to a series of interest rate cuts the fed has tried with limited success to entice banks to borrow at its discount window for emergency borrowing meanwhile the treasury has worked with financial institutions to modify terms on troubled mortgages and to contain damage from troubled investment pools called structured investment vehicles despite these efforts the drumbeat of stress in short term lending markets has persisted banks have become reluctant to lend to each other determined instead to conserve cash and also wary of lending to other potentially problematic institutions investors who sit on deep pools of cash also have been unwilling to step in for fear of being saddled with holdings that might run into trouble the fed and other central banks said they would take unprecedented steps to revive lending by expanding the ways they inject cash into the financial system but underlying worries about rising defaults on mortgages the complexity of many mortgage related investments and an economic slowdown will take more time to sort out "the fed is coming up with some creative ways to attack the problem but confidence is still very challenged right now " said chris vincent a portfolio manager at william blair in chicago adding that the problem is an overhang of securities that are hard to trade and investors dont know their value "we didnt get into this situation overnight and were not going to get out of it overnight " he said the feds moves did help ease concerns that some borrowers would have problems arranging financing for year end a time when many financial companies might pull back capital as they close their books for among the bright spots was the market for loans between banks measured by the london interbank offered rate it has been a major trouble spot banks have been charging unusually high rates to lend to each other for example tuesday the fed notched down the funds rate by percentage point but libor fell only about percentage point a sign of banks continued unwillingness to lend however libor fell to from after news of the new efforts by the fed to spur lending activity treasurys which had staged a big rally tuesday after the rate cut gave up their gains yesterday a sign they were slightly less risk averse after the latest move investors tend to flock to treasurys pushing down these yields when worries are heightened the year treasury note fell &# for every &# traded pushing its yield up to the yield on two year treasury notes rose to from a day earlier meanwhile the commercial paper market where many companies fund their short term borrowing also welcomed word of the plan the commercial paper market and its subset the asset backed commercial paper market have been under pressure amid worries about the fallout from the subprime mortgage market the asset backed commercial paper market has used large heapings of subprime mortgages as underlying collateral the source of its stress it has contracted significantly over the last few months as of december the volume of asset backed commercial paper outstanding had declined to &# billion down nearly a third from &# trillion at the end of july according to fed data yesterday morning there was an uptick in buying of three and six month commercial paper and asset backed commercial paper noted deborah cunningham head of the taxable money market group at federated investors in contrast investors earlier had been moving to paper carrying shorter dated maturities such as overnight or one week holdings the difference between interest rates on some asset backed commercial paper issues and libor narrowed by around percentage point yesterday a sizable move said john kodweis a managing director in j p morgans short term fixed income group another problem the hangover from the trouble facing structured investment vehicles so called sivs were mainly set up by banks and profited by selling commercial paper and using the proceeds to buy higher yielding long term debt but some of the debt backing the siv commercial paper was lower quality mortgages investors stopped buying the commercial paper crippling the sivs "the assumption was that the assets underlying some of the commercial paper were extremely safe but when several instances came to light that hadnt been the case that made investors question things much more broadly " says christopher molumphy chief investment officer of the franklin templeton fixed income group the result is the practical boycotting of anything that isnt transparent "theres very large demand for absolute safety " says james mcdonald a portfolio manager at t rowe price group inc banks and brokers with exposure to troubled sivs and other securities backed by troubled mortgages "have less room on their balance sheets and less capital" to make loans says scott amero co head of fixed income at blackrock inc "thats the stress point in the market " security capital assurance is put on review by
