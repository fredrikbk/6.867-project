what classical music should be in beethovens fifth symphony which ended the first simon bolivar concert and even more in bartoks concerto for orchestra which kicked off the second one professionals could hear that not all sections of the orchestra were equally good simon rattle the berlin philharmonics music director took over the podium to end the second concert with the shostakovich tenth symphony and now the bassoons and the brass and in fact the whole orchestra sounded better new york sometimes its worth thinking awhile about things that happen before trying to write about them and certainly thats true for the concerts at carnegie hall last month by the berlin philharmonic and the simon bolivar youth orchestra of venezuela the simplest reaction would simply be "wow this is what classical music should be " and nothing in the past few weeks not the few caveats i had not any other music ive heard has changed what i feel these on the whole were spectacular events and they were linked together because the berlin orchestra works with the venezuelan kids so their appearance right next to each other was carefully planned though here i think carnegie hall went a little off the rails billing it all as part of a festival called "berlin in lights " which especially when those words were projected on the wall behind the stage before the venezuelans came on to play must have baffled those who didnt know the backstory but let that pass because the venezuelans however addled their billing drew the largest collection of classical music dignitaries ive ever seen at a concert and thats for two reasons one was the simon bolivar conductor gustavo dudamel who at age has become an international star and has even been named the next music director of the los angeles philharmonic taking over in this was his new york debut if you were a classical music professional you had to be there the second reason was that mr dudamel and his orchestra were trained in a government program which for a generation now it started long before hugo chavez has been teaching classical music to kids all over venezuela "el sistema " the program is called and the buzz about it has started to spread could we do something like this people ask here in the u s and from the moment mr dudamel walked out on stage looking like he owned the place the crowd must have thought the answer was "yes " the first piece was the berlioz "roman carnival" overture and the start of it with music sweeping up and down the violins just about slammed me against the back of my chair ive rarely heard anything like it so much fire so much unanimity these musicians love what theyre doing and put meaning into every note still in beethovens fifth symphony which ended the first simon bolivar concert and even more in bartoks concerto for orchestra which kicked off the second one professionals could hear that not all sections of the orchestra were equally good the bassoons sounded like they had vinegar in their reeds and the brass could be tinny though maybe the group just needs money to buy better instruments certainly in the beethoven mr dudamel showed what a conducting animal he is evoking to cite just one detail a dramatic hush in the second movement without ever losing his onward motion through the piece but then came a puzzle simon rattle the berlin philharmonics music director took over the podium to end the second concert with the shostakovich tenth symphony and now the bassoons and the brass and in fact the whole orchestra sounded better does mr rattle rehearse the group more thoroughly than mr dudamel does does he care more about technical perfection or did a conductor in the audience solve the puzzle with one simple stroke when after the concert he asked "who makes you play better your brother or your father " with mr rattle in charge though the orchestra wasnt as exciting as it had been under mr dudamel when i heard the three concerts by the berlin philharmonic i could understand why mr rattle takes extravagant charge of every musical detail but without much heart i thought or even any change in tone when the music plunges from one mood into another shifting say from light into darkness but heres a paradox mr rattle might at least for me have hurt the flow of the music but the orchestras playing at any given moment was beyond belief in mahlers last three major works the ninth and tenth symphonies and "das lied von der erde " music that often sounds like it comes from a torn and distant world and also in three new pieces the berlin musicians put their bodies into just about every note i could see them moving swaying sometimes almost dancing and doing all this as individuals not with any kind of group choreography each musician looked inspired and they sounded that way making a sound so rich and deep that other orchestras by comparison seem to be using only half their energy in "das lied" they played quietly transparently and with an inner light as if somehow they were alone in a small room listening only to one another with no audience and no need for anyone to lead them after one of these concerts one orchestra professional spoke of feeling "humbled " and a musician from a top american orchestra wished he felt free to move while he plays so these five concerts showed what classical music can be electric with devotion and excitement and after the venezuelan events the excitement was tumultuous total strangers came up to each other "this is the future of classical music " someone id never seen before said to me "this gives me hope " at least three large american orchestras the los angeles philharmonic the chicago symphony and the boston symphony are trying to introduce "el sistema " or at least some version of it in the cities where they play theyre teaming with community groups to teach classical music to kids especially the poorest kids could this bring us a cultural revolution im torn the bolivar orchestra is irresistible but i have my doubts the u s isnt venezuela were multicultural with many musical traditions including an american tradition thats mostly not classical why cant we teach even the poorest kids more than classical music why cant we also teach them blues and jazz and then the venezuelans have some limits as an encore they do latin american classical works along with the quasi latin rhythms of a mambo from "west side story " they wear their national colors for this and they get up and dance while they play who wouldnt love them but why dont they do latin music in the main part the serious part of their concert programs why dont they play new music as the berlin philharmonic and just about every serious american and european orchestra does and why dont they create music of their own why doesnt el sistema encourage composers as strongly as conductors and oboists why does it teach almost entirely the music of the past if these kids had come to new york with a new piece by a year old venezuelan a piece as hot as mr dudamels conducting well thats when theyd restore classical music to all its former glory mr sandow is a composer critic and consultant whos writing a book on the future of classical music
