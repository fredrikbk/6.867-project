that giant sucking sound may be your new tv flat panel displays devour power even before add ons energy star blurs the picture powering a fancy tv and full on entertainment system with set top boxes game consoles speakers dvds and digital video recorders can add nearly &# to a familys annual energy bill "what scares us is the prices for plasma sets are dropping so fast that people are saying why get a inch plasma set when you can get a inch or inch one " says tom reddoch director of energy efficiency for the nonprofit electric power research institutes laboratory in knoxville tenn an independent organization that advises the utility sector prices for big screen television sets are dropping but the cost of home entertainment may still be headed up that is because the fancy screens shoppers are lugging home this holiday season consume far more electricity than their old school predecessors consider that a inch plasma set can consume more electricity than a full size refrigerator even when that tv is used only a few hours a day powering a fancy tv and full on entertainment system with set top boxes game consoles speakers dvds and digital video recorders can add nearly &# to a familys annual energy bill most consumers arent made aware of extra energy expenses when they are shopping for a tv energy star tags a government program that identifies the most energy efficient models wont begin flagging the greenest televisions when turned on until late next year currently energy star judges energy consumption only in standby mode limiting its usefulness while most new types of tv sets use far more electricity than the old fashioned gadgets they replace some upstarts are bigger energy hogs than others in general liquid crystal display or lcd screens use less power than plasma sets of comparable size and in the largest screen sizes projection televisions typically use less electricity than lcd or plasma models a inch conventional television set containing a cathode ray picture tube or crt for example often uses about watts of electricity a inch lcd set a typical upgrade item requires about twice that amount of electricity but the real beast is the plasma set a inch model often sucks up to watts and a plus inch plasma screen can consume to watts depending on the model and programming according to the environmental protection agency in the biggest screen sizes a projection television is a better option from an energy use standpoint because it consumes about watts to watts far less than a plasma or lcd screen assuming each screen is on five hours a day the annual energy bill for the conventional inch television set would be about &# a year compared with about &# for the inch plasma model assuming power costs cents a kilowatt hour by the time other devices are added including game consoles speakers and dvds the cost to power the whole works can top &# annually how to do the math something that draws a constant watts of electricity uses kilowatt hours of electricity in a hour period or kilowatt hours in a year at cents a kilowatt hour the annual cost would be &# "what scares us is the prices for plasma sets are dropping so fast that people are saying why get a inch plasma set when you can get a inch or inch one " says tom reddoch director of energy efficiency for the nonprofit electric power research institutes laboratory in knoxville tenn an independent organization that advises the utility sector "they have no idea how much electricity these things consume " doug johnson senior director of technology policy for the consumer electronics association says the industry is working to improve disclosure and energy efficiency he says comparing television energy use to refrigerator energy use is "hackneyed " adding "when was the last time the family gathered around the refrigerator to be entertained " but consumers making an effort to go greener at home and who also want to ditch their bulky old tv set can be in a bit of a bind the energy savings gleaned from swapping out incandescent light bulbs for energy efficient compact fluorescent lights for example can easily be canceled out by the pileup in entertainment gear currently to of the average american households electricity bill stems from consumer electronics but that is projected to rise to by according to the epa part of the department of energy at a western appliance &amp television store in san leandro calif salesman mike lemos says customers often seek energy saving appliances but seem less focused on electricity use when it comes to entertainment gear "televisions are a more emotional purchase " he says "you look at a high definition tv and its hard not to get excited " just inside the entrance of a nearby costco store retiree pat brown paused to look at a riveting display of plasma and lcd screens stacked up billboard style to seize the attention of shoppers many stopped dead in their tracks to take in the noisy display ms brown who lives in nearby oakland said she always looks for the blue energy star tag when buying appliances but she was unaware that energy star for now doesnt cover sets when they are turned on "im retired so my tv is on pretty much all the time " she said "i definitely would want better information before buying one of these especially if theres a lot of difference between them " set top boxes which deliver programs and movies through the internet cable or satellite dishes also can be energy hogs in fact they typically consume about the same amount of power whether they are being used or standing by an older style box that functions as a standard receiver for cable tv viewing usually draws fewer than watts of power but a more robust version that offers high definition viewing and includes a built in recorder may consume three times as many according to a calculation by the natural resources defense council a typical high definition cable box with a built in digital recorder consumes about kilowatt hours of juice annually more than a conventional television set and clothes washer combined it can be tough for shoppers to know how much energy a tv set will consume while the epas energy star program covers tv sets only in standby mode the federal trade commissions "energy guide" labeling which tells how much electricity an appliance consumes and estimates the annual energy cost isnt used on tv sets the ftc says "it has not made a determination it will label tvs " says hampton newsome an ftc staff attorney in the bureau of consumer protection and enforcement in the past the agency didnt think there was enough difference between television sets to warrant energy guide labeling now the ftc is in a holding pattern waiting for the epa to finish work establishing the proper test methods for comparing sets when turned on this isnt as straightforward as it sounds because energy use differs according to the complexity of programming content for its part the epa appears to have settled on a process that will allow consumers to compare sets of the same size across technology types the agency expects to have improved energy star labels on television screens by november and to get them on set top boxes also in active and standby modes by december
