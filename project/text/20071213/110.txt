fall are hanging on the discount racks at outfit a clothing store at the wynn las vegas resort marked down by is a wall long rack of plaid that jean paul gaultier sent down the runway in paris last february nearby are other recently hot items from proenza schouler outfits to charles chang lima tops and avant garde pants and sweaters from martin margiela high end boutiques and department stores are now putting fall designs on sale its one of the vagaries of fashion resort and spring collections start elbowing out fall clothes just as the weather is turning frigid recently many retailers have been saying business is slow suggesting that upcoming sales may be treasure troves for shoppers but the remainder racks also provide an opportunity to see how the drama of the runway shows translated into actual sales back in february i tagged along with todd hanshaw the buyer for outfit as he purchased designer clothes for fall in new york and paris by following the collections through a buyer i hoped to gain a window on what fashions actually connect with americas luxury consumers mr hanshaw whos been buying for more than years says you can teach the rudiments of buying but "you cant teach style " one sign of the times in this las vegas outpost the cracks in the u s economy arent deterring luxury shoppers the priciest gowns were the ones that sold out "people have really been shopping for the showpieces " mr hanshaw says "i dont have one &# or up gown left to show you " he says noting that the store sold more than a dozen at that price outfits sales through november are already up over all of last year mr hanshaw says i chose outfit for its focus on showy high caliber designers and emerging talent as well as its seat at the crossroads of shopping crazed america roughly million people will visit las vegas this year thats not quite as many as will visit new york but each sin city visitor will spend almost twice what a visitor to the big apple spends according to new york city tourism agencies and the university of nevada at las vegas center for business and economic research that accounts for the increasing number of luxury retail stores in las vegas where the casino malls look a lot like the chic faubourg saint honore in paris these days wynn las vegas offers sprawling louis vuitton chanel dior and graff stores retail sales there measure roughly &# per square foot mr hanshaw says compared with about &# per square foot for a typical u s mall according to the international council of shopping centers industry group when i returned to outfit last week for an unannounced look see several of mr hanshaws more dramatic choices remained including a size monique lhuillier gown of black tulle over a leopard print which was ms lhuilliers runway finale in february mr hanshaw with saucy confidence had two of those gowns altered asking the showroom to strip some of the embroidered "hoop lah " as he called it off the skirt one sold even at off the gown still isnt a steal its now priced at &# more than the store paid although mark ups vary retailers generally price luxury clothes at two to times the wholesale price not until outfits clothes go to the so called second markup at off will they be priced below the stores cost whatever is left after that will be stored with its ultimate disposal probably taking place in a private warehouse sale mr hanshaw says he takes such misses in stride saying that he never expects to sell everything at full price and even at half off the store still makes money alexander mcqueen who showed a body hugging line of sexy dresses and slacks in february turned out to be outfits top selling designer this season owned by gucci group mr mcqueen is rapidly expanding his collection and the wynn resort has a new mcqueen store now under construction the wynn is betting that mr mcqueens sales will outpace those of jean paul gaultier whose store was recently closed after three and a half years mr gaultier the fashion industry "enfant terrible " puts on extravagant runway shows in paris every season last february he sent one model clog dancing down the runway and the scotland inspired fashions were elaborately constructed but the pieces appear not to have resonated with the wynn customers as evidenced by all the plaid outfits on sale racks mr hanshaw says it was problematic that the designers shipments arrived later than those of other designers marianne hicks vice president of sales for jean paul gaultier at aeffe usa inc says mr gaultier has always shipped later than bigger luxury conglomerates in part because of the complexity of his garments "jean paul gaultier kind of works on his own schedule " she said aeffe distributes the designer in the u s but wasnt responsible for the las vegas store because mr hanshaw bought directly from the showroom in paris other strong sellers included bottega veneta which sold out entirely by midseason with the exception of four dresses a cashmere sweater and a &# shearling shrug all of alexander mcqueens shiny patent "elvie" hand bags priced at &# sold out perhaps more surprising was the runaway success of overstitched leather clothes from gustavo lins a little known brazilian architect cum designer they had to be re ordered the store sold nine out of of the &# overcoats by narciso rodriguez why things sell or dont sell is one of the mysteries of the industry looking back mr hanshaw says his biggest mistakes didnt involve the choice of designer he ordered too many size s and s and he wishes he had bought less black and gray and more color he will soon have a chance to make amends the new york runway shows for fall are seven weeks away email christina binkley wsj com
