were shown without commercial interruptions on the three broadcast networks government rules required that ads run all at once between programs making the ad breaks as long as minutes and tempting viewers to get up and leave but that is about to change to the delight of broadcasters and the dismay of viewers a government agency responding to years of pressure from tv executives last month decided to allow broadcasters to break into shows with commercials some of the details including when the new policy will take effect have yet to be decided but it will be the biggest change in years in south koreas strictly regulated tv industry which imposed the advertising rule in the change is likely to mean higher rates for advertisers and more revenue for tv stations not surprisingly some viewers are upset in show commercials will "break the story flow " says woo ji sook a year old office worker in seoul "ive always pitied americans for being forced to take a break just before the story gets to the climax now it seems like ill be put in the same environment " south korean tv executives have been pressing for the change for several years under the current system the ads arent effective they say for example "legend " the popular prime time drama that recently finished its run on munhwa broadcasting corp or mbc drew a share in its time slot but the network says that according to its research only about of viewers watched the commercials before and after the show with so few viewers tuning in a good chunk of ad time is going unsold "at the moment only to of the total advertisement time is selling so we have to fill up the rest with house and public ads " says yoon jeong sig a spokesman for mbc it isnt clear how much of a financial boost broadcasters will get

and tivo doesnt exist here some advertisers say they dont plan to jump immediately at the new ad opportunity "i will probably wait until i see its worth the price " says yoo mina who is in charge of marketing of neutrogena products at johnson &amp johnsons korea unit jung jung yoon a marketer at gm daewoo auto &amp technology a subsidiary of general motors corp fears that intense competition for the in show slots may double or even triple current ad rates south korea allowed in show commercials on tv in the s but in the government changed the rules to limit advertising to before and after the programs chinas state run tv still has that policy japans tv networks which also started with this system long ago shifted to in show advertising south koreas broadcasters are still highly regulated for example korea broadcast advertising corp which sets ad rates also sells the spots themselves keeping a commission for the government and it forces advertisers to buy ads in bundles that include some commercial time that marketers want and some that they are less excited about the policy setting agency called the korean broadcasting commission is expected soon to write a proposal that would include details of how the new in show ads would work that proposal ultimately has to be approved by the president which is expected to be a formality ad rates in south korea are relatively low the highest rate is about &# for seconds next to the p m newscasts which are widely watched a korea broadcast advertising spokesman says in show ads may be priced to higher by contrast a second spot on a top rated prime time show in the u s runs about &# the in show breaks are likely to be either a minute long enough for four of the second spots that are common here but shorter than the breaks in other countries or seconds in total the korean broadcasting commission says in show ads are likely to boost total income of the networks by billion won &# million or if it limits in show ads to only two spots or a total of seconds if the in show ads have four spots adding up to a minute the revenue is expected to grow "this may not be a lot but it will help them to gain back their attractiveness"
