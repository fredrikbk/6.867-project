in europe some still cling to dreams of revolution group nabbed in italy appears to hark back to lethal red brigades for years he had lived a double life appearing as a model citizen while secretly running a radical group that plotted bank heists bombings and assassinations police say gassino torinese italy one night in february police officers in ski masks burst into a house in this small town near turin and arrested vincenzo sisi the charge running an armed terrorist group giancarla lorenzin his wife of years thought it was a mistake her husband a press operator at a factory had no criminal record and professed nonviolence they spent weekends hiking bicycling and gardening "ill see you in a few days " she told him as he was hustled out by police he caressed her cheek and shook his head no mr sisi knew things she didnt for years he had lived a double life appearing as a model citizen while secretly running a radical group that plotted bank heists bombings and assassinations police say they describe mr sisi and more than a dozen others arrested that day as the new face of the red brigades a violent left wing group that haunted italy during a bloody era of the s called the "years of lead " some of those arrested had been underground for years mr sisi for one is years old others werent yet alive in the s they include something factory hands a call center operator a pony tailed mailman and a student named amarilli caprio ms caprio when arrested seemed above suspicion she came from a middle class family in padua had good grades in high school wrote poetry and was studying languages at a milan university police uncovered clues they say make clear members of the group were armed and preparing to act dogs sniffed out a kalashnikov assault rifle buried under the garlic bulbs in mr sisis garden they found a cache of automatic weapons buried near an abandoned farmhouse sophisticated surveillance equipment in a milan basement ingredients for explosives and fake police uniforms among the groups targets police say were the milan headquarters of oil company eni spa and a professor of labor law hearings to decide whether the matter goes to trial began this week attorneys for both mr sisi and ms caprio said their clients planned to fight the charges but declined to discuss the case from jail mr sisi has written letters calling himself part of the "politico military wing preparing for the struggle to finally end the barbarism of exploitation " ms caprio before a transfer to house arrest signed prison letters "as always with a clenched fist " beneath the archaic rhetoric and sweeping ambitions is a remarkable story of a political movements survival long after soviet communism collapsed traces of a left wing dream of revolution live on in corners of europe sometimes in virulent strains adherents say theyre motivated by profound disappointment with how political struggles from a generation ago have played out instead of a more equitable society they see one more out of kilter partly through years of strikes european workers have won greater job and welfare protections but debt laden governments can no longer pay for it all and a system of haves and have nots has emerged young people chafe at a rigid job market with few opportunities communist parties espousing workers rights still garner support italy has two each with ministers in the government france has five far left groups the parties retain the trappings of a militant era like the hammer and sickle symbol but most have lost their edge as they join governments and forge compromises one result is that some who still cherish the dream of revolution have been forced to the margins of society or gone underground although the mass worker movements that fed the political violence of the s have long vanished left wing political terrorism retains a romantic appeal italian movies such as "the best of youth" and "buongiorno notte" co written by a former red brigades member paint a seductive picture of idealism and violence that resonates with some investigators were struck by the sympathy the arrests kicked up graffiti in support of the red brigades and those arrested appeared on factory walls around padua and there were two protest marches a molotov cocktail was left unexploded at the home of a police investigator that has left investigators with nagging worries "we have dismantled this wing but we dont know if there are others " says bruno megale head of milans investigative police unit "i think the siren call of revolution is buried deep inside this society " in the s and s a bloody ideological struggle in italy pitted workers against bosses and left against right communists garnered up to of the vote in elections strikes were frequent and often violent some elements impatient with the pace of change began seeing the unions and even the communist party as obstacles to a profound transformation a group with roots in the sociology department of the university of trento in northern italy evolved into the red brigades highly secretive they counted members many with training in explosives firearms and forging documents their attacks were brazen including bank heists and prison breaks and hit factory owners politicians journalists police and military officers attacks organized by the red brigades and other extremist groups killed more than and wounded thousands in the brigatisti kidnapped former italian prime minister aldo moro in broad daylight killing his bodyguards after days they shot him and left his body in a car trunk in central rome the brutishness of the assault isolated the red brigades from many of the workers they claimed to represent but it didnt stop them attacks continued including the kidnapping of a u s general james dozier who was later rescued authorities whod infiltrated the movement finally broke the back of it around history seemed to do the rest the soviet union collapsed china embraced capitalism yet on a spring day in a man stepped from a parked van near the university of rome and shot to death massimo dantona a professor and government labor adviser in a dense manifesto a group calling itself the red brigades took responsibility in marco biagi an economic adviser to the government was slain with the same gun not long after mr sisi unknown to his wife began recruiting militants to plot more attacks according to his arrest warrant and other police reports mr sisi had quit school at for a factory job he joined a union to fight for better pay and safer conditions by the time he met ms lorenzin in a disco in he was deeply involved in the ideological battles of the time three decades later he was still at the bottom economic rung making around &# a month after tax according to his former employer for operating a press at an auto parts supplier he was still fighting the same battles railing against his employer over working conditions and safety standards at home he and his wife focused on eating healthily cooking the vegetables from mr sisis garden "he doesnt have vices he doesnt smoke drink coffee " says ms lorenzin sitting in her living room under a crocheted "no smoking" sign yet in between pursuits such as his garden and bicycling or hiking mr sisi was cultivating a violent plan police say one thing he did they say was procure false documents and plan a clandestine border crossing for an associate from decades earlier the comrade alfredo davanzo had been on the lam in france for years after drawing a seven year italian prison sentence for subversive activity and arms possession investigators say messrs sisi and davanzo with a third longtime radical claudio latino formed the core of the group in they began anonymously publishing a journal called aurora which pushed a maoist type strategy of "long term class warfare " the plan was to recruit followers in places where social tensions ran high such as certain factories universities and immigrant neighborhoods the chance discovery of sophisticated surveillance equipment and bomb making manuals in a milan apartment buildings basement storage area put police on their trail but they took elaborate diversionary measures when they got together while walking to a meeting mr sisi would duck behind a wall and emerge a moment later with a different colored shirt up to three or four times in a single outing according to a police surveillance report mr sisis arrest warrant says he would arrive in milan from turin by train and switch to the subway he would take a zigzag route jumping out of a subway car just before the doors closed and then taking another subway in the opposite direction mr latino would arrive by bicycle to elude a possible police tail he would ride the wrong way down milan streets and run red lights he looked over his shoulder so frequently say police that more than once he crashed his bike into parked cars arriving at their destination usually a milan street corner the three didnt greet one another but loitered on opposite corners one would begin to walk and the others would follow at a distance they might walk for miles before stepping into a cafe or chinese restaurant never the same one twice ms lorenzin says she wondered about mr sisis absences "he would leave for whole days and not tell me where he was going and not answer me when i asked him " she assumed his trips had to do with union activism in the summer of the couple rented a cottage in the alps when mr sisi and his wife returned after a walk he would check to be sure nothing had been moved according to the police surveillance report he insisted testily that his wife never say "milan" or "leaving" on her cellphone when she told him he was being too cautious he snapped "you just dont think about anything " police were indeed watching through surveillance that sometimes included agents across a single milan neighborhood they began to piece together the outlines of the groups plans such as amassing explosives on aug of last year at a meeting in a bar across from milans teatro piccolo recorded by the police mr latino said he had moved two people from padua to milan where they had enrolled in the university to canvass students and "see if there are others who might be interested " one of the two was amarilli caprio the daughter of a middle class engineering consultant and a high school literature teacher who had named her after a demigod in a virgil poem ms caprio attended the university of padua she also worked in a customer service call center and became active in the local union a co worker recalls her as "combative but hard working " ms caprio was eager to earn financial independence but the call center job offered meager pay and few prospects like many other students in italy she languished in the university with no degree six years after high school in ms caprio told her parents she was leaving padua to enroll at the university of milan she said she wanted to learn languages that would allow her to teach italian to foreigners and there were more immigrants in milan recalls her father roberto caprio "she was independent " he says and he saw nothing odd about her move in milan ms caprio and her boyfriend held meetings with other students and advanced a radical agenda police say the warrant doesnt say whether they recruited anyone after ms caprios arrest police say they found her notebooks to contain lists of possible targets the same ones discussed by others her arrest came at a m one day last february in the milan apartment she shared with her boyfriend when her father in padua got home that evening his wife told him something terrible had happened and turned on the tv news "i thought my daughter i felt the whole world coming down on me for something that couldnt be true " mr caprio says it was five days before he and his wife could visit amarilli in jail when they did "she looked at her mother and said i did it for love " mr caprio recalls the love he says was for the working class in solitary confinement at first ms caprio spent her days writing poems as well as letters home and to a radical web site in one poem she saw herself as part of a long struggle of the working class "we have callused hands " it began forged by "centuries and centuries of exploitation " ms caprio turned in jail on june a date her father notes that is recognized as the international day of political prisoners in september a judge let her finish her pretrial custody under house arrest at the home of an uncle near the town of urbino hundreds of miles from her home in padua "when i cant sleep at night i try to make sense of whats happened " ms caprios father says "she was accused of proselytizing we all do some form of proselytizing look at priests " he adds "why couldnt she have just taken to golf or something "
