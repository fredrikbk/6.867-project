now showing the battle of the buzz new model of sponsored events starts a red carpet ruckus its a practice that has gone on for years but mr saffir has added a new twist to these exclusive gatherings of movie stars studio moguls and paparazzi the luxury brand sponsor who pays for the event a manhattan native and former longtime polo ralph lauren corp executive mr saffir has pitched his screenings and parties as a younger hipper alternative to ms siegals events which usually take place at screening rooms in midtown manhattan followed by sit down meals at restaurants nearby a pivotal moment at a recent private screening of the new film "margot at the wedding" in manhattan nearly went awry and it had nothing to do with the movie itself on a red carpet the films stars nicole kidman and jennifer jason leigh posed with director noah baumbach as part of the celebrity march known as the "step and repeat" the stars take a step pose for the cameras and take another step but they stepped too far as photographers snapped pictures the trio was out of line with a backdrop stamped with the name of the film the logo of event sponsor allure magazine and a third less familiar emblem "the cinema society " a publicist spoke up "hey guys could you stand in front of the thing " they dutifully repositioned themselves getting film stars photographed on the red carpet with corporate logos is key to the business model of andrew saffir the year old founder of the cinema society mr saffirs company hosts exclusive film screenings and parties for the elite in new yorks celebrity fashion and media circles its a practice that has gone on for years but mr saffir has added a new twist to these exclusive gatherings of movie stars studio moguls and paparazzi the luxury brand sponsor who pays for the event sponsors of mr saffirs events have included chanel calvin klein inc vanity fair magazine and the wall street journal which has underwritten nine in the past two and a half years mr saffir has quickly established himself in territory that new york based film publicist peggy siegal years old has dominated for the past two decades in the late s when many studios streamlined and moved their publicity departments to los angeles ms siegal created a business niche by hosting small screenings and dinners for the influential new york press for years studios have paid ms siegal known for her ability to get journalists socialites and veteran film and stage professionals into film screening seats to plan such affairs for them in addition to funding the events she says studios pay her a fee starting at &# as their rivalry intensifies ms siegal takes frequent swipes at mr saffir she says its distasteful that he includes his own companys logo on the backdrops for his step and repeats "the cinema society is good at promoting the cinema society " ms siegal says moreover staging such photo opportunities at the screenings amounts to "the bastardization of the red carpet " she says mr saffir makes no apologies "this is a business " he says "im trying to create a brand " his company put on screenings in and so far this year he says he doesnt want to do many more than that because he doesnt want them to be "run of the mill " ms siegal plans around events each year ranging from to attendees with the occasional party for in the past decade the grand scale hollywood premiere has fallen from grace studios have become loath to shell out piles of cash to throw bashes and celebrities dread the mobs of fans publicists say as a result studios are increasingly counting on the small scale "special screenings" or "tastemakers screenings" that ms siegal and mr saffir produce to market films with small guest lists free of the hoi polloi the events end up attracting the a list late fall is the busy season for such screenings because producers are hungry for buzz that translates into oscar nominations now all the more since a writers strike has stopped production of many late night talk shows a crucial vehicle for promotion as studios tighten marketing budgets mr saffirs approach of getting sponsors to foot the bill is becoming more attractive "all we have to do is show up " says meryl katz vice president awards and special events at miramax a unit of walt disney co she has worked with mr saffir on four screenings a manhattan native and former longtime polo ralph lauren corp executive mr saffir has pitched his screenings and parties as a younger hipper alternative to ms siegals events which usually take place at screening rooms in midtown manhattan followed by sit down meals at restaurants nearby last week the cinema society hosted a screening for "atonement" at new yorks ifc film center followed by a party at soho restaurant balthazar chanel paid for the event which was attended by the films star keira knightley and musician michael stipe the following night mr saffirs company held a screening for "revolver" that was underwritten by piaget afterward director guy ritchie held court at the gramercy park hotels private roof club with his wife madonna a cinema society event costs the sponsors &# to &# including mr saffirs fee which ranges from &# to &# many luxury brands are happy to absorb the cost of hosting an event because it helps associate them with glamour in the minds of their consumers while its become common for brands to underwrite film festivals charity events and other celebrity bashes mr saffir has made a specialty of using sponsors for tastemaker film screenings "andrew found a way to marry film luxury and exposure to brand " says luxury marketing consultant robert burke in mid november mr saffirs after party for a showing of the bob dylan bio pic "im not there " sponsored by hogan a division of tods spa at the bowery hotel in downtown manhattan drew actress julianne moore model padma lakshmi and actor heath ledger word of mouth is hard to measure but the buzz created for a film can be powerful after seeing the film "united " at an event put together by ms siegal last year nbc nightly news anchor brian williams plugged it on air this october howard stern mentioned "things we lost in the fire" on his radio show after seeing it at a cinema society screening part of ms siegals appeal is her connections to members of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences as they vote for the oscar nominees and winners studios clamor to get their films before them but the academy prohibits studios from courting members who vote ms siegal says any academy member attending her events is invited despite their membership not because of it "you have to be careful " she says in november ms siegal held a "filmmakers lunch" for miramax to celebrate joel and ethan coens film "no country for old men " amid a crowd of blue jean clad ethan coen sat at a table with cbs newss jeff greenfield emmy winning writer lawrence odonnell and miramax president daniel battsek the room was dotted with academy members such as actor joel grey "i fill the room with young pretty smart people and old academy members " ms siegal said mr saffir says he likes to include filmmakers "so if a member of the academy ends up in that mix so be it but i dont make any concerted effort to include academy members " he adds "the goal is to create a buzz worthy and press worthy night " mr saffirs fashion connections have helped him with certain sponsors malcolm carfrae calvin kleins senior vice president of global communications says he was impressed by the crowd at a cinema society event on the deck of donna karans east hampton beach house attended by christy turlington and cbs evening news anchor katie couric "the quality of the people munching their popcorn was unbelievable " he says ms siegal says studios are increasingly insisting she come up with sponsors to pay for their events and to cover her fee "im resentful " she says still she is trying to give the studios what they want she says she has gotten backing from luxury brands including yacht brokerage firm edmiston co sipping champagne at the soho grand hotel after the cinema society screening of "margot at the wedding " daphne zuniga a star of pop culture classics like aaron spellings "melrose place" says the intimate gatherings are a sign of the times "these days were all looking to connect " she says "and if we have to connect amid underwriters and branders well thats entertainment "
