eu nations try to steer auto co caps u k letter is latest to lobby regulators a north south split in a letter to eu regulators reviewed by the wall street journal three british government ministers asked that the eus looming limits on carbon dioxide be shaped in a way that doesnt disproportionately affect niche auto makers such as ford motor co s jaguar and land rover brands which are up for sale the united kingdom has asked european regulators to mold auto emissions caps in favor of the u k based jaguar and land rover brands as europes governments move to defend their car makers in a letter to eu regulators reviewed by the wall street journal three british government ministers asked that the eus looming limits on carbon dioxide be shaped in a way that doesnt disproportionately affect niche auto makers such as ford motor co s jaguar and land rover brands which are up for sale they warned the brands could be forced out of business depending on how new rules are written the letter dated dec also warned that new regulations "could genuinely threaten the very viability" of smaller u k based car makers such as morgan motor co and aston martin unless they are exempted from regulation altogether uncertainty over the plans has been a particular source of worry for companies bidding to purchase jaguar and land rover ford has put the brands up for sale as it tries to refocus on its north america business the last minute lobbying efforts come as the european commission prepares to publish details of its plan to cut average emissions from new cars in europe possibly as early as next week the regulations are part of an effort to limit carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming the u k letter joins a flurry of others from governments worried that the way the new rules are written could have a major impact on the competitiveness of their car industries the contest already has broadly split eu countries into north and south pitting germany against france and italy in separate letters to eu regulators over the past six weeks french president nicolas sarkozy and italian prime minister romano prodi have urged the eu to adopt emissions regulations that would be relatively flat across model lines regardless of how much cars weigh such regulations would be somewhat easy for italian and french car makers such as fiat spa renault sa and psa peugeot citroen sa because their model lineups are largely skewed toward small vehicles that emit low levels of co germany is calling for targets that account for differences in vehicle segments german car makers say limits should be more lenient as vehicles get heavier reflecting the skew of their own fleets toward more powerful cars with relatively high emissions levels the broad outlines of the commissions plan are well known by regulators want to reduce the average level of co emitted by europes new car fleet to grams per kilometer compared with roughly now the commission has said it will hold car makers accountable for reducing the industry fleet average to grams with a further reduction of grams coming from "other technological improvements" and increased use of biofuels what isnt clear is how the commission will apply its regulations in a marketplace that ranges from tiny hatchbacks like the fiat to sport utility vehicles like the porsche cayenne eu officials have said they are likely to adopt a weight based system with more lenient targets along a curve as cars get heavier but officials havent specified how steep it will be or how they will enforce the system to reduce co emissions as quickly as eu officials would like sales of some of europes heaviest most profitable vehicles would have to fall a step that would cost germanys bmw ag roughly million euros &# million a year according to an analysis by citigroup inc the u k ministers wrote that jaguar and land rover may soon be "independent" and that the brands "would be disproportionately impacted by the legislation simply due to the nature of their limited product portfolio " it would be wrong to penalize brands "simply because they specialize in a particular type of vehicle and therefore cannot offset their emissions internally " wrote british environment secretary hilary benn secretary of state for transport ruth kelly and john hutton secretary of state for the department for business enterprise and regulatory reform to avoid "artificially distorting the market " the ministers argue that car makers with sales of more than vehicles a year should be allowed to choose between having to reduce their fleets emissions by a certain fixed percentage or committing to targets that would be based on certain attributes of their vehicles such as weight for car makers with sales of less than vehicles annually such as morgan and aston martin the ministers argue that no statutory co limits should be set because those companies make up a tiny fraction of the european car market
