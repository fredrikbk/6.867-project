extra protection for your kids ride will child car seats designed for side impact crashes be the next must have item worries over side impact crashes make sense because the area between the passenger and the colliding vehicle "is very thin " compared with front or rear crashes says lorrie walker training manager with safekids org a safety research group sponsored by general motors corp still she says theres no u s crash standard for child restraints so some makers employ testing methods similar to those used in europe that say the child must stay within the confines of the seat and not strike the window side impact protection isnt just for grown ups anymore now the feature is being touted by the makers of a new generation of child car safety seats that claim to offer protection from both side crashes and side air bags the seats which are widely available in europe dont come cheap they range from &# to &# as opposed to &# to &# for many conventional child seats theyre arriving on the market as new u s regulations are compelling the auto industry to improve safety in side impacts among the deadliest types of crashes by making extensive side air bags necessary yet air bags are designed mainly to protect adults and have been known to harm younger children and even small adults during their sudden deployment though side impact air bags may not present the same threat that front end air bags do the newest child restraints are designed in part at shielding children from them so far two big manufacturers britax child safety inc and peg perego spa both based in europe have begun selling the new car seats in the u s they feature bolsters or "wings" fortified with thick energy absorbing padding that extend to the childs sides and give them a boxy enclosed look domestic makers say they are holding off developing these seats until federal regulators establish a standard for testing their effectiveness worries over side impact crashes make sense because the area between the passenger and the colliding vehicle "is very thin " compared with front or rear crashes says lorrie walker training manager with safekids org a safety research group sponsored by general motors corp still she says theres no u s crash standard for child restraints so some makers employ testing methods similar to those used in europe that say the child must stay within the confines of the seat and not strike the window companies such as britax peg perego graco childrens products and evenflo co say they conduct their own tests not only to check how secure children are in their seats but also to make sure they dont conflict with the growing number of air bags and other restraint systems in vehicles the new focus on side impacts has parents taking another look at the current crop of car seats lori webber says she noticed her old car seats shortcomings while riding in the back seat next to her baby caroline as her husband drove over the bumpy driveway apron caroline looked wobbly and uncomfortable ms webber started thinking about getting a new car seat and when she went shopping she noticed some britax models had added protective side panels which protrude from the seats backrest and form a sort of channel around the child "i wound up buying the britax boulevard mainly because of the side impact protection " says the charlotte n c stay at home mom "caroline didnt like them at first because they blocked her view a little but on the positive side they support her head during naps " years of collision data confirm that side impact crashes tend to be more severe than other types such crashes have a significantly higher fatality rate among children up to age than front or rear collisions according to the childrens hospital of philadelphias center for injury research and prevention side impact collisions also result in more severe injuries at lower crash severities than frontal ones "child seats in frontal impacts do very well so side impact protection is the next big thing " says kristy arbogast associate director of field engineering with the center for injury research and prevention in philadelphia but side impact accidents can be more complex and it can be hard to figure out exactly what happens to passengers and how best to protect them especially small children "the concept of having side wings and padding those wings reflects good engineering and design principles " ms arbogast says most side impact crashes on the road though differ from those in lab tests because they almost always include a frontal component thats because the car being hit from the side is usually moving forward and the collision sharply decreases that forward motion so the child in the rear seat tends to pitch forward during the crash as well as to the side as a result ms arbogast says it is difficult to estimate how effective side wings would be in actual crashes the national highway traffic safety administration recently drafted new regulations that will require more protection in a side impact collision the regulations will start affecting vehicles when the model year begins in practice the new rules will likely require vehicles to have extensive side air bags that protect passengers torsos and heads some seat makers are waiting to see the effect of the new federal regulations before they introduce new designs and whether consumers flock to competitors seats because of added protective features lindsey harris vice president of product development for evenflo a u s car seat maker says the company has been looking into ways of improving side impact safety but plans to wait for the new rules arrival before deciding on whether to roll out a specific product dorel juvenile group a unit of dorel industries inc that makes restraints under a number of brand names including cosco safety st and eddie bauer didnt comment on its plans regarding the side impact regulations one reason manufacturers are cautious about side impact protection is the potential cost parents they say are more reluctant to pay a premium for child restraints than for strollers and other childrens products the majority of seat makers will develop side impact seats only if compelled to do so by regulators or if they see a potential market for them "consumer demand is what drives this market " says safekids orgs ms walker if parents safety concerns are as deep as some seat makers think stronger seats with thicker padding and side impact wings could become the standard within a few years "but you will pay for it " ms walker says
