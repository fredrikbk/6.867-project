treasury yields could throw a curve gains for year note have potential to weigh on housing and stocks after being a nonissue for most of this year treasury bond yields have begun to rise driven by the strong global economy worry that china is losing its appetite for u s government debt and a concern that rising food and energy prices could boost inflation expectations among consumers while the rise in yields remains modest if the trend continues it would hurt borrowers in general and in particular homeowners looking to refinance their adjustable rate mortgages potentially adding another negative to the housing market the yield on the benchmark year treasury note rose to last week thats hardly a lofty perch but it is a step up from in late february and as recently as may since mid the yield on the year note has stayed reliably below except for a four month span last spring and summer when it reached as high as bond prices and bond yields work like a seesaw when prices go down yields go up so shrinking demand for treasurys has pushed their yields near their highest levels this year higher yields could worry stock investors because higher returns on low risk bonds would make riskier stocks less attractive last week the dow jones industrial average shed to snap a string of seven consecutive weeks of gains the standard &amp poors stock index slid the nasdaq composite index lost less than for the week the steepest run up in yields has come in long term treasurys such as year notes in recent months the yield on the year had lagged behind the yields on shorter term treasurys an uncommon state of affairs known as an "inverted yield curve" and considered by some as a sign the economy is heading for trouble now the years yield has just slightly surpassed the yield on two year treasurys which is considered more normal because investors expect to get paid more for risking their money over a longer period several recent developments have come together to make treasurys less popular some data have indicated that the u s economy is stronger than once thought so investors are less inclined to seek the safety of low paying government debt and more apt to plow their money into stocks and other riskier but often higher paying assets another factor is the growing concern about rising food and fuel prices says rich yamarone an economist at argus research corp while food and energy are generally not counted in core measures of inflation rising prices could convince consumers that higher inflation is at hand that can change their behavior which worries both central bankers and bond investors the government will release inflation data this week and an unexpected uptick would likely send bond yields higher still mr yamarone said he doesnt foresee an alarming rise in treasury yields he predicts the year notes yield will be around at years end "the economy is not going to get knocked off kilter with or or " he says "wheres the harm wheres the foul there " in another wrinkle some bond investors have begun to worry that china plans to invest more of the proceeds from its massive trade surplus into stocks and less in its favorite capitalist tool the u s treasury market chinas demand for u s government debt has been credited with helping keep treasury prices high and yields low recent news that a chinese government entity invested &# billion in u s private equity giant blackstone group has some bond market hands worried it will start investing its money in "something with more sizzle than treasury securities " says kevin giddis a managing director at morgan keegan &amp co a memphis tenn investment bank "this is kind of like the butcher finding out his best customer is now a vegetarian " morgan stanley economist richard berner meanwhile thinks the recent rise in rates could be a harbinger of a new era an unwinding of what former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan once termed the "conundrum" of persistently low bond rates mr berner predicts bond yields will continue to be driven higher by strong global economic growth and by foreign central bankers efforts to cool inflation by raising their interest rate targets this has helped push up yields on global bonds he notes for example that yields on the u k s year index linked "gilts" have risen more than one third of a percentage point in the past two months a substantial rise in u s government bond rates would have a big effect on homeowners because mortgage rates are benchmarked to the yield on the year treasury note mortgage giant freddie mac estimated late last year that nearly &# billion in first lien adjustable rate mortgages could reset in many borrowers who took out adjustable rate mortgages in with a three year fixed introductory rate are likely to see their mortgage rates jump to about from about says keith gumbinger at financial publisher hsh associates as of last week hshs surveys showed the going rate on a year fixed rate mortgage was around that means homeowners who took out adjustable rate mortgages in would do better if they refinanced into fixed rate loans but not much better the pain could be greater though if the year notes yield climbs substantially "there dont appear to be real worries that rates are going to go screaming off into the night " mr gumbinger says "over the last couple years weve had remarkable stability in interest rates theres no reason to believe were going to break out of that anytime soon "
