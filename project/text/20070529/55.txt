miracles of resurrection clifton n j when more than half a century ago the homily went into serious overtime at st josephs catholic church in west new york n j young donald samick found a welcome distraction in the rich colors streaming from the stained glass windows "i remember looking up at the windows and thinking how pretty they were " said mr samick now the head of j&amp r lamb studios inc the oldest continuously operating ecclesiastical art and stained glass concern in the u s lamb which celebrated its th birthday last month has had commissions from every state in the union these range from the creation of a double lancet stained glass window for manhattans marble collegiate church and stained glass windows for various chapels at camp lejeune the north carolina marine corps base to the restoration of the robert e lee memorial window in richmond va s historic st pauls episcopal church made necessary when a sailor on leave and in his cups heaved a rock through it in the work room of the studio a modest two story structure on a busy suburban street here an artisan was assembling a stained glass window for st albans episcopal church in new brunswick n j one of a series of four that will replace large sheets of colored glass at a neighboring work table an employee examined a window with missing pieces a memorial tribute to one helen c dickinson gesner that had been brought in for evaluation from christ church in ridgewood n j theres a split between commissions for new windows and restoration projects while much of the work is ecclesiastical in nature lamb does a few domestic jobs diamond shaped leaded glass say for the occasional architect building a tudor home a current project is the restoration of a skylight for a house in nearby hoboken whatever the scope and nature of the work its done exclusively by hand with soldering irons and glass cutters pattern shears and lead knives rather like a doctor taking a medical history mr samick and his colleagues attempt to learn as much as possible about a window before beginning treatment major artisans notably the arch rivals john lafarge and louis comfort tiffany had their own discrete design techniques and their own methods for cutting glass and putting windows together "it behooves us to understand those techniques intimately you cant just take it apart blindly or youre not going to know how to put it back together " said mr samick whose craftspeople take rubbings of the lead lines of each layer of glass to facilitate reassembly depending on the quality of the lead a windows structural design and the method of installation restoration is required every to years &# to &# will refurbish a by foot window "the glass itself will last forever " said mr samick "its made of silica so its impervious " not so the lead which is gradually weakened by oxidation moisture and heat the biggest challenge of the job is not the restoration work itself which involves releading the window and perhaps shoring up the window frame but the removal of the window from its resting place "when a window is installed its strong " said mr samick "but when youre taking it out its because the window is weak and delicate and needs to be restored in some cases the leading is so fragile the window could start falling apart under its own weight " prayer and tape come in particularly handy at such moments there are certain fundamental rules when it comes to restoration chief among them make sure whatever you do is reversible because there might come a time that better permanent solutions will be available and unless its missing dont replace painted glass because youre dealing with original artwork lamb studios was established in by two brothers who had emigrated from england and settled in new yorks greenwich village the original focus of the business was the interior design of churches mosaics woodwork and metal work but in the s lamb extended its reach to include windows in the process becoming one of the foremost developers of opalescent semi opaque stained glass "i can recognize a lamb window by the style of painting on it its different from anyone elses its much more refined in terms of brush strokes " said mr samick a former architecture student who joined the firm in as a draftsman and salesman and became its owner six years later hes currently bidding on a project to restore the opalescent stained glass windows that lamb studios made almost a century ago for the first presbyterian church in orange texas it is he says a good time to be in the restoration business "america is getting old the result of the church building boom of the early s is that a lot of work needs to be done now roofing masonry stained glass " when a house of worship approaches lamb for new stained glass windows the firm has fashioned some of them generally theres already donor money on the table "its usually done to honor or more likely to memorialize someone " said mr samick who determines a price based on the size of the window and the intricacy of design will there be lots of tiny pieces and myriad painted figures for instance the full cast of the last supper or will there be abstract imagery which tends to mean little painting applied and only a few small pieces "i always tell people its like asking the price of a car its a complicated question " he said for a by foot window the tariff runs from &# to &# if its an older church mr samick can count on a request for traditional scenes from the bible "its generally what the donor wants because the donor tends to be an older person who grew up with sweet images of jesus we make a lot of sweet images of jesus " conversely if lamb is outfitting a new house of worship with contemporary architecture "theyd probably like to have more stylistic imagery " for instance praying hands said mr samick "we were very appreciative of the direction don gave to us " said edwin mulder retired associate pastor of the marble collegiate church "we hadnt put in a new window in years and he had the patience of job he asked what we were trying to say with the window what was the message i never got the sense that he was trying to sell us something " mr samick returns the compliment he regards himself as blessed in his clientele "the clergy is easy to communicate with and very respectful of the work we do " he said adding "i have no bad debts i have no accounts receivable over days thats unheard of " whether its good for business or good for the soul mr samick spreads his religious trade around "i worship in a lot of different places at different times " and while he cant help but notice the stained glass on the premises or the lack thereof "i wouldnt say to the minister great service but your windows need help " at home that diplomacy goes right out the you know what "im a fanatic " he said "about having clean windows ms kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the journal
