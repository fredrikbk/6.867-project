antonio express news buck harvey looks back to when mr fisher then a los angeles laker made a miracle shot over mr ginobli to claim game for l a "ginobili had put his arms straight up then so as not to foul derek fisher " mr harvey writes "ginobili figured that was enough then the basketball whizzed over his head in a kind of time travel and a season changed years passed fisher left the lakers and then came monday when ginobili did far more than put his arms in the air and hope " in the salt lake city tribune gordon monson writes "go ahead and whine about the officiating if you must jazz fan cry about the disparity in number of calls down the stretch but san antonio was nothing short of relentlessly aggressive until the last buzzer the jazz tried but were timid " mr monsons colleague
