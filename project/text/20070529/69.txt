politics &amp economics vietnam vies to get in on outsourcing talent pool wages let nation compete with china india hanoi vietnam foreign investors and the vietnamese government are trying to push this emerging economy up the learning curve nudging it into higher tech and higher margin businesses and winning commerce away from better established countries when british recruitment agency harvey nash plc began scouting for an offshore hub for its new software development business six years ago vietnam wasnt an obvious choice while countries such as india the philippines and south africa already were latching onto the outsourcing phenomenon vietnam still was in the business of trying to make shoes bicycles and clothes cheaper than anybody else but when harvey nashs inspection team returned from hanoi to assess the options vietnam was the top contender its mix of low wages improving english language skills and technical proficiency helped tip the balance in its favor an alliance with fpt software corp a unit of vietnam technology company fpt corp also gave the nation an edge at a time when outsourcing wages and job hopping were on the rise in india today harvey nash employs people across vietnam through its own business and its partnership with fpt it develops billing software for telecom companies such as belgiums belgacom sa creates applications to manage human resources at honda motor co s british unit and tests software systems for discovery communications inc s discovery channel and nbc universals msnbc since beginning to open up its economy in the late s vietnam has mostly seen its economy expand on the back of agricultural exports and low wage manufacturing but many prospective investors sensed vietnam is capable of doing much more during a visit to hanoi last year microsoft corp founder bill gates said there was no reason vietnam couldnt follow india into software development and other forms of outsourcing last years decision by intel corp to build a &# billion semiconductor factory near ho chi minh city was a turning point of sorts for such efforts intels announcement was a sign to the international investment community that major high tech companies were comfortable channeling large amounts of money into vietnam industrial land here is cheaper than in china wages are about a third lower than in chinas industrial coastal regions and with a population of almost million people half of whom are under years old vietnams talent pool is deep and increasing the fact that vietnam is controlled by the communist party isnt a concern for most investors adam sitkoff executive chairman of the american chamber of commerce in hanoi said vietnams leaders have closely watched chinas development and are following beijings strategy of opening up the economy to investment while maintaining a tight hold on political power while corruption remains a problem in vietnam government leaders said they are working to reduce the bureaucratic processes that could lead to graft at the same time vietnam is offering incentives to investors such as intel since intels commitment vietnam has seen a surge of interest from technology companies hoping to follow in the semiconductor firms path said vice minister for planning and investment cao viet sinh "higher end investors are coming here and sensing the opportunity " mr sinh said "we have a young work force here which is familiar with technology and the training is getting better all the time " california consultancy neoit ranked vietnams ho chi minh city as the top non indian city in its review of the most competitive cities for outsourcing based on the available labor pool and infrastructure the only other non indian cities in the top are manila and shanghai while foreign companies are paying closer attention to vietnam the country also is beginning to spawn home grown high tech outfits such as glass egg digital media and alive interactive media inc in ho chi minh city which design parts of videogames for companies such as microsoft sony corp s sony computer entertainment inc and electronic arts inc other vietnamese companies such as tma solutions develop software for clients including nortel networks corp and alcatel lucent "this is a very bright sector for vietnam " said louis nguyen a vietnamese american financier who until recently was a fund manager at vinacapital group overseeing a technology investment fund that invests in vietnamese companies vietnam still is some way from becoming the next india china or even a philippines the reigning outsourcing giants in asia the latter two are leading the race to get a slice of an information technology outsourcing market with an estimated value of &# billion in according to industry consultancy b e a associates inc moreover the global outsourcing industry relies as much on the quality of telecommunications as on the talent pool and in this respect vietnam still is lacking industry analysts said the english spoken by its work force doesnt flow off the tongue as fluently as it does among indian or filipino workers either but building up telecommunications is a quicker fix than building up a competent work force and an increasing number of companies such as harvey nash are getting in early to tap as much talent as they can graham davies vice president of harvey nashs software development unit said software development and business process outsourcing comprised about of the companys gbp million &# million in revenue in the months ended jan after starting from scratch six years ago over the next two to three years he expects more work to come from u s clients to complement harvey nashs mostly european business base the nature of the companys business is a good match with the increasing number of vietnamese graduating into the work pool and aspiring to snag the kinds of jobs that can help them climb into the countrys middle class mr sinh vice minister for planning said vietnams government is focusing on improving education to strengthen what he describes as the countrys "soft infrastructure " mr davies among others said this focus is paying off "theres a lot of concentration on the hard sciences and mathematics in the vietnamese universities " he said while acknowledging that newly arrived companies are beginning to compete with his firm for the pick of graduates tuan nguyen years old is just the kind of person the outsourcers hope to nab sitting in his cubicle in harvey nashs three floor office in hanoi he speaks fluent english and is a skilled coder "this is just the right work for me " mr nguyen said while figuring out the coding on the software for a london financial services company "sometimes the problems are difficult to solve but thats the challenge "
