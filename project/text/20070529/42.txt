home &amp family best of the juggle million dollar question how to save for retirement excerpts from wsj coms work &amp family blog im years old and saving for retirement is often overshadowed by more pressing expenses child care preschool student loans and saving for a house yet a recent column by my colleague jonathan clements titled "the &# million retirement fund how to get there from here " reminds young people that to achieve the gasp &# million nest egg theyll need they should start saving now when weve written about finances in the juggle in the past some readers said they barely come out ahead each month even if you do save unexpected events can wipe you out readers whats your plan readers say "we live below our means by driving basic cars even though we can afford more we live in a house that is nice but we could afford three times more we always buy on sale and we use coupons " "i used to be a retirement savings poster child now my husband and i end the month with maybe &# combined in our checking accounts the incredible drain of child care expenses has left us totally unable to save for anything at all " the boredom factor by tom weber theres a lot of worry these days about kids who are overscheduled but what about children who are overentertained i am talking about the lack of boredom in kids lives a lot of the apprehension about overscheduling relates to overloading kids and stressing them out but arent we also depriving them of the chance to develop an important skill the ability to entertain themselves in a response to a recent item we did on overscheduling one reader commented "when do kids read when do they dream learning to deal with boredom and solitude are essential to developing an inner life " kids of working parents may be especially susceptible busy parents are often driven to make the most of the time they get with their kids packing in activities and events my kids have a lot of great plans for this summer but im hoping theyll also run into spells of boredom and find their own ways to address it readers say "im always amazed and dismayed at the end of the day by how little time my kids have had to just play " "i grew up as a very bored suburban kid and teenager and i was generally miserable in my boredom you would think that boredom would be a magical elixir that will help kids develop their imaginations and discipline more frequently though bored youth equals alcohol drugs violence and crime " are we whiners in many ways working mothers these days have it easier there are more professional opportunities and laws that protect against discrimination it still amazes me that my grandmothers company where she worked as a typist in the s required women to resign once they were married today fathers take on much more of the parenting role and stay at home dads are more socially accepted than they were a generation ago technology too has made life more flexible for working parents allowing them to head home early and log on later to finish up work there are obvious downsides blackberrys hum at all hours and employees are expected to be always reachable employers often demand longer hours and more travel then theres the pressure of trying to be a powerful professional a stellar mom and a supportive spouse do parents today actually have it harder than past generations or do we harp too much on the negatives readers say "i wouldnt try telling someone of the past generation how hard we have it raucous laughter is the best you could expect " "theres nothing wrong with wanting to be responsible and happy and find a balance its a worthy goal but its just one more thing to add to the already long to do list " so long city life by katherine meyer my family plans to move from the city to the suburbs this summer and i constantly wonder whether were doing the right thing were expecting a second child this fall so well need more space good schools are another factor since we cant afford to go private i also dream of a yard with a jungle gym for the kids as well as a spacious basement playroom the trade offs are huge right now we live close enough to the office to bring our son to a nearby baby sitter this wont be possible after we move and our commute stretches to over an hour well have to find local day care or a nanny ill also see my kids two hours less each day a longer commute will mean less time for hitting the gym running errands or seeing friends plus no more walking to shops or restaurants i know a lot of urbanites who scoff at the suburbs but i have fond memories of growing up in a suburban town and want the same for my kids still i admit to some doubt about whether its worth the trade offs if you made a similar move what was your experience readers say "i was born and raised in new york city left when i was to live in the suburbs three kids later it was a good move we have a one acre lot with woods and wildlife the kids love it they play outside at every opportunity " "in my view the commute is never worth it kids can find a playground anywhere " write thejuggle wsj com
