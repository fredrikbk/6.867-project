wal mart sneezes china catches cold retailers clothing slump leaves factories scurrying to find new customers shanghai several months ago chinese clothing executive shao zhuliang got bad news from his u s agent wal mart stores inc his biggest customer wouldnt be placing any orders for the spring season now mr shao says he is scrambling to line up other buyers from europe japan and south korea to keep production lines running this summer at boshan linar garments co in eastern chinas shandong province wal mart "said they had inventory piled up over there " says mr shao who heads boshans sales department "its always hard to make money from wal mart orders but without them we are finished " a softer u s economy rising gasoline prices and business miscues have left the worlds largest retailer with a growing amount of unsold goods in its stores including about &# billion worth of clothes and home decor products with about of wal marts revenue coming from apparel the excess has several analysts trimming profit estimates for this year by as much as five cents a share and as wal mart struggles to pare down stocks and get sales growth back on track at its u s stores some of the companys suppliers in china are feeling the pinch "wal mart is no different from any other retailer going through a tough time " says marc compagnon an executive director at li &amp fung ltd one of the worlds largest apparel sourcing firms which matches retailers with manufacturers "anyone doing business with a retailer having trouble is going to suffer the consequences " mr compagnon who is based in hong kong says that about to of the worlds garments are made in china production of the remainder is scattered among countries in asia latin america and elsewhere it is difficult to tell how much of the cutbacks at boshan and some other chinese companies that supply wal mart are related to the companys inventory pile up and what orders are simply being shifted to firms with lower production costs or different capabilities wal mart did not respond to requests for comment boshans challenges are a sign of the risks to chinas companies and its economy if u s consumer spending slows sharply about of all chinese exports go to the u s its biggest overseas market wal mart imported &# billion in goods from china in and chinese economic growth remains highly dependent on exports by labor intensive manufacturing industries but government officials are working to stimulate domestic demand to lessen reliance on sales abroad china is likely to weather all but the most extreme of slowdowns many economists say but the fallout from wal marts problems shows how difficulties at one end of the global supply chain ripple through to the other with the potential for significant economic disruptions at least locally for boshan the warning signs started the end of last year when wal mart scaled back its order for the fall season from pieces to about mr shao says workers at boshans factory in zibo a city of four million are now sewing denim womens shirts the last of which will be delivered to wal mart in september and thats it "they used to buy so much we had to devote nearly all of our capacity to them " says mr shao last year wal mart accounted for of the companys business "it will be impossible to find substitutes easily or quickly " mr shao says so far mr shao says he has received orders from british retailer tesco plc and conglomerates from south korea and japan boshan employs about people in zibo roughly miles from wal marts bentonville ark headquarters many mr shao says could lose their jobs or see their pay fall if the company cant win enough other business lu keqin a seamstress and workshop supervisor says seamstresses earn an average of &# a month the result of a piece work rate of about cents for each garment they sew "people want to work here because its a big company theres not much work to do at the small factories nearby " ms lu says ms lu whose daughter is due to start university this year says "i dont want my salary to be affected " analysts have blamed much of the slowdown in wal marts apparel sales on the failure so far of the companys strategy to design and market more expensive and fashionable clothing wal mart last year sharply cut the number of u s stores carrying its metro clothing line and recently pulled its first designer line george m e by mark eisen from several hundred stores that carried it according to a person close to the situation susan floyd a wal mart shopper in chandler ariz says she noticed earlier this year george m e wasnt selling and "i just waited until they went on sale " recently she grabbed a george m e gold foil embossed leather jacket originally priced at &# for &# and a pair of slacks for just &# but evidence from chinese manufacturers suggests the chains problems may not be confined to higher end clothing one manufacturer of pajama pants zhejiang furun co says it was selling about &# million in clothing a year to wal mart until this year when orders ceased chen jiayong a manager at nanjing yongxin fashion co in jiangsu province north of shanghai says his company is finishing up the last order in its pipeline for wal mart now cotton coats that will sell for about &# thats less than of last years order and the company stands to lose about &# in revenue this year mr chen says nanjing yongxin is also feeling pressure from the appreciation of the chinese currency the yuan whose value has risen by since mid "not only wal mart but many other customers in europe and america canceled orders this year " mr chen says the lost orders totaled about &# million yan erhao manager of weifang zuo bang garment co in shandong province says his person company lost its wal mart business last year and is still struggling to find other customers last summer the retailer canceled its orders for the mens casual shirts that weifang had been delivering for years "the buyer said
