china must start playing by the basic rules of free trade contrary to matthew slaughters assertion "yuan worries " editorial page may the vast majority of economists agree that a floating currency is an important tenet of free trade floating currencies alleviate the destabilizing effects of large imbalances in trade undervaluation of the yuan makes chinas exports to the united states cheaper and u s exports to china more expensive putting american companies who play by the rules at a significant price disadvantage as a member of the world trade organization china has an obligation to its global trading partners to play by the rules not just when they benefit china for those of us who believe in free trade chinas continued failure to play fairly makes it impossible to convince americans that free trade is in our interests and it leaves congress no choice but to act those of us moving in this direction are defending free trade those who are blindly opposing these efforts only serve to undermine the fragile consensus for free trade sens max baucus charles grassley lindsey graham and i are working on a measure within the framework of the wto that will push the chinese to start playing by the basic rules of free trade sen charles e schumer d n y chairman joint economic committee washington mr slaughters carefully crafted argument that china is not manipulating its currency for benefit simply repeats the tired talking points found in many other recent commentaries like others before him he asks us to believe the yuan floats against european currencies the obvious academic question then is "would those current exchange rates remain unchanged if china today allowed its yuan to float against the u s dollar " if not the yuan is actually no more "floating" against the euro than our social security dollars are in a "lock box " mr slaughter also ignores a huge economic distortion that results from this artificial devaluation of the yuan in order to suppress the yuans value against the dollar china must maintain an entirely inelastic demand for u s treasuries yield is irrelevant in this system we see this in low long term bond yields and is a significant cause of yield curve inversion and flattening commodity and energy prices have soared over the past three years yet year bond yields are some of the lowest in years good news for some not for others but either way a significant distortion finally the u s has already completed the litmus test on "market economy" and determined that chinas is such an animal and subject to the tariff actions already taken against it if it is a market economy chinas tightly managed and targeted at the u s exchange rate clearly violates requirements of wto membership and for those who feel we are beneficiaries of this exchange rate and its resulting cheap imported goods lets devalue the u s dollar tomorrow against european currencies and see how fortunate they feel l w piastrelli barrington hills ill
