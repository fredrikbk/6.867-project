market in a slump the state is taking the lead in tackling one of the booms more onerous legacies sky high property taxes in mid june the florida legislature plans to convene a special session that could pave the way for more than &# billion in property tax relief over the next five years thats by far the largest among the similar tax breaks some states are adopting amid a backlash by disgruntled property owners reducing property tax revenues would be painful for the cities and counties that depend on them to fill their coffers but by leaving taxpayers with more money to spend a property tax cut could stimulate the economy of a state that has become the epicenter of the housing bust "we can send a sonic boom through floridas economy " florida gov charlie crist a republican said at a miami town hall meeting on property taxes earlier this month "we must provide relief to floridians " across the nation the rise in home values in recent years has boosted property tax bills sharply the average annual property tax burden in the u s stood at &# per person in up from in inflation adjusted terms according to data from the commerce department residents of wyoming and washington d c saw the largest rises their tax bills went up by and respectively new jersey had the nations biggest property tax bills at &# per capita up from in many areas housing prices in recent years rose too quickly for local tax assessors to keep pace with them now tax assessments are catching up just as market prices are slumping responding to an outcry from taxpayers politicians in some states have come up with plans to ease the pain this year alone new jersey new york indiana and montana have cut property taxes in one way or another says david brunori professor of public policy at george washington university and vice president of tax analysts a nonprofit tax information company in falls church va pennsylvania did the same last year none of those measures however compares in size and scope to floridas "this is the biggest tax break being considered anywhere since proposition in california " says prof brunori referring to the initiative that radically slashed property taxes in that state floridas legislature is considering various plans that aim not only to cut taxes but also to change a system that many regard as unfair much like california florida protects existing homeowners effectively capping the amount that their property taxes can rise from year to year as house prices have more than doubled in florida over the past five years the system has shifted the tax burden onto people who dont enjoy the same protection new homeowners business owners real estate investors people with second homes and "snowbirds " nonresidents who have vacation homes in the state as of such property owners accounted for about of floridas property tax revenues if all florida property owners were taxed the same way those who lack protection under the current system would account for less than according to data from the state legislatures joint select committee on property tax reform in certain cases homeowners annual property tax bills can be up to times as high as those of neighbors in similar houses "people are just getting hammered " say miami democrat dan gelber minority leader in the florida house of representatives he estimates that if he moved into an almost identical home across the street in his miami beach neighborhood his annual property tax bill would jump to more than &# from its current &# among the most ardent proponents of reforming the tax system are floridas real estate agents who have suffered a huge drop in business as home sales in the state have plummeted they hope a big tax break will bring them business from longtime homeowners who have avoided moving into new homes for fear of losing their protected tax status "i think it would cause a second boom " says craig beggins president of century beggins enterprises a real estate agency based in tampa bay "i know a lot of people who would like to sell their house and move up to another home " he said he had recently organized an email campaign to urge local politicians to support tax reform a bigger question is how the tax break would affect the broader florida economy which is still expanding but faces some strong headwinds in addition to a drought threatening the states agriculture and the risks posed by the impending hurricane season florida is far more exposed to the housing downturn than other states for one builders put up many more homes in florida during the housing boom than its families needed that glut is now triggering a steep drop in construction which accounts for about of the state economy as of the last quarter of housing starts were down almost by half from a year earlier and economists are predicting sharp drops in construction activity and employment beyond that as floridas house prices stagnate and even decline from extremely high levels homeowners are likely to feel poorer and cut their spending accordingly in a recent research report economists at goldman sachs in new york estimated that homes in florida still are more than overvalued and prices are likely to fall by to this year alone economists doubt a tax break by itself would be enough to turn around the states economy if the negative forces combine to tip it into recession but it could make a difference at the margin giving consumers some extra spending money to offset the effects of falling house prices "it definitely will help " says amy baker chief economist at the florida legislature "but its not likely to spur economic revival " though consumers would benefit the flip side would be some severe belt tightening for municipalities florida doesnt have a personal income tax and its cities and counties depend heavily on property taxes to pay for services such as police and firefighters miami dade county manager george burgess called the proposed tax reform "potentially catastrophic for county and local governments " overall though the property tax revenue of floridas city and county governments has been rising at a rate much faster than the states population a trend that critics see as a sign of a bloated bureaucracy in the state collected &# billion in property taxes almost double the level of over the same period the states population grew by about "its as much a spending problem as it is a property tax problem " said dominic calabro president of florida taxwatch a nonpartisan watchdog group in tallahassee "the idea is to put local governments on a healthy diet so they can grow but grow along with the economy "
