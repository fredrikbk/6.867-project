the middle seat why flights are getting longer planes are faster and navigation better but airlines are padding schedules even more as congestion worsens it takes minutes longer to fly from new york to los angeles today than it did years ago and not because the head winds are stronger or the continental u s stretched itself wider dallas houston is now an hour long flight instead of minutes united airlines p m departure from philadelphia to san francisco is scheduled for more minutes than it was years ago new york washington flights now get blocked out at almost two hours even though you can fly it in about minutes travel delays get lots of attention for the pain of being trapped for hours the inconvenience of missed connections and late arrivals and the cost about a half million u s flights arrived late last year and this summer may see record levels of delays officials say estimates peg the cost at roughly &# billion a year for airlines and more than &# billion a year for passengers in terms of the value of time lost but thats only part of the problem many delays are now simply being incorporated into schedules at high cost to consumers and airlines congestion at airports and in the sky have forced airlines to pad their schedules more than ever so flights have a better chance of arriving "on time " which the department of transportation defines as within minutes of the airlines scheduled arrival time flights now arrive technically "on time " but with minutes or more of delay written into the flight plan a check of two dozen flights from june airline schedules found that "block times" the time airlines allot in their schedules for the trip are about higher than they were in june that kind of slowdown makes trips less productive for travelers with more time spent sitting and waiting it can also frustrate travelers who arrive "early" on days when there arent slowdowns only to wait for a gate to open at the scheduled arrival time even though some of todays airplanes cruise faster than the models they have replaced and are equipped with advanced navigation systems capable of flying the shortest route between two distant points airlines have had little opportunity to take advantage of those improvements congestion in the sky and high fuel prices often slow down the cruise speed of planes a lack of modern equipment for air traffic controllers means planes still fly from one radio beacon on the ground to another hop scotching across the country instead of flying shorter more direct paths experts say congested airports need more runways and the modernization program that the federal aviation administration has embarked on should eventually help speed up air travel but "itll probably get worse before it gets better " said russell chew former operating chief at the faa who recently became chief operating officer at jetblue airways corp faa administrator marion blakey says the modernization program is already producing improvements new navigation routes have been added for the dallas fort worth and atlanta airports for example using advanced navigation technology thats allowed more than takeoffs or landings per hour at each big airport she said "were creating more lanes in limited airspace " she said and that means planes move faster eventually consider the mess for flights between new yorks kennedy airport and washingtons reagan national airport with congestion slowing jfk to a crawl most days delta air lines inc now schedules its p m flight with a comair regional jet at one hour minutes but in june trans world airlines had an p m departure on that route with a turboprop airplane scheduled for from gate to gate it takes the faster plane minutes longer and it isnt just the northeast corridor that is seeing the air slowdown northwest airlines corp has added nine minutes to the length of an evening detroit phoenix trip houston raleigh durham in the evening now takes minutes longer than in according to continental airlines inc s schedule the first flight of the day from salt lake city to seattle for southwest airlines co now is scheduled minutes longer than it was years ago southwest runs shuttle service between dallas and houston that for many years was scheduled at minutes gate to gate now those flights are blocked at one hour about two years ago southwest stretched its operating day minutes flights started a bit earlier and shut down for the night a bit later to increase block times without buying more airplanes said alex heinold a lead planner in southwests scheduling department the airline bases its block times on a two year historical record for each flight "delays get baked into our history " mr heinold said airlines hate adding minutes to their schedules because they cost millions pilot and flight attendant costs increase since many are paid based on scheduled time maintenance costs rise since many functions are based on how many hours that engines and airplanes are in service inefficient schedules can even mean more planes are needed to fly the same schedule for southwest to avoid elongating its day two years ago the airline would have had to add eight to airplanes mr heinold said to save fuel and speed up flights southwest decided this month to begin equipping all of its planes with an advanced navigation system that will allow more direct routings to runways part of the faas modernization effort alaska air group inc pioneered use of the technology in alaska where bad weather at airports without precision landing systems often forces flights to divert to other airports the new technology onboard airplanes helped alaska avoid flight diversions last year the faas ms blakey said now the program is spreading to the continental u s "were getting there " ms blakey said "but theres a lot more to be done " extra padding airlines keep adding minutes to the scheduled length of flights some reasons increasing congestion at airports and in the sky high fuel prices are forcing airlines to slow cruising speeds to save money lack of modern equipment for air traffic controllers prevents flights from taking the most direct routes
