the evening wrap ultimate accountability online edition a chinese regulator has been sentenced pay the ultimate price for failing to protect the integrity of the countrys food and medicine but as dramatic as his fate appears a new recall system may offer the more significant development zheng xiaoyu formerly the top food and drug safety administrator in china was today sentenced to death by a court in beijing for receiving bribes of cash and gifts worth at least &# from eight drug makers that were seeking swift approval to bring their medications to the market such a penalty for a misbehaving regulator appears stunningly severe but the court declared that its decision was justified by the "huge amount of bribes involved and the great damage inflicted on the country and the public by zhengs dereliction of duty " the court found mr zheng years old failed to make "careful arrangements for the supervision of medicine production which is of critical importance to peoples lives " according to the xinhua news agency during his term the state food and drug administration approved a number of medicines that turned out to be fakes some of them lethal one antibiotic was blamed for the deaths of at least patients last year before being withdrawn china is pursuing corruption cases with vigor also today officials linked to one of chinas worst cases of lead poisoning were disciplined to be certain none faced as sharp a penalty as mr zheng who is the first official of his rank to be condemned to die since the deputy governor of anhui province wang huaizhong was put to death in for corruption he is allowed to appeal but his plans are unclear the severe sentence demonstrates how seriously china is taking the increasing crisis of confidence over its food and medicine at home and abroad "the chinese government attaches great importance to the safety and security of food " foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said at a news conference "we stand ready to work with the international community to safeguard the quality and reputation of the chinese food industry " grave suspicions about chinas food exports erupted in march after contaminated wheat flour

the delegation for new food safety measures like a registry of companies exporting food to the u s china today unveiled plans to set up a national food recall system though that was almost five years after passage of a law indicating the need for such an avenue wu jianping director of chinas food production and supervision department said the sweeping plan would apply to all producers in the country foreign and domestic and will focus on "potentially dangerous and unapproved food products " but it remains to be seen how effective the recall system will be in preventing future food crises according to some reports as many as a third of chinas food producers dont have a license increasing the odds that a contaminated product will slide through the fingers of regulators meanwhile american consumers who watched thousands of cats and dogs die amid the last contamination episode may be reluctant to knowingly buy chinese made food again and may be more inclined to support
