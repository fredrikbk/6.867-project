bp venture loses suit over gas field license reuters news service russia moved closer to stripping tnk bp half owned by bp plc of its license for the giant kovykta gas field after authorities won a court case a judge in an arbitration court in irkutsk the region in east siberia where the field is located said he ruled to throw out a suit by tnk bp which was seeking to stop the officials from taking away the license held by its rusia petroleum subsidiary judge valery titov said it was "out of our jurisdiction to review the submitted documents " the protracted battle for the kovykta field which has enough reserves to supply the world with gas for almost a year is seen by many analysts as part of a kremlin drive to consolidate major energy resources under state control it has also been interpreted as state pressure on the group of billionaires who own the other half of tnk bp to sell out to a kremlin controlled firm which would become bps partner "we are disappointed by the courts decision i think rusia petroleum will appeal " said alexander shadrin tnk bps spokesman
