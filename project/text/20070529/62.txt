pension crash landing when congress passed a broad pension reform last year prodding companies to get their retirement programs in order it seemed too good to be true now we know it was thats the lesson of an amazing bit of corporate welfare the senate tucked into the iraq war supplemental last week last years bill included a hard fought political compromise carriers that agreed to a "hard freeze" of their pension plans would be allowed to use a higher interest rate in calculating their plans which would reduce their net liabilities the idea was to discourage airlines from buying union peace by running up their pension tabs which they might later dump on taxpayers a few airlines such as northwest and delta took this medicine their competitors namely american and continental headed back to the beltway and last week their lobbying blew apart last years compromise under the senates backroom fix the airlines can use a higher interest rate even if they promise higher pension benefits the airlines claim this is about "leveling the playing field " which makes little sense because american and continental could have accepted the same rules all along this is about giving those two a competitive advantage over other airlines that have already agreed to play by the reform rules the taxpayer backed pension benefit guaranty corp is obliged to bail out any company that cant meet its pension obligations so there is once again little reason for these airlines to practice any pension restraint the pbgc conservatively estimates that this airline fixeroo will result in an additional &# billion in underfunded pension obligations over the next years no senator is taking credit for this pension earmark though wed note that both continental and american hail from the great state of texas meanwhile the architects of the provision were nothing if not clever by including this in a war supplemental they made it veto proof see related letter "letters to the editor smoother flight plan for airline pensions" wsj june
