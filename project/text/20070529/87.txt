the cartel that gives us tv filth and gore it is not often one reads the wall street journal editorial page upbraiding a free market but that is precisely what happened with your may editorial "fcc tv " which woefully misses the mark on the issue of the fccs desire to bring consumer choice to cable television after dismissively addressing violent television content the near epidemic growth of which is inflicting long term irreversible harm on children according to the social and medical science communities you went on to deride the most simple and fair minded solution for graphic content on cable tv allowing the customer not the seller of cable programming to determine what he she buys first in arguing that "it a la carte cable would constitute an unwarranted attempt by the government to dictate a private sector business model " you give the cable industry far too much credit for participating in a bona fide competitive business model but that is a fiction the cozy relationship between programmer and distributor one that comfortably conceals them from the votes of the marketplace and yields annual price increases that are several times the rate of inflation would be exposed for the unseemly cartel it truly is second suggesting that parents can deal with tvs filth and gore by using blocking gadgets and software all of which rely on deeply flawed program ratings that the networks inaccurately assign to their own programs misses a critical point why are parents forced to buy the filth and gore even if they chose to or can figure out how to block it for that matter why are the of households without children forced to buy disney and nickelodeon or why are non sports fans forced to pay for a half dozen espn and fox sports channels third you suggest no connection between a network and the violent programs it airs i think most families understand the difference between violence like "sharks and lions feeding" as noted by the journal and say a criminal gang member holding a pistol to a police captains head and forcing him to fellate him or a torture scene where a botox needle is injected into a mans groin or a wife being graphically raped by her estranged husband each of these three examples was taken from a different television program that airs on the same basic cable network fx the connection between a network and the types of violence it airs would be abundantly clear to the customer the cable and programming industry answer and so it would seem your answer is to tell us this is the way the "business model" works but would it be a workable business model if your readers were forced to purchase cosmopolitan and ranger rick magazines and vice versa of course not and fortunately a number of lawmakers and fcc chairman kevin martin know this they know that an open market between the buyer and the seller always has and always will yield the best results tim winter president parents television council alexandria va
