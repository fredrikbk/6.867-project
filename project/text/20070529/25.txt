congoleum is floored one of the bigger asbestos litigation scams may have ended this month when a new jersey judge ruled that insurers wont have to pay claims in the high profile congoleum bankruptcy this could be the stake in the heart of "prepackaged" asbestos bankruptcies which is great news for business the judicial system and seriously ill asbestos plaintiffs credit goes to middlesex county superior court judge nicholas stroumtsos jr who spent seven months digging into congoleums gory details a maker of floor materials congoleum is one of many companies trying to escape its asbestos woes by engineering a "prepackaged" bankruptcy while there is nothing wrong with "prepacks" generally the tort bar long ago turned the asbestos versions into self enrichment schemes in this case congoleum joined forces with its former enemies in the plaintiffs bar including the notorious joe rice and perry weitz they designed a deal in which congoleum would preserve its equity while the lawyers would make millions off dubious asbestos claims and insurers got stuck with the bills the schemers presented their plan to a federal bankruptcy court expecting the judge to bless this ripoff as other judges had in other cases instead the insurers pushed back in court and the congoleum caper began to unravel our kimberley strassel exposed the legal details in april in january federal bankruptcy judge kathryn ferguson threw out the plan ruling it gave special treatment to certain plaintiffs and their lawyers but the insurers real coup was getting the question of their liability heard before a state court unlike federal court which considered if congoleum and its tort bar soulmates had violated bankruptcy law judge stroumtsos had the freedom to look at the big picture his ruling exposed the deals entrails to public view finding that the plan was "unreasonable " had not been made in "good faith" and that insurers need not pay the judge found that congoleum and the lawyers crafted a &# billion bankruptcy plan while purposely keeping insurers in the dark about their plans that messrs rice and weitz demanded a "few million" dollars as a "payoff" for devising the plan in addition to the millions theyd get in the settlement that the firm that congoleum hired to vet asbestos claims was once owned by mr rices paralegal and that at least one of the law firms was representing both congoleum and those suing congoleum a clear conflict of interest the judges ruling serves as a warning to other companies contemplating "prepack" collusion with the tort bar and its notable that no such bankruptcies have been filed in some time congoleum now has little choice but to start over with a bankruptcy plan that is fair to all parties such a plan would require insurers to pay only legitimate claims truly sick asbestos claimants would also go to the front of the line rather than giving priority to the healthy clients of messrs rice and weitz the only real losers here are the trial lawyers who for a change have had one of their scams exposed and shut down its a shame they wont be disbarred
