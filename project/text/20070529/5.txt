another iranian milestone in the u s national intelligence estimate predicted that iran would be unable to produce sufficient quantities of weapons grade uranium until "early to mid next decade " last week the international atomic energy agency iaea reported that iran was operating centrifuges up from just last year and could be operating as many as within a month thats enough to produce one bombs worth of uranium every year so much for another cia "slam dunk " the iaea probably understates the speed at which the iranians are likely to make progress at the current rate at which they are adding capacity they are expected to have centrifuges by december enough to produce several bombs worth of weapons grade uranium a year the report also notes that "iran has not agreed to any of the required transparency measures" demanded by the nuclear watchdog and should put to rest the illusion that we can take our sweet diplomatic time dealing with irans nuclear file time is now on mahmoud ahmadinejads side one would hardly know this by watching the bush administration "we will work with our european partners to develop further sanctions " president bush said thursday though our sources say the u s is unlikely even to develop a list of new sanctions until next months g summit in germany and who knows how many weeks it will take after that to agree to a new u n resolution as it is iran has for nine months been in material breach of a binding u n resolution requiring that it suspend its enrichment programs the most the security council has been able to agree on are limited sanctions on a handful of iranian individuals and companies known to be directly involved with irans nuclear and ballistic missile programs with neither russia nor china inclined to impose much less honor any kind of effective sanctions regime dont look to the u n for much progress the state department has also been seeking none too subtly to find ways to engage iran directly in a diplomatic process secretary of state condoleezza rice sought discussions earlier this month with the iranian foreign minister at a regional summit in egypt she was snubbed outside the government haleh esfandiari an iranian american academic who has sought for years to build bridges with tehran "moderates " has been taken prisoner by the regime as has kian tajbakhsh of george soross open society institute yet state keeps rolling the engagement rock up the hill with u s ambassador to baghdad ryan crocker meeting yesterday with his iranian counterpart mr crocker said they agreed on "policy" toward iraq and iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki reciprocated by noting that "we are hopeful that washingtons realistic approach to the current issues of iraq by confessing its failed policy in iraq and the region and by showing a determination to changing the policy guarantees success of the talks and possible further talks " how reassuring then there is iaea director mohamad elbaradei who believes that the security councils demand that iran suspend enrichment "has been overtaken by events " and that instead iran should be required merely to cap its enrichment programs at current levels mr elbaradei is right that keeping iran from acquiring the know how needed to run an enrichment program is now moot less persuasive is his notion that iran should be rewarded for preserving its nuclear gains which were achieved by lying to the iaea and ignoring past security council resolutions on the contrary iran should now be required in future resolutions to dismantle its enrichment facilities not that any u n proclamations are likely to have any effect on the regime in tehran are there better options weve noted that iran imports nearly half of its refined gasoline much of it via the united arab emirates german chancellor angela merkel and new french president nicolas sarkozy could demonstrate their atlanticist credentials by putting a halt to their combined &# billion in export guarantees to companies doing business with iran targeted financial penalties against key regime figures such as the plutocrat ayatollah akbar hashemi rafsanjani should also be considered along with financial support for labor unions and dissident groups the three u s aircraft carriers that recently shipped through the straits of hormuz in broad daylight are also a reminder to tehran of our ability to use force against the nuclear threat if all else fails all these steps entail risk but none compare to the risk of a nuclear iran reinforced in its power to promote instability in afghanistan iraq and lebanon with no fear of american reprisals if you dont like the look of the middle east today wait until the regions most fanatical regime gets its hands on the worlds worst weapon
