the revolutionary frenchman who banished the corset poiret king of fashion metropolitan museum of arts costume institute through aug new york smack in the middle of the metropolitan museum of arts latest fashion exhibit is a shapeless silk dress so plain that its one dimensional silhouette makes it seem at first glance like a basic nightgown even its shade of blue not truly navy not quite complex enough to earn the "prussian" label exudes the mundane and yet this chemise is currently being celebrated as the very essence of revolution its designer paul poiret is far from a household name these days but the french couturier who rose to fame before world war i is widely credited with being the father of modern fashion famous for unshackling women from the confines of corsets in with the introduction of drapey dresses and also for splashing fashions largely sober palette with bold color mr poiret provoked a seachange in style in fact his silhouettes that emphasized fluid straight lines laid the groundwork for such still famous modern spreaders of the "less is more" creed as coco chanel now in what fashion historians say is the largest assemblage of his work in more than years ensembles are on display in "poiret king of fashion " at the mets costume institute the exhibit offers an enchanting experience against handpainted backdrops of lush watery greenery done by the paris based opera set designer jean hugues de chatillon mr poirets frocks and velvet coats are shown draped on mannequins captured mid fete silk tunics and billowing gold lame pants that he created for his legendary persian themed "the thousand and second night" ball in paris on june are staged before painted twinkling lanterns in a blackened garden setting girlish white day dresses are displayed in a diorama bathed in faux sunlight poirets captivation by the "orientalist" harem style costumes of the ballets russes and the design aesthetics of the far east is evident in many pieces one remarkable lampshade style kimono sleeved "sorbet" tunic is perched on a mannequin frozen in mid dance these pieces dont exist just as clothing they offer a glimpse into the relationship of the designer and his muse denise who married him in and left him in he shuttered his business the following year and died a pauper in many of the exhibits clothes had been seen only by friends and family of the couple they were discovered in by the poirets granddaughter sophie who opened up three trunks in a family attic and found them stuffed to the brim with denises clothing the costume institute acquired more than of the items in a auction of this private collection among them are three cotton and silk grecian style nightdresses that look so of the moment one could swear theyve made recent appearances on a red carpet somewhere before opening his own atelier in mr poiret got his start in fashion working for jacques doucet and the house of worth two of the most important couturiers in paris at the turn of the last century and his training shows in the exquisite details of some pieces his silk tulle "theatre des champs elysees" dress comes circled with a delicate ring of rhinestones a seafoam silk and lame gown is encrusted with massive coral turquoise and silver beads mr poirets success eventually was eclipsed by ms chanels as he continued to churn out flamboyant designs while she created minimalist ones in fact he famously asked a black clad ms chanel in the s "for whom madame do you mourn " her answer "for you monsieur " before his business unraveled however mr poiret was an entrepreneur ahead of his time historians say he was the first designer to be a life style brand branching out into selling perfume and accessories such as hats a bold business move then thats since become de rigueur some of these pieces including elaborately designed perfume flacons are also on display and while using celebrity connections to sell clothes feels like a st century invention mr poiret had that tactic down pat a hundred years ago he counted popular actresses gabrielle rejane and sarah bernhardt among his friends and outfitted them for parties in his gowns in many fashion exhibits clothes take on a static feel set up on faceless mannequins trapped behind glass not so here there are those enchanting painted backdrops for one and curators harold koda and andrew bolton have also incorporated artwork that mr poiret co created with such artists as georges lepape and paul iribe who were famous for their art deco stenciled fashion illustrations in addition they have worked video into the telling of some garments stories one video snippet is virtual origami in motion showing how mr poiret took a single long piece of velvet and made his wrap style "paris" coat which ended up being one of his most famous creations but what truly stands out in this exhibit is the unfussy silhouettes mr poiret dreamed up the chemise dress while simple was a striking departure from the fashions it preceded mr poirets other innovations included the "hobble" skirt named for its narrow cut that restricted the wearers movement and also coats and day dresses that cocooned the female form in a sack like covering a look that now feels fresh and sensual even given the tidal wave of hyper sexy super revealing look at me fashions that have been ubiquitous of late when britney spearss latest ensemble for running errands is basically a bra and boyshorts paired with a mesh dress and ripped fishnet tights mr poirets concealed baggy looks with a loungey sex appeal point the way to a welcome alternative could mr poiret be as revolutionary today as he was a century ago perhaps designers from christian lacroix to nicolas ghesquiere of balenciaga which helped underwrite the exhibit have credited him as an inspiration for recent collections the auction provided a flurry of excitement in fact some of mr poirets pieces on display bear striking resemblances in cut and color to dresses more recently seen on european and american runways one columned red and navy blue day dress looks so contemporary it could be hot off a marc jacobs spring rack now if only ms spears would take notice ms tan is a fashion reporter for the journal
