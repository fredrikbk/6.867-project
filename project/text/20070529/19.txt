business technology for it dull sounds pretty good forecasts called for a grimmer year companies are still spending nearly halfway through growth in u s corporations spending on technology is shaping up to be tepid and that may be good news the outlook had appeared grimmer after all to some tech market watchers who see tech spending as an indicator for how well big industry players such as international business machines corp hewlett packard co and intel corp will do forecasters had previously projected that companies would drastically slow tech spending this year as the u s economy decelerated forrester research for one at one point estimated u s corporate spending on information technology or it would grow just to this year down from growth of about to last year instead corporate it buyers say they are still opening their wallets this year even if they arent increasing their spending lavishly trugreen landcare a commercial landscape maintenance provider owned by servicemaster co may be typical it plans to increase its spending on tech this year just as it has done every year since says mark mills trugreens chief information officer the tennessee company which last year had a &# million it budget plans to spend mostly on new management software that helps companies improve business processes such as quickly transferring information about a sale mr mills says he expects trugreen which has employees to increase its it budget in as well such steady if unspectacular increases are likely to contribute to overall growth in u s tech spending of between and this year say research firms such as idc and forrester and investment bank goldman sachs group inc while that is slightly weaker than last year and is still far off the double digit tech spending growth rates of the late s it isnt shaping up to be the doomsday scenario this year that some forecasters had predicted tech spending "is holding up but its dull " says laura conigliaro an analyst at goldman sachs some clear trends are emerging as to where the money is going for example many it buyers say they are buying technology this year that will help beef up it security and upgrade their corporate networks according to a citigroup survey of u s chief information officers or cios released last week of respondents said their top priority it project was improving security followed by tasks such as consolidating server computers and deploying new software to help with specific business tasks ray barnard executive vice president and cio of fluor corp says his company increased its tech budget this year for the first time since in order to add new servers and beef up it security as the dallas engineering procurement and construction concern expands its business for the past four years mr barnard says he has worked with an annual it budget of &# million to &# million this year he says the company will increase that by "business is booming " says mr barnard "what were focused on is global expansion to meet our customers demand " fluors annual revenue has increased more than to just over &# billion since and the company has expanded to countries from countries since fluor which has more than employees plans to spend the new it funds on "blade" servers from dell inc as well as adding global security services from dell and ibm and buying some new pcs says mr barnard blade servers are thin standard size computers that fit into computer racks like books in a bookcase ms conigliaro of goldman sachs says there is still reason to be cautious on the tech environment when tech firms reported their most recent quarterly earnings last month and earlier this month several companies such as sun microsystems inc and ibm made comments suggesting they saw weakness in the u s market indeed some corporate it buyers say they arent increasing their level of it spending this year at all health care provider marshfield clinic is keeping its spending on it level says joe brickweg director of infrastructure at the wisconsin company while he didnt disclose his it budget mr brickweg says marshfield isnt altering its tech spending because it just completed a major investment in a five year project to consolidate its phone system vimal thomas cio at the u s office of musical instrument maker yamaha corp says his company plans to increase its it spending by this year after keeping it flat for the past several years mr thomas who declined to give underlying figures says he plans to upgrade the companys phone system using voip or voice over internet protocol and will change to a new email system from microsoft corp among other things while he had meant to do some of these upgrades last year mr thomas says he postponed the work because "of the tough business environment we were in " including issues like high oil prices and labor costs to attract good it people this year he says he decided not to hold off any longer because yamahas existing
