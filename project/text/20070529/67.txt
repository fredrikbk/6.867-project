playing cellphones on stage has ring of respectability bora yoons music career takes a high tech turn listening for a special pong bora yoon plays a mean electric violin and has a light touch on the glockenspiel the year old contemporary classical musician can jam out on a cellphone too midway through a recent concert in downtown manhattan she flipped open a samsung phone held it up against a microphone and began tapping intensely on the keys she wasnt making a call but rather stringing together a precise series of notes that make up her mobile phone composition "plinko " cellphones are a notorious audience distraction at musical performances ringing buzzing and beeping and giving conductors fits but for some avant garde electronic artists cellphones themselves are musical instruments that can be incorporated into rock hip hop and even modern classical music household items like washboards saws and buckets have found their place in music and electronic instruments that once seemed gimmicky like turntables and laptops are going mainstream so why not cellphones some musicians have already taken cellphone music to an extreme an austrian rock band called the handydandy named itself after the german term for mobile phone handy the band which performs at electronic arts festivals in europe and elsewhere has done away with ordinary instruments altogether each member of the quintet straps a sony ericsson handset around his neck like a guitar and taps away on the buttons making all the facial and bodily contortions of an eric clapton or carlos santana while producing very different results the groups cellphones sometimes attached to styrofoam cutouts shaped like guitars are linked wirelessly to laptops a few steps away pressing keys triggers the nearby computers to play a cacophony of distorted sounds and digital beats the group refers to its cellphone powered blur of electronic noise as "bluetooth rock " a reference to the popular wireless technology some aspiring djs and hip hop artists are beginning to experiment with cellphones too in the town of slough west of london a youth center recently began a workshop on "mobile mashups " using cellphones equipped with special mixing software students with stage names like mc panicphaze learn to splice pieces of existing tunes add all sorts of electronic effects and record rap vocals on top tina palmer a pop musician who started the classes for the slough young peoples centre says low income residents in the borough cant afford expensive turntables or laptops with fancy mixing software for them souped up cellphones are the next best thing the slough cellphone program is going national this year through other youth centers the chicago sinfonietta kicked off its th season last fall with a "concertino for cellphones and orchestra " a piece built around ringtones amplified phones onstage were programmed to play short classical motifs by brahms and other composers the orchestra would pick up on the themes and play along meanwhile the conductor got the audience involved when a green light flashed onstage the crowd downstairs was instructed to switch on their ringtones and fiddle with the volume when a red light flashed concertgoers in the balcony did the same some experts say cellphones are a natural instrument because the same internal synthesizer that blasts annoying jingles at inopportune moments can also be manipulated for aesthetic purposes "im surprised cellphones are emerging like this but there isnt any reason they shouldnt " says geoffrey wright director of the computer music program at johns hopkins universitys peabody institute one of the nations best known music schools theres even a small technology industry emerging mostly in the united kingdom and elsewhere in europe to serve the needs of mobile phone musicians the phones and other hand held devices the slough youth center uses for example come equipped with software called minimixa made by the tao group it turns a cellphone into a tiny sound mixer and recording studio ms yoon a chicagoan took up piano at the age of and went on to study classical violin and choral singing after studying music in new york at ithaca college and making recordings that melded classical music and some of her original songwriting she got serious about electronic music and she began to experiment with unorthodox instruments including the melodica and tibetan singing bowls the cellphone caught her ear for its "old school and wonderfully dated" timbre she says like "youre stuck in a calculator or a digital clock from the s " she trained herself to play the cellphone hooking it up to digital effects that give it an ethereal quality echoing as though it were in a giant concert hall she learned to lay one melody over another creating harmonies and dissonant effects ms yoon has incorporated the phone into her solo act using it alongside her voice and other instruments she has also collaborated with musicians including suphala a tabla player and protege of indian legend zakir hussain and dj spooky an avant garde hip hop artist and producer she is picky about her instruments so not just any phone will do she insists on playing one particular samsung model a e which she says has a special "pong" tone reminiscent of the "ambient" sound pioneered by british musician and record producer brian eno she buys the samsung model on ebay as it gets tougher to find in stores "i need a backup supply " she says ms yoon asks her audiences to play along at her recent show she told concertgoers to whip out their phones and call each other "vociferously " to the untrained ear the resulting garbled murmur of ringtones didnt sound much like music but ms yoon says shes trying to take advantage of the fact most phones ring in the "diatonic western scale of c" and are in the same tuning as western instruments that gives some order she says to how the sounds of the phone mix with instruments on stage "weve all got a little audio source with us " ms yoon says of cellphones "its kind of fun to remember that "
