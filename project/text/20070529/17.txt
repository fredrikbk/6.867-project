buying a retirement home decades before you retire younger families are investing nest eggs in second houses the rationale is emotional retirement home sales are growing among buyers still decades away from retiring from new yorks catskill mountains to oregons rocky coast younger couples who might otherwise be focused on building a nest egg instead are buying a lakefront house or country cabin that they hope to one day use in retirement for these younger buyers this isnt an extension of the real estate investment bug that bit a few years ago and is now fading as home prices flag in many markets and theyre not throwing financial caution to the wind just because they want a second home instead theyre crunching the numbers and making hard decisions about their personal finances in some cases theyre receiving an inheritance or a stock grant and are choosing to invest in their future real estate needs rather than the stock market in other cases theyre altering their expectations about how long theyll work and the kind of returns theyll earn on their nest egg in order to pursue an emotional investment no one knows how many younger buyers are out snapping up their retirement homes but real estate agents and financial planners around the country say theyre increasingly assisting younger buyers out spending &# to &# for a house to call home in retirement partially at play is a cultural shift planners say they see among younger savers who arent content to just accumulate assets to use in retirement instead this younger generation wants to put some of its nest egg to work today as an investment in family a year ago daniel merkle and sandra bauman of glen rock n j took roughly of their retirement assets none of it coming from tax deferred accounts like their iras or k plans and bought a cottage on a hill with feet of lake frontage in athens n y in the catskill mountains "it was clear the money was better off in the index funds we owned " mr merkle says "but there are factors you cant see on a spreadsheet like the time we get with our kids building memories there " he says "we wanted to get in while it was affordable " the trade off is that the couple had to give up on the idea of retiring early "but we realized you never know what is going to happen in years and its better to enjoy it now " mr merkle says gregg yaeger a vice president at chicagos northern trust corp says he has dealt with several younger clients doing this in recent years including a year old client currently buying a retirement house on a lake in michigan "he wants this place specifically to retire " mr yaeger says "but he also wants it now as a place to build a bank of memories with his kids " the question many people face is how to afford the future today after all beyond the price of the house there is maintenance insurance taxes and other costs phillip cook a financial planner in torrance calif says he discourages his clients from pursuing this strategy because "most of the rationale is emotional and financially i think thats a mistake do you really think you know where you want to live or years from now " nevertheless people who receive an inheritance or other cash infusion are often deciding to put that money into retirement real estate instead of stocks others are pulling some of the nonretirement plan money from their nest egg either way says suzanne krasna a financial planner in walnut creek calif the bottom line is to figure out if your income can support the additional liability of this house after youve met other obligations such as building an emergency savings account contributing to a childs educational savings and fully funding your retirement plan and after accounting for your current lifestyle clients without deep pockets ms krasna says are finding ways to afford the home they want to retire to one of her clients a year old single mother recently sold her home in northern california and decided to rent instead so that she could use the cash to build a nest egg and buy the home she wants to retire to in new mexico this client ms krasna says is generating from her new mexico home &# in excess cash that she is also funneling into her retirement account the trade off because renters live there she doesnt get to spend time with her daughter at her future retirement home mr cook the planner in torrance calif says prices on retirement homes purchased in resort locations are often volatile negating the idea that the homes are an investment that doesnt mean they wont appreciate though while all real estate is susceptible to price declines unique properties such as those on a lake tend to appreciate over time at a faster rate than traditional residential real estate "because you cant just replicate these kinds of properties in a subdivision " says james donnelly vice president of j lee donnelly &amp son a bethesda md real property appraisal firm jeff page a senior director for a clinical research company says the house that he and his wife laura bought a square foot three bedroom cottage on lake gaston near the north carolina virginia border has already doubled in value in the four years theyve owned it the raleigh n c couple purchased the place when they were each years old heeding the advice of both their fathers who both advised essentially the same thing enjoy your money while youre young so from april through early september the pages and their three children spend most weekends at the lake "the house is an asset " mr page says "so its not like were throwing away part of our retirement savings " younger buyers however dont necessarily see these homes as investments they recognize that real estate has intrinsic value and that their retirement dollars remain at work in some fashion since if they do live in this house at retirement they can sell their current primary residence to supplement their retirement savings most though are like anuraj bismal and his wife ann the pair pulled money from their nest egg and bought acres and a year old farmhouse in far northeastern pennsylvania about hours from their montclair n j home because after each seeing parents die in recent years theyve come to the conclusion that "the moment is now " says mr bismal a financial executive with a major wall street firm so the bismals spend most weekends at their pennsylvania house and mr bismal expects theyll spend part of every year in retirement there "i could care less if i make &# on this place " he says "for me this is very basic i want to live my life now "
