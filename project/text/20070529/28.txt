comeback plan at morgan stanley a game of catch up to regain firms perch ceo mack pushes big bets big deals when john j mack became chief executive of morgan stanley in he was disquieted by what had become of the big securities firm he had left four years earlier the firm wasnt wagering much of its own money with big trades and investments missing wall streets latest gold mine its bankers were losing out on far too much mergers and acquisitions work "he didnt recognize the place how lumbering we had become " says paul j taubman head of global mergers and acquisitions last june after morgan stanley bankers watched the &# billion purchase of bellsouth corp by at&amp t inc from the sidelines mr mack slipped into a meeting of investment bankers and delivered a blunt impromptu speech suited for a losing team "it bothers me the way we interact with a number of our clients " he said in his north carolina drawl his unmistakable anger captured in an internal webcast "it bothers me that we take no and walk away there are people in this room embarrassing the firm this is a great firm " he said his voice rising "youve lost your swagger when we miss business i want it to ruin your day because it ruins my day " a former bond salesman nicknamed "mack the knife" for his cost cutting tendencies mr mack years old is two years into his campaign to raise morgan stanleys metabolism he wants to restore the firms reputation as a top merger adviser to make a lot more financial wagers with the firms own money and to discard some remnants of its ill fated merger with dean witter discover &amp co already he has jettisoned dean witter brokers and steered the remaining force to richer clients he plans to spin off the discover credit card business and he is pushing the firm to get into the private equity business by teaming up with big investors to buy entire companies with the intention of reaping big profits by selling them or taking them public buoyed by trading gains and more merger advisory work morgan stanley earned a record &# billion in the fiscal first quarter up from a year earlier his effort underscores a major shift in how money is being made on wall street when mr mack helped orchestrate morgan stanleys merger with brokerage giant dean witter large securities firms were infatuated with the small investors plowing oodles of money into stocks that love affair with the "little guy" soured when the stock market nose dived in leaving many small investors saddled with losses and gun shy about further trading meanwhile tens of billions of dollars were flowing into hedge funds and private equity funds private investment vehicles for institutions and the wealthy competitors such as goldman sachs group inc and lehman brothers holdings wasted little time going after these new big fish they targeted the investment funds for business and began behaving like hedge funds themselves notching huge profits wagering their own capital on everything from stocks to the price of oil but morgan stanley which was once a pioneer in investing in buyout deals was slow to respond and now lags archrival goldman mr macks big challenge is to catch up for most of its year history morgan stanley had been a leader on wall street it traces its roots to banking titan j p morgan &amp co the famed "house of morgan " when the glass steagall act of erected a wall between commercial banking and investment banking the company split in two the investment bank which can issue securities but cannot take deposits took the name morgan stanley and it was investment banker to such blue chip companies as international business machines corp and general motors corp the theory behind its &# billion merger with dean witter was that dean witters army of retail brokers would sell stocks and other products for morgan stanley bankers dean witter chief philip purcell became chairman and chief executive with mr mack his no before long it became clear to mr mack that he wouldnt get the top job anytime soon and he left in january after years at the firm later his son gave him a custom monopoly board with a "chance" card that reads "a struggle with phil purcell finds you in a dilemma at msdw should you stay or should you go you choose go " it was a troubled merger the brokerage businesses were never effectively integrated mr purcell showed little interest in investment banking and blocked proposals to use morgan stanleys money to make financial bets or to invest in private equity deals current and former morgan stanley executives complain morgan stanleys market valuation slipped from about &# billion in january to about &# billion in june a bigger drop than its main competitors as discontent from shareholders and employees mounted mr purcell stepped down that june he declined through a representative to comment mr mack grew up in mooresville n c the son of a lebanese grocer he attended duke university on a football scholarship but a neck injury ended his years on the defensive line and his financial aid to raise tuition money he took a job at a local brokerage firm in his years away from morgan stanley mr mack ran rival financial firm credit suisse group but was ousted over his support for pursuing a big merger a registered republican he supported mr bush in the last election although he recently threw his support behind democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton in mid after a short stint as chairman of pequot capital management inc a hedge fund he returned to morgan stanley to take the top job "i dont think you get too many second chances" in life says mr taubman the mergers and acquisitions chief "this was an opportunity to come back to a place desperately in need of leadership " when he arrived for work one of the first things mr mack discovered was that morgan stanley had missed the private equity boat it hadnt done much advising lending to or investing alongside buyout firms like blackstone group which can generate big fees and profits nor had it raised a u s buyout fund of its own a lucrative business for competitors like goldman he asked alan jones then head of corporate finance what had happened mr jones pushed a stack of papers toward his new boss "here are five years worth of business plans i wasnt allowed to execute " mr jones said according to people familiar with the conversation "just go do it " mr mack responded according to these people it hasnt been easy morgan stanley investment bankers wary of competing with their own clients to buy companies questioned the move some wondered if morgan stanley was getting into the private equity game too late and they worried about risk investment banks have always put their own money on the line by buying stocks and bonds from clients and by extending short term loans but the modern private equity business where deal sizes run to many billions of dollars involves taking much bigger risks bigger loans to clients and bigger direct investments mr mack argued that the move is essential to the firm the potential fees and investment profits were too big to ignore he said recently he gave employees an example merrill lynch &amp co is teaming up with buyout funds on a &# billion leveraged buyout of hospital company hca inc morgan stanley is advising hcas board a traditional investment banking role merrill will make eight to times as much money as morgan stanley he said playing catch up has been costly morgan stanley lured stephen trevor from goldman to run the new business which cost the firm more than &# million mostly to buy out mr trevors goldman stock and private equity interests according to two people familiar with the pact morgan stanley is now raising a buyout fund projected to be &# billion and has about &# billion in private equity investments by comparison goldman has a &# billion fund and has &# billion in investments to get a role in some private equity deals morgan stanley has extended risky short term loans to help buyout firms fund large transactions this exposes it to the risk that the borrower wont be able to find longer term financing potentially leaving morgan stanley with a piece of the target company during his first days on the job mr mack asked his lieutenants to draw up proposals for boosting morgan stanleys profits among their ideas investing in the financial derivatives business getting more involved in residential mortgage finance and taking more risk by trading with the firms own capital one of his first difficult decisions was what to do about the firms discover credit card operation which had been criticized as a slower growth business than the firms core ones mr purcell had decided to spin off the operation to shareholders mr mack reversed course arguing that discover provided diversification and cash flow at an internal morgan stanley meeting in the fall of henry mcvey the firms chief strategist told mr mack that discovers growth prospects were keeping a lid on the firms stock price during a business trip to china in early people familiar with the matter recall mr mack told mr mcvey "we dont need a quick fix " last summer a group of the firms top bankers known as the chairmans council gave mr mack an earful during a meeting in the firms corporate dining room several attendees recall mr taubman the mergers chief argued that discover was of no strategic importance these people say ruth porat a senior banker questioned whether morgan stanley would be better off if management focused on the firms core banking and other businesses they say "everybody was on me for discover " says mr mack including eight former executives who two years earlier had waged a public campaign to unseat mr purcell in the end mr mack was persuaded in december he proposed that the firm spin off discover which is set to take place in this years third quarter critics were also after mr mack to sell morgan stanleys brokerage operations for individual investors many of the former dean witter brokers were not as productive as their counterparts elsewhere on wall street in the unit posted a profit margin of just far below the at merrill and at citigroup inc in august mr mack recruited merrills brokerage head james gorman to run the business his challenge to change the perception that it caters to small clients in reality he says less than of the individual investor clients have assets of &# or less "we arent opening small offices in small towns " he says "in fact we are closing them " mr mack was particularly concerned about morgan stanleys investment banking franchise which had been stung by defections and was in turmoil last july one month after criticizing his investment bankers for poor salesmanship he showed them how to go after business aggressively when it appeared that morgan stanley would be left without any advisory role on the &# billion hca buyout he phoned fred gluck then an hca director he recommended morgan stanleys top merger bankers and offered mr gluck "direct access to me " hca tapped morgan stanley and credit suisse as advisers to the hospital companys board "we wanted a second point of view " mr gluck says morgan stanley earned &# million in advisory fees according to thomson financial mr mack prodded his lieutenants to stop rewarding laggards late last fall he complained to managers that proposed pay packages were "all up up up nobody is down " two people familiar with the conversation recall walid chammah who runs morgan stanleys global investment banking business spent thanksgiving weekend in the office with his deputy slashing paychecks for poor performers these people say morgan stanleys share of advising on world wide merger deals has risen this year to from during mr purcells last full year it recently won a plum assignment as co lead underwriter of blackstones &# billion initial public offering profit margins in its brokerage business have rebounded from to since mr macks return morgan stanleys stock has risen but that lagged the gain over that period in the dow jones u s select investment services index of brokerage firms and exchanges earlier this year it appeared that morgan stanley had lost out on a bid to advise private equity firm apax partners on the &# billion acquisition of chicago insurance broker hub international ltd mr chammah and a team of senior bankers that included u s insurance banking chief eric bischof showed up at apax to pitch the business once again they offered to invest alongside apax ultimately agreeing to put in up to &# million "if you turn back the clock a year " ms porat a senior banker who mobilized the team told associates "there is a good chance we may have missed a deal like this "
