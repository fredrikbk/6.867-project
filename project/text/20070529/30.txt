enterprise small firms look to derivatives trading to manage costs investments mute risk of price swings for raw materials karl fowler isnt a traditional publisher his books which chronicle major sporting events and teams can weigh more than pounds and go for as much as &# so to control the costs of the raw materials mr fowler needs to produce these hefty tomes the entrepreneur is using an equally untraditional approach for small businesses derivatives trading these sophisticated financial instruments which allow investors to hedge risks and bet on fluctuations in anything from the weather to orange juice prices might not seem relevant to a small book publisher but mr fowler cut his teeth as a derivatives trader so when he left the finance world in for book publishing it was only natural for him to apply his specialty to help insulate his british firm kraken group from rising prices for raw materials like paper ink and silk of course most entrepreneurs are unlikely to possess mr fowlers expertise yet a growing number of small business owners are using devices like derivatives to protect themselves against risks they previously considered unavoidable such as bad weather or soaring gas prices derivatives come in many forms among the most common are futures contracts which rise and fall in tandem with the value of commodities such as coffee grain or oil futures on a wide range of commodities are traded on public exchanges another type of derivative known as a forward contract is a private agreement between two parties for the future purchase or sale of something at a predetermined price using derivatives doesnt mean the buyer gets a bargain instead they mute the risk of volatile prices which can wreak havoc on small businesses whose profits hinge largely on the costs of raw materials but given their complexity and risks these investments arent for everyone experts especially caution against inexperienced derivatives users gambling on swings in commodity prices or the weather "hedging is still a sophisticated concept but its percolating down to more and more people " says robert j shiller a finance professor at yale university in new haven conn at kraken group where two of the firms employees trade derivatives full time one strategy is to buy pulp paper futures on commodities exchanges prices for paper can go up and down by more than in short periods says mr fowler years old if higher prices take a bite out of profit the company is compensated by the higher value of the futures contract ink prices tend to be even more volatile but cant be hedged by exchange traded futures so mr fowler asked an ink supplier to set up a forward contract he needed &# worth of ink he wanted only half immediately but hoped to get the rest later without haggling over prices mr fowler says the supplier was surprised by the concept but agreed he estimates that the strategy has boosted profit margins by more than because he managed to lock in low prices "when youre looking at those kinds of numbers " he says "its daft not to spend a little time" using derivatives more complex derivatives in the form of indexes whose values fluctuate based on factors like a regions temperature also are attracting interest from small businesses take robert webber who owns belle harbor car wash in queens n y people generally wash cars on sunny weekends and a string of soggy saturdays and sundays can put a serious damper on profits mr webber says his car wash was closed days last year due to rain mr webber says he got the idea of using derivatives after a conversation with his cousin a former chief executive of the chicago mercantile exchange the worlds largest derivatives marketplace but mr webber found that while plenty of derivatives deal with temperatures none focuses on rain so he decided to try to fill that void by devising a monthly index where the greater the rainfall the higher the derivatives value a business that stands to lose sales during a rainy month can make up some of its losses by holding the contract mr webber says he patented the product and is in talks with the merc about getting the derivative listed merc officials confirm that they may list the offering meanwhile some start ups are making it easy for small businesses to hedge their risks with derivatives weatherbill com launched in january offers

be complex and risky and trading can be expensive james conway jr who runs mister softee inc an ice cream truck company based in runnemede n j says he considered buying butter fat futures to protect against rising ice cream prices but he says it seemed like the futures were controlled by a few big players unlike more widely traded commodities orange juice that meant the butter fat futures ended up being more expensive for him to trade "it didnt make economic sense for us " he says kelly k spors contributed to this article
