journalistic malpractice as medical information is exploding and becoming more accessible all of us particularly physicians need objective sources to interpret data and present a balanced view unfortunately major medical journals that should be filling this role often put more weight on pushing political agendas their editorial prejudice has left a troubling void for rigorous and unbiased arbiters of medical evidence who can guide sound medical practice decisions the behavior of the new england journal of medicine nejm is a case in point when it rushed onto its web site a limited and flawed analysis of safety concerns around the diabetes drug avandia the publication was timed to get ahead of the food and drug administrations more careful evaluation of the same issues the journal seemed bent on beating the fda to the punch the goal painting the fda as impotent in order to argue for legislation winding through congress that would increase regulatory hurdles for drug approvals the journals motives were made bare by its own editorial on the matter while there are "questions" whether avandia is associated with certain heart risks so far unsupported by more rigorous randomized studies and extensive review by the fda and other authorities around the world the nejm study doesnt add much new insight into those issues because of its own limitations but you wouldnt know that from the way the journal hyped its analysis to the media or opined about the studys significance these facts werent lost on clinicians and even nejms competitors the lancet nejms british sister publication said of the study "alarmist headlines and confident declarations help nobody " a top american medical researcher told webmd "i cant help but wonder if the nejm is functioning more like the mainstream press than a scientific journal at this point " nejm said it rushed to post the study on the web because of its medical importance but the fda which would need to act on any safety issues wasnt even given a heads up about the studys publication or its findings rep henry waxman d calif however seems to have known in advance that it was coming because he issued a substantive press release immediately after the study was posted online he was even ready with the date and location of oversight hearings aimed at probing the fdas "handling" of the drug safety issues mr waxman is trying to add new restrictions to the fdas drug approvals the studys primary author cleveland clinic cardiologist steve nissen admitted to the wall street journal that he was in touch with congress while preparing his analysis three days after the study was submitted to nejm and before it was published the fda commissioner received a letter about avandia from members of the house energy and commerce committee that seemed to reference the nejm study at what cost do political machinations of the medical journals come nejm editors have long favored more drug regulation but medical journals have also historically played a special role in helping to define medical practice standards even decisions they make on how prominently to place a study let alone how they editorialize about it are seen as strong signals to clinicians on how doctors should weigh the evidence so when editors pursue a political agenda its public health that pays a price degrading an institution that doctors depend on for balanced analysis and fair minded editorial judgments isnt good for anyone in the case of the avandia study nejm editors gave short shrift to the studys flaws the paper which re analyzed the results of earlier studies of the drug found on the internet revealed that avandia might cause a small increase in the absolute risk of a heart attack but the study that the authors did called a "meta analysis" because it aggregates results from lots of studies to generate a larger sample contained a number of serious limitations among other things the authors of the nejm study based their conclusions that avandia caused a higher heart risk on just a handful of cardiac events none of which they could go back and verify because unlike the fda the authors didnt have access to confidential patient records a few heart events either way might have changed the studys findings the way data was misused by nejm will give pause to companies that agreed to more transparency around results of medical studies and who now post their clinical trial data online these shortcomings didnt stop nejm from spinning the preliminary data into the conclusion that avandia was a troubled drug mishandled by the fda and comparing it to vioxx the pain drug withdrawn by merck two years ago because it increased risk for heart attacks vioxx "represented a similar regulatory failure to insist on large trials of public health importance in a timely fashion " nejms editorial states absent was any discussion by nejm of the drugs benefits or advice from diabetes experts on how doctors should counsel their patients based on the information there have now been too many instances where one of the major medical journals has used editorial decisions about publication and placement of bottom line medical information as a tool to primarily influence political discourse rather than informing medical practice many journals still hold the line and stick to scientific standards in their decision making but face political risks themselves in declining politically minded submission tactics when it comes to the issue du jour drug safety no description of medical research in a medical journal comes close to the detail level or scrutiny imposed by the fda on study results before approval yet nejm and other journals have tried on other occasions to upstage fda investigations through well timed but much less complete publications nor is this the first time that nejm timed release of a deceptive publication to influence political debate its now infamous december editorial on the vioxx affair titled "expression of concern " advanced factual distortions that internal nejm emails later revealed were timed to divert attention away from a damaging deposition that one of the nejm editors had given in a vioxx trial and instead place blame on merck i have worked on the staff of two leading medical journals the british medical journal and the journal of the american medical association these institutions fill an invaluable role informing clinical practice and maintaining standards for how rigorous clinical research ought to be conducted there is a problem when some journals let antipathy for business interests and left leaning views interfere with the medical decisions that they make bending standards or stepping outside their mandate using their prestige and influence in ways that distort medical facts in the aim of influencing political outcomes prestigious biomedical journals are important public health tools provided they stick to their core business of weighing medical evidence and informing physicians of important practice advances when they use shortcuts and shoddy analysis to fabricate criticism and doubt of drug regulation theyre no better than some politicians they increasingly comport with dr gottlieb a physician is resident fellow at the american enterprise institute and was deputy commissioner of the fda from to see related letter "letters to the editor patient care not politics guides editorial policy" wsj june
