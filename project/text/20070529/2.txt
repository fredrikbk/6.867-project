 and all that our first revolution by michael barone crown pages &# when the english speaking peoples consider the forces that have made them the global hegemonic political culture since the mid th century representative institutions the rule of law religious toleration and property rights among them they look back to britains "glorious" revolution of what at first looks merely like a minor coup detat that replaced the catholic king james ii with his protestant dutch nephew and son in law king william iii was much more than that it heralded nothing less than a complete realignment of worldview for the anglosphere it changed everything michael barone the distinguished political commentator and co author of "the almanac of american politics " demonstrates both an encyclopedic knowledge of late th century european politics and a keen appreciation of their long term implications he sees in the glorious revolution which he dubs the first revolution the genesis of "changes in english law governance and politics that turned out to be major advances for representative government guaranteeing liberties global capitalism and a foreign policy of opposing hegemonic powers " he argues that it was essentially in defense of the rights won in that the american colonists rose against george iii in the handful of whig aristocrats who secretly invited prince william of orange over from holland to overthrow their anointed monarch james were undeniably rebels and traitors as were of course the american colonists who signed the declaration of independence yet they both acted in the name of an ancient inherent legitimate and noble cause liberty english common law rights dating back to magna carta were perceived to be under threat from king james and they trumped whatever allegiance might have been owed him the founding fathers were thus repeating years later and in an american and republican context largely what the "first" revolutionaries had done in what makes "our first revolution" stupendously better than a political tract or a work of straightforward narrative history is mr barones sense of how close the glorious revolution came to failing the whole adventure was predicated on a series of hideous risks if it had fallen at one of any number of hurdles the repercussions for both britain and later america would have been incalculable it is a story of midnight escapes invisible ink secret passageways royal nosebleeds base betrayals and amazingly few high ideals william of orange may not set foot in england until page of mr barones pages at torbay in devon in november but "our first revolution" has all the elements of a political thriller although james ii stood for catholic obscurantism pro french appeasement and stuart paternalism and monopoly all of which would have held britain back politically and commercially in the th century it is hard not to sympathize with his lear like cries of anguish as both his daughters mary and anne betray him in order to safeguard their claims to the throne meanwhile william rightly comes across in mr barones account as more interested in protecting his native holland from france than in extending the liberties of a new kingdom james was brave throughout his life except at the time that courage was most needed in the weeks immediately after william landed he was curiously indecisive lest we forget he was the man after whom new york city was named as duke of york he had successfully fought the dutch in america years before yet in as his army steadily defected to the protestants led across the channel by winston churchills ancestor john churchill later duke of marlborough james decided to flee to france fearing imprisonment in the tower of london by the time he got around to fighting at the battle of the boyne in ireland in it was too late yet had james ii not made myriad errors after succeeding his brother king charles ii in errors that help to trigger williams later intervention "french style absolutism might really have sprung into life" in england mr barone writes perhaps "in late or early " such absolutism was doing well on the continent especially under louis xiv and james was busy trying to buy the coming general election and pack the house of commons when an heir was born to james in june establishing the catholic succession the moment of decision had arrived william had to invade then or never as it was he risked a difficult sea crossing the english channel in november was treacherous throughout the age of sail in the event about dutchmen decided the matter everything that flowed from the whig victory of limited government the bank of england tradeable national debt triennial parliaments mercantilism free enterprise an aggressively anti french foreign policy the union with scotland eventually the hanoverian succession and the industrial revolution combined to make the english speaking peoples powerful mr barone proves beyond doubt how much the glorious revolution inspired the founding fathers to launch their own with virginia gentlemen farmers seeing themselves as the heirs of englands revolutionary aristocrats the bill of rights in britain thus unquestionably paved the way to the american bill of rights of to comprehend how americas birth pangs came about and why its title deeds were drawn up in the way they were it is therefore crucial to understand the ideals and passions of the very best introduction is this well researched well written thought provoking book mr robertss "a history of the english speaking peoples since "
