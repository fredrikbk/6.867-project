delta iis fate worries nonmilitary users possible end of boeing rocket could boost costs narrow options uncertainty over the fate of boeing co s delta ii rocket has some satellite operators and research scientists increasingly worried about losing an affordable and dependable means of launching their hardware into space the delta ii has been a workhorse of the u s space program which has depended on the rocket and its forerunners since but military brass confronting mounting war expenses and cuts in space budgets have decided they cant afford to continue to help underwrite three delta ii launch pads associated personnel and other fixed costs the u s national aeronautics and space administration seems unable to shoulder the costs itself barring a last minute reprieve the u s air force will discontinue its own delta ii launches in a little more than a year it will switch its satellites and also seek to switch those of other launch customers to a pair of larger more powerful rockets developed separately by boeing and lockheed martin corp government officials project overall savings down the road from the move but a delta phaseout could pose major headaches for commercial users and u s nonmilitary agencies launch costs for individual missions could soar as switching to alternative rockets primarily intended to carry larger military and spy satellites could end up costing twice or even three times the delta iis price of roughly &# million per launch they will also have to compete for space on overall fewer launches and would be forced to put up with complications and delays from hitching a ride as a secondary payload to military projects with higher priority the space launch sector is an example of a business where shifting federal budgets and policies can whipsaw corporate and civilian users private efforts to find other ways to get rockets and satellites into space face huge upfront investment costs and other barriers shifting government priorities impact fledgling satellite imaging providers private satellite telephone companies research scientists and various space entrepreneurs russian and other foreign launchers could be used as alternatives but typically they dont have the delta iis reliability "its definitely an item people are quite worried about " said thomas young a former high ranking official at nasa and at lockheed martin who has headed several independent reviews of u s space programs the rockets fate is part of an overall streamlining and consolidation of the space business prompted by u s budget constraints which already have squeezed profits for major contractors the trend has spurred boeing and lockheed to combine their rocket businesses into a venture called united launch alliance civilian space funding is seen facing even greater pressure as manned space missions take a growing share of money over the next decade while the u s struggles to complete the international space station and eventually return astronauts to the moon the delta ii is classified as a medium lift rocket able to lift loads of six tons into near earth orbits of as high as miles or more than two tons into high earth orbits at altitudes of miles the rocket is an inviting option for launching a new class of lighter simpler satellites favored by companies that provide telecommunications imaging and data transmission capacity to a variety of corporate and civilian users scientists have long relied on the rocket to launch weather mapping and other research payloads since the delta ii fills an essential niche that "many different agencies and groups have come to depend upon " there has to be "a real examination of what the consequences" of a shutdown would mean said lt gen michael hamel in charge of air force satellite and rocket acquisitions boeing said in a recent filing with the securities and exchange commission that it had "approximately &# million of delta ii parts inventory that is not related to firm orders " adding that decisions about the rockets fate "could reduce future earnings " in revenue from the delta ii and larger delta iv rockets totaled &# million the companys network and space unit which also includes other business lines such as satellite manufacturing last year earned &# million on nearly &# billion revenue the boeing lockheed venture said the number of future science missions has been slashed and it is "working with nasa to come up with the most cost effective means of meeting the nations" launch requirements a spokeswoman for the venture said that "it is premature to make any decision to discontinue" using the rocket the pentagon however already seems determined that all military communication navigation and spy satellites will ride solely on larger rockets after the autumn of the military then plans to terminate its delta ii contract according to an air force spokeswoman both the agency and the boeing lockheed rocket joint venture are studying potential alternatives they range from switching to a slimmed down version of the lockheed martin designed atlas v to using smaller rockets launched from planes those who depend on the delta ii are pushing to keep it alive "if you dont have that capability" tailored to launch smaller payloads "theres a whole range of things that scientists will not be able to do " lennard fisk a former nasa science chief and current chairman of space studies for the national research council told a u s house science subcommittee this month joseph burns a professor and vice provost of cornell university told the panel that losing the delta ii "is a critical issue" that could be "staggering" and "very damaging" to american space research
