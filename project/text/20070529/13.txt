brussels sprout the story of tintin unlike his most famous creation the intrepid young reporter tintin the cartoonist georges remi didnt travel far and wide he lived worked and sought inspiration in the city of his birth brussels so its not surprising that the man behind one of the worlds best known comic book heroes remains relatively unknown outside his own country even by his nom de plume herge derived by reversing his initials to r g which are pronounced in french as "air zhay" but a series of events this month commemorating the th anniversary of his birth as well as reports that steven spielberg will produce a series of tintin films should draw more attention to the artist "this time we are celebrating the creator not his creations " says charles dierick of studio herge the brussels based organization promotes herges work and is coordinating most of the centenary events including exhibitions musicals the dedication of a new museum and even a tintin themed flea market for more information on the herge centenary visit www tintin com biographer philippe goddin remembers herge simply as a "nice guy" who did not seek out personal fame "he was a workaholic who sought perfection in his art " says mr goddin whose authorized biography "lignes de vie" "lines of life" will be published in october but tintins world wide fame is remarkable while the "adventures of tintin" books have never been as popular in the u s as in other countries more than million copies in languages have been sold around the world since the first volume appeared in at the end of this year a th language will be added ancient aramaic why does tintin appeal so much why do the adventures of a peripatetic reporter with a tuft of blown ginger hair continue to fascinate more than years after they were first published says mr goddin "even herge didnt know the answer i am amazed with his success and it surprises me when a child from africa or india writes in to say tintin is his hero hed often say " but mr goddin credits the tintin books universal theme of good versus evil along with the impressive graphic detail and lively characters from the salty tongued captain haddock to the eccentric professor calculus to the bowler hatted thompson twins as key to their popularity he calls the strip the most realistic depiction of the th century in comic form whether exposing the iniquities of communism in "land of the soviets" or depicting colonialism in "tintin in the congo" and capitalism in "tintin in america" herge first created the tintin character in while working as a comic artist for the weekly newspaper vingtieme siecle but it was his friendship with a chinese student in brussels that marked a turning point in his career zhang chongren pressed the artist to research his works more carefully to make them authentic their friendship lasted years herge immortalized his friend as the character "chang" in "tintin in tibet" which was his personal favorite herges death in only increased the popularity of his works that year a record four million books were sold as fans scrambled to buy copies following news that no new adventures would be written the author had willed that no artist be allowed to continue his work "tintin is me we will disappear together " he said hollywood however has other ideas it was reported earlier this month that mr
