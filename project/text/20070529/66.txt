politics &amp economics mistrust colors u s iran talks violence in iraq is focus no accords are reached but some ideas emerge the first formal diplomatic talks between the u s and iran in decades held out some promise for cooperation but mainly highlighted the vast gulf of distrust that divides the two sides despite being at loggerheads over issues ranging from tehrans nuclear program to its support for radical islamic groups such as hamas and hezbollah the two countries focused their four hours of discussions in baghdad yesterday strictly on the worsening violence in iraq iran has gained in stature from the disarray in a much weakened iraq but the government in tehran says it doesnt want to see the country teeter toward dissolution tehran also has close ties to the shiite controlled government in baghdad no agreements were made in the talks and it wasnt clear whether the countries ambassadors to iraq ryan crocker of the u s and irans hassan kazemi qomi would meet again yet u s officials described the session in generally positive terms suggesting at least some chance of improved relations mr crocker who took over as chief of the u s embassy in march said after the talks "there was pretty good congruence right down the line support for a secure stable democratic federal iraq in control of its own security at peace with its neighbors " for months the u s has sharply accused parts of the iranian government of aiding shiite militias in iraq and shipping in powerful roadside bombs and other military equipment to attack u s troops mr crocker said he used the session to lay out to the iranians "direct specific concerns about their behavior in iraq and their support for militias that are fighting iraqi and coalition forces " the iranians didnt reply in any detail but they did reject the allegations mr crocker said the iranians proposed forming a three way security forum that would include the iraqi government an idea the u s said it would consider mr kazemi the iranian ambassador said he also offered to help train and equip the iraqi army and criticized the u s failure to build up iraqs security forces after the invasion mr kazemi told reporters afterward that iran would like another meeting within a month but mr crocker said a second session hinged on "whether we start to see indications of a change in iranian behavior " the meeting held under heavy security in the baghdad office of iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki came after more than a year of off and on signs of willingness by the u s to engage tehran in talks about iraqs security iraqi diplomats formally led the talks mr crockers suggestion that the two countries share similar principles in iraq contrasts sharply with the increasingly bitter differences between washington and tehran on nearly all fronts iran continues to plunge ahead on its uranium enrichment work despite two united nations sanctions resolutions since december demanding that it suspend the work the u s and europe say iran is seeking nuclear weapons a charge tehran denies iran has recently detained at least four iranian american scholars amid accusations in tehran that the u s is leading a widespread espionage effort to bring down the iranian government in the most prominent of the arrests iran last week imprisoned haleh esfandiari the year old head of the middle east section of the woodrow wilson center for scholars in washington on charges of attempting to topple the iranian government ms esfandiari was in tehran visiting her mother the u s meanwhile is holding seven iranian officials in iraq who washington says were secretly aiding iraqi insurgent groups the sudden spike in detentions of americans in iran has led to widespread speculation that tehran was attempting to broker a swap for its officials being held in iraq mr crocker said that the issue never came up during the talks yesterday in baghdad iran portrayed the talks beforehand as a sign of u s weakness in the region iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said in tehran that the administrations "realistic approach" would succeed only if the u s began by "confessing its failed policy in iraq and the region and by showing a determination to changing the policy " mr crocker said that despite irans stated desire to see improved security in iraq a large gap still exists between those aims and iranian actions the test he said is whether irans behavior on the ground can "come into harmony" with its public policy "i wouldnt make a huge amount out of this single meeting and what came out of it or didnt " mr crocker said
