general mills tries to convince americans to cook chinese general mills inc is hoping a brand of dinner kits imported from china will convince consumers to trade in their restaurant chopsticks for kitchen woks this summer the minneapolis based company will introduce in the u s four dinner kits it developed under the chinese food brand wanchai ferry sweet &amp sour chicken spicy garlic chicken kung pao chicken and cashew chicken with the u s packaged food industry growing at only about a year most food companies look for growth in emerging markets such as china but now general mills and a few others are starting to view their global operations as a two way street allowing them to bring high margin products to the u s that tap into consumers growing taste for more exotic fare kraft foods inc the nations largest food company by revenue has introduced the world to oreo cookies and philadelphia cream cheese but it has brought only a few international brands such as toblerone chocolate and gevalia coffee to the u s bringing a foreign brand here is a first for general mills which offers its old el paso brand in markets including iceland where its a top seller each of general mills new wanchai ferry dinner kits comes in a package that resembles a chinese take out box and contains everything needed to make the meal except the chicken and cooking oil the spicy garlic chicken kit for example comes with jasmine rice spicy garlic sauce bamboo shoots water chestnuts and seasoned cornstarch the suggested retail price for the wanchai ferry dinner kits which can serve five is &# more than twice the cost of a similar size box of hamburger helper the company is positioning its dinner kits as a higher end product with ingredients that are worth paying a premium for "our research suggests that families are tired of letting their tastes be dictated by younger kids theyre tired of hot dogs and spaghetti and are looking to spice up dinner " says bruce von stein marketing director of general mills meals division general mills will face competition in the ethnic food aisle a taste of china a brand of microwavable meals manufactured by closely held andre prost inc are sold there along with mccormick &amp co s thai kitchen and simply asia packaged meals hain celestial group inc has a line of frozen meals called ethnic gourmet which features thai singaporean cuban and indian food u s consumers frequently dine at chinese restaurants but dont know how to make chinese food at home general mills found introducing almost complete chinese meals "makes sense " says darren tristano executive vice president of restaurant consulting firm technomic inc "theres definitely growth in chinese dining but mostly what you see in grocery stores are frozen egg rolls and stir fry dishes " asian restaurants make up the bulk of the countrys full service ethnic restaurants with outlets mr tristano says compared with full service mexican restaurants and full service italian restaurants tom brophy eating lunch recently at a downtown chicago panda express says he might try the new dinner kits he goes to asian restaurants two nights a week and never attempts to make chinese food from scratch because he doesnt know where to start "i grew up with pasta and roast beef " explains mr brophy a year old clerk at the chicago board of trade general mills which derived &# billion of its &# billion in fiscal revenue from sales abroad decided to bring wanchai ferry to the u s because it didnt want to miss an opportunity to capitalize on the popularity of chinese food "we pioneered mexican food around the globe with old el paso but we didnt have a chinese brand in the u s " says chris oleary executive vice president and coo of general mills international division the company turned to a chinese brand it already owned in madame kin wo chong started selling dumplings from a wooden cart on hong kongs wanchai ferry pier eventually becoming known as hong kongs "dumpling queen " in she formalized her business with the creation of the wanchai ferry peking dumpling co and in entered into a joint venture with pillsbury which general mills later acquired "my vision is to bring chinese traditional dim sum and dumplings to every part of the world making wanchai ferry a global brand " madame chong said through an interpreter in china wanchai ferry is primarily a frozen dumpling business the dinner kits were created for the european and american markets madame chong who is a consultant to general mills was involved in the final stage of their design signing off on the flavors the product was three years in the making and involved research teams in china europe and the u s the wanchai ferry brand introduced in france this spring will make its way to other european countries in the next few months one of the challenges was figuring out how best to keep the ingredients fresh because they arent in the refrigerated or frozen sections of stores the sauces come in vacuum sealed pouches while ingredients such as bamboo shoots and water chestnuts are canned in water china has recently faced mounting criticism from western consumer advocates over tainted food and drug exports general mills spokesman tom forsythe says that while general mills buys its water chestnuts and bamboo shoots from china they are shipped to the u s where they are processed and canned by a leading supplier of canned vegetables with whom general mills has had a long term relationship officials from general mills visited the supplier of those ingredients many times and conducted assessments of the suppliers management and food safety programs according to mr forsythe the company continues to use a third party auditor to conduct regular safety checks in the u s the wanchai ferry brand isnt being positioned as authentic chinese food but rather as the americanized version found in most chinese restaurants general mills says it is targeting all consumers with these products including chinese americans to replicate the style of chinese food in america for the kits mr von stein and other general mills employees toured san franciscos chinatown "we immersed ourselves in what chinese cooking in the u s is like and sampled lots of food at the restaurants " he says the result each kit contains ingredients that would be found in chinese restaurants such as hoisin sauce oyster sauce and sherry cooking wine z j tong president of the chicago chinese cultural institute inc a cross cultural consulting firm says the kits which can serve five people might be too big for chinese families because it would mean everyones eating the same thing for dinner "if we go to a chinese restaurant each person doesnt just order one dish we order a lot of different dishes and share " he says "a family of five might want to try five different dishes " but mr tong who grew up in baoding a city miles south of beijing said he would try them "instead of going to an american fast food joint if i can cook quickly for myself at home i will " he adds "it all comes down to taste if they taste good i can see some chinese americans trying them " gary chu president of general mills greater china expects to see more from the wanchai ferry brand in the u s "meal kits are just the beginning " he says "i think this will be like a chinese betty crocker "
