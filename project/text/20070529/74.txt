scrutiny of stent problems turns to doctors some experts say devices are often poorly placed in arteries contributing to risk of clots in the continuing debate over the safety of drug coated stents increasing scrutiny is being placed on the role of the doctors who implant them the concern among some doctors and researchers is that poor technique by cardiologists may contribute to the rare but dangerous blood clots that can form even years after a stent is put in to prop open a clogged artery stents that arent placed properly over the affected area or that arent deployed firmly enough into the artery wall may enable clots to form worries about blood clots have roiled the &# billion global stent market since the problem first drew wide attention last september doctors in the u s have curtailed their use of the &# drug coated devices and currently implant them in about two thirds of cases down from nearly early last summer for other patients doctors are using cheaper bare metal stents which can reclog more easily but dont appear to carry the same long term blood clot risk as drug coated ones so far the search for the cause of the problem has focused on the properties of the metal devices themselves and how they interact with conditions inside the blood vessel one suspect polymers that control the release of the drugs that are meant to prevent reclogging of the artery but there are increasing concerns that overconfidence in the benefits of drug coated stents has led to sloppy technique in one recent study sponsored by a stent maker for instance two thirds of the stents were implanted incorrectly now the cardiovascular research foundation a staunch proponent of stent technology is launching an patient study the trial is designed in part to examine whether less than optimal deployment of a stent is linked to the type of clots at the center of the debate those that occur more than a year after implantation "we went through a period with drug eluting stents thinking that it might not be so important to put them in perfectly " says kirk garratt cardiologist at lenox hill hospital new york "there was so much optimism and confidence about the stents that people might have gotten a little lazy " he says dr garratt and the other cardiologists quoted in this article consult for or get research grant support or speaking fees from companies that make products used in stent procedures in some cases grants or fees are paid to the institution and not directly to the doctor the clotting problem known as very late thrombosis is rare occurring in probably less than of the roughly one million stent procedures done in the u s each year but it happens long after doctors have believed patients were out of such danger and the result is often either death or a major heart attack the chief remedy is to keep patients for at least a year on both aspirin and a second drug called plavix to prevent clots but cost and bleeding risks are among the drawbacks to that strategy not all experts agree that physician technique is a big culprit indeed most believe very late thrombosis has multiple contributors gary mintz a cardiologist at cardiovascular research foundation says that over time the bodys healing process covers over the stent as well as placement shortcomings "the effect of poor technique diminishes as time gets longer from implantation " he says nevertheless concern about proper implantation has helped spur sales of imaging technology called intravascular ultrasound or ivus that can help guide or verify proper deployment some doctors say they are altering their techniques to improve placement a stent is a wire mesh tube installed using a tiny balloon which is inflated to deploy the device where the vessel is clogged using a standard imaging procedure called an angiogram doctors can see where a blockage occurs after a stent is deployed they see a clean smooth channel that appears free of obstruction but it is difficult to tell on an angiogram whether a doctor sufficiently inflated the balloon to fully expand the stent against the artery wall ivus enables the doctor to see the vessel as if peering into a pipe and underexpanded edges of the stent can come into view "you put ivus in there and you find that the stent that looks beautiful on an angiogram isnt very well deployed " says raj makkar director of interventional cardiology at cedars sinai medical center los angeles who uses ivus in about a quarter of his patients a patient study presented at an interventional cardiology meeting late last year found that in two thirds of cases drug coated stents were either underinflated or failed to cover the treated area of the vessel after one year of patients whose devices werent accurately deployed had undergone an additional procedure compared with whose stents were properly placed patients in the poorly deployed group had suffered heart attacks compared with four among those with well deployed stents the study was sponsored by johnson &amp johnson which along with boston scientific corp make the two drug coated stents currently on the u s market "weve never tested ourselves and doctors roles have been completely overlooked " says marco costa a cardiologist at university of florida college of medicine jacksonville who initiated and led the study "the message has to be that doctors need to pay attention to avoid the consequences " the study which hasnt yet been published in a peer reviewed journal wasnt designed to look at the problem of very late blood clots and hasnt tracked patients beyond a year critics believe it either overstates the frequency of poor placement or raises more questions about the device "its kind of hard to say something is just sloppy technique when its happening two thirds of the time " says deepak bhatt an interventional cardiologist at the cleveland clinic in ohio "i wouldnt blame the doctor id blame the stent " johnson &amp johnson said in a statement that the findings confirm that "optimal deployment provides benefits for patients " it added that the "consensus among the medical community" is that "appropriate stent placement or technique is just one variable" in the late clotting issue eric simso vice president of interventional cardiology marketing at boston scientific said "experts are stressing the importance of procedural factors and plavix compliance and those same experts are at the same time demanding that industry continue to design better products " dr mintz attributes much of the very late thrombosis problem to the vessel wall pulling away from the device creating a gap that can promote formation of clots just this month a study in the journal circulation by stephane cook and colleagues at university hospital bern in switzerland used ultrasound to look at the stents in patients who had suffered very late blood clots they found that in cases the vessel wall had pulled away from the device while the stent wasnt fully expanded in the other three "better operator technique could have prevented two or three of those events but the majority appeared to be related to poor healing " dr mintz estimates some doctors are changing their practice to increase their chances of implanting stents correctly ramon quesada medical director of interventional cardiology at baptist cardiac &amp vascular institute miami has increased his use of ivus after finding in a study at his hospital that the devices were often underinflated "technique is of the essence with drug eluting stents " he says samin sharma director of the cardiac catheterization lab at mount sinai hospital new york says he turns to ivus to examine his work in complicated cases and has increased the use to about of cases up from about before the clotting problem emerged in addition fellows at his hospital training to become interventional cardiologists have been getting stepped up instruction in ivus since the late clotting problem emerged william oneill dean of clinical affairs at the university of miamis miller school of medicine uses higher balloon pressures to expand stents than he did before "we got away from high balloon pressure with drug eluting stents " he says partly as a cost saving strategy in the face of more costly stents and good results on an angiogram dr oneill suggests patients who are candidates for stent procedures might ask their doctors how often they use the imaging technology "if they say never shy away from them " he says "ultrasound is a surrogate for quality " sales of ivus equipment have jumped in recent quarters as a result of the blood clot concerns according to stent maker boston scientific and volcano corp a rancho cordova calif medical device company that makes ivus equipment but many cardiologists balk at routine use of ivus because it adds about &# to &# to the cost of a stent procedure and isnt separately reimbursed it also increases the time necessary to complete a procedure the big patient study being launched by the cardiovascular research foundation is intended to look broadly at the root causes of very late thrombosis in hopes of defining factors that might predict which patients are at risk and which ones are likely to benefit from plavix a subset of patients will be evaluated with ivus in a bid to determine just how physician technique might contribute to the problem "it is being supported by funds from industry sponsors " says the foundations gregg stone who is a co leader of the study "it is a sincere attempt to understand more about the underlying causes of this rare event " risk assessment a look at the clot risk with stents drug coated stents reduce the reclogging of arteries found with bare metal stents but drug coated stents also come with a higher risk of clots over the long term some experts say stents that dont fully cover the plaque clogging an artery or that arent properly inflated inside the vessel may contribute to such clots
