john henry in a slump merrill lynch joins the parade out of red sox owners firm hard times for trend followers john henrys boston red sox are in first place in baseballs american league east but his investment firm is on a losing streak that has investors rushing for the exits amid dreadful performance for more than a year merrill lynch &amp co is pulling about &# million of investment funds from mr henrys firm at the end of this month the move by merrill which has had an year relationship with the firm leaves john w henry &amp co with just about &# million about a year ago mr henrys firm a managed futures adviser a hedge fund like operation that bets on commodities currencies bonds and stocks in boca raton fla managed more than &# billion the firms largest investment fund the strategic allocation program a blend of mr henrys various strategies is down in the past year and is off more than so far this year by way of comparison the standard &amp poors stock index gained in the past months while a range of bonds have scored gains of about higher six other investment programs at mr henrys firm have dropped more than in the past year with one diversified fund declining all are down sharply this year "its very painful one never gets used to poor performance periods and this has been our most prolonged " says mr henry the controlling owner of the red sox "weve had clients withdraw during tough periods before and that is never an easy decision sometimes at the very bottom of our performance cycles " behind the problems mr henry is a so called trend follower meaning he looks for markets that are making significant moves and jumps in betting that they will continue limited volatility and few extended trends have hurt these types of traders this year energy prices have been in a tight range stocks have climbed only gradually and other markets have been too placid for his strategies to excel "our returns are dependent on long term trends that yield significant profits for a small percentage of trades each year " he says "long term trends in currencies for example have been very profitable for us for more than two decades but recently they have been the most difficult " mr henry is being lapped by rivals who focus on commodity and currency trading those players are merely flat this year according to barclay group which tracks these commodity trading advisers or ctas over the past three years mr henrys largest fund has dropped about while an index tracking the largest ctas is up earlier this year mr henry tweaked his trading systems to try to moderate the firms returns and reduce volatility the performance has improved a bit lately the strategic allocation program rose more than in april and some of his other funds have done a bit better too he has seen the departure of a number of executives including the firms president and chief investment officer mark s rzepczynski mr rzepczynkski didnt respond to calls seeking comment another one that got away ken tropin who left a number of years ago to start his own hedge fund graham capital which now has &# billion in assets "there has been an inflow of talent as well as an outflow " mr henry says about recruiting new stars the merrill decision reported earlier by nakedshorts typepad com a financial web log means a lot to mr henrys year old firm since he hasnt been able to attract a rush of money the way other hedge fund honchos have done in recent years despite what had been stellar returns until recently that is because his programs had always been highly volatile scaring away some potential clients a spokeswoman for merrill declined to comment mr henry hasnt moved into stock trading or other new strategies like some peers and continues to rely on models to guide the firms trades which generally need trends of at least five months to generate big profits some say central banks have done a better job keeping a lid on inflation in recent years and global economies have become more resilient narrowing the range of trading for interest rates hurting mr henry some argue that mr henry hasnt focused enough on his firm and updating the trading models a notion that he disputes "i am in daily contact with our trading supervisors " he says "we are a long term technical trader utilizing systematic programs that have changed very little over the past years the portfolios have evolved but we strictly adhere to a philosophy of long term trend following through good and bad periods " mr henrys firm has discussed affiliating with another investment manager but no deal is imminent according to a person close to the matter despite the travails and the smaller size mr henry says he is optimistic and has no plans to shutter his firm "for many firms just a half billion dollars would be a sizable amount " he says "if i thought that long term trend following had lost its efficacy for the future i would close but at this point i dont believe that it is hard for me to imagine that volatility has left financial markets once and for all "
