the afternoon report squeezing khartoum online edition president bush trying to stop the horrific violence in darfur that has claimed lives tightened sanctions against sudans government but some say the measures are too little too late and its uncertain whether other nations will follow suit the president threatened to tighten the screws on khartoum weeks ago but held off at the urging of united nations secretary general ban ki moon who asked for more time to find a diplomatic resolution to the now four year old drama but it was clear today that the administrations patience had been exhausted mr bush said that sudans president omar al bashir made empty promises to cooperate while obstructing international efforts to halt what the white house has described as genocide the president said after he had agreed last month to delay announcing new sanctions "they bombed a meeting of rebel commanders designed to discuss a possible peace deal with the government in the following weeks he used his army and government sponsored militias to attack rebels and civilians in south darfur hes taken no steps to disarm these militias in the year since the darfur peace agreement was signed " the conflict dates to early when tribes in the darfur region revolted against what they viewed as the arab dominated governments systematic discrimination against them the government is accused of ordering up a campaign of ethnic terror prosecuted mainly by the janjaweed militia to put down the rebellion khartoum denies the allegations and says that the death toll is vastly overstated putting it at about deaths the fresh measures include blocking some companies that are either owned or controlled by sudans government from the u s financial system a band of individuals were also slapped with restrictions ahmad muhammed harun the state minister for humanitarian affairs who has been accused of war crimes by the international criminal court in the hague awad ibn auf sudans head of military intelligence and security and khalil ibrahim a rebel chief who refused to sign the darfur peace accord were all barred from doing business in the u s the president also directed secretary of state condoleezza rice to draft a new u n resolution that would strengthen the international pressure upon sudan much like the measures unveiled today the president said he envisions a resolution that would further isolate sudan and punish individuals accused of violating human rights or blocking a peace deal "it will prohibit the sudanese government from conducting any offensive military flights over darfur it will strengthen our ability to monitor and report any violations " mr bush said getting other members of the u n in its corner on such a measure is another matter however britain could be on board prime minister tony blair will be using a trip to africa this week to rally support for ending the bloodshed in darfur but as much as darfur has become a cause celebre in the west other countries view sudan as a critical source of energy and the price of intervening in darfur as far too dear beijing is a massive consumer of sudanese crude and so far has resisted calls to rein in its investment amid the crisis it didnt seem to be swayed by todays developments chinas african affairs representative liu guijin told reuters that "expanding sanctions can only make the problem more difficult to resolve " he said that it was "still too early" to speak of whether his country would use its veto power to quash new sanctions against sudan but his words suggest a tough road awaits the

comes as china is struggling to contain a crisis of confidence in the safety of its food and medicine both at home and abroad the court justified the death sentence by the "huge amount of bribes
