specify the terms of the arrangement there has been speculation that the pritzkers would seek liquidity through an initial public offering of hyatts stock mr pritzker said the family hasnt decided

hilton hotels for &# billion while the recent credit crunch left industry observers wondering if private equity had cooled toward hotels the &# billion investment in hyatt suggests the lodging

liesel and matthew pritzker filed suit several years ago accusing their father of looting their trust funds they settled in walking away with about &# million apiece the pritzkers have extensive charitable interests particularly in their chicago home base the family empire was founded in chicago more than a century ago by nicholas j pritzker a young lawyer who had emigrated with his penniless family from kiev in the late s the empire was run for many decades by two of his grandsons jay pritzker and his brother robert while jay pritzker was alive the family members were content to keep their assets together and individual members received relatively small personal funds but as with many families the cohesion started to crumble after jay pritzkers death in with some individual members agitating for greater control over their wealth although the pritzkers are liquidating parts of their empire a large core group of assets is likely to remain run by cousins thomas nicholas and penny pritzker several other adult members of the family are likely to keep at least some of their wealth invested in the core family business while some of the dissident members already have struck out on their own putting their funds into investment or business ventures tamara audi contributed to this article
