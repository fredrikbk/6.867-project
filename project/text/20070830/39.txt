democrats race to return cash from big donor sen hillary rodham clinton and other prominent democrats scrambled to unload thousands of dollars of contributions from one of the partys leading fund raisers amid questions about his fund raising techniques and news that a warrant for his arrest has been languishing in california since the early s the swift political rise and fall of norman hsu an obscure new york businessman who never donated to a presidential candidate before underscores the tremendous pressure candidates are facing this election cycle to raise unprecedented sums of money and in the process turning to financiers the campaigns may know little about questions surrounding mr hsus marshalling of funds on behalf of mrs clinton and other candidates were first highlighted by the wall street journal earlier this week the journal noted unusual patterns between mr hsus political donations and those of people he knew in particular the residents of a tiny house in daly city calif who often gave large contributions on the exact same day and for the exact same amount mr hsu did election law experts said the pattern raises red flags that justify a probe into whether the wealthy mr hsu was improperly reimbursing the others for their donations mr hsu denied any reimbursement or any wrongdoing beyond his &# in personal contributions to mrs clinton mr hsu had raised well over &# million for the new york senators presidential campaign making him one of her top "bundlers " his reach extended well beyond the presidential race as he has also raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for house and senate democrats and governors across the country earlier this week clinton campaign spokesman howard wolfson responded to questions about mr hsu by saying "there has been no question about his integrity or his commitment to playing by the rules and we have absolutely no reason to call his contributions into question " but yesterday the los angeles times reported that mr hsu had legal troubles in his past and that he faces arrest in california after failing to appear for sentencing more than a decade ago on charges stemming from a business deal later in the day the clinton campaign said it would donate to charity the &# mr hsu had given over the past two and a half years to her senate and presidential campaigns as well to a political action committee "we regularly review contributions as we receive them " mr wolfson said yesterday "we will continue our practice of scrutinizing contributions and should we have a basis to return a contribution we will do so " no evidence has emerged that the clinton campaign knew anything about the controversies surrounding mr hsu until the press reports surfaced this week but his saga does show that leading democrats were willing to embrace him and his sudden tremendous success in gathering funds apparently without asking a lot of questions until yesterday mr hsu had a california fund raiser scheduled for the clinton campaign late next month yesterday the roster of democrats who once welcomed mr hsus largess joined mrs clinton in racing to distance themselves from him california rep doris matsui said that she will return the &# she has received from mr hsu and members of the paw family who live in the daly city house highlighted in the journals initial story others who said they would return donations from mr hsu include pennsylvania rep joe sestak new york rep kristen gillibrand louisiana sen mary landrieu massachusetts sen john kerry and comedian al franken who is running for a senate seat in minnesota another democratic presidential candidate new mexico gov bill richardson said hed donate to charity the &# he received from mr hsu for his gubernatorial campaign last year "theres no way to keep the money " said doris chandler duke a former ambassador and a major clinton supporter who belongs to the community of long time established donors "the man may be cleared of all charges and it could blow out to sea but in the meantime you dont want to be associated with any donations that might be dishonorable " mr hsu emerged as a leading fund raiser at a time when the cost of running for office particularly for president skyrocketed and campaigns have been aggressively hunting for a new vein of fund raisers skilled at finding new donors so far the presidential candidates from both parties have raised &# million for the nominating contest nearly three times as much as candidates had at the same point during the election cycle mrs clinton herself has raised &# million according to campaign finance reports "whenever you have a lot of pressure to raise a lot of money there are going to be people cutting corners " says david mason one of two republican commissioners on the six member federal election commission mr hsus legal troubles come from allegations that he raised money from a group of investors but failed to deliver on his promises the business plan essentially was to buy latex gloves cheaply in asia and sell them for a profit more than a dozen people lost more than &# million according to ronald smetana who handled the case for the california attorney generals office in the early s after pleading no contest to state theft charges mr hsu faced a penalty of three years in prison and was responsible for paying restitution of the entire amount to investors mr smetana said in an interview yesterday "he was supposed to be sentenced but he didnt appear " mr smetana recalled "he faxed a letter saying he had an emergency and he never came back " mr smetana currently a deputy attorney general in california said that without the help of the internet it was difficult to track him down "you could look through phone books but which phone books " he said officials figured mr hsu a naturalized u s citizen who was born in hong kong had returned to asia "so it was very surprising to see him emerge in such a high profile role in fund raising " mr smetana said "i would like him to come back to california and turn himself in " mr smetana said otherwise "he could be arrested and extradited to california " in a statement issued yesterday through his attorney mr hsu said he was "surprised to learn that there appears to be an outstanding warrant as demonstrated by the fact that i have and do live a public life " he added that "i believe i properly resolved all of the legal issues related to my bankruptcy in the early s " and he said "i have not sought to evade any of my obligations and certainly not the law " the statement didnt say how he would respond to the lingering legal charges but mr hsu did say he intends "to refrain from all fund raising activities on behalf of all candidates and causes" until his legal matter is resolved "i would not consciously subject any of the candidates and causes in which i believe to any harm through my actions " he said the news of the old legal charges followed a report in the wall street journal monday that detailed the correlations between campaign contributions from mr hsu and six members of the paw family who live in a one floor &# house just south of san francisco william paw the year old head of the household is a mail carrier earning &# a year according to a union representative winkle paw states in campaign reports that he works for several of mr hsus apparel companies campaign finance records show the &# in donations the family members have made to mrs clinton this year place them among her leading financial supporters the family has donated about &# to democrats since records also show that political donations from the paw family are regularly made to the exact same candidate on the exact same day and for similar amounts as campaign donations from mr hsu who once listed their home as his address the family with mr hsu and other associates have collectively donated a total of &# to a long list of democratic candidates it is illegal for individuals to reimburse others for campaign donations mr hsu denied he has reimbursed anyone for making contributions and no evidence has emerged that he has done so while many of mr hsus new political friends abandoned him yesterday at least one stuck by his side pennsylvania gov edward rendell said in an interview yesterday that he plans to keep the &# he has received from mr hsus fund raising network mr hsu donated all but &# of that total from his own pocket since pennsylvania election law doesnt place limits on campaign donations last year mr hsu hosted a course dinner for gov rendell and about a dozen others at per se a swank new york city restaurant overlooking central park where a meal costs &# a person the menu included oysters and russian sevruga caviar calling mr hsu a personal friend mr rendell said "he has never asked me for a bloody thing which in our business is unusual virtually everyone who gives you money asks for something " mr rendell said he thinks mr hsu is motivated to donate money because he likes to hobnob with elected officials and talk politics "some people like to be around movie stars norman is more interested in politicians " corrections &amp amplifications the paw family refinanced their daly city calif property at shelbourne ave for &# in an aug page one article on efforts by democrats to unload contributions from fund raiser norman
