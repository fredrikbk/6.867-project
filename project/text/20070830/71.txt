politics &amp economics beijings antitrust plan raises questions chinas landmark antitrust legislation now on the verge of final passage after more than a decade of deliberations is creating uncertainty for companies over how the government will use new powers to regulate mergers and investigate abuses the proposed antimonopoly law is likely to be adopted as soon as today it has been discussed at this weeks meeting of the standing committee of chinas legislature which closes today and officials after repeated delays have said publicly that the current draft is mature and ready for passage the law would take effect on aug though questions about its effects on chinas economy will persist for much longer "this law is going to be conferring really substantial discretion on the enforcement authorities " says nathan bush a beijing based lawyer with omelveny &amp myers llp the current draft of the law is fairly neutral he says and could be used either to pursue conventional antitrust cases or to push industrial policies that would benefit state companies at the expense of private and foreign ones "if the enforcement program is not transparent and coherent the resulting uncertainty could create a drain on investment and business activities " mr bush says the uncertainty reflects the divergent agendas that have come together in the drafting of the antimonopoly law some see it as a tool that can aid domestic and government owned companies and protect them from inroads by foreign multinationals an accelerating rate of inflation this year has also led to renewed official interest in controlling price increases by manufacturers yet other local proponents see the antitrust code as a way to bring more competition and openness to the chinese economy many parts of which are still dominated by the state "the general view among domestic private entrepreneurs and foreign companies is that this is a good thing such a law controls the power of the state owned enterprises " says benedict tai a partner at the law firm jones day in beijing "though they may not be efficient they have the size the relationships and access to bank financing that makes them formidable competitors " whether the law lives up to that promise depends less on the language that is finally approved by legislators and more on the priorities of future chinese administrations in the last couple of years foreign investment in china has come under increasing political scrutiny as leaders worry less about attracting money from abroad and more about supporting emerging local companies for instance rules revised last year allow the government to review acquisitions by foreign companies that may affect chinas "economic security " the draft antimonopoly law also provides for review of foreign deals that may affect "national security " lawyers say the change is likely to have little practical impact because regulators already have broad discretion to reject deals many of the disputes that dogged the drafting of the law havent been resolved only deferred it doesnt specify for instance which government agency will be the main antitrust enforcer though most observers now expect an existing ministry rather than a specialized new body will be given the assignment and after much back and forth over a key technical issue how big a merger has to be before it must be reported to the government for antitrust review the latest draft of the law does away with specific thresholds and simply allows the government to set them later
