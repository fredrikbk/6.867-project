down in the trenches in a war that cant be won in response to mary ogradys "canadas shooting gallery" americas aug providing clean injection equipment and a safe place to use drugs is a far cry from "engaging in drugging the citizenry" or "encouraging drug use " supervised injection centers like insite i know of a similar one in madrid do not provide either drugs or drug substitutes or information on where to get those substances plus they are located in drug and crime ridden neighborhoods and are frequented by destitute addicts how are those centers supposed to encourage the average citizen to start doing drugs as for people who are already in the habit their addiction is a far more powerful motive to continue using drugs than the free needles needles are already cheap and easy to get drugs are expensive dangerous to obtain and potentially deadly and yet addicts continue to consume them regularly interestingly enough ms ogrady mentions the "bright white lights " the "cold clinical setting" and the "no smoking" signs that one can find at insite none of that sounds very inviting perhaps if we furnished the center with dim warm lights and plush armchairs ms ogrady would be right in claiming that the government encourages drug use centers such as insite send the message "we know you exist " feeling acknowledged may make drug addicts feel part of society and be willing to rejoin it and regardless of whether they feel acknowledged or not simply making it easy for addicts to sign up for detoxification programs like those centers do will only increase the numbers of those who quit using francisco m torralba chicago ms ogrady is correct beyond any doubt that the war on drug use has been and will continue to be a total failure citing the late milton friedman she correctly notes there is just too much money in it for the distribution channel to ever run dry legalizing drugs will bring the street price down to production costs plus margin and put the dealers on the unemployment line the money saved no doubt in the tens to hundreds of billions can be channeled into all sorts of ways to reduce drug use if this society can successfully stigmatize tobacco addiction and make significant progress against drunk driving surely we can figure this one out as well but it starts with the core admission that while attacking the supply side of the distribution channel might make for good politics it is doomed policy jack kay framingham mass i traveled to vancouver recently for the first time and happened upon east hastings street ive lived in new york for more than years through rough times such as the crack epidemic of the early s but that left me unprepared for what i saw human zombies were wandering everywhere in the middle of the day people inhaled crack from a sidewalk "hookah" that looked like an octopus it was a mecca of self imposed human misery and it was paid for by canadian taxpayers i am completely for legalization of all drugs if people want to destroy themselves that is their right but the alternative to banning drugs is not to subsidize them that is the statist solution lost in this false alternative is individual liberty where people are simply left alone to live their own lives productively or not as they see fit reality is punishment enough for drug addicts only a minority of people will choose that way of life because it is so self destructive their numbers are further reduced through early death subsidize that its insane raymond c niles new york im a british columbian who sees complaints about safe injection sites contributing to the growth of the "poverty industry" as rather laughable in view of the fact that the amount currently spent on this "industry" is chump change compared with the billions spent on the drug prohibition industry and complaining that this harm reduction innovation condones illicit drug use makes about as much sense as complaining that speed limits and good tires condone the use of vehicles george kosinski gibsons british columbia
