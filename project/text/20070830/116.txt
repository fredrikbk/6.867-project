years in the making powerful yahoo mail is worth the wait two years is a really long time to test a software product but thats about how long it took for yahoo to finish its slick new version of yahoo mail the popular email program you access from a web browser this new yahoo mail entered its beta or test stage in september and this week it emerged in finished form the result is a polished fairly powerful email program that i prefer to googles much hyped gmail which is undergoing an even longer gestation it has been in beta status since april ive been testing the new yahoo mail on both windows and macintosh computers it has some downsides but it beats gmail in my view both in terms of features and in terms of its ability to act like a standard computer program rather than a web page something for which gmail often gets more credit a closer competitor to yahoo mail is actually microsofts hotmail now called windows live hotmail but yahoo tops hotmail too in my opinion the new yahoo mail which works in internet explorer and firefox on windows and in firefox on the macintosh is now more than just an email program like gmail but unlike hotmail it has a built in instant messaging module you can choose to communicate with any of your contacts via a real time chat right from within yahoo mail as long as that contact is online and has an im account on either the yahoo or microsoft instant messaging networks you dont need to be running your im program unlike either of its competitors however the new yahoo mail also allows you to exchange text messages with people on cellphones although the message exchange must be initiated from yahoo mail yahoo mail offers unlimited storage of emails and attachments free of charge and a very fast and good search capability like gmails so you can keep years of messages on hand and retrieve them quickly gmail offers gigabytes of storage free it sells extra storage for prices ranging from &# a year for six gigabytes to &# a year for gigabytes hotmail is in the process of boosting its storage to five gigabytes free and gigabytes for &# a year with yahoo mail you can send attachments of up to megabytes per message and megabytes if you opt for a &# a year plan that also eliminates the annoying banner ads that litter the free version gmail offers attachments of up to megabytes free hotmail allows megabyte attachments and megabytes under its &# a year plan which also banishes ads gmail has no banner ads just text ads that run alongside the emails and cant be eliminated this new yahoo mail is gradually being rolled out in coming weeks the company still plans to retain the older version of yahoo mail now called classic for people who prefer it or for those using browsers that are incompatible with the new version such as apples safari the new yahoo mail allows you to do things that once were impossible in a web based email program for instance you can drag messages to new folders or select a group of messages in the same way you would with a standard email program to delete them or mark them as read or unread unlike in gmail when you right click on a message you get a list of options that pertain to the mail program like "reply to sender" instead of options that pertain to the use of the browser like "add to favorites " also yahoo mail features a very nice tabbed interface that gmail and hotmail lack with this interface which is separate from the browsers own tabs you could have your inbox in one tab an instant message or text message conversation going on in another and a new email you are composing occupying yet another you can move among these tabs without losing the content in any of them and like hotmail but not gmail yahoo mail offers a preview pane like microsofts outlook so you can see the contents of an email without opening it gmail offers just a "snippet of the message content unlike gmail which forces you to view your emails as bunched up "conversations " yahoo mail like hotmail displays them as a standard email program does sorting them by date sender subject or size so what are the downsides of yahoo mail well the biggest is probably that unless you pay for the &# a year premium plan you cant view your yahoo mail account in a standard email program such as outlook or apple mail gmail allows this free of charge hotmail allows it free in outlook and in windows mail though it will soon announce the capability for other email programs for premium members and eventually for free members as well also i found yahoo mail could sometimes be slow when i created a new folder and tried to drag emails into it i was warned that i couldnt do that because the new folder was "still being created " but overall yahoo did a really good job making its online mail program versatile powerful and accessible email me at mossberg wsj com find all my columns and videos online free at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
