altria sets in motion plans to spin off international unit altria group inc which signaled yesterday that it likely will spin off its international tobacco operation soon now must figure out how to market the two parts to investors to avoid the newly divided companies being seen as poor performers in a first step in that direction altria group whose main business will become the u s cigarette operations raised its quarterly dividend to cents a share yesterday altria signaled its intention to make the restructured u s tobacco company a high dividend payer with a payout ratio of around compared with to for the holding company in the past slow growing companies often pay out high dividends as a way of attracting investors altria also said it plans to slash costs including downsizing its u s headquarters which will be relocated to richmond va from new york the move including plans to cut two thirds of altrias new york employees will contribute to savings of &# million in overhead costs annually altrias long anticipated decision to spin off the international tobacco unit announced following a board meeting yesterday will create a new independent company called philip morris international with operations based in lausanne switzerland it will be unfettered by legal and public relations problems in the u s and be able to blanket overseas markets with cigarettes and possibly other tobacco products "the beast will be unleashed " wrote one citigroup inc analyst yesterday referring to the international cigarette operation a purveyor of billion cigarettes last year more than four times the billion cigarettes its american sibling made for the u s market international revenue was &# billion compared with &# billion at philip morris usa while the u s units sales declined more than last year the international operation continues to enjoy sales growth particularly in developing world markets such as eastern europe the middle east africa and asia the move has been under consideration for several years and the transaction could be completed as soon as early next year philip morris international will get its own listing on the new york stock exchange with louis c camilleri altrias chief executive officer taking its helm michael e szymanczyk ceo of philip morris usa will become chairman and ceo of altria which aside from the u s tobacco operation will own a stake in united kingdom beer giant sabmiller plc altrias shares yesterday rose to &# in p m new york stock exchange composite trading the muted reaction may reflect disappointment with the jan deadline to decide the exact timing of the spinoff as well as skepticism among investors about the benefits of separating the tobacco businesses "we want to see more of how both of these companies look before we make any decisions " said david dreman of dreman value management llc which owns roughly million altria shares "but the philip morris u s company might be attractive if it is spun off at a lower valuation than some of the other american tobacco companies out there with a good dividend and possibly some other assets " another reason for the ho hum reaction many large investors likely would have preferred altria use other methods of boosting share value such as a large stock buyback plan a spinoff of the overseas business will delay major share buybacks until however because only after the companies are finally separated would their respective boards have the chance to consider such a move "there are two things they want a breakup and a buyback and you cant do the second until you do the first " said david adelman a tobacco analyst at morgan stanley he has an "overweight" rating on altria group shares in a conference call mr camilleri argued that separating the international and u s parts of philip morris makes sense because while both philip morris usa and philip morris international sell marlboro cigarettes they face different regulatory landscapes and growth prospects he has long contended that a "conglomerate discount" has affected altria shares implying wall street would place a greater value on the companys three individual parts the u s and international tobacco operations and kraft foods inc than it has placed on the whole altria spun off its stake in kraft earlier this year however krafts stock performance has been unimpressive since then which also could feed into skepticism about the benefits of corporate breakups mr camilleri predicted that both companies would be able to enhance their "growth rates through a sharper focus on the opportunities" before them management incentives would probably be linked to the share price of each tobacco unit one of the biggest knocks against the international company he said has been the argument that it "appears to be relatively weak in emerging markets " which account for virtually all of the overall growth in cigarette volume these days but he said "we have momentum" in terms of market share growth adding that philip morris international would continue aggressively rolling out new iterations of the companys marlboro brand with products such as marlboro filter plus marlboro flavor plus and marlboro kretek cigarettes a new line of clove flavored smokes sold in indonesia the company hopes these products will enable it to boost its international market share which is the biggest question may surround the u s units prospects given the steady decline in the u s cigarette market mr camilleri said philip morris usa which has a share of the american cigarette market would continue to push into smokeless products
