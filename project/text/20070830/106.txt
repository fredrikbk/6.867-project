u s open diary what you dont see on tv flushing meadows n y tennis still has a reputation largely undeserved as a hoity toity preserve of the country club set in fact the top tournament in north america the u s open is about as democratic as you can get for as little as &# you can buy a nighttime ticket to an early session on the main court arthur ashe stadium the preserve of the federers and sharapovas of course for that little money youll need binoculars to see anything but if you spend &# still a bargain compared with the nfl or nba playoffs you can get a grounds pass that will let you see the worlds best tennis in a way that you cant on television not only do you get a better sense for the speed and ferocity of the game in person but you can also see matches that never make the main telecast youre not limited to the headliners who tend to have lopsided results in the early rounds much better to find more obscure match ups featuring aging has beens or young hope to bes and no need to stay for an entire match you can leave as soon as your interest wanes no two spectators experiences will be identical but heres what i saw during my two day visit at the start of this years championship monday a m as i arrive matches are beginning amid this embarrassment of riches i head to court to see an year old african american donald young take on a year old australian redhead chris guccione mr young has been heralded as the savior of american tennis but he tanked in his first pro matches can he turn it around here as i sit a few feet from the court i marvel at the pace and control with which the two lefties propel the ball thwack thwack thwack its like a high level tennis lesson note to self put more underspin on volleys like these guys are doing mr young narrowly loses the first set in a tie breaker but comes back to grab the second  p m lunchtime with the match going at least four sets its best of five i can sneak away and not miss the finish after a quick chicken caesar sandwich the grub here wouldnt rate highly in zagats but its a bit better than the stadium average i return in time to watch mr young win the fourth set and the match the future of american tennis looks a bit brighter than it did a few hours ago  p m i rush over to see max mirnyi and marcos baghdatis battling in the fourth set theyre in louis armstrong stadium which was the top venue here until when the palatial ashe stadium it seats opened with its current capacity of armstrong is a much more intimate forum mr mirnyi is a year old belarusian who has been on the tour for more than a decade and has had the most success playing doubles mr baghdatis is a year old cypriot who made a splash by taking a set off roger federer in last years australian open final hes the favorite but he dropped the first two sets before recovering to take the third i am eager to see the fourth set action but spectators have to wait until the players change sides before they can enter and thats taking a while because a game is stalemated at deuce while i wait a chatty usher complains of poor upkeep pointing to cracks in the concrete seeing my press pass he hints at high level shenanigans im not interested i simply want to see some good tennis when i finally get in im not disappointed by relentlessly chipping and charging on mr bhaghdatiss serve mr mirnyi forces a crucial mistake that earns him an upset  p m a brief foray to court to see jonas bjorkman the oldest man in this years draw hes gasp ive been watching him play here for more than a decade so hes a sentimental favorite but sentiment can take you only so far when the sun is so unmerciful after watching a couple of games i beat a hasty retreat back to armstrong to find some shade and an ice cream bar  p m john isner and jarkko nieminen come out to warm up mr isner is an oddity not only because of his height foot but also because he went to college the university of georgia most top players dont even attend a normal high school his higher ranked finnish opponent looks shell shocked by mr isners serve which routinely exceeds miles per hour but the rest of mr isners game lags behind he keeps spraying forehands wide the first two sets go to tie breakers each player winning one  p m losing interest in this sloppy match i wander over to the adjacent grandstand to see the aging american journeyman vince spadea known primarily for having had the longest losing streak in tour history matches hes in the process of adding another one to the loss column against german veteran nicolas kiefer but their contest is far more entertaining than the doings at armstrong neither man has an overwhelming serve so there are plenty of long rallies once mr spadea blows a service game in the third set however its clear that the fun is almost over  p m back at armstrong mr isner wins the fourth set and the match with a mph ace i walk over to court where american ashley harkleroad is struggling against romanian ioana raluca olaru i watch as ms harkleroad double faults to lose a game then misses an easy overhead to lose the first set im too embarrassed for her to keep watching besides ive overdosed on tennis for today time to go home tuesday a m back on court to watch the only player taller than mr isner ivo karlovic of croatia who actually has his height foot sewn on his shorts take on frenchman arnaud clement a pygmy by comparison at foot mr karlovics serves sound like the crack of thunder yet somehow mr clement keeps scooping them back after he wins the first two sets i head out  p m planning to grab lunch im distracted by the sight of meghann shaughnessy an american ranked th in the world practicing her serve in a sports bra and skimpy shorts im not the only one a small crowd gathers to watch the tall willowy blonde next on the practice court are the bryan brothers the american doubles stars no doubt to the disappointment of their female fans theyre wearing shirts  p m back to court mr karlovic wins the fourth set in a tiebreaker to force a fifth set i overhear a fan say "this is as good as it gets " and hes right mr clement manages to break mr karlovics monster serve and then he staggers on to victory after more than four hours in the sun  p m in the grandstand to watch daniela hantuchova one of a bevy of slavic beauties shes slovakian who have taken over the womens tour this isnt her day she falls to a lower ranked challenger julia vakulenko of ukraine sitting courtside im almost crushed by a horde of kids eager to snare the victors autograph  p m my first stop at ashe stadium the biggest and most impersonal tennis arena in the world thanks to my press pass im close enough to see the action if only there were any to see defending champion maria sharapova makes quick work of her unheralded challenger italian roberta vinci commentators spend more time discussing marias wardrobe a red minidress with shiny spangles than her game  p m the last match features andy roddick last years runner up his opponent justin gimelstob no makes the first set surprisingly close before losing a tiebreaker the atmosphere is loose with the players joking around but mr roddick is impatient to finish hopping out of his chair before the breaks are over  p m mr roddick has taken the first two sets and is in control of the third no need to await the inevitable im sleepy and need to get home after all i have an article to write in the morning mr boot is a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and author of "war made new weapons warriors and the making of the modern world "
