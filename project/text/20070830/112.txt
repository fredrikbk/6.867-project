wonder land media showers last month though it feels as if it were last year a large snowman got to ask the democratic presidential candidates a question about global warming cnn solicited questions through youtube the amateur video web site because youtube is in some as yet undefined sense "the future " a senior cnn executive said "there are questions that we the journalists we the mainstream media would never think to ask in the presidential debate " thats for sure afterward there was commentary on whether the snowmans video had dumbed down the political process more recently barack obama has had to take time from his day to deal with "i gotta crush on obama " a mildly suggestive video made by what press reports described as an actress then unto us came stories in the political "media" that sen obamas young daughters were upset by the video sen obama spoke of the difficulty of insulating his family from "things like this " these two events however are passing clouds compared to the debate over the role of the media in our time that has enlivened the summer in britain readers will recall that some weeks ago this space discussed tony blairs criticisms of the modern media both newspapers and television the former prime minister said that the ramped up pace of modern news had eroded the quality of public life driving politicians into hasty decision making about public events that are now invariably operating at the level of melodrama in a much discussed speech last week at a large british tv conference jeremy paxman a well known news interviewer for the bbc remarked that the general reaction of the u k media to mr blairs critique was "yah booh youre a politician were media yahoos get over it " he demurred from the herd "im sorry to say but i think theres something in all of these arguments " he urged his colleagues to get a grip and "stand back and ask what were using this medium for " a spate of scandals recently has put british tv at low ebb a bbc promotional clip suggested the queen had walked out in anger from a photo shoot with photographer annie leibowitz false programs on other channels involving viewer telephone participation in quiz shows have been exposed as fraudulent the bbcs news has been embroiled in controversy over the impartiality of its coverage notably in the middle east similar smelly bubbles reached the surface of the media swamp here during the election when cbs and dan rather were unable to verify the authenticity of documents questioning george w bushs national guard service all this has gotten the media into high anxiety over the one thing it presumes to value most the publics trust "the defining problem of contemporary television " the bbcs mr paxman told the tv professionals last week "is trust can you believe what you see on television does television treat people fairly is it healthy for society " fascinating and worthwhile questions to be sure insofar as most opinion polls of how much the american public "trusts" the press tv news or even congress have put their approval ratings in lindsay lohanland but for the media ponderers theres a more troubling issue than the restoration of trust its the possibility that too many people now simply dont much care about the major media anymore normally the great media combines would overcome periods of lassitude by forming up focus groups to tell them what to do next hah they want "survivor" alas living as we do now in a world of seemingly infinite choice it is possible not to care for a seeming infinity of reasons which is why the established media are having such a hard time knowing what to do mr paxman identified one reason not to care "in the last quarter century weve gone from three channels to hundreds the truth is this the more television there is the less any of it matters " once there was a time when tv announcers used to say "stay with us " now no one stays they go surfing endlessly seeking a five minute wave of tv that will take them just a little higher than the five minutes they just watched more difficult are the i dont care revolutionaries who argue that digitization has reversed the media worlds authority and power the old aristocracy of programmers and editors has been overthrown by average people who now blog new political priorities download media and form themselves into clickable communities the snowman wins get over it one part of me likes this scenario some say were living out marshall mcluhans long ago forecasts such as "the circuited city of the future will be an information megalopolis " could be if it is so that these new technologies are redistributing power into millions of liberated hands accessing "what i want when i want it " then we are also cruising toward what another seer predicted in three words "free to choose " that seer of course was milton friedman if indeed the web and microprocessors have brought us to the doorstep of a marshall meets milton world of individual choice as a personal ideology then record companies newspapers and old tv networks arent the only empires at risk public school systems run by static teachers unions may find themselves abandoned by young parents from the snowmans tribe "accessing" k education in unforeseen ways whose politics will that serve big media and big politics are all flying through an electronic meteor shower just now and not all will survive but like "star wars " itll be fun to watch the carnage the gop candidates have their own cnn youtube debate in november most after seeing a snowman dominate the democrats debate have been leery of the format they should be i wouldnt want to argue with a snowman write to henninger wsj com
