property tax flood the second anniversary of hurricane katrina arrived yesterday with the white house disclosing that u s taxpayers have chipped in no less than &# billion including &# billion in tax relief to rebuild the gulf region thats more than the gdp of most nations but we thought wed draw attention to a little discussed issue in new orleans that may well determine how many residents ever return to their homes to wit rising property taxes due to cleaner government of all things property taxes in the city are suddenly rising by hundreds and in some cases thousands of dollars above what they were last year as the times picayune reported three years ago the citys system of assessing property values through seven different tax assessment offices allowed city officials to play favorites the homes of longtime residents were assessed below homes that were recently sold the proof was in the tax rolls neighbors with similar homes often paid very different amounts in property taxes following the times picayunes series the state ordered new orleans to re assess property values throughout the city and voters in one of the seven districts elected reformer nancy marshall to be their tax assessor ms marshall has since taken the lead in assessing homes at their fair market value no more special favors the new tax assessments started coming out in late july and lo they are up an average across the city in ms marshalls district they are up with higher assessments come higher tax bills something homeowners are learning to their dismay since the beginning of the month hundreds of homeowners have shown up at city hall to complain many have attempted to lower their tax bills the old fashioned way by asking their tax assessor for special handling others are lobbying the city council to lower tax rates as it happens the latter is also mandated by the louisiana constitution to stop local governments from collecting tax windfalls when property values spike the state requires local governments to roll back property tax rates in hot housing markets but this being new orleans the city has followed the law in the past by cutting property tax rates only to immediately raise them again mayor ray nagin refuses to rule out playing the same game this year his office wouldnt answer our questions on the issue referring us instead to the citys tax assessors notwithstanding mr nagin there is an opportunity for leadership here the biggest threat facing new orleans beyond another hurricane is that too few people will return to the city the citys population is about of what it was pre katrina and many former residents still seem to prefer living in fema trailers to returning home high property taxes dont help or as former governor huey long once quipped "one day the people of louisiana are going to get good government and they arent going to like it " the city council will likely cut property taxes and council president arnie fielkow is taking the lead in meeting with homeowners to discuss the issue what the council must now decide is whether to give homeowners a strong reason not to flee the city before their property tax bills come due later this year
