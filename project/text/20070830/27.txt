credit crunch markets ride asian banks may face woes amid complex investing a global credit squeeze is raising new questions about exposure to potentially risky u s mortgage debt at some of asias most sophisticated banks overall asian banks have been relatively insulated from the problems stemming from the meltdown in securities related to u s subprime mortgages many of the regions financial institutions are domestically focused havent dabbled much in riskier debt instruments and in some cases are limited in how much they can invest overseas but signs of damage are emerging among a handful of banks that adopted off balance sheet funding vehicles commonly used by banks in the u s and europe some analysts now worry that these leading edge banks will be the most exposed to problems if financial market turmoil continues "the sophisticated end of the market is in trouble " says sunil garg an analyst with j p morgan chase &amp co in hong kong "risk management is what gets tested in a downturn its a skill set you cant acquire by sending someone on a two week training course " dbs group holdings ltd a singapore bank that has been expanding its regional presence this week was forced to inject liquidity into an off balance sheet vehicle that invested in complicated securities such vehicles called conduits raise money by selling short term debt to investors and then investing in other securities in this case exotic bundles of debt called collateralized debt obligations or cdos the market jitters in recent weeks have upended the market for such short term debt called commercial paper and left many banks on the hook to provide direct funding to keep their conduits going dbs admitted that once the conduits holdings were taken into account the banks overall exposure to cdos was &# billion up from the &# million it had previously disclosed however it said none of the conduits cdo investments are directly tied to subprime mortgages dbs notes of its cdos are backed by high quality debt rated triple a or double a and that only &# million of the instruments are tied to u s subprime mortgages it says the bank is "comfortable" with that position and has a strong capital base getting accurate information about conduits and other vehicles is difficult because they are kept off the balance sheet they arent part of banks routine disclosures if credit markets get tighter it could become even more difficult for conduits to keep funding themselves requiring the banks to pony up cash that could affect earnings although generally asian banks have enough capital to support those vehicles if needed mr garg of j p morgan says shares in standard chartered plc a united kingdom based bank with extensive operations in asia last week also came under pressure on concerns about a &# billion structured investment vehicle it manages called whistlejacket capital standard chartered says its exposure to the off balance sheet entity is about &# million and that it manages no other such vehicles outside of singapore banks operating in the less developed financial systems of southeast asia china and india generally dont dabble much in such complicated structures in hong kong conduits and other forms of off balance sheet financing dont appear to be in widespread use a spokesman for the hong kong monetary authority said the regulator "is not aware of any conduits set up by banks in hong kong " but added that if banks did have conduits they would have to consolidate them onto their balance sheet when reporting to regulators based on what the banks have reported subprime securities represent "a very small proportion of the total assets of locally incorporated banks " the spokesman said some of japans large banks make regular use of off balance sheet vehicles for funding called "variable interest entity" conduits they already have done much to disclose their direct exposure to the subprime sector though that hasnt prevented investors from selling off bank shares "from what has been disclosed and based on how we see them positioned we dont think theres a considerable exposure " said jason rogers an analyst at barclays capital in singapore who covers japanese banks mitsubishi ufj financial group inc japans biggest bank by market capitalization has booked a five billion yen &# million loss on subprime loans and says it currently has an exposure of about billion yen or about &# billion the bank says the use of off balance sheet vehicles is part of its normal activities and these vehicles may hold a variety of asset types such as real estate or investment funds that hold japanese stocks and high rated japanese bonds at the end of september the bank had trillion yen &# billion in maximum exposure to the off balance sheet vehicles according a filing it made with the u s securities and exchange commission a spokesman for the bank said the billion yen figure covers the entire group but wouldnt say whether it included exposure to subprime loans through the off balance sheet vehicles another major japanese bank mizuho financial group inc took a million yen write down on subprime investments at its peak the bank had an exposure of about billion yen but it has since sold off almost all of those investments mizuho also has off balance sheet vehicles with a maximum exposure of billion yen &# million at the end of march the bank wouldnt disclose how much of that if any was to subprime loans sumitomo mitsui financial group inc sold off about billion yen in subprime and wrote off several hundred million yen in losses it currently maintains about billion yen in such investments almost all of which is rated triple a tetsu morishima a spokesman for the bank said sumitomo mitsui maintained no off balance sheet vehicles the asian bank with the biggest exposure to subprime securities is bank of china ltd because it has historically dominated chinas market for foreign currency deposit taking and other financial services it has much larger foreign currency investments than other chinese banks and therefore much greater exposure to international market risks reporting its earnings last week bank of china said it had &# billion in investments in subprime related securities on its books and had taken a charge of about &# million to prepare for losses in cdos the exposure figure which exceeds the banks entire first half profit of &# billion was much larger than analysts had been expecting and reinforced longstanding worries about the risk management skills of the chinese state banks several analysts believe that bank of china may end up taking bigger losses on its subprime securities than management now expects thus cutting into its earnings but the subprime exposure which accounts for about of bank of chinas &# billion in foreign currency investments still isnt generally thought to be big enough to threaten the banks financial health and bank of china like other chinese banks funds itself mainly through customer deposits rather than debt sales and so is more insulated from financial market turmoil
