a wireless bounty in the name of fostering competition democrats in congress liberal consumer groups and even the republican led federal communications commission have been calling for more government regulation of the wireless telecom industry but a new survey of the domestic cellular landscape suggests that competition already abounds in a hearing last month the consumers union told congress that "in europe and asia wireless consumers have better choices" and that "instead of innovating the wireless community has become a cozy cartel of a few dominant providers with limited device offerings " more recently the fcc slapped "open access" requirements on a valuable block of spectrum to be auctioned off early next year fcc chairman kevin martin justified the move to "ensure that consumers benefit from innovation and technological advancements " but consumers are doing just fine according to an american consumer institute study released last week comparing u s and foreign telecom markets it concluded that the u s market "offers more choice and is less concentrated than any western countrys wireless market " u s consumers have access to more wireless operators and more devices than consumers anywhere else in the the world and the top three wireless providers in the u s comprise a smaller share of the market than their counterparts in europe and asia americans on average use more than four times as many wireless minutes per month as europeans according to the study reflecting the fact that "u s wireless prices are the lowest in the world with the exception of hong kong " this combination of higher usage at lower prices it says "presents compelling evidence that the overall consumer welfare derived from wireless service is higher in the u s than internationally " in short calls for more telecom rules and regulations are a solution in search of a problem
