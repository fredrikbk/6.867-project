wake forest investment guru uses an old school blueprint like many university endowments wake forest has poured money into esoteric investments such as hedge funds and timberland but louis morrell who manages &# billion for the university is also making big profits off an old school investment plain vanilla mutual funds his strategies which he first developed by trading in his own retirement account have proved lucrative during the past five years the endowments &# million mutual fund portfolio has gained an average a year through june when its fiscal year ends that far outpaces the average annual gain in the standard &amp poors stock index for that time it has been an important enhancer of returns for the schools overall endowment which is one of the top performing in the u s the endowment is up annually for the past five years the fund investment strategy has held up amid the recent turmoil through monday it was down in august whereas the s&amp p was down year to date it is up more than triple the s&amp p s gain "lou is an original thinker " says diana adams a trustee for wake forest and a member of the endowments investment policy committee "and wake forest has profited" from that this year mr morrell intended to step down from overseeing the overall endowment and focus on managing the &# million tactical fund and potentially take on other clients but after a search for a replacement the school asked him to reconsider he agreed on condition he could work several days a week from his house near the beach in wilmington n c mr morrell said it was an easy decision "this is what i do " he says "if i wasnt doing it for the school id be doing it for myself " his moves before and during the recent tumult illustrate his strategy several months ago he exited fidelitys value fund correctly thinking growth stocks were set to outperform he also scaled back on fidelitys leverage company stock fund which had been a top position amid concerns about prospects for companies with heavy debt meanwhile he shifted into fidelitys technology fund betting that tech a sector he feels is undervalued would profit from export growth he moved into fidelitys fund targeting canadian stocks in part as an energy play and fidelity overseas fund as a way to increase his non u s exposure this week he shifted into fidelitys strategic income fund which holds a big slug of high yield bonds a category that has taken a beating mr morrell also runs small accounts for the school using funds from vanguard group "if you take two very risky assets classes that have very low correlations that can give you a higher return without higher risk " mr morrell says "our strategy is to be highly diversified at all times " mr morrell was born and raised in massachusetts and after graduating from babson college with a degree in economics he did a stint in the navy in he began working in the treasurers office at smith college then in he went to the radcliffe institute where his responsibilities for the first time included oversight of the schools endowment a voracious reader of anything related to the markets and investment strategy mr morrell decided having a traditional portfolio simply split between stocks and bonds was a recipe for mediocrity particularly since an endowment might need to earn more than a year to keep up with a schools financial needs when he joined wake forest in the endowment was "very plain " says william greene chairman of the schools board of trustees mr morrell didnt manage money back then rather he developed overall investment strategies and hired other managers to implement them his first move he quickly shifted the endowment into hedge funds which now are about of the endowment timber and other commodities private equity emerging markets and real estate bonds which include emerging market and junk bonds now comprise just of the portfolio in the schools trustees asked what more he could do to further bolster returns and he suggested applying mutual fund trading strategies he had been using in his retirement account "most chief investment officers wouldnt want to put themselves in that position " says mr greene "if you dont perform that kills your credibility " wake gave mr morrell a tiny slice of the endowment &# million to invest and dubbed it the tactical fund the trustees liked what they saw in the fund gained while the s&amp p stock index gained they funneled in more money mr morrell says he takes his cues from broad trends globally for example concerns about the sustainability of energy resources from political instability in the middle east to worries about global warming spurred him to shift into the fidelity natural gas fund which has stable supply and is a cleaner burning fuel the funds biggest holding as of the end of july was fidelitys materials fund at of the tactical fund it is mainly a play exporting companies particularly those that do business in china where he expects the economy to remain strong
