from the pulpit powerful words a city upon a hill by larry witham harperone pages &# a sermon is like a symphony both are first written out and then can be read in words or musical notes studied and discussed as though nothing more were necessary but in the end a sermon is written to be preached just as symphonic music is written to be performed what ultimately determines the quality of both sermons and symphonies is the effect of their performance on a listener for that reason a history of the american sermon has to answer three very different questions what did the preacher say how was it said and how was it received alas in "a city upon a hill " religion journalist larry witham remains cheerfully deaf to those questions for him the sermon is mostly a printed text he seems to have assigned himself the task of going through the vast store of published american sermons and finding the most influential ones which he tidily summarizes then he weaves the summaries into what amounts to a history of the theology contained in the american sermon it is a traditional narrative except this time illustrated by its famous preachers instead of its formal theologians thus we begin with robert hunt the first chaplain at jamestown and move rapidly to the new england puritans their political and spiritual leader john winthrop wrote the sermon "a model of christian charity " which famously begins with a biblical allusion by saying "for wee must consider that wee shall be as a citty upon a hill " we next visit the great awakening and jonathan edwards who roused listeners with "sinners in the hands of an angry god " and then the revolutionary war and the heroic preachers of that era the historical tour races on touching on the wars over darwinism and other charged topics before ending up in the modern era with the work of martin luther king jr jerry falwell and other preachers mr witham does not so to speak preach in fact he tells the story in a carefully bland tone that damps down even the fiery energies that drove sermons about slavery and the civil rights movement he yokes together all this preaching across four centuries by arguing that the principal task of the american sermon has been to articulate the countrys "civil religion " having given his book the subtitle "how sermons changed the course of american history " mr witham asserts that the pulpit has been the point of origin for a host of what he considers particularly american traits and values these include "america as a chosen people " "manifest destiny" and even "the battle between good and evil " which is strange i always understood the task of the sermon as the exposition of the sacred word over five decades of sermon listening i have never once heard anything that sounded like a rallying cry for mr withams "american civil religion " perhaps his experience is different of the actual sermons in "a city upon a hill" and especially their delivery and effect we learn little this is disheartening there are only a few faint moments when mr witham conveys the sense that hearing jonathan edwards or the presbyterian theologian from south carolina james henley thornwell might have been a different experience than hearing say mister rogers mr witham makes us dimly aware that colonial preachers "absorbed adapted and expressed a range of sermon styles" and that radio turned "fiery oratory into conversation " and he is certainly conscious that "the american sermon also has been shaped by its audiences " depending on the "social and economic class" of congregations and their tastes what is maddening is that mr witham seems to have no means of describing what those sermon styles were which class or tastes mattered and how the sermons they shaped compare with anything we might hear today one obvious excuse for treating the sermon as a printed text rather than as a speech event is that we have plenty of printed sermons to choose from but no recordings of speech before but even this is not quite the ironclad excuse it seems the late kenneth cmiels "democratic eloquence the fight over popular speech in nineteenth century america" was a bravura display of how differing styles of political speech could be captured and "heard" by the modern reader especially through handbooks on delivery and patterns of vocabulary we can get a fair idea of what abraham lincoln sounded like by timing out the shorthand transcriptions of his debates with stephen a douglas in lincoln spoke at about words a minute by collecting impressionistic descriptions of his vocal timbre high pitched tenor and by noting that a contemporary likened lincolns voice to that of william mckinley thomas edison recorded the latter mr witham manages to get by without a single citation of "democratic eloquence " so "a city upon a hill" is a book not so much of unanswered questions as of unasked ones why did jonathan edwards in the th century revive the "plain style" of th century sermonizing in all its spareness of form what did revivalist charles grandison finney mean when he boasted that he preached like a lawyer arguing a case before a jury is martin luther kings "i have a dream" speech really a sermon and above all how has the american sermon actually "changed" the country one has to wonder whether in the end the real story of the american sermon is one of a battle between a culture that wanted sermons to approximate a "civil religion" mr withams theme and preachers who aspired to something more spiritual these are questions that it would have been worthwhile for mr witham to spend some time with if he had maybe wed know a little better just what a sermon is and was dr guelzo the director of civil war era studies at gettysburg college in pennsylvania is the author of "abraham lincoln redeemer president" and "lincolns emancipation proclamation"
