target date funds shake up the mix often criticized as too conservative investments that mimic pension plans are adding more exotic and riskier holdings target date mutual funds created as a simple way for people to let someone else manage their retirement savings for them have long been criticized as too conservative to live up to their promise now these funds are finally starting to venture into more exotic territory taking on more risk to boost potential returns target date funds also known as lifecycle funds hold an ever changing mix of other stock and bond funds with the goal of serving as the only investment an employee needs in a k plan the closer the employee gets to retirement age the more conservative the funds investments become in theory locking in the gains from an earlier riskier mix of holdings in the fund the funds have grown rapidly among workers seeking one stop shopping for their retirement savings but investment pros and others have long complained that target date funds are too conservative to build up a nest egg large enough to fund a lengthy retirement now some of these funds are venturing well beyond plain vanilla stocks and investment grade bonds they have added real estate investment trusts or reits stocks from emerging markets such as brazil and russia inflation protected securities commodities and other alternative assets once found mainly in traditional pension plans such investments can be risky on their own but many money managers say that a judicious use of alternative assets can instead reduce risk in a diversified portfolio while enhancing returns the idea is that when some assets decline in value other investments can be expected to gain but as the past few weeks have shown widespread financial upheaval can undermine that diversification theory at least in the short term in target date funds that have added alternative assets these holdings typically make up to of the funds overall investments verizon communications inc offers a k to its managerial employees that includes target date funds the telecom giant recently added to these funds investments such assets as emerging market stocks and global bonds the goal "to pretty much replicate" what is found in verizons traditional pension plan which is available to the companys unionized employees says david beik chief operating officer at verizon investment management which supervises the companys retirement plans principal financial group a major provider of k plans to employers in recent months has added to its target date principal lifetime funds investments in high yield bonds inflation protected treasurys and emerging market stocks including russias oao gazprom "theres nothing wrong" with target date funds that stick to a basic mix of stocks bonds and cash says mike finnegan chief investment officer at principal financials principal funds group "but we argue that you can do better by adding nontraditional assets because you reduce the risk" and boost the return "when we talk to cfos who are involved in their companys retirement plans they always wonder why the pension plan assets they can get arent part of the lifecycle funds" in their k plans mr finnegan adds while alternative assets typically carry higher fees for investors fund companies say they have largely managed to keep costs from escalating inside their target date funds charles schwab corp says that with assets of more than &# billion in its target date schwab managed retirement trust funds the firm has been able to negotiate lower fees with outside money managers overseeing newly introduced alternative assets schwabs fee on its target date funds ranges from to of assets under management schwab is also absorbing some added costs when the firm added a multisector bond vehicle that owns assets such as emerging market debt and bank loans schwab opted to "take a small hit" to the funds revenue to keep fees unchanged says john sturiale director at charles schwab investment services target date funds are particularly useful for workers who dont want to figure out what investments to buy you need only pick a planned retirement date verizon for instance offers a series of target date funds with maturity dates stretching out to in five year increments workers who expect to retire in say would invest in the fund that fund in the earlier years owns a larger percentage of alternative assets but grows increasingly conservative as the worker ages target date funds currently hold some &# billion in retirement plan assets according to financial research corp a big jump from &# billion at the end of a soon to be released survey by hewitt associates shows that of large and midsize companies now offer target date funds in their k s up from in target date funds represent just a fraction of the total &# trillion invested in k plans but the funds are expected to grow rapidly following passage last year of the federal pension protection act that law has prompted many employers to begin automatically enrolling workers in k plans and automatically defaulting them into target date funds unless they choose to select their own investments although the department of labor is still working on the rules the pension act will generally shield employers from liability issues if they default workers retirement savings into certain types of investments including target date funds previously companies had been reluctant to do this because they were concerned about state laws that prohibited businesses from withholding money without an employees consent often workers dont realize that alternative assets are being added to their target date funds "thats why we hired principal to make these kinds of decisions " says kline wilkins vice president of operations and a member of the retirement plan committee at bruker axs a madison wis maker of analytical x ray equipment which moved its k plan to principal financial in june bruker gave its employees the option to choose their own k investments or be defaulted into the principal lifetime funds mr wilkins says adding that have chosen the target date route some companies are customizing their retirement plans to include alternative assets devon energy corp will soon launch a new plan that will be made up solely of target date funds the oklahoma city energy company says it is hiring individual money managers to oversee the investments and "we have moved away somewhat from traditional assets to put in some alternative assets like reits and treasury inflation protected securities " says paul poley vice president of human relations "we want it professionally managed much like" a pension plan mr poley says all new hires starting in october will be defaulted into the appropriate target date fund based on their expected retirement date fidelity investments target date freedom funds invests in various other fidelity mutual funds it recently added to the mix the fidelity strategic real return fund which owns a variety of investments designed to hedge against inflation ranging from treasurys to commodities and floating rate loans earlier this year fidelity restructured the bond component to hold a small taste of emerging market and high yield debt fidelitys moves are designed "to help savers do a better job of managing against their future liability the stream of income they need" to live on in retirement says jonathan shelon a co portfolio manager at the freedom funds not all retirement plan administrators agree its a good idea to add alternative assets to target date funds so they resemble pension plans "the argument that tailoring these plans with exotic asset classes" to match what pensions do "is not something im sure i go along with " says john ameriks a principal at vanguard group inc he says all you need do is look at the troubles many pension plans have had in recent years "to realize there are some question marks with these strategies " mr ameriks says vanguards target date funds dont have dedicated exposure to alternative assets though some are included as part of the overall portfolio for instance vanguards exposure to the total u s stock market includes reit holdings and the international equity allocation includes exposure to emerging markets while many k plans offer stand alone mutual funds that provide access to some of the same alternative assets such as reits inflation protected bonds and emerging market stocks financial advisors say employees are generally better off putting their money in target date funds thats because workers can often misuse the stand alone funds diving in with a large portion of their portfolio only after some sector has posted big gains then rushing out only after the sector has already fallen bigger nest eggs a once simple mutual fund for retirement savings is getting more complex target date funds are expected to gain much wider use as employees principal k investment plan providers have been adding alternative assets such as emerging market securities to boost the funds returns employers say increasingly sophisticated target date funds more closely resemble traditional pension plans
