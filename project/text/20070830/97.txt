suits focus on secret computer industry fees a federal investigation into alleged kickbacks paid by computer vendors on government contracts may force high tech companies in marketing partnerships to change the way they do business with each other the pressure for change is coming from a series of whistle blower suits in u s district court in little rock ark by a former employee of accenture ltd a big computer outsourcing and consulting firm the suits contend that most computer industry players regularly violate the anti kickback act of by forming marketing partnerships involving what some companies call "influencer fees" or "referral fees" payments or discounts that pass between companies doing business together on federal contracts but arent revealed to the government the companies argue that the payments at issue are common rebate and discount programs widely used in their industry and others however some believe the little rock suits may ultimately prompt the companies to stop such payments or at least disclose them to the government which spends &# billion a year on information technology the suits were filed in but were sealed until april when the justice department intervened in separate suits charging accenture hewlett packard co and sun microsystems inc with violations other suits remain sealed this month two companies settled charges in the first resolutions of the little rock cases international business machines corp agreed to pay &# million and pricewaterhousecoopers will pay &# million to settle allegations that they "solicited and provided improper payments and other things of value on technology contracts with government agencies " according to the justice department pricewaterhousecoopers a big accounting firm said the settlement involved its former technology consulting subsidiary which it sold to ibm in each company said that it didnt do anything illegal and that it cooperated with the government but declined further comment people familiar with the little rock cases say more settlements are coming the justice department says only that there is a "larger ongoing investigation " charles tiefer a government contracts expert at the university of baltimore school of law and a former deputy general counsel of the house of representatives predicts that many tech companies that have had partnerships with the defendants "may very well decide to change their practices and they may want to settle with the government " the governments legal actions may prompt questions from big technology buyers at private companies "a smart buyer is going to look harder to make sure costs and discounts are all disclosed " says thom rubel director of idc government insights a research and consulting firm that follows government contracts technology companies routinely announce marketing partnerships between computer services firms and makers of hardware and software but the financial incentives tied to the deals are usually closely guarded secrets when buying new information technology government agencies such as the postal service the army and the state department frequently hire computer services firms like accenture to take care of buying software and hardware and writing new software to make it all work seamlessly these so called systems integrators "are entrusted and retained to act as the governments independent third party objective advisors " in buying computers and software one suit says separately the general services administration signs agreements with hardware and software companies putting them on approved purchase lists for all agencies contracts in return the vendors guarantee they will give the government the lowest available prices and fully disclose all their costs in selecting suppliers for a contract computer services firms usually pick from these lists the government backing the whistle blowers contends that marketing partnerships created an "undisclosed conflict of interest" for the systems integrators the complaint suggests that instead of simply selecting the best products the firms could potentially be influenced by vendors partnership payments or discounts which arent passed on to the government the government argues such fees and discounts are kickbacks which are illegal under the anti kickback act of the act defines kickbacks as money or "compensation of any kind" provided to a government contractor to "improperly" reward favorable treatment the act says its illegal to give or solicit such payments and to include any kickback amount in the contract price the government maintains that accenture signed agreements with numerous suppliers under which accenture would receive fees or get discounts if accenture selected them to sell products to the government in a statement accenture said "we are confident that we have acted appropriately and in compliance with the law we intend to defend our position vigorously and expect to prevail " no trial date has been set accenture partners named in the suit but not specifically charged include dell inc cisco corp and ncr corp dell said the government decided to dismiss any charges against it it said it doesnt comment on relationships with partners like accenture cisco said "as of now" it isnt directly involved in the case and declined further comment ncr said it doesnt comment on litigation issues alan chvotkin general counsel of the professional services council a washington trade group that includes many of the services firms named in the suit says of partnership agreements "i dont think they are kickbacks the justice department has litigators so they pick the most loaded phrase " he says that in complex computer contracts where services firms often manage computer and software procurements for years the government encourages "teaming arrangements" so the services firms can obtain the best products nevertheless he concedes companies will be "talking to their lawyers" about how to change their practices of paying partners who refer them business according to the complaint one of the whistle blowers norman rille first learned of the industry practice of making payments to partners in return for business when he worked on private industry contracts for teradata corp a unit of ncr of dayton ohio there he saw partnership agreements involving clients in the private sector but later he saw payments that were involved in government contracts as well while at accenture in he saved a powerpoint presentation filed as evidence in the case showing that ncr would pay accenture up to of the contract value for new installations and for repeat business much of the business was at private companies but some was with federal agencies the complaint says that mr rille "learned" that the payments "were always to be kept confidential and never disclosed to customers " mr rilles attorney who filed the whistle blower suit von g packard of packard packard &amp johnson los altos calif declined to make mr rille available to comment under the government false claims act whistle blowers technically known as "relators" can receive from to of the damages recovered in such suits if the justice department intervenes william carroll a lawyer with dykema gossett pllc in washington who teaches government contract law at american university says that independent whistle blowers are successful only about of the time but when the justice department believes a case is good enough to intervene the suits are successful around of the time a person familiar with the accenture case said that the plaintiffs are likely to argue that the kickback payments led the government to overpay many millions of dollars for computers or software if that argument prevails the government could potentially demand substantial refunds if the companies lose at trial they are likely to argue that damages should be limited to the amount of the partnership fees which would be much smaller according to an industry lawyer justice department filings in the cases dont specify how much the kickbacks may have cost the government however in the case the department filed against hewlett packard it cited numerous payments that h p refers to as "influencer fees " according to the court papers h p in paid &# to accenture &# to capgemini a paris based outsourcing and consulting company and &# to gtsi corp a chantilly va systems integrator capgemini said it hasnt been charged and doesnt comment on investigations into other companies gtsi didnt respond to emails in a statement h p said it "is confident its business practices are appropriate we plan to vigorously defend this action and look forward to demonstrating that h p has done nothing wrong " the justice department says such fees undermine the contract process for example the government says companies that sun called its "government alliance partners" received "a back end rebate of in return for" a sun sale sun also paid rebates under its "competitive knock out program" if a partner persuaded a government organization to replace a customers systems with sun products the government said sun paid "millions of dollars" to its partners in to under these programs which werent revealed to the government in a statement sun said it "has not paid kickbacks" and that the rebate and discount programs at issue "were conducted in an open and aboveboard manner "
