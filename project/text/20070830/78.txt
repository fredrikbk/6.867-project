politics &amp economics pakistani leaders closer to political deal president expected to trade army post for bhutto support pakistan president pervez musharraf and former prime minister benazir bhutto have reached a pivotal point in negotiations to strike a power sharing arrangement that could permit gen musharraf to remain the countrys leader despite a sharp decline in his popular support conceding to a key demand from ms bhutto gen musharraf has decided to give up his powerful post as army chief before the end of the year say officials in his government as leader of the largest political party in pakistan ms bhuttos backing is important for gen musharrafs efforts to win popular support for his government and policies this week in london top aides to gen musharraf held several rounds of meetings with ms bhutto and other leaders of her pakistan peoples party that could pave the way for both politicians to have leadership roles in pakistans next government u s officials welcomed news of a deal between gen musharraf and ms bhutto viewing it as a crucial step in stabilizing pakistan and continuing counterterrorism efforts senior officials in the bush administration say they have urged pakistans president to pursue dialogue with all of pakistans moderate political leaders including ms bhutto and former prime minister nawaz sharif in a sign of this support they note that senior american officials met ms bhutto during her visit to washington and new york earlier this month after years of largely ignoring her during u s trips "i dont know if were pushing for a deal specifically with bhutto but weve been looking for ways for musharraf to widen his base " said a u s official working on pakistan "maybe in the absence of any other options thats what youre encouraging " many current and former u s officials have raised reservations about ms bhuttos return to political prominence in pakistan during her years in power they say her governments developed reputations for rampant corruption and poor economic and fiscal management not all members of ms bhuttos party have been pleased with the power sharing negotiations with some threatening to resign if gen musharraf doesnt doff his uniform before a presidential election expected next month in which the president is expected to seek a new five year term details of any prospective deal havent been disclosed in an interview with the associated press in london yesterday ms bhutto was quoted as saying "i expect that gen musharraf will step down as army chief before the presidential elections but that is for the president to say " a senior federal minister sheikh rashid ahmed said the president would announce his decision this week the outcome of the power sharing talks could be crucial for both political leaders and for pakistan the year old gen musharraf who came to power in a coup has been weakened through repeated political crises and is under threat from militant islamist groups as well as a growing pro democracy movement unhappy with his military backed authoritarian rule gen musharraf would benefit from the support of ms bhuttos party because in pakistans political system the president is elected by an electoral college drawn from the national parliament and provincial assemblies ms bhutto has sought a way back into pakistans political arena after years of exile overseas following the corruption allegations such circumstances have driven the talks between the two former political foes gen musharraf in the past has vowed not to allow ms bhutto to return to pakistan but now their interests appear to have aligned gen musharraf is constitutionally required to call for an election between sept and oct after the presidential election a parliamentary election is expected to be held later this year or early in the party that wins a plurality of seats chooses pakistans prime minister pakistans law bars gen musharraf from holding his current dual posts as president and army chief beyond november unless changes are made in the constitution ms bhutto who served two separate terms as prime minister in the late s and mid s also faces obstacles in her quest to return to political power in pakistan including a rule passed by gen musharrafs government barring prime ministers from serving more than two terms there is no indication so far that gen musharraf intends to drop the ban as part of any power sharing deal with ms bhutto the bush administration has remained a staunch backer of gen musharraf through the current political turmoil u s officials have said they favor free and fair elections in pakistan but they also have expressed concern about the rise of islamic extremism proponents of a musharraf bhutto pact say it aims to minimize political turbulence ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections yet the possible alliance has already provoked strong opposition from those left out of the deal including mr sharif he has said he has felt betrayed by ms bhuttos talks with gen musharraf now living in london mr sharif has pledged to return to pakistan in the next two weeks last week pakistans supreme court ruled that mr sharif could return home "the musharraf bhutto alliance would further aggravate the current political crisis " said ijaz hussain a former professor of social sciences at quaid e azam university in islamabad gen musharraf confronts his own set of challenges he has long resisted widespread demands including some from within his own government to give up the top job in pakistans powerful military as the supreme court begins to hear a case to decide whether he can run for civilian office while he continues to serve as military chief his supporters are worrying that gen musharraf may not get a sympathetic hearing earlier this year he tried to oust the supreme courts chief justice fueling a pro democracy movement that has since increased opposition to gen musharrafs
