capital new bank capital requirements helped to spread credit woes even before the current financial firestorm passes the search for people and institutions to blame has begun greed and hubris overtook common sense and propriety excessively easy credit overwhelmed good judgment and fueled a housing bubble profit grubbing crooks took advantage of unsophisticated home buyers rating services blew it government overseers couldnt keep up with financial innovation u s regulators let shady subprime lenders slip through cracks in archaic rules european bank regulators were blind the right answer will prove to be some combination of the above one culprit however has gone unnoticed a sweeping change in international rules governing the capital banks must hold by requiring banks to boost the capital held in reserve against the loans carried on their books the rules encouraged banks to get rid of those loans by turning them into securities to be sold to investors banks took the hint thats complicating the federal reserves efforts to put out the current fire for more than years a club of central bankers has been tinkering with rules known as basel for the swiss city in which officials meet to get banks to hold more capital so they can absorb major losses without threatening the financial system details are so technical that only insiders pay attention most of the time thats just fine the battles over the rules typically have had more to do with banks and countries jockeying for advantage than anything that mattered to borrowers in boise or bremen the rules are rooted in the worries of wise men like paul volcker the former fed chairman that banks didnt have enough capital an especially acute concern after germanys herstatt bank defaulted on obligations to foreign banks in and the u s government rescue of big continental illinois national bank &amp trust in the solution a international accord required banks in countries where national authorities adopted the rules to hold more capital if they make riskier loans and investments a bank that loans &# million to other solid banks needs only &# million in capital a bank that loans &# million to ordinary companies needs &# million capital banks are a special case theyre traditionally at the center of the financial system bank panics led congress to create the fed in and government insurance of bank deposits means most depositors neednt worry if their banks make foolish loans that can give bankers a heads we win tails you lose incentive to gamble that regulators must monitor the original basel rules were crude overwhelmed when banks figured out how to game them and were recently revised the rules did succeed in getting banks to strengthen their financial footing they did reduce the risks most banks take was that the intention yes is that always a good outcome well maybe not among other things the rules required banks to hold more capital against an ordinary mortgage than against pools of mortgages turned into securities so banks sold off individual mortgages and many replaced them with securities comprising pools of mortgages between and these mortgage backed securities rose to more than of bank assets from this huge change in finance has advantages banks still make loans and hold them but are more likely to originate and distribute loans as a result much of the risk of delinquencies on mortgages in inner city detroit isnt shouldered by local banks but has been shifted to investors all over the world how many of these hot potatoes may actually return to bank balance sheets is a question for another column short answer more than some bankers would like it turns out the folks who hold mortgage backed securities are forced to be much quicker than banks are to acknowledge reality when the value of the collateral for loans drops and banks now behave more like securities firms more likely to mark down the value of assets when market prices fall even to distressed levels rather than sitting on bad loans for a decade and pretending theyll be paid back its a huge contrast to the bad old days of the early s when big new york banks found themselves holding lots of bad loans to latin american governments and took years to write them down or when japanese banks reluctance to admit the size of their bad loans problem paralyzed japans economy but it may have some unwelcome effects banks arent the shock absorbers they once were at a moment of market panic because they hold fewer loans on their books banks dont have the ability to say "these mortgages are more likely to be paid off than the market thinks today and well just hold on until the market comes to its senses " instead the holders of mortgage backed securities are dumping them pushing down the price this forces other leveraged players those backed by borrowed money to sell their holdings and if not interrupted an economically devastating downward spiral can take hold the fed is now laboring to prevent such an outcome but its tools are designed with banks in mind not for a world in which banks have shifted risks to all sorts of other leveraged investors who are now forced to be obsessed with the value of their collateral the fed which was an enthusiastic proponent of these risk based capital standards and securitization is trying to prime the banking pump to put out the fire ironically its discovering thats harder because of unappreciated consequences of the basel rules that were intended to make the banking system more fire resistant mr wessel responds to
