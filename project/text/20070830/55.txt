microsoft and its rivals take office politics global ente nazionale italiano di unificazione or uni italys national standard setting body handles such matters as drawing up specifications for water tanks and establishing the proper diameter of nuts and bolts its work rarely draws a crowd that changed this spring when a uni subcommittee began to consider a bid by microsoft corp to win its support for the file format used in new versions of its ubiquitous office software microsoft is seeking to make that format an international standard for creating and storing computer documents within months a technical committee of some half dozen members ballooned to no fewer than italians opponents say microsoft packed the committee with its allies the redmond wash giant levels a similar charge at its critics saying rival international business machines corp is playing the same game in other national committees to block the office formats approval as a world wide standard ahead of a key deadline sunday that the work of an obscure italian committee on the codes that tell a computer how to turn bits of data into business letters spreadsheets and presentations has drawn the feverish attention of technologys largest players speaks to the stakes surrounding microsofts delicate pas de deux with governments around the world nowhere are those stakes higher than in europe where microsoft awaits a critical court ruling next month in its long running antitrust battle with european union regulators ahead of that ruling microsoft is taking pains to persuade officials that it is playing nice in the giant markets for computer software it dominates thats in part why it cares about the work of italys uni and other national standards bodies to gain approval as an international standard microsoft had to bare the code that undergirds the office file format called open xml making that public could help microsoft persuade eu regulators that the company is allowing competitors to work openly with office which includes mainstays like word excel and powerpoint microsoft has been beleaguered by charges that it keeps formats and key pieces of computer code secret to freeze out competitors microsoft has racked up &# billion in fines to the eu partly over claims it does just that with its windows operating system a european court in luxembourg is expected on sept to rule on microsofts appeal of the european commissions charges the ruling is being scrutinized as a barometer for the eus future moves against microsoft either side can appeal to europes highest tribunal the court of justice if the eu prevails it could be emboldened to bring future actions against the software titan eu regulators are already looking into a separate complaint by rivals that microsoft abused its office software dominance blocking competitors from the market because before the introduction of open xml it used file formatting it wouldnt broadly share without knowing precisely how word documents are formatted for example competitors cant effectively market a word alternative that can faithfully read and write its documents microsoft says the new open xml format is open to everyone and doesnt pose the kind of concerns raised by older office file formats opponents say open xml is a wolf in sheeps clothing a format thats nominally open but which is actually so complex and so loaded with microsoft specific features that no one but microsoft can use it fully ratification of open xml as an international standard would provide substantial support for microsofts argument jean paoli one of microsofts top standards experts says the company wants open xml adopted as a standard to encourage rivals to use its format not squelch interoperability he points out that other vendors including apple inc are adopting it he says ibm is stirring up opposition to open xmls gaining approval from the international organization for standardization or iso to protect its lotus notes office suite which uses the rival format open document "it is very bizarre to see ibm try to block everyone from using" open xml mr paoli says open document is already an iso standard but microsoft says theres room enough for more than one document standard an ibm spokesman declined to address microsofts accusations for years microsofts office file formats were closely guarded secrets rivals have decoded portions enabling them to open and save office documents but the translation isnt perfect that has made it hard for corporations to use rival products because they need documents to look the same all the time microsofts sales of office products total around &# billion a year placing it alongside windows as a company cash cow some half billion users create office formatted documents countless billions of office documents reside in the hard disks networks and archives of the worlds computers the scramble over standards has become remarkably contentious countries like italy that participate in iso have until sunday to submit their votes on open xml to the organization setting a standard is complex countries have national bodies represented at iso one of the requirements for a standard to pass is that no more than one quarter of the countries can vote against it the requirement has given rise to an stampede to win votes in every corner of the globe each country has its peculiar membership rules for the national committees that decide whether to support a standard some let all comers join perhaps requiring a fee others have strict nominating procedures on mauritius an island nation in the indian ocean some miles off the east coast of africa the national standards body is governed by a small council one member is a microsoft sales manager though hell have to recuse himself from the final vote according to the agencys director microsofts network of resellers is also active microsoft resellers sit on standards bodies or technical committees in several countries including kenya and portugal microsoft portugal executive miguel sales dias is chairman of the technical standards committee there rui seabra an open xml opponent also on the committee says the group was dominated by microsoft allies the committee was opened to a dozen new members including both microsoft supporters and opponents but ibm and sun microsystems inc major open xml foes were turned away for lack of space mr seabra says mr dias "was bullying the meeting toward a vote " debate was cut off after the third session he says in the end open xml was approved besides mr dias five committee members were microsoft resellers according to the standards bodys roster mr dias says he disagrees with mr seabras assessment "i was just chairing a meeting like i have done for many more of these meetings " said mr dias who has also worked on digital image standards "it happens that i am a microsoft employee " tom robertson microsofts top standards official said the company has had a "dialogue" with resellers and others about getting involved in standards committees but he said "i dont think that there would be so much drama around this had ibm not led an international charge" to oppose open xml in addition mr robertson said the technical committees should include lots of voices and that means some on microsofts side "where you find expansion in the committees you will find expansion on both sides " he said "thats ok because it represents the community a whole lot better " microsoft has urged its allies in several countries to lobby standards groups ahead of their iso votes a coterie of rival groups and companies some backed by ibm is swinging into action too many in the anti microsoft camp are partisans of "open source" software which can be freely modified and shared they swap rumors and information about committee workings on web sites "the warring parties have recruited as much as they could " says italian committee member leonardo chiariglione explaining the sudden bloat in italys standards committee which has an ibm employee as president mr chiariglione a digital media consultant long active in standards organizations abstained "the ballot had reached such a level of acrimony and it was so politicized that i did not want to take sides " he said regulatory wrangling microsofts run ins with u s and european antitrust authorities august
