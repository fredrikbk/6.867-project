china hurdle lack of refrigeration inability to safely move food long distances raises concerns shanghai its a scene that james rice head of the china operations of tyson foods inc has seen numerous times in his three years with the poultry giant there tons of featherless frozen chickens loaded on the backs of flatbed trucks under thick blankets in the summer heat awaiting a long haul journey across china "its my achilles heel " says mr rice he says the lack of everything from temperature controlled trucks and warehouses to a shortage of general refrigeration know how limits tyson to a handful of major cities in china "i can only sell in the areas where i know ill get trucks that are going to keep my products at minus celsius " he says that lack of infrastructure known in the industry as a cold chain poses problems for china and the western companies that see opportunity in its growing consumer culture without it many kinds of food drugs and a host of other products can be shipped only short distances and without it china may find it difficult to improve its stained image on food safety a cold chain encompasses everything from cooling vegetables as they are harvested to transporting goods in refrigerated trucks to storing goods in cold warehouses or keeping them in freezers or refrigerators at the store a break in the chain can result in sick consumers and economic loss from spoiled foods vaccines that are accidentally frozen or exposed to heat can lose their potency and in some cases even be harmful to patients consulting firm a t kearney estimates that more than &# billion would have to be invested for china to have an efficient and safe food distribution system in place costs that would be borne by companies and in many cases be passed on to consumers but the payoff is lucrative food industry executives estimate that china loses about of its produce and meat between the source and the consumer a t kearney estimates the economic losses from the lack of proper cold chain in china is about &# billion a year until now "everyone agreed it was the right issue but they werent willing to step up to actually do something because there was no crisis " says james morehouse a senior partner at a t kearney and a food industry veteran who has been working on developing a fuller cold chain since given the new pressure on chinas safety record "now perhaps theres enough of a crisis that they will actually step up and do something " he says processed meat maker hormel foods corp of austin minn prefers to contract out its logistics as it does in the u s but its research when it first entered the market years ago showed china didnt offer that option says edward cheung hormels director of business development in china "so we had to do it on our own " he says now about half of the deliveries in china are done through logistics companies but the costs for such services are still higher he says mr cheung believes improvements are on the way as companies such as hormel require strict cold chain services and retailers and food service companies increasingly push suppliers to observe the cold chain one cold chain logistics provider u s based world courier management inc this month expanded its service coverage in china to major cities from a dozen cities before a process begun about a year ago its main business is in transporting pharmaceutical products and blood or other biological specimens at strictly controlled temperature for clinical trials during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars four years ago the company shipped human serum stool and urine samples from hong kong to germany and the u s and has also transported the bird flu virus from china to the u s says henning voss world couriers north asia director mr voss said the first problem was to find reliable partners in the cities "the second step was to then educate them " he says "we felt that a lot of times the awareness just was not there the awareness that the things have to be packaged a certain way " a manager at henan luohe shineway industry group co a big chinese meat processor controlled by a goldman sachs group inc investment arm says what was once a challenge for the company has become its strength "at the beginning the trucks we bought were just to deliver our own products but the logistics network wasnt well established and the understanding about cold chain was pretty low now weve succeeded in eliminating return trips with empty trucks " says jin haitao a manager at shineways logistics arm more than of its refrigerated trucks crisscross china with a utilization rate about of the business is to deliver shineways own products and the rest is for other firms mr jin says today china has about refrigerated trucks and million cubic feet of cold storage according to a t kearney to serve chinas growing middle class with effective safety levels china would need refrigerated trucks and five billion cubic feet of cold storage by when the chinese middle class is expected to spend around &# billion on food that market is about &# billion today the firm estimates in china if you want a proper cold chain "you pretty much have to do it yourself " says steven wolfe managing director of shanghai based allfresh manufacturing co which makes cooling equipment for postharvest temperature management of fresh fruits vegetables and flowers he says the lack of equipment among end users limits the market for other elements of a cold chain "you cant just start cooling stuff because when it gets to retail they dont have the facility to keep it chilled " he says but he has seen a change in the governments rhetoric this year on food safety issues and is even getting verbal promises from a local government near shanghai for subsidized loans in exchange for setting up a factory in their city in shanghai the government is launching chinas first standards on cold chain logistics the new standards which are expected to take effect in october indicate temperature control requirements throughout distribution according to an official at the shanghai municipal bureau of quality and technical supervision
