bills online but when she got a disconnection notice from her phoenix electric utility arizona public service she realized a payment had gone awry somehow in the past she would have scooted over to a nearby utility office to make the late payment but the utility has shut down most of its neighborhood offices and relies on a network of retail stores and check cashing facilities to receive in person

interest "payday loans" a business that consumer advocates say often preys on low income people in dire financial straits "why aps needs to use this sort of place to accept payments i dont know " she says it is an experience that is increasingly common for utility customers across the u s utilities have shut down scores of customer service centers in recent years and turned to retail outlets to take payments in order to save money many of these locations are check cashing centers which cater to mainly low income customers who dont use traditional banks providing services such as loans and wire transfers on a fee basis the trend has sparked criticism from utility customers regulators and consumer advocates customers say they miss the local centers where they were able to get personal service such as arranging special payment plans and some are simply uncomfortable going to check cashing facilities but perhaps of greatest concern is that check cashing facilities may be using utilities to build foot traffic so they can steer consumers into expensive and addictive loan products that can carry annual interest rates in excess of at least one operator of check cashing centers
