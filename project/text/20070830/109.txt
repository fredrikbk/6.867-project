unknown enemies an iraqi general faces risk from within his ranks mahdi militia stymies u s security push new ceasefire questioned baghdad early this month brig gen falah hassan kinbar barely escaped a kidnap attempt by the mahdi army a radical shiite militia during the attack more than a dozen of the moderate shiite generals own men betrayed him switching sides to aid the militia fighters u s officials say when it was over gen kinbars superiors seemed to distance themselves from him he says the day after the attack as the clock in a dingy u s chow hall here approached midnight gen kinbar sat with the man who seemed to be his only friend a year old american officer from long island n y "i am all alone on the battlefield " the general told lt col steven miska through an interpreter "i want to do my duty but i am very sure my own government will abandon me " gen kinbar pleaded with col miska to help him relocate his wife and two children "any country any country any country " he said breaking into english the two men talked for four hours amid the soft clatter of a rat foraging for food col miska promised he would try to help the general "is one of the few military commanders up here who refuses to violate his principles and work with the mahdi army " said col miska "thats why they want to kill him " u s commanders intent on building capable iraqi security forces and a competent iraqi government say their efforts are increasingly being stymied by the radical shiite mahdi army the group emerged in to defend shiite neighborhoods from attacks by sunni insurgents today the mahdi army has infiltrated iraqs government and society so deeply that the americans are struggling to distinguish friend from foe the militias political arm controls several iraqi ministries and is a fractious member of the shiite dominated ruling coalition in baghdad yesterday its leader the anti american cleric moqtada al sadr ordered a six month suspension of all mahdi army activities so that he can "rehabilitate" the force u s officials say mr sadrs announcement is an acknowledgment that the militias rogue elements which have attacked u s forces sunnis and even moderate shiites are sapping support for his movement among iraqis some u s officials doubted mr sadrs ability to rein in the renegade fighters others questioned his sincerity yesterdays announcement was made by an iraqi cleric and aide to mr sadr who just three weeks ago u s officials say participated in the mahdi army operation to kidnap gen kinbar to counter the mahdi armys influence over iraqs army and police forces u s commanders have focused on strengthening relationships with moderate shiites like gen kinbar but for iraqi officers standing up to the mahdi army often means taking huge risks that isolate them from fellow officers and put their families in danger "if we are not standing by falah hes got nobody " says col miska using gen kinbars first name "he has cast his lot " a few months ago mr sadr the mahdi army leader agreed to entreaties from the iraqi government to lessen his anti american fervor and not fight the u s troops surging into baghdad since then the group has splintered into factions that often battle each other the groups activities range from aid projects to assassinations say u s officials as prime minister nouri al malikis government has teetered in recent weeks the mahdi army seems to have stepped up efforts to consolidate power say u s military officials in ghaziliya a baghdad neighborhood the mahdi army arrays forces around fuel stations levying a "security tax" on owners and denying sunnis fuel says col miska mahdi fighters have infiltrated the major food distribution warehouse on baghdads west side and shortchange sunnis of rations u s officials say elsewhere mahdi army forces have "infected pieces of the local government" to deny sunnis health care water and electricity says maj scott nelson operations officer for a soldier brigade in baghdad armor piercing bombs used primarily by the mahdi army accounted for three quarters of american deaths and injuries in july u s commanders say mr sadr yesterday called on mahdi fighters to halt such attacks today few districts in baghdad are more important to the mahdi army than kadhimiya the area where col miska and gen kinbar are charged with maintaining security kadhimiya home to more than iraqis and the citys holiest shiite shrine has become a major center of shiite political and economic power rival shiite factions compete to dominate the area around the shrine which draws hundreds of thousands of pilgrims a year mahdi fighters also use the shiite district as a base to launch attacks against sunnis u s officials say col miska a year old infantry officer arrived in kadhimiya in november for his second iraq tour the son of a vietnam veteran he grew up in a rural part of long island n y and attended the u s military academy at west point at his fathers urging he has a calm demeanor rarely raising his voice he worries deeply about what will happen to his iraqi translators when u s forces leave so far of the translators have applied for u s visas with his help two have received them shortly after col miska assumed command the senior iraqi commander in kadhimiya was arrested by u s forces for cooperating with the mahdi army in january he was replaced by gen kinbar who is also gen kinbar who is trim with a neat black mustache grew up in baghdad and spent most of his adult life in the iraqi army special forces he says he hated saddam hussein but loved the discipline of army life prior to the war he says he got along well with fellow officers both sunni and shiite although his wife and daughter both wear traditional muslim head covering he isnt devoutly religious and often regales col miska with stories of baghdads nightclubs from the late s and early s when baghdad fell he briefly took a job with the international red cross as a security adviser he loved the work and mixing with people from places like australia great britain and germany "those people all cared about all of humanity " he says but when the organization cut its staff in iraq amid the growing chaos gen kinbar was laid off in he rejoined the iraqi army the shiite officer helped lead operations against sunni insurgents in northern and western iraq in he accepted the job as the military commander in kadhimiya "in kadhimiya i knew there would be a lot of political interference in military operations " he says on april americans learned the mahdi army was holding an underground court to discipline renegade members near the shrine in kadhimiya several key mahdi army leaders that the u s wanted to detain were there col miska says as u s troops approached the shrine they came under withering fire and called for iraqi army help gen kinbar told his battalion commanders to join the fight none came to help the americans they did however help the mahdi army some of gen kinbars soldiers stripped off their uniforms and passed their weapons to the mahdi fighters according to u s officials that evening with the battle still raging col miska gen kinbar and baha al araji leader of the parliamentary bloc loyal to mr sadr all met at camp justice the joint u s iraqi base gen kinbar brokered an agreement in which u s troops withdrew from around the shrine and his iraqi troops took their place although eight mahdi army fighters were killed in the fighting and the u s suffered no casualties the battle was a defeat for u s forces col miska says in the days following the battle mosque loudspeakers blared that u s forces had tried to destroy the shrine "our relationship with the population was greatly damaged because of the gun battle " he says meanwhile gen kinbars close relationship with col miska put him at risk he says he began receiving threatening cellphone calls throughout july and august gen kinbar and col miska met regularly in the chow hall on the american side of the joint base col miska says he could see his friend was "walking a tightrope " on aug five days before pilgrims descended on the kadhimiya shrine gen kinbar met with col miska and his boss col j b burton the mahdi army had painted murals of iraqi flags on cement barriers in kadhimiya at the bottom of the barriers they stenciled "a gift to the iraqi people from the mahdi army " col burton didnt want the mahdi army to get any credit for providing security during the pilgrimage and asked gen kinbar to paint over the signs gen kinbar politely refused "if i paint over the signs i will get calls from or politicians " he said "miska painted over some signs and nothing happened to him " col burton retorted "they cannot send him to jail " gen kinbar replied the following day gen kinbar was summoned by mr al araji the lawmaker to an a m meeting to discuss plans for providing security for the massive aug pilgrimage no u s officials were invited the meeting was attended by more than people including some militia leaders on the u s target list gen kinbar gave an uneventful presentation after the meeting one of gen kinbars subordinates told him that a cleric affiliated with the mahdi army wanted to meet with him privately in his office gen kinbar sensing a setup refused "just sit down for tea with him " the subordinate urged suddenly about mahdi army fighters moved in and leveled guns at gen kinbars head according to a u s military report and interviews with the iraqi troops they stripped him and his soldiers of their radios and weapons iraqi military vehicles commandeered by militia fighters moved to block his exit in the chaos gen kinbar escaped after one of his bodyguards threw him into a car col miska says he believes the mahdi army didnt want to kill the iraqi general which would have forced the u s to make an arrest but just wanted to humiliate him five members of gen kinbars security detail were taken captive for about an hour they told u s officials that they were questioned by hazim al araji a cleric and the aide to mr sadr who announced yesterdays freeze on mahdi operations his brother is the lawmaker from the district the iraqi troops told u s officials they were then beaten and released all that afternoon mosque loudspeakers throughout kadhimiya blared that the only legitimate security forces in iraq were the mahdi army the speakers also announced that if gen kinbar returned to the area he would be killed back at his office at camp justice gen kinbar was furious "there is no law in iraq " he screamed "there is only power power creates the law " after about an hour the iraqi officer who had urged gen kinbar to meet with the cleric stopped by his office which is decorated with pictures of gen kinbar with senior u s officers gen kinbar stared at his subordinate with fury "you were involved in the kidnapping " he said "you kept telling me to just go see him " "i didnt know " the officer replied shifting in his chair "i am sorry " gen kinbar looked away in disgust col miska then took gen kinbar aside and told him that u s and iraqi forces had to go back to the shrine that afternoon and demand that the militia fighters return the weapons and radios they had seized "from what i have seen the mahdi army takes advantage of your soldiers " col miska said "unless we do something about it that will always be the perception " gen kinbar slumped over in a plastic lawn chair and said nothing the iraqi general needed his superiors approval before he could launch a raid around p m gen kinbar received word from the prime ministers office that iraqi forces shouldnt confront the mahdi army he says the mission was blocked because of fears it would lead to unrest in the run up to the big pilgrimage the normally calm col miska was frustrated "right now the mahdi army is the only iraqi security force with any legitimacy in kadhimiya " he said in the two days that followed the kidnapping none of gen kinbars senior officers came by to check on him the general told col miska that he was hearing rumors that he was going to be transferred if he lost his job he worried he would also lose his security detail which consists of about a dozen officers he has known for years he worried that someone would try to kidnap his wife and children who had gone into hiding "i am in a very tight place " he told col miska one evening in the u s chow hall "things are happening too fast my mind is going miles per hour i dont sleep at night it is beyond my control " col miska and brig gen john campbell the deputy commander of u s troops in baghdad worked to help gen kinbar col miska launched an investigation to determine which iraqi troops had participated in the kidnapping gen campbell put pressure on lt gen abboud ghanbar who commands all iraqi army and police forces in baghdad to ensure gen kinbar wasnt transferred or fired in recent months gen campbell has worked to forge a close relationship with gen ghanbar meeting with him several times a week three days after the kidnapping he flew gen ghanbar a confidant of prime minister maliki to kadhimiya to see gen kinbar and tour the area after only a few minutes on the ground gen campbell a square shouldered u s special forces soldier who doesnt walk so much as stomp spotted iraqi soldiers sitting around without their helmets "get your helmet on and try to look like a goddamn soldier " he barked although there was no one to translate the men put on their helmets because of concern about car bombs no vehicles were supposed to pass into kadhimiya in the lead up to the pilgrimage but at several iraqi checkpoints soldiers were letting in cars with militia supplied passes gen campbell summoned gen kinbar who yelled at the soldiers to stop it a few feet away the u s general pulled aside the iraqi gen ghanbar "the government has got to back gen kinbar up " gen campbell said as they marched through the degree heat gen ghanbar brushing away sweat said he understood later in the day gen campbell draped an arm around gen kinbar and leaned his stubble covered face in close "you need to know we are behind you here you have got your battle buddy col miska he is going to be with you " he said col miska and gen kinbar now visit at least once a day gen kinbar says he had always been drawn to the "order and control" of military life he often laments iraqs army now has few of those qualities "we are disorganized and dirty " he says col miska says he is trying to get gen kinbars wife and two children out of the country hes talked with representatives from the state department his own command and nonprofit groups that deal with refugee issues his hope is that if gen kinbars family is beyond the mahdi armys reach the iraqi will be better able to stand up to them
