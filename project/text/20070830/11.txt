are airline lounges worth the price of admission we test former elite clubs that now sell day passes &# to share a bowl of pretzels in this season of rampant flight cancellations and long delays many travelers have had to spend hours cooling their heels in cramped and grimy airport terminal gates but these days fliers can buy their way into the plusher lounges once reserved for first class passengers and elite frequent fliers in the past couple of years many carriers have begun offering day passes to their lounges for travelers who want to enjoy a drink at the bar or do some work before their flight without having to become a member of the club or buying a first class or business class ticket some airlines see the day passes as a way to lure potential new members and aiming to build customer loyalty airlines are in the process of building more of these spaces amr corp s american airlines has opened three new admirals club facilities this year at tokyo narita nashville tenn and at john f kennedy international airport in new york delta air lines inc is adding a new club in jacksonville fla and is renovating lounges in miami and philadelphia to see if it is worth spending up to &# a day for access to a lounge we checked out the facilities of four major airlines at four airports around the country in theory the lounges can be great oases for hopping online grabbing a snack and relaxing before your flight especially if youve been delayed but some of the ones we visited were far from lavish and we often went hungry indeed u s lounges are often no match for those of foreign carriers in overseas airports lufthansas first class lounge in frankfurt has a cigar room and passengers are driven to their planes in a mercedes or porsche virgin atlantics "clubhouse" at londons heathrow airport has a jacuzzi and its own movie theater theres also usually plenty of free food and drink but many foreign carriers restrict access to first class passengers and dont offer day passes we tried continental airlines inc s lounges called the presidents club at san francisco international la guardia international in new york and hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport we paid &# a person and the pass is good for hours at any presidents club continentals lounges have perks that are absent at some other airlines lounges every presidents club has free wi fi internet access and free alcoholic drinks the lounges also offer some snacks gratis bags of chips pretzels peanuts crackers and cheese but they dont allow food from outside continentals clubs were the tiniest ones we visited but we werent able to visit any of the airlines main hubs in houston cleveland or newark n j where the lounges are more spacious "it isnt comparing apples to apples " says julie king a spokeswoman for continental in san francisco the lounge had very few seats and the lack of windows gave the space a claustrophobic feel at la guardia the mens bathroom was dingy the tiles on the floor were cracked and the walls were scuffed in atlanta the presidents club was bright and airy upon entry but theres one big downside guests have to leave the lounge to hit the bathroom located a few gates down the terminal concourse service was also generally good if a bit understaffed in places in san francisco the same clerk that processed our day pass at the front desk also made our bloody mary at the bar and cleaned our trash in atlanta the clerk at the front desk gave us a good rundown of the facilities upon entry a manager even greeted us as we sat down and gave us a coupon for a free future visit we bought day passes &# for one person &# for two to american airlines admirals clubs at la guardia san francisco atlanta and los angeles the lounges were spacious and plush but only if you didnt look too closely besides atlanta all of the admirals clubs we visited had serious cleanliness issues at la guardia crumbs and other unidentifiable detritus were scattered on the carpet on tables and on chairs in the ladies room there was a large puddle on the floor and toilet paper was strewn around at lax several seat cushions had huge gashes and the bar area was sullied by crumbs and orange peels american spokeswoman september wade said vacuuming is done after hours and bathrooms are cleaned every hour regarding the damaged chairs she said "we have identified areas that need updating and are in the process of finalizing refurbishment plans now " the admirals clubs do have some nice touches at lax you could use massage chairs for a fee there was also a private shower with complimentary shampoo and soap lounges also offered wi fi access for a fee but dont plan to use the atlanta club if you have a late connection it closes at p m and be prepared to pay to eat theres hardly any free food at la guardia and and atlanta the only complimentary snack was a large communal bowl of pretzels the clubs did sell food including sandwiches and salads and booze but at la guardia about half the menu was unavailable service was uneven in atlanta the staff was professional and almost apologetic when we showed surprise that they charged for drinks but the bartender at la guardia was surly when we approached to order she barked "we have no wraps and no turkey " before we could even say "hello " americans ms wade said "we are very selective of the employees that work in the admirals club we continually conduct performance reviews and receive some of the highest comments from our customers regarding customer service " deltas crown room club had the cheapest entrance fee only &# for a one time visit at la guardia and its atlanta hub and when we told the hostess at la guardia we were planning to use the lounge only for about an hour she let us in free in atlanta the spread was pretty lavish for the low price tag complimentary drinks flowed freely from a well run bar there was also plentiful snack food also free including trays of olives celery and carrots as well as cookies pretzels and nuts we scored a free corona with lime at la guardia at la guardia the lobby was spacious and comfortable there were two big screen tvs and conference rooms available for private meetings the business center was outfitted with a copier two fax machines and a half dozen computers in atlanta service was courteous but ill informed our first effort to buy a day pass was rejected because we werent holding a delta ticket a second attempt at a club in another terminal was successful but only after the receptionist called a manager and learned that a delta ticket is not required any person can purchase a day pass said andy mcdill a spokesman for delta the information that was passed on by the first clerk was incorrect he said "maybe it was a new representative " once past reception however service was smooth we visited four of ual corp s united airlines lounges dubbed united red carpet clubs our experiences were wildly variable the lounge in san francisco was more charming than most we had visited it felt less like a corporate waiting room and more like a lush hotel lounge decorated with tugboat models and black and white photos of san francisco but the lounge in atlanta was abysmal fluorescent lights and dust covered ivy gave it the feel of a motel cafeteria the one bathroom opened right into the doorway of the small business center it also closed at p m "we need to make some improvement to that lounge " said robin urbanski a spokeswoman for united she said that atlanta is one of their smaller lounges and doesnt receive much traffic service was generally good in los angeles the clerk at the front desk checked on our flight status several times in san francisco the front desk signed us up for united frequent flier program even the staff at the dismal atlanta club was polite and forthright about the lounges limitations douglas a blackmon and andrea petersen contributed to this article airline club american
