hanaros new growth channel tv wired south korea opts for downloads more viewer control seoul south korea as telecommunications companies around the world try to boost revenue by shifting internet users to high speed broadband a question arises how do you keep growing after that in south korea where broadband is already ubiquitous one company is finding a way by providing on demand video programs and movies to televisions instead of to computers hanaro telecom south koreas no telecom firm behind korea telecom corp has signed customers to its hana tv service in its first year of availability executives expect that will double by early next year "we now have a growth engine that will augment our broadband business " says park byung moo hanaro telecoms chief executive for about &# a month customers can choose from more than programs a figure that grows with each days new shows from koreas tv broadcasters and numerous international content providers thousands more programs chiefly movies but also education and other features are available for varying pay per view fees such a service is another big step in the shift of viewers taking control of their tv watching an evolution that began with videotape recorders in the s and has been characterized more recently by hard disk tivo and ipod machines hana tv is different because viewers dont have to record anything themselves for instance a person who missed the main nightly newscasts which air at p m on south koreas big networks can order one of them via hana tv at p m there is a longer delay for entertainment shows prime time programs arent available until the next morning the iptv service as it is called uses internet protocol technology to send the television program through the internet akin to the way voip phone companies carry voices over the web a few dozen phone companies around the world are using the technology to offer television entertainment pccw ltd of hong kong has subscribers to its iptv service more than the citys cable tv provider and systems in france spain belgium and italy are also growing rapidly in the u s at&amp t inc has announced it will spend &# billion to deploy iptv via broadband lines though it is still in the early stage south korea is considered one of the most wired countries in the world because high speed data access has been available virtually everywhere for more than five years but the government which is in the midst of overhauling its bureaucracy and rules in telecommunications doesnt allow telecom and internet service companies to directly compete with cable and satellite tv systems in south korea an internet company cant send along tv shows as they are happening although that may change that presented a growth problem for hanaro and its bigger rival korea telecom since both firms had saturated the market with their broadband offerings hanaros growth stalled about three years ago and it started posting losses in as it scrapped with korea telecom over broadband pricing the turning point came when hanaro executives realized that even if regulators allowed them to offer streaming video channels they would find themselves in another "me too" competition where price is the key differentiator "the biggest strength on iptv is interactivity if you just focus on linear broadcasting you are just using a very small part of its capability " mr park says "if you focus on interactivity video on demand or whatever it is you can develop a lot of services that differentiate from cable and satellite tv " as a result executives decided they would launch hana tv as a download service rather than wait for regulators to rewrite the rules for streaming broadcasts "this was not something that was a replacement for cable or satellite we had to contemplate whether customers would be willing to add another video service " said dominic gomez chief operating officer for hanaro "the safe bet for us would be to wait for the regulations to change we opted to pursue this " mr gomez said the results so far are encouraging to date hanaro says the average customer is downloading about hours of programming a month about buy at least one pay per view program a month and the average pay per view customer buys three a month rates that are considered high in the tv industry in the second quarter the company reported an jump in revenue and a marginal &# million profit its first in two years hanaro telecom is also starting to attract advertisers to the service it operates a home shopping service on the system and recently hired sales people to sign up sponsors for certain types of downloaded programs
