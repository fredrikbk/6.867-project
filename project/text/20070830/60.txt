mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q i cant figure out how to remove a song from my iphone how do i do it a unlike an ipod the iphone has no purely manual mode option which would allow you to drag songs on and off of it however there are alternative methods the simplest approach is to connect your iphone to your windows pc or mac and allow it to synchronize as usual then select your iphone in the list at the left edge of the itunes window in order to bring up the iphone settings functions in the large window at the right in itunes click on the summary tab and check the option called "only sync checked items " this will limit the songs and videos the computer places on the iphone to those for which you have checked the little box that appears next to their names in itunes next go into your music library or into any playlists you have selected for syncing with the phone and uncheck any songs you no longer want on your iphone the next time you perform a sync these songs will be removed from the phone another method is to place all the songs you want on the iphone into a single specially designed playlist or several such playlists then go to the music tab in the itunes settings screen and click on "selected playlists " next check off only your special iphone bound playlists once this is done you can control which songs are or arent synchronized to the iphone by adding or removing songs from these playlists if you remove a song from one of these playlists it will be deleted from the iphone the next time you perform a sync neither of these methods will delete the songs from your computer or your itunes library or prevent them from playing on your computer q i have tried to download some pictures recently and use them as wallpaper i am storing them in my my pictures folder but when i choose to make them my wallpaper they appear multiple times on my desktop how can i have a picture cover the whole background on my monitor a assuming you are using windows xp go to the display control panel and select desktop then find the image in the background list and select it then under position on the right select center or stretch note however that if you have downloaded a small image from the web and your monitor has a relatively high resolution the center option wont allow the image to fill much of the screen the stretch option while filling the screen may result in a grainy and or distorted image q i was wondering if you could recommend a good service for automated online backup of a pc running vista all the services i have found require the user to manually transfer files to the online site in my ideal world i could set up my machine to transfer the files during the evening a there are two automated online backup services ive tested and reviewed mozy mozy com and carbonite carbonite com both work on vista neither requires manual file transfers and both are good though i preferred mozy when i last tried them in december however carbonite has released a new version i havent tried yet and mozy has also been updated since then i dont think youd go wrong with either you can read my review at ptech allthingsd com mozy offers two gigabytes of backups free and charges &# a month for unlimited backup though you can save by paying one year or two years in advance carbonite offers a day free trial after which you pay &# a year for unlimited backup though you can save if you pay upfront for two years you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online free at the all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
