beyond petrosaurus how a sleepy oil giant became a world player petrobras taps well of brazilian talent inspired by tadpoles rio de janeiro a decade ago state controlled oil company petrobras was such an industry laggard that it earned a nickname petrosaurus workers were less productive than the industry average and brazil depended on imports for nearly half its oil petrobrass board consisted solely of company insiders today petrobras boasts more crude reserves than chevron corp lower costs of finding oil than exxon mobil corp and a listing on the new york stock exchange with a market value of around &# billion its a rare success story among state owned oil companies as they play a growing role in an energy hungry world three quarters of the worlds reserves are now in the hands of national oil companies according to the international energy agency conocophillips chairman james mulva recently said that the top publicly owned international oil companies now have direct access to only about of the worlds oil reserves with an additional theoretically open through joint ventures most national companies are far less efficient at developing their reserves than petrobras whose full

social programs indonesia whose state energy company has had a history of graft and cronyism recently turned into a net oil importer from an exporter "if only our friends in opec were more like petrobras wed all be a lot happier because there would be a lot more oil " says leo drollas chief economist of the london based center for global energy studies one key to petrobrass success is technology seventy miles out on the atlantic ocean a story size floating production platform p is a showcase for the deep water prowess of the company about one in three pioneer wells petrobras drilled in this area known as the campos basin hit pay dirt an extraordinary percentage by industry standards since its founding in the s petrobras has been a magnet for talented brazilians many motivated by patriotism to work for a company that symbolizes brazilian nationalism what has changed since the s is its corporate structure to prod petrobras to be more open and accountable the government set up an independent board of directors and floated shares in new york it also abolished petrobrass monopoly on drilling for oil in brazilian territory the entry of foreign companies ratcheted up competitive pressure and helped ignite a productivity revolution inside petrobras over the past decade the company has doubled oil production boosted reserves by about and expanded internationally from argentina to india petrobrass successes plus a national project to extract ethanol from sugar cane to power vehicles have helped brazil achieve self sufficiency in oil petrobras "learned over the last years to think on its feet like an international oil company but still retained the strengths and advantages of a national company " says richard d taylor president of bp plcs brazilian operations other energy producing countries are taking note delegations from a host of countries including mexico nigeria and peru have flown to rio de janeiro to study brazils energy model says haroldo lima president of brazils national petroleum agency a regulatory body a number of oil companies are pursuing joint ventures with petrobras lured by access to brazils reserves and petrobrass technology one is norways state controlled statoil asa which is also highly regarded for its efficiency statoil is studying petrobrass techniques for installing wellheads on the sea floor while providing petrobras with know how on extending the life of maturing fields norways king harald v came to rio in to formalize the deal with brazil meanwhile petrobras has expanded abroad and now

event of a hurricane workers will be able to detach the connection between the platform and the well allowing the platform to float away for all of the companys success some brazilian analysts fret that politicians are meddling with petrobrass formula much of the groundwork for the companys transformation was laid under the centrist government of fernando henrique cardoso who left office at the beginning of his successor and longtime rival the leftist luiz inacio lula da silva has faced criticism for injecting a tint of politics in the companys management under mr da silva petrobras has sometimes forgone revenue by not immediately passing on to consumers international price increases of politically sensitive products like gasoline cooking gas and diesel oil more controversial is mr da silvas move to make petrobras buy more brazilian made equipment which he says will stimulate domestic industries after a couple of brazilian made rigs recently came in substantially over budget some analysts questioned the policy jose sergio gabrielli who has been petrobrass president since july says criticisms are off the mark he says the extra rig costs resulted from higher steel prices and a stronger brazilian currency as for the pricing policy petrobras says its just trying to smooth out dramatic fluctuations mr gabrielli says critics ought to focus on the companys record profits strong stock performance and improved environmental record petrobras officials argue that the companys dual identity part embodiment of brazilian nationalism part wall street growth play is an asset "we view ourselves a having the best of both worlds " says financial director almir guilherme barbassa the company is able to draw on some of the best minds in the country both in its sprawling in house research laboratories and in its collaborations with brazilian universities over the past several years petrobras has been signing new partnerships with universities at a rate of one per business day one cooperative venture funded by petrobras royalties is a massive water tank at the federal university of rio de janeiro the tank slightly bigger than a tennis court and feet deep simulates winds and waves encountered offshore and ultimately helps design safer platforms ney robinson salvi dos reis an engineer at petrobrass own lab has a number of robotics patents to his credit one cylindrical robot he designed cleans the gunk out of offshore pipelines he got the inspiration for it by studying the swimming motion of tadpoles mr reiss latest invention looks like something out of star wars a glass cockpit mounted on a buggy with big fiberglass wheels this "environmental robot " with a camera mounted in the cockpit can rumble over land and float on rivers to monitor the impact of a petrobras gas pipeline running through the amazon petrobras was created in amid the nationalist rallying cry "o petroleo e nosso " "the oil is ours " the rhetoric was somewhat theoretical since at the time brazil was producing only barrels a day unlike most state companies which were either born with reserves or nationalized them "our objective was to find reserves " says mr gabrielli the petrobras president with more than of brazils oil lying offshore petrobras began adapting land rigs for offshore conditions and deploying diving teams to do the perilous work of maintaining them as it moved into depths beyond feet petrobras built robots to do the underwater upkeep despite the companys technical competence its management was parochial and sometimes undermined by politicians the board consisted of petrobrass top executives and the companys monopoly on brazilian territory relieved it of the need to raise efficiency the companys international trading arm busied itself marketing shoes and lobsters in the s and part of the s the government set artificially low prices for petrobrass gasoline and other products to try to arrest the sky high inflation that then ravaged brazil the policy starved petrobras of investment capital while other oil companies racked up windfalls during the price runup amid the gulf war petrobras bled red ink because it was selling high priced imported oil at a loss when he became brazils president in mr cardoso says petrobras was in a state of "total confusion " knowing that mr cardoso wanted to shake the company up the powerful oil workers union challenged him with a national strike in but the walkout backfired with kitchens running short of gas and long lines at service stations public opinion swung against the status quo at petrobras mr cardoso termed his policy for petrobras "flexibilization " he wasnt willing to privatize it fully but he used market forces like a stock flotation and foreign competition to make petrobras behave more like a private company in the government started allowing foreign operators to bid against petrobras for offshore blocs to prepare the company for competition mr cardoso named an investment banker as its president the new chief cracked down on dicey deals with suppliers started an incentive based bonus system for managers and cleaned up the books by acknowledging billions of dollars in pension and health liabilities the next year the government sold a stake in petrobras for &# billion on stock markets in new york and sao paulo while petrobras shares already traded locally the big board listing "had a big impact on governance " says mr gabrielli "it forces transparency it forces disclosure " petrobras has adopted u s accounting standards and faces scrutiny from some wall street analysts who follow the companys shares among the most widely traded overseas issues on the new york stock exchange under the companys two tier stock structure the federal government maintains a slight majority of voting shares but about of overall equity is now in the hands of outside shareholders the government of mr cardoso also created petrobrass first independent board of directors even critics of mr da silva brazils president praise him for beefing up the nine member board with four heavyweight brazilian corporate executives they include roger agnelli chief executive of companhia vale do rio doce sa a giant mining company and jorge gerdau head of grupo gerdau sa a multinational steelmaker the arrival of foreign competitors has had a huge psychological impact on petrobras but the international operators have encountered a steep learning curve made tougher by brazils legislation covering environmental and labor matters in a number of exploration and production projects international companies such as royal dutch shell plc and spains repsol ypf have formed joint ventures with petrobras rather than competing with it oklahoma city based devon energy corp
