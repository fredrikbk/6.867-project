what you get with vip status at theme parks for all the joys of a family outing at an amusement park the pitfalls can include nearly endless waits for rides lousy seats for shows and the prospect of having too much to cram into one day unless that is youre willing to pay to get the vip treatment theme park operators have been stepping up their long standing practice of offering exclusive tours that can easily add &# to standard admission prices of &# and up such packages provide guests a chance to cut in the front of lines and be escorted around the park to enjoy perks ranging from buffet lunches to complimentary souvenirs six flags inc with theme parks throughout the country just unveiled its private vip tour priced from &# to &# per person admission included with a suggested minimum of four people that provides what it calls "concierge level service " busch entertainment corp the company behind three seaworld parks and two busch gardens ones says its tour offerings from one hour behind the scenes tours to full day "adventure" outings have surged in popularity with tour attendance climbing to last year from in walt disney co has been hosting vip tours since the opening of disneyland in back then the tours were strictly for bona fide vips guests who might cause a commotion on their own but now theyre open to anyone willing to fork over as much as a &# minimum in the case of private tours at walt disney world parks around orlando the boom in vip tours industry experts say indicates a mature business that is looking at new ways to drive revenue especially given that park attendance rose only a modest in according to one industry report its also reflective of a culture that seeks special treatment at every turn to see if spending extra money really makes you feel like royalty we booked vip tours at four prominent theme parks without revealing our affiliation with the wall street journal we noted everything from the guides attitude to the number of attractions covered we also tested the guides knowledge of the park and threw in a kingly request or two if we were going to be vips for a day we wanted to feel well important at times we certainly did nothing brings out your inner spoiled child quite like breezing past a long line of tired park goers waiting to ride an attraction but at other times we didnt appreciate the nasty looks or threats of physical harm that our jump the queue status engendered our conclusion is that its worth the extra money if it is your one shot at visiting a particular park and if it happens to be during a popular time period think summer a properly led tour can save you time and give you an odds on chance of having a great time but tours may not make sense in every instance in some parks its easy to play vip on your own finding your way without impediment it also pays to consider what the tour actually provides vip tour pioneer disney for example was the only company not to offer a tour with front of line access to rides at disneyland our four hour private excursion &# for a group of seven plus park admission got us preferred seating for a parade and an evening fireworks display plus plenty of trivia from a chirpy kid friendly guide who knew such details as the year the "its a small world" ride debuted but the best the guide could offer when it came to riding "small world" or any other attraction was to help arrange for fastpass disneys book ahead ride program available free to all guests or to hold our place in line while we hit another ride disney officials later told us thats intentional they dont want to alienate non vip guests by forcing them to clear the way for vips then whats the point of vip treatment mostly its to help with logistics especially for disney newcomers our guide knew where to start the matterhorn bobsleds which tend to get crowded later on and when to seek out character autographs all that planning went haywire however when she arranged for seats for the "aladdin" show at neighboring disneys california adventure without realizing it wasnt playing that day that meant we shortened our lunch not included in the tours cost for nothing a disney spokesman says the mishap "sounds like an error " with a vip tour at the six flags over georgia in atlanta we paid &# per person the biggest problems cropped up in advance unlike other theme park companies that have guests simply show up at the appointed time six flags puts a tour planner in touch with the group beforehand we had a tough time connecting by phone and there was confusion over the tours start time the online reservation system said a m the tickets said a m and though we were invited to "brunch with bugs " we were later told the event wasnt happening on our tour day a six flags representative says the pretour issues should not have arisen and are "going to be addressed immediately " that said after we worked out the kinks the tour offered bang for the buck theres no time limit and our helpful guide plus another guide in training stayed with us from a m to p m theres also no limit on included treats our four person gastronomic tally seven lemonades four helpings of ice cream four bottles of water three orders of chicken fingers and fries one pizza slice and a salad and we didnt even stay for dinner front of line access is guaranteed helping us hit attractions and is granted on the spot our main guide a pre kindergarten teacher even baby sat our two year old while the adults went on some thrill rides at our other parks seaworld in orlando and universal orlandos islands of adventure the options for a private tour were nearly a kings ransom up to &# in the case of universal so we booked a cheaper group tour that still promised the vip treatment albeit with strangers in tow but at seaworlds "adventure express" tour &# per person plus park admission we felt like another face in the crowd because our group of a dozen plus was so large and diverse moms dads toddlers teens and even a newly engaged young couple we applauded them plus the tour led by a sincere and low key gentleman didnt show us much of anything we couldnt have found ourselves because of its emphasis on shows and walk through attractions seaworld doesnt tend to be as hard to navigate as ride oriented parks the only real perk was a chance to pet a penguin in its near freezing backstage habitat very cool in every sense a busch spokeswoman says the "adventure express" was meant for those who want a little more hand holding and would rather not have to map out their day at universal orlandos islands of adventure our group was having too much fun to nitpick the tour &# per person plus admission was a five hour romp taking in nine attractions plus repeat rides with barely a moments rest save for bathroom breaks and a quick lunch not included but on a day when the park was packed and lines for some attractions exceeded minutes it was the only way to go we were led on rides as if we were visiting dignitaries making a few regular park goers a tad envious if not downright angry in one instance someone attempted to trip a member of our group a universal spokesman says non vip guests shouldnt feel left out since the parks offer other ways to gain front of line access including a lower cost universal express plus pass that incident notwithstanding our tour led by a woman with the zealous spirit of a fun loving big sister kept upping the "wow" factor at the "amazing adventures of spiderman" ride one of the most complex ever built we were taken backstage to see how the specially designed cars moved along the track at the water rides we were given ponchos to stay dry best of all the person three family group hit if off one group member said
