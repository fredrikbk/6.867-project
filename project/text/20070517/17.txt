congresss war dodge democrats in the senate yesterday demonstrated once again that they neither have the votes for withdrawing u s troops from iraq nor a real policy on the war wednesdays vote to cut off funding by march was voted down with democrats joining every republican in opposing the measure which was submitted as an amendment to an unrelated bill wisconsin senator russ feingold who put forth the measure with majority leader harry reid noted optimistically that a majority of his caucus voted for the measure which is one way of defining majority down there seemed to be some ambivalence moreover even among the who supported the measure presidential hopefuls hillary clinton and barack obama both voted for mr feingolds amendment but they also indicated that it was more about sending a message than setting policy we recall bob doles legendary advice to a freshman republican that he couldnt go wrong voting for a bill that failed the two democrats thus dont give competitor john edwards any running room on the antiwar left but they also dont have to take responsibility ah war time leadership the democrats in other words remain trapped in the land of symbolism over the war taking up the responsibility that the "power of the purse" gives them does not seem to be on the agenda theyd rather posture appeasing their partys left wing without taking ownership of war policy this evasiveness wont let them off the hook however the political consequences of defeat wont only belong to president bush to the extent that democrats are making the conduct of the war more difficult and less certain they already bear responsibility for the wars outcome whether they like it or not we should add that some republicans are behaving little better house minority leader john boehner who likes to talk about congresss responsibility to support the troops has recently taken to the airwaves to suggest that a september deadline for "progress" might not be such a bad idea after all this comes despite the fact that the troop surge is not yet even fully deployed and certainly hasnt been given a chance to work the fifth u s brigade for baghdad wont even arrive until june most embarrassing was last weeks demonstration of faux political courage by republican "moderates" who met privately with president bush at the white house to warn him about falling support for iraq as if he wasnt aware of it they then promptly called reporters to advertise their willingness to confront a president with a approval rating they had no such doubts about the war when they voted for it in october republicans in tough districts are entitled to be uneasy but they like their colleagues across the aisle cant have it both ways withdrawal or redeployment from iraq can be determined by political considerations which translates into embracing defeat or it can be informed by military considerations which means giving general david petraeus &amp co the resources they need and letting them decide when the mission has been accomplished or has become impossible there are certainly democrats who have already decided that we are on mission impossible but as yesterdays vote showed that wing of the party lacks the votes to make policy or to cut off war funding they owe it to the country then to sit down and fund the troops and let the generals do their job
