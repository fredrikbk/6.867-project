boss talk transformer in transition he turned utc into giant now ceo george david carefully prepares successor united technologies corp chief executive george david is often described by senior executives as the professor they wish theyd had in business school those who find themselves traveling on his corporate jet refer to the seat across from mr davids as "the tanning booth" because of the intense nature of so much face time with the boss mr david commands such attention because since taking the helm in he has led the transformation of a once sleepy new england manufacturing company into a &# billion aerospace and building services conglomerate that routinely outperforms its peers now years old mr david is preparing to turn over the reins to louis chenevert who was promoted a year ago from head of the companys pratt &amp whitney jet engine unit to the position of utc president and chief operating officer mr david who spends his free time racing an oceangoing yacht has said he intends to step down as chief executive during the second quarter of he has indicated that hes willing to stay on as nonexecutive chairman for a couple of more years at the request of the board excerpts from a recent interview follow wsj you have said that a sailing race is like a year of business compressed into an afternoon how mr david what goes on in a big sailboat is a combination of preparation organization design strategy tactics rules teamwork individual performance and group performance on a footer you race with a dozen people in a congested space when you drop a new crew person in every now and then you may get an elbow in the face its because you and that person dont know how youre going to move relative to one another thats the same thing in the business you dont want an elbow in the face wsj there are some who think theres a george david premium built into utc stock do you think thats true mr david well the answer is there isnt i wish there was but there isnt it was that way with former general electric co chairman jack welch and maybe even former honeywell international inc chairman larry bossidy no doubt about it they were fairly center stage kinds of people i dont think ive ever been that way on the math our multiple is actually right in the middle of the pack we sometimes think its a point low so the answer is theres no premium in the stock wsj about a year ago you started the process of preparing mr chenevert to take your place when you retire hows that going mr david i would say its going very well louis is a great operator hes as good as they come one point thats a little misunderstood by investors and people outside these big companies is that the skill sets required in the corporate office are dramatically different than the skill sets in the divisions i think it takes a couple years to learn actually i think some of the problems with ceo succession in the past are because it has been too quick i was the president for two years and then the ceo for three and not the chairman until after five years wsj regardless of who becomes the ceo of united technologies that person isnt going to have your experience or cachet with wall street what are you doing to ease that situation mr david its not correct to compare me to a prospective chief executive ive been at this job for years in when i was the new chief executive people didnt like us and they didnt like me thats the time when utcs market cap was &# billion today its &# billion i think its really important to do a like for like compare thats why i believe in an extended transition investors and a board need time to be comfortable with a new chief executive wsj according to your numbers utcs products generate something like of the greenhouse gases world wide given that you dont have any plans to stop making air conditioners and jet engines what can you do to make them greener mr david we cool things heat things fly things elevate things send people to the moon the common denominator is to convert energy to useful work our equipment lasts super long the average life of installed air conditioning systems is years or more for elevators years or more engines years so you get giant populations of stuff out there which is where you get the from i think the solution to the energy problem is actually not alternative energy to me the solution immediately is conservation by greater efficiency too much in the mind of the public is this idea that conservation means deprivation youve got to be cold at night shut off the lights stuff like that thats simply not true the bottom line is that energy is wasted in the world to a phenomenal extent theres enormous energy savings potential in the conservation agenda where you do it by efficiency in our own internal operations we dropped the energy consumption at utc by over a decade at the same time the company doubled its size all of america can drop its energy consumption by in a decade easily were now working with the world business council for sustainable development to come up with a building that uses zero net energy wsj how have globalization and productivity changed the playing field mr david theres probably half a billion more people in the work force in the world now versus years ago and that is china and surrounding countries thats a tremendous increase of frankly low cost labor thats why weve seen high productivity and low labor cost inflation and therefore real productivity at the bottom line theres a lot of room left for this incredible labor force in asia you cant walk through life with a trained eye and not see the opportunities for productivity every time you sit in traffic thats a productivity loss every time you go to the doctor and fill out a bunch of forms and he refers you to somebody else and you fill out the same forms all over again thats a loss of productivity whenever you wait for something thats waste i believe you can have times more i really do wsj ten times more of what mr david everything everything just look at the differences in personal productivity between people educated versus not educated or people in good really productive labor environments versus people who are kind of struggling because theyre in disorganized or ineffective companies a large number of people have been deprived by opportunity by education by lifes circumstance and they end up having less than fully productive lives its not only bad for them as individuals its also very bad for the society because its all lost work theres a part of the world that doesnt believe in the rights of women why on earth would you live in a society where half the people are deemed to be nonproductive if you would like to have a little more isnt it a good idea to have actually every single person participate every single person be educated to me thats almost an entitlement in a civilized society wsj since you founded the utc scholar program the company has spent more than &# million paying for higher education for its employees has it been worth it mr david categorically flatly no argument i think thats the best thing we ever did for employee benefits twenty one thousand degrees have been earned and people are currently enrolled it costs us &# million a year thats about of utcs operating income is it worth it i guess i go back to my basic principle which is education is definitely the most powerful force in life educated people are more thoughtful theyre more widely read theyre more alert to change theyre more confident
