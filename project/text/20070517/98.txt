the evening wrap not amnesty online edition "it is not amnesty " pennsylvania republican arlen specter said of an immigration deal struck between senate negotiators making a pre emptive defense of a plan that is sure to disappoint some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle the proposed agreement which represents a major overhaul of the immigration system would allow illegal immigrants to come forward and obtain a "z visa" and after paying fees and a &# fine get on track for permanent residency a process that could take between eight and years heads of household would have to return to their home countries first the plan which inspired president bush and senate democrats edward m kennedy and diane feinstein all to make "coming out of the shadows" analogies would create a program to bring temporary workers to the u s with a separate program covering agricultural workers skills and education level would for the first time get priority over family connections in determining which

bipartisan agreement i am confident leaders in washington can have a serious civil and conclusive debate so i can sign comprehensive reform into law this year " but bruising battles loom in both the
