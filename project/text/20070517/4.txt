blairs progress tony blair made it official last week he will step down as britains prime minister as soon as the labour party chooses a new leader political obituary writers wrote headlines along the lines of "brilliant career destroyed by iraq war " dont believe it one of britains longest serving prime ministers and the first ever to win three straight elections mr blair leaves an imposing legacy of political modernization and policy innovation that will stand long after the iraq controversy fades his greatest achievement is the resuscitation of the democratic left in britain for nearly two decades after margaret thatchers election in the labour party wallowed in a mire of marxian dogma trade union militancy and political irrelevance the party was widely seen as a spent reactionary force holding fast to old socialist nostrums even as the soviet union collapsed command economies failed and a new global marketplace emerged inspired by bill clinton and "new democrats" in the u s mr blair and a band of youthful brainiacs including gordon brown now chancellor of the exchequer and his likely successor set out to modernize their party dubbing themselves "new labour " they engineered repeal of clause the provision in the party charter that called for "common ownership of the means of production " then they forged a new political synthesis of market dynamism social justice and public sector reform that broadened labours appeal in mr blair led his rejuvenated party to a smashing victory that gave labour a huge parliamentary majority staying the course of economic liberalization the blair government has presided over britains longest period of sustained growth in years messrs blair and brown embraced the new democrats"work first" approach to social policy pushing reforms that have helped to alleviate welfare dependency and child poverty mr blair also vowed to be "tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime" and crime in britain has fallen on his watch at the same time left wing labourites could point to more conventionally "progressive" achievements including a national minimum wage civil unions for gays and a doubling of the number of women mps more recently messrs blair and brown launched a bold effort to reform public services not just by spending more money but also by injecting elements of choice and market competition into the education system and transportation network and even the national health service the crown jewel of britains welfare state this money plus reform approach though grating on left wing sensibilities follows mr blairs oft expressed conviction that progressive parties everywhere must "modernize or die " growing out of talks between mr clinton and mr blair in the late s the modernizing bug has spread to other european countries and to latin america asia and australia even the center left parties most resistant to mr blairs idea of a "third way" beyond top down welfare statism and market fundamentalism frances socialists and germanys social democrats have grudgingly conceded the need to update their governing philosophies and programs theres no question that mr blairs support for president bushs iraq policies has been a millstone around his neck it has also been a cudgel in the hands of britains cynical press which derided mr blair as mr bushs "poodle " and gave him no credit for braving popular disapproval to stand by his convictions the real tragedy here is that the iraq debacle has overshadowed mr blairs efforts to reinvigorate the progressive outlook on international affairs as well as domestic matters in a pivotal speech in chicago in he enunciated a new "doctrine of international community " whose central insight is that globalization has made interdependence a political as well as an economic reality it has enlarged the definition of every nations "vital interests" to include the imperative of international cooperation on such common problems as terrorism global warming and pandemics like aids since in fact mr blair has been progressives most trenchant and eloquent voice in defining what is at stake in the confrontation between liberalism and islamist extremism in a manifesto entitled "a global alliance for global values " he says "this terrorism in my view will not be defeated until we confront not just the methods of the extremists but also their ideas i dont mean just telling them that terrorist activity is wrong i mean telling them that their attitude to america is absurd that their concept of governance is prefeudal that their positions on women and other faiths are reactionary we must reject not just their barbaric acts but their presumed and false sense of grievance against the west their attempt to persuade us that it is we and not they who are responsible for their violence " whatever progressives may think of mr blairs stance on iraq they cant ignore his summons to reject anti americanism and cultural relativism and lead the defense of liberal values that too is his legacy mr marshall is president and founder of the progressive policy institute correction tony blair was the first labour party prime minister to win three consecutive elections a may commentary mistakenly identified him as the first british prime minister to win three consecutive elections that honor goes to conservative margaret thatcher who won three straight elections in and wsj may
