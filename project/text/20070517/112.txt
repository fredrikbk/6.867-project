wiretap tales democrats and former deputy attorney general james comey put on quite a senate show tuesday over the national security administrations wiretapping program with new yorks chuck schumer directing the players staged a full length docudrama to create the impression that the bush administration broke the law in reauthorizing the program to eavesdrop on al qaeda senate hearings can be boring so well assume the press corps dozed through select parts that would explain why no one reported on the discussion as senator arlen specter questioned mr comey on how the great covert operation actually went down news stories have suggested a pattern of white house misdeeds to accomplish an ultimately illegal end the transcript tells a different story first lets review the background on march then white house counsel alberto gonzales and white house chief of staff andrew card visited john ashcroft in the hospital as he recuperated in intensive care according to mr comey the purpose of the visit was to get attorney general ashcroft to sign off on the nsas wiretapping authority which mr comey himself had declined to do in the hearing mr comey spared no dramatic detail as mr gonzales and mr card came into the hospital room mrs ashcroft supposedly stood by the bed "holding her husbands arm " as they queried him on the matter mr ashcroft "lifted his head off the pillow and in very strong terms expressed himself and then laid his head back down on the pillow seemed spent " this is the kind of stuff that can get you into the oprah book club in mr comeys spirited retelling messrs gonzales and card were trying to "end run" his authority as acting attorney general by taking advantage of a "very sick man" who had delegated his ag powers to mr comey in a series of events that followed mr comey under the guidance of mr schumer presented himself as further harassed summoned to the white house to meet with mr card and later with president bush himself the implication is that the white house was trying to lean on justice to do something illegal but listen to what mr comey actually said as mr specter questioned him was he pressured by mr card senator specter asked no "i dont know that he tried to pressure me other than to engage me on the merits and make clear his strong disagreements with my conclusion " did they threaten him or suggest he could be fired "no sir i didnt feel threatened nor did he say anything that could reasonably be read as threatening " and what about mr bush did he twist arms in the oval through fbi director robert mueller mr comey explained "the president said the justice department should do what the department thinks is right " so wheres the smoking gun here when the program was reauthorized by the president alone mr comey and others planned to resign in protest so mr specter asked does that mean the program went forward illegally again negative "the justice departments certification was not required as far as i know " thats because as even mr comey conceded many judges and scholars believe a president has the constitutional authority to approve such wiretaps especially in wartime in other words per mr comeys testimony nothing illegal was done he was never threatened by white house officials and the president told him to do what he felt was right the gonzales card hospital intrusion was unusual and politically unwise but their motive at the time was to gain approval for a program the president thought vital to national security and was about to expire by the way march the date of mr comeys visit to mr ashcrofts bedside is an historic day for another reason it was the eve of and the madrid train bombings which killed and injured it was in other words the kind of event that brings home the global nature of terrorism as well as the sophisticated coordination required to execute attacks of such brutality whats really going on here is a different form of political theater democrats are trying to whip up an aura of "illegality" to create the political leverage to strip a republican president of his surveillance authority in wartime theyve tried to do this since the program was revealed and back in russ feingold compared it to watergate but unfortunately for the democrats wiretapping aimed at americas terrorist enemies is politically popular so rather than arguing the legal merits democrats are spinning a yarn about shady deeds perpetrated in a hospital room at night they are using half truths to achieve a partisan goal that is dangerous policy and they shouldnt get away with it
