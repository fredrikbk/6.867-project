politics &amp economics testimony puts comey in spotlight appearance at gonzales hearing spurs talk of future role washington for years when president bushs justice department needed a credible and charismatic face for its most controversial policies it turned to james comey the foot deputy attorney general known for his disarming chuckle and impeccable reputation that fact is what makes mr comeys dramatic senate testimony this week such bad news for his former boss attorney general alberto gonzales mr gonzales has been clinging to his post with the support of president bush but few others mr comeys manner and the depth of his testimony also heightened speculation about his own future possibly as attorney general or even a political candidate even though he has denied interest in running for office sen charles schumer d n y who presided over tuesdays hearing says that mr comey a republican should be on the short list for attorney general even under a future democratic president mr comey who left the government in to become general counsel of lockheed martin corp stunned washington on tuesday with his account of a march confrontation with mr gonzales then white house counsel in the hospital room of an incapacitated attorney general john ashcroft mr comey as acting attorney general had refused to certify the presidents domestic surveillance program as lawful "i was concerned that this was an effort to do an end run around the acting attorney general and to get a very sick man to approve something that the department of justice had already concluded" was unsupportable mr comey testified the story "sort of poured out of him " when a senate staffer last week asked him about the hospital incident the outlines of which were publicly known in preparation for the hearing sen schumer says "it was clear he had been carrying around this burden for a long period of time " he says "but he made it clear he was not going to tell anybody this publicly unless he was required to and he only wanted to do it his way " mr gonzales remains pressured amid allegations that his department fired a number of u s attorneys for political reasons mr comeys account pushed a third republican senator nebraskas chuck hagel to call for mr gonzaless resignation mr gonzales "has lost the moral authority to lead " mr hagel said in a statement in washington holders of high level offices such as the justice departments no job are keenly aware that political sensitivities matter greatly by contrast one senior justice department official recalls mr comey a year old father of five "marches to his own drummer " but while his charm won over many staffers and journalists some administration officials considered him "tin eared" to the administrations political agenda the senior official says "theres always been a rap on him that he wasnt a team player " says mark corallo who headed justice department public affairs under mr ashcroft "but in retrospect now that i realize what was going on i say thank god &amp nbsp " nevertheless mr comeys high profile could raise concerns for his current employer lockheed derives most of its revenue from the federal government "big defense contractors always dislike getting caught up in political battles that are unrelated to their business " says loren thompson a military analyst at the lexington institute think tank although he notes with democrats on the rise "i dont see how this could hurt lockheed " in any event the industry seems to think top talent may be worth risking controversy last year boeing co hired as its general counsel former u s circuit judge j michael luttig a prominent conservative who questioned government conduct in a high profile case involving the so called dirty bomber jose padilla a lockheed spokesman declined to comment on mr comey beyond a written statement that "jim exemplifies the ethical principles and values based culture championed by lockheed martin " mr comey who hails from yonkers n y made his name as a tough federal prosecutor in manhattan taking on white collar fraudsters and organized crime and developing a close friendship with another assistant u s attorney patrick fitzgerald as they prosecuted members of the gambino crime family as deputy attorney general mr comey appointed mr fitzgerald as a special prosecutor to investigate the leak of covert agent valerie plames identity a case that led to the conviction of vice president dick cheneys chief of staff lewis "scooter" libby mr comey first came to mr ashcrofts attention in the spring of after he was tapped to take over the slow moving investigation of the khobar towers bombing which killed u s airmen in saudi arabia in june that year mr comey obtained a grand jury indictment accusing members of the iranian backed terrorist group hezbollah in the bombing after the sept terrorist attacks mr ashcroft brought mr comey to washington to help run the investigation that experience solidified a bond between the men both graduates of the university of chicago law school mr corallo says "ashcroft got to measure the man up close " mr corallo says mr ashcroft through a spokeswoman declined to comment in president bush named mr comey as u s attorney for the southern district of new york after sen schumer objected to a candidate backed by the states republican governor the district which includes manhattan often prosecutes some of the biggest crimes and mr comey burnished his reputation with high profile prosecutions of white collar crimes including the case involving entrepreneur homemaker martha stewart the district also was home to the grand jury investigating and while some civil liberties advocates criticized mr comeys aggressive prosecutions his tough antiterrorist stance further pleased the attorney general his management style also endeared him to most of his staff both political appointees and career employees mr comey has a "tremendous personal touch and a great sense of humor " says patrick philbin who handled national security matters in the deputy attorney generals office mr philbin mr comey disclosed in his testimony was with him in mr ashcrofts hospital room when the confrontation occurred mr comey testified that as a result of siding with him on the wiretap issue mr philbin had been "blocked from promotion " mr philbin now in private practice was denied appointment as principal deputy solicitor general after objections from vice president cheney and his counsel david addington a person familiar with the matter says the vice presidents office declined to comment mr philbin also declines to comment on the matter but says of mr comey "if theres a crisis and you want somebody in your foxhole jim is the guy you want in your foxhole " and it was that reputation that the department relied on during mr comeys tenure says mr corallo the former public affairs chief mr comey received such difficult assignments as justifying the years long detention without charge of u s citizen mr padilla mr padilla currently is on trial in federal court in miami on lesser charges of supporting terrorism he has pleaded not guilty mr comey "was very good on television " mr corallo says "one of my jobs when we needed to make the departments position public was to pick the right people to go out and sell it and jim was a great salesman for the departments policy " jonathan karp and evan perez contributed to this article
