matter "markets are adjusting to the problems in the subprime market but the regulatory agencies must consider what additional steps might be needed " he said "the federal reserve is currently

responsible lending or eliminate refinancing opportunities for subprime borrowers " his latest warnings may not be enough allay concerns of lawmakers who have sharply criticized the fed for failing to act "its good news that chairman bernanke and the fed may finally be cracking down on abusive lending in the housing market later this summer " sen charles schumer d n y said in a statement "but we
