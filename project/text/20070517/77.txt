politics &amp economics gazas unity government is threatened factional fighting also damps hopes of u s diplomacy jerusalem this weeks factional fighting in the gaza strip threatens to undermine the unity government of the palestinian authority and smother hopes for a revival of u s regional diplomatic efforts that began six months ago israel yesterday made its first significant strikes on gaza since the military wing of the islamist group hamas violated a five month old cease fire by firing rockets from the coastal strip more than three weeks ago the strikes came in response to a hamas escalation of those volleys in the past two days with militants launching at least rockets that left two people in southern israel seriously injured according to both hamas and the israeli defense forces israeli officials accused hamas of trying to provoke an aggressive israeli response in an effort to unite palestinian factions and divert attention from fighting that has engulfed gaza a densely populated and impoverished stretch of land roughly the size of wichita kan and pushed palestinians back to the precipice of civil war israeli leaders said they were carefully balancing a need to respond to the rocket fire with a deep desire to stay out of the palestinian crisis street fighting in gaza between masked gunmen loyal to hamas and its chief political rival fatah which is the predominately secular movement founded by yasser arafat has left at least palestinians dead in recent days instead of killing each other the two factions are supposed to be peacefully sharing power in a "unity" government coalition formed in march the biggest sticking point in the formation of that government was the appointment of an independent interior minister who might be able to control warring security forces from the two sides that official resigned this week after saying his authority had been undermined when fatah loyal chiefs deployed forces late last week in gaza without his permission that deployment appears to have sparked the current round of violence this weeks fighting is the worst since hamas and fatah leaders reached a peace accord in february setting out the basic parameters for their coalition the deal was brokered by saudi rulers in the muslim holy city of mecca gaza schools were closed yesterday after buses were stopped and searched by masked gunmen with shops and offices also shuttered witnesses said the streets were deserted except for fighters what most disturbed many palestinians was the brutal nature of the continuing assaults which included apparent assassination attempts fighters loyal to hamas stormed the home of a senior fatah security official yesterday killing four of his bodyguards according to news reports "we are now witnessing the culture of revenge prevailing in gaza " said mahdi abdul hadi an analyst and political scientist who heads the palestinian academic society for the study of international affairs tensions began flaring after hamas won elections in january and formed a government two months later robbing fatah of power for the first time since the palestinian authority was launched in the islamist group deployed its own security service in gaza after leaders complained that fatah dominated forces were openly hostile to the new government violence between the two sides was unleashed almost immediately before the mecca accord brought it to a temporary end the renewed fighting makes it harder for the u s to advance regional diplomatic goals almost all of which are tied to progress toward the creation of a palestinian state those efforts already were staggering thanks in part to the plummeting political popularity of israeli prime minister ehud olmert whose cooperation was seen as vital even in the dark days before the mecca accord palestinians had one hope tethered on the political horizon that a unity government would lead to peace but the death of unity at least on the streets has many wondering what to hope for next the imprisoned hamas parliamentary speaker yesterday called for arab regimes to urgently renew mediation efforts but one such delegation from egypt was fired on after leaving truce talks earlier this week the only other public call that seemed to offer any hope was from bassam salhi a leftist minister in the unity government who doesnt belong to either faction he said fatahs mahmoud abbas the palestinian president and ismail haniya the hamas prime minister should jointly declare a day state of emergency the u s has been stung by criticism that it has been stoking a palestinian civil war by openly backing armed forces loyal to mr abbas the u s considers hamas to be a terrorist organization after the coalition government was formed u s secretary of state condoleezza rice announced in jerusalem that mohammed dahlan who led a brutal crackdown against hamas in the s would now be in charge of what she dubbed security sector reform efforts for the palestinian authority there was widespread speculation in the palestinian territories yesterday that u s officials would now push mr abbas to dissolve the unity government take charge and hold new elections holding out the promise of renewed western aid funding to the palestinian authority was cut after hamas won the january national elections which had been backed by the u s
