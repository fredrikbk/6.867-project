land grab farms are latest target in venezuelan upheaval co ops of city dwellers on seized acreage are mostly a bust so far san felipe venezuela vicente lecuna jabs a wall map of his santa isabel ranch so angrily that the map crashes to the floor "i used to produce tons of sugar cane a year " says the year old venezuelan cattleman "now its zero zero " he shouts two years ago squatters seized about half of mr lecunas acre ranch setting up a cooperative named "re founding the fatherland " far from being evicted the squatters got loans and tractors from the government of president hugo chavez they then uprooted the sugar cane and decided to try their hand at growing plantains "we are building socialism and fighting capitalism " says co op leader juan nava standing amid wooden shacks on what used to be mr lecunas land the ranchers efforts to fight the takeover in court have gone nowhere if the rhetoric smacks of the s its because mr chavez dreams of transforming venezuela just as fidel castro did cuba mr chavez has already sharply cut private companies role in venezuelas lucrative oil industry and uses the state oil company to funnel billions of dollars to his social projects he has nationalized the leading telephone company and the main electric utility he speaks of wanting to drive a stake through the heart of capitalism limiting the role of money and installing a barter system now mr chavez is taking his revolution to the venezuelan countryside "we must end latifundios " he said in a televised speech in march referring to large agrarian estates "the people order it and we will do it whatever the cost " then he announced the seizure of a land area larger than the state of rhode island since coming to power the chavez government has handed over million acres an area bigger than maryland for use by the poor while much of this was state owned land that was either idle or leased to ranchers some million acres were "recovered" from private owners mr chavez said recently in some cases the government compensated them in most others like mr lecunas it has simply turned a blind eye to land invasions the government bills land reform as a way to make venezuela self sufficient in food but so far the effect has been to undercut production of beef sugar and other foods as productive land is handed to city dwellers with no knowledge of farming established farmers and ranchers fearing their land may be seized next are cutting investment in their operations to a minimum the chaos in the countryside has contributed to shortages in basic items like milk and meat a paradox in a country enjoying an economic boom traceable to high oil prices also spurring the shortages are price controls on certain foods that keep them priced below the cost of production meanwhile plus inflation as oil revenue floods the economy spurs panic buying purchasing price controlled and other goods the shopper might not immediately need for fear of having higher prices in the future or not finding the items at all "you get up at dawn to hunt for a breast of chicken all over town housewives are in a foul mood " says lucylde gonzalez a caracas homemaker who says she hasnt seen an egg in a week after squatters took part of mr lecunas land his bank said he could no longer use what remained as collateral for loans and asked him to put up a caracas office building he owns instead mr lecuna says he cant get financing from state banks because they now wont lend to farmers with more than acres he has stopped buying fertilizer and machinery "im afraid of investing " he says in addition kidnappings of farmers and ranchers for ransom are on the rise and scandals have plagued the co op program mr chavez blames the shortages on "speculation" by distributors and producers agriculture minister elias jaua recently called a news conference to deny theres been any decline in food production during the eight years of chavez rule the central bank stopped publishing agricultural statistics in a private farm association called fedeagro estimates venezuela grew less food last year than the year before citing factors including the price controls land seizures and the wave of kidnappings of farmers some chavez initiatives recall disastrous past experiments with collectivized agriculture such as in maos china and the cuban revolution which helped turn one of latin americas richest lands into one of its poorest but as the worlds fifth biggest oil exporter venezuela has an advantage they didnt oil revenue gives the fiery nationalist leeway to pursue utopian policies despite the doubts of many mainstream economists that they are sustainable members of new farm co ops receive training via a program called mision vuelvan caras "mission about face" which mr chavez has just renamed mision che guevara it pays thousands of slum dwellers monthly stipends to learn a hodgepodge of marxism "ancestral" venezuelan farming methods and cuban fertilizer making techniques in two years the program has graduated nearly a million people at the re founding the fatherland co op the members have four tractors including a bright red veniran made by a venezuelan iranian government joint venture co op members have uprooted about acres of sugar cane planted by the former owner mr lecuna the co ops mr nava a wiry former construction worker in plastic sandals says members have planted acres of plantains a figure he ups later in the interview to lecuna ranch hands say its acres at most co op members have also planted small plots of corn beans and watermelons the co ops production doesnt come close to sustaining its members and most work in nearby cities and towns the dozen or so who live in shacks on the land are currently building a concrete trough that they plan to fill with millions of worms the worms will be fed cow manure to create a fertilizer called humus de lombrices or worm humus the technique comes recommended by cuba "by next year we will live from this " says mr nava as two rail thin dogs fight nearby and kick up a cloud of dust referring to the rancher whose land was seized mr nava demands "why so much land owned by one man and so many others dying for land tell lecuna we are going to take everything we are coming his way " until mr chavez became president in land reform wasnt a big issue in venezuela a land redistribution program in the early s had ended a system of big estates with absentee owners and serf like laborers handing hundreds of thousands of acres over for the use of peasants say venezuelan agriculture experts early on mr chavez pushed legislation permitting the government to seize land from large farms but opposition from farmers ranchers and the supreme court largely stopped his efforts he tried again in and this time faced little resistance mr chavez by then controlled the courts as well as the congress where he had no opponents because opposition parties thinking legislative elections rigged had boycotted the polls one of the first battlegrounds over land reform was hato paraima ranch on the scorching plains of cojedes state in central venezuela in the state governor a chavez ally announced he would seize the acre ranch outright from its owners the branger family the federal government stepped in and after months of negotiation purchased about acres "it was a reasonable negotiation within the context that it was a forced negotiation " says jaime perez branger president of the family company hato paraimas land gets virtually no rain about six months of the year during the other six it is subject to repeated flooding so its acceptable for grazing cattle and growing grass seed but not much else even grazing is difficult because of the acidic soil and extreme rainfall pattern the branger family has a seed company that developed hardy grasses adapted to the tough conditions of venezuelas plains without any sort of water study the government distributed acres of hato paraima to dozens of co ops and individuals who submitted plans for growing everything from sugar cane to vegetables on it as well as for raising cattle on small plots the government hoped the results would be a showcase but the co op members have seen their pastures dry up in the searing sun of the dry season some gave up others in desperation have turned to the branger family for help "the people are going crazy for lack of pasture " says rodolfo barrios who manages the familys seed company called sembra he says that co op members pleaded with him five times this march for hay to feed their cattle and that he donated about bales plus the use of a bulldozer to make a road to connect distant co ops to the main road today the co ops feature a succession of empty shacks and a couple of skinny cows among dust devils and hard rocky soil with just a few people around a planned community center is half finished as are some houses that will eventually replace squatters shacks roads and drainage systems promised by the government are for most part yet to be built co op member arturo morffe lives in a shack made of tin and sticks with no water or electricity the year old former construction worker is the only member of a person co op all city dwellers who lives full time at the co ops acres he says the rest including his wife and children are back in the city of maracay where they first formed the co op and eight have abandoned the co op effort altogether his wife visits occasionally he says as he takes a break from clearing brush with a machete "she says i should quit the struggle " but the lanky mr morffe who has planted maracuya fruit plants by his shack is determined to see the project through "its tough but we have to keep going " he says pointing with his machete toward the stony ground he says "if the government helps out as it says it will then in two years we could have to milk cows " for some the venezuelan co op program which readily makes loans available to members of a wide variety of co ops not just agrarian is evidently just a way to make a buck some city residents hire watchmen to live a subsistence existence in shacks on their rural homesteads while waiting for government loans in guarico state officials say some local businessmen gave local prostitutes a few hundred dollars for the use of their names to form ghost co ops and then receive loans of up to &# the repayment rate on farm co op loans in venezuela is less than says olivier delahaye an expert on agrarian reform in latin america the whole venezuelan co op program is a "loan factory " mr delahaye says jose lopez occupies a tin and wood shack down one dusty road on a co op "im the watchman here " says the one eyed mr lopez sprawled on a hammock surrounded by empty beer bottles mr lopez says the acre homestead belongs to a person who works for a television cable company in the city of valencia three hours away who drops by once a week to pay his salary an official from the government land institute which certifies that the lands occupiers are making improvements stops by making his rounds the official says the government has granted the homesteader a &# loan to build fences and improve the place although there is no water nearby many involved in the land reform effort say it is riddled with corruption such as in san carlos the capital of the state of cojedes a sweltering town with a statue of a giant mango marking its entrance the last three local administrators of the agency that grants squatters "agrarian letters" the first step in getting a government loan have been fired amid charges of mismanagement and fraud "the struggle against the oligarchy is paralyzed " says anibal lopez an aging former guerrilla sent from caracas to run the agency scandals have dogged almost every agency involved with venezuelas new agricultural development fondafa which is supposed to fund the new co ops has the worst reputation reinaldo barrios a chavez supporter and municipal official in the town of zaraza in the main corn producing region estimates that &# million of money intended for farmers was stolen or lost in the last two years "impunity inefficiency and corruption are destroying the economic and political bases of the country " he charges venezuelas congress is doing an investigation but some high ranking chavistas have labeled mr barrios a "counterrevolutionary " suggesting the inquiry may not go very deep mr chavez is undaunted in late march he held his weekly televised address from a farm that had just been seized he asked an aide what kind of land it was "this is a very flood prone zone " the aide replied saying that of the land is at times under water that didnt stop mr chavez who promised that in three months the government would have an economic development plan for the land "the revolution is here " he said
