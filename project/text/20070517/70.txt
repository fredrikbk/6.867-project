our lawless fda the food and drug administration spends your money and acts in your name to regulate medicines it has been acting badly on april the fda rejected arcoxia etoricoxib a new cox inhibitor from merck the fda explained that it didnt see the need for another drug like this robert meyer director of the fdas office of drug evaluation ii told reporters that "simply having another drug on the market" wasnt "sufficient reason to approve the product unless there was a unique role defined " the fda is supposed to judge whether a drug is safe and efficacious and thats all in its literature the fda even agrees with this role saying that "once a new drug application is filed an fda review team medical doctors chemists statisticians microbiologists pharmacologists and other experts evaluates whether the studies the sponsor submitted show that the drug is safe and effective for its proposed use " but the fda slyly added a third requirement is arcoxia better than whats currently on the market according to the law this isnt part of the fdas approval process and for three good reasons first it would be difficult and expensive to show before its marketed that a new drug is better than all competing drugs it already costs on average just shy of a billion dollars to get a new drug approved a study by joseph dimasi an economist at the tufts center for the study of drug development in boston found that the cost of getting one new drug approved was &# million in dollars &# million in dollars most new drugs cost much less but his figure adds in each successful drugs prorated share of failures and this &# billion figure was before the fda dreamed up this new requirement the fact that were talking about drugs often causes us to forget what we know about other products whose safety and efficacy are important we shouldnt imagine that saturn had to prove that its new car aura is safe works well and is better than accord and camry before a single aura hits the showroom floor if the evidence is too costly for saturn to collect aura will be rejected regardless of the facts to prove superiority what manner of tests would saturn run how much would this cost and how long would it take what if five years later saturn presented its evidence and on some attributes aura was better on some it was equal and on some it was worse than accord and camry is it a better car theres no right answer it would be better for some drivers and not as good for others but there doesnt need to be a right answer this is the second reason drug companies dont have to prove their drug is better than existing drugs people are capable of choosing the cars that best meet their specific needs faced with this situation however the hypothetical federal agency regulating cars would probably say as the fda did with arcoxia "why do we need saturns aura when weve already got hondas accord and toyotas camry the camry and accord are fine cars " hasta la vista aura the non steroidal anti inflammatory nsaid class of products including aspirin naproxen aleve ibuprofen motrin diclofenac vioxx and celebrex have historically grown to their peak sales quickly because there is so much dissatisfaction with whats available a lot of switching between products is taking place patients switching behavior ensures that new products get tried quickly unlike other therapeutic areas where doctors and patients adopt a wait and see approach take pretty much any product and ask around youll find that each product has its adherents and its critics one patient kathleen slocum said that her life without vioxx or other cox inhibitors was "misery " she also pointed out that while over the counter analgesics work well for pain relief the main problem she has had with her severe arthritis is joint swelling and stiffness otc analgesics havent helped her with these problems ms slocum knows more about her specific needs than the fda does isnt it possible that at least some segments of the population would find that arcoxia addresses their needs and remember that the people choosing are self interested patients and their highly educated and trained physicians the third reason drug companies dont have to prove their drug is better than existing drugs is summed up in one word competition take the worst case and assume that arcoxia is no better than any existing drug for anyone but is as good for some patients in that "worst case " arcoxia would compete with existing drugs two centuries of economic theory and evidence show that competition is good a new drug that competes with existing drugs is likely to cause drug prices to fall and competitors to stay on their toes dont be misled into believing that arcoxia which has been tested in over patients is a wildly dangerous drug the fda doesnt make that claim according to merck "there is more long term safety data from controlled clinical trials in terms of patient years on treatment for arcoxia than for any other nsaid including traditional nsaids and cox selective inhibitors " do the german and english governments approve drugs carelessly no and those countries already allow patients to use arcoxia as do other countries in asia latin america and europe the fda is being too cautious the fda knows that it can make two types of errors if it approves a drug later found to be dangerous bad things happen as one former fda employee hoover institutions henry miller put it "this kind of mistake is highly visible and has immediate consequences the media pounces the public denounces and congress pronounces " if the fda fails to approve a good drug few bad things happen to the fda one arcoxia fda advisory panel member david egilman commented "fool me once vioxx shame on you fool me twice arcoxia shame on me " arcoxia never had a chance because the fda never gave it a fair trial americans would protest a government agency that prevented the sale of saturns new aura in favor of established competitors why should we let the fda get away with such behavior mr henderson is a research fellow with the hoover institution mr hooper is a visiting fellow at hoover and president of objective insights which consults for pharmaceutical and biotech companies mr hooper has consulted for merck but not on vioxx arcoxia or other cox inhibitor products see related letter "letters to the editor fda clears the
