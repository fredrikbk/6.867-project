the then tiny soda maker as an underwriting fee for cokes initial public offering the secret coke formula still sits in a suntrust vault but now suntrust banks has sold of its &# billion stake in coca cola and has said it will decide what to do with the rest by years end the move is meant to appease exasperated investors who see the coke shares as an asset that suntrust has been squandering for decades still it could be too little too late to save suntrust from a takeover long thought to be impossible the banks sale of the beverage makers shares could make suntrust more vulnerable because any buyer of suntrust currently would have to include the market value of the coke holding in the purchase price shedding the stock would make a takeover of suntrust less expensive and some analysts have long argued that the coke stake amounted to a "poison pill" that kept suntrust in control of its destiny cokes own fall from glory increases suntrusts vulnerability a spectacular rise in coke shares from the mid s to late s made it far more expensive to acquire suntrust but management turmoil and marketing missteps at coke have left its share price below a peak of around &# in for

decisions on pricing and credit "its still one of the best franchises on the planet " says christopher marinac research director at fig partners llc a bank research firm in atlanta "youve got some of the best cities in the world in the suntrust footprint but the company hasnt executed on growing earnings like they could have " a shareholder return of for the past decade is barely half that of
