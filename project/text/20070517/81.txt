pursuing power and trying to keep it japan rising by kenneth b pyle publicaffairs pages &# china fragile superpower by susan l shirk oxford university press pages &# the day after the japanese attack on pearl harbor the shockwaves through washington were echoed in the words of one new york congressman the japanese have gone stark raving mad actually they had not the seemingly irrational military strike was in keeping with a long tradition of japans going to extreme lengths to pursue power and prestige pearl harbor is just a particularly catastrophic example of americas failure to read tokyos intentions long before dec and in the decades since japan has demonstrated its capacity to stun the world kenneth pyle a professor at the university of washington is hardly predicting another pearl harbor but the message of his "japan rising" is clear dont be fooled by appearances japan may seem to be sitting on the sidelines and watching chinas rise as a formidable asian power but u s policy makers would be unwise to assume that this passivity will continue japan has been a relatively docile global citizen since world war ii largely because of a postwar constitution written by the victors that shackles its military in the modern era many view japan as a tradition bound country where change is glacial and pacifism deeply rooted but looks can be deceiving mr pyle shows how through much of its history the country has shown a startling willingness to jettison tradition and start anew "japans role in the international system has not been driven by great transcendent ideals or universal principles " mr pyle writes instead its behavior "has been marked by its pragmatic often opportunistic pursuit of power " the meiji restoration is a case in point fed up with economic backwardness and an inferior global status japan in a matter of decades re fashioned itself taking cues from the west the young samurai who seized power in "were remorseless in their readiness to sacrifice japans own time honored institutions to the demands of foreign policy " mr pyle writes the meiji leaders created the most centralized state in the nations history imported thousands of advisers and adopted european legal codes in the s japan saw another opportunity "other powers were forming closed regional spheres the international system was collapsing and fascism seemed to be the wave of the future " mr pyle notes the japanese leaders "did not want to miss the bus " such conditions may have prompted japan to invade manchuria in and then launch a wider war with china in japans defeat in world war ii marked the end of more than a decade of aggression but the seeming meekness that followed is easy to misinterpret it was widely thought to express "the trauma of defeat the nuclear allergy and a deeply divided public " what was rarely recognized was that "japanese realism was as strong as ever it was simply being exercised in a different fashion " mr pyle argues or to put it more bluntly "pacifism" allowed japans leaders to focus on economic growth leaving the defense burden to the u s today external factors may once again drive japan to change its ways threats from north korea for example may spur japan to revise its constitution so that it can take a more robust military posture or maybe the pursuit of status will drive change mr pyle describes how the economic realism behind japans passive defense role has come at the cost of self respect and national pride for decades the japanese may have seemed content to focus on the economy with wildly varying degrees of success but signs of discontent have not been hard to find perhaps the most theatrical example came in when the novelist yukio mishima "drew the nations attention to the loss of its samurai spirit " as mr pyle puts is by going to the self defense forces headquarters and committing hara kiri or ritual suicide "a deferential stance " mr pyle contends "was never easy for a proud and spirited people " if mr pyle is right and japan is on the rise then what about china its growing power and importance are widely taken for granted but in "china fragile superpower" susan shirk argues that chinas communist leaders are a lot more insecure than they let on ms shirk a former deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for u s relations with china says that chinese leaders are haunted by a sense of impending doom and with good reason the wounds of tiananmen square have never fully healed "in the communist dynasty almost ended in its fortieth year " ms shirk reminds us "for more than six weeks millions of students demonstrated for democracy in beijings tiananmen square and other cities in every chinese province the communist party split over how to deal with the demonstrations and the peoples republic just barely survived " the specter of public unrest still spooks beijing ms shirk lists a host of domestic threats such as uprisings by chinese peasants who are frustrated with burdens like high local taxes and land seizures given that farmers make up of the population ms shirk writes they "certainly would gain from electoral democracy " another potential source of trouble is chinese nationalism bubbling up from below the communist party in constant fear of mass protests now finds itself hampered by a population that may be more aggressively nationalistic than the government itself of course the party fueled such nationalism for years by focusing the attention of chinas media and schools on inflammatory subjects such as japans wartime brutality beijing may especially regret spending so much time propagandizing about the importance of taiwan chinese textbooks have insisted that "the century of humiliation will not end until china is strong enough to achieve reunification " ms shirk notes but such a claim puts the party in an impossible position it cant afford a war over taiwan which the u s might feel compelled to defend but it cannot appear to allow taiwan to shatter the status quo by formally declaring independence "it is universally believed in china " ms shirk writes that the party "would fall if it allowed taiwan to become independent without putting up a fight " thus beijings insecurities should be the real concern for u s policy makers not its "rise " and the stakes are high ms shirk even goes so far as to claim that "preventing war with china is one of the most difficult foreign policy challenges our country faces " she argues that america should avoid overreacting to chinas economic rise with protectionism nor should it go about "inflaming chinese nationalist public opinion by public hectoring or chest thumping " such actions might prompt beijing counterproductively to try to look tough on america we still have no clear vision of what a world with a strong japan and a powerful china would be like what we do know is that they are both proud nations that demand to be taken seriously on the world stage they pose similar challenges to washington as well ms shirk writes that after many years of sitting on the sidelines "the chinese leaders and public crave respect and approval from the world community especially from the united states " hmm sounds a bit like japan ms parker is assistant editorial features editor at the wall street journal
