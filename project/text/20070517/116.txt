wsj singers bypass labels for prime time exposure from the wall street journal by john jurgensen tonight some million or more viewers are expected to watch the season finale of abcs "greys anatomy" to find out whether cristina and burkes wedding will take place theyll also hear the premiere of a song that will serve as the soundtrack of the episodes climactic final five minutes that high profile tune will be performed by an artist who doesnt have a contract with a record label the singer is ingrid michaelson a year old staten island native who lives at home with her parents and has become the chanteuse of "greys anatomy " she was discovered on myspace by a management company that specializes in finding little known acts and placing their works in soundtracks for tv shows commercials movies and videogames this unconventional model has worked well for ms michaelson who until recently was earning about &# a week teaching theater to kids part time but can now support herself with her music three of her songs have already been aired on this seasons "greys" as the sonic backdrop for the dramas soapy tales of seattle grace hospital the exposure sent one of those songs to no on the itunes pop music chart tonights placement will likely widen her exposure ms michaelsons musical path reflects a shifting entertainment industry landscape where heavyweight record labels are increasingly being sidelined in music deals managers and agents are turning to business models anchored in tv and using the internet to develop new ways of scouting talent for tv shows that make liberal use of music to ratchet up emotions this approach is a way to get evocative soundtracks without paying top dollar for established artists breaking new indie artists is also seen as a way to bring some hipness to a show for the performers its a career jump start that may help them bypass years of playing clubs to attract the attention of traditional music industry scouts and for the middlemen that are bringing the shows and artists together the approach is evolving into a new and profitable path to musical success ms michaelsons efforts to establish her music career began in thats when she set up her page on the myspace site the goal was to network with musicians and potential fans long before she landed a slot on "greys " friends and family told her that her breathy vocals and lush piano work would fit well on the show ms michaelson says she used to watch "greys" and "sing my songs over the dialogue " in the fall of she came to the attention of lynn grossman who founded secret road music services in march of ms grossman herself a tv music supervisor she helps select songs for the fox drama "house" established the company to seek out fresh talent that would work for tv one of ms grossmans consultants was assigned to be a "constant surfer " spending hours online each day checking out myspace pages and other artist web sites she found ms michaelsons page and liked what she heard before long ms michaelson was contacted by secret road via email they told her she would "sound good on tv " ms michaelson remembers her first song aired on "greys" in november followed by another in january and a third last week many shows will only pay unsigned artists about &# for the use of their music on tv while artists on major labels might garner more than &# since she has been signed to secret road ms michaelson has been paid up to &# each time her music has been featured on a show or commercial according to someone familiar with the deals secret road says its cut of ms michaelsons income is in keeping with industry standards of between and tv of course has become an increasingly powerful force for driving music sales apart from "american idol" and "saturday night live " possibly the most coveted tv slots for musicians are on "greys anatomy " which has helped make songs like "how to save a life" by the fray into top sellers on itunes a finale spot on "greys" is considered a particularly plum slot last year the finale allowed scottish band snow patrol to break through to a broad audience and played a role in making its featured song "chasing cars " a hit because ms michaelson doesnt have a record label contract she stands to make substantially more from online sales of her music for each cent sale on itunes ms michaelson grosses cents compared with perhaps or cents that typical major label artists receives via their label so far she has sold about copies of her songs on itunes and other digital stores ms michaelson is pouring most of her profits into pressing her own cds and t shirts hiring a marketing company to produce promotional podcasts and setting up distribution for her cds there are some drawbacks to ms michaelsons approach because she doesnt have a record label or distributor her two cds "slow the rain" and "girls and boys " which she put out herself in and arent carried by many traditional music stores "the fact that you can reach more people in a moving way as an unsigned completely independent artist is a huge shift in how the business works " says jordan kurland the manager for several bands including death cab for cutie which signed to a major label after several independent label releases and wide exposure on television shows like "the o c " but mr kurland says that labels are much better equipped to capitalize on such exposure and that an unsigned artist risks losing momentum "theres a lot more components to an artists career than being featured prominently on a show just as theres more to it than having one hit on the radio " he says although she hopes to sign with a label eventually ms michaelson says she wants to build up her reputation and fan base "i want to make my presence known before that happens so i can have some clout " she says unlike her other tunes on the program ms michaelson wont be able to sell her "greys" finale song immediately after the show airs the song will appear on a soundtrack for the series that will be released in the fall viewers will be able to listen to but not download the song on her myspace site after the shows conclusion tonight
