why china relaxed blogger crackdown registration plan was dropped in face of tech industry protests beijing the chinese government which spent months mulling over ways to crack down on bloggers is retreating from its campaign a development that illustrates the difficulty china faces as it tries to control technology since september the central government has been studying the need to enforce a real name registration system which would have required nearly million chinese bloggers to register their real identities on the web and give up the anonymity many have gotten used to even though bloggers can never be entirely anonymous as they can be traced back to an ip address the chinese government which sees the online world as a conduit for slander pornography and antigovernment views believes the real name system would force the internet community to watch their words and actions but the policy received sharp protests from the technology industry now the ministry of information industry the agency responsible for the policy has abandoned plans for a law requiring all chinese blog service providers to ask their users for verifiable personal details before they can start blogging instead the government is going for the soft approach next month beijing is expected to rally industry players to sign a pact and promote the use of real name registration said yang junzuo who heads a committee with the internet society of china a think tank affiliated with the ministry that has been gathering industry reactions to the intended policy the internet society of china with the ministrys backing will spearhead the effort to get blogging companies to support and implement the real name system on their sites said mr yang "we are leaving it to the industry to guide the development " he said the real name debate is part of a set of broader controls on technology china is attempting to impose on its citizens to mixed success the internet has been a decade old challenge for china while it has brought the country commercial opportunities helping to spark the development of its own online gaming and software industries and its own tech companies it also has surprised the government with its ability to connect citizens and let them access foreign news and distribute sensitive information beijing previously closed internet cafes and has blocked foreign news web sites on several occasions it has forced its own politics on global tech giants with business interests in china in microsoft corp pressured by the authorities shut down a popular blog written by chinese journalist zhao jing who was critical of the government yahoo inc also has been accused of abetting the chinese authorities in april a human rights group filed a suit against the company alleging it had released data that helped beijing identify and arrest several chinese pro democracy writers but analysts say the chinese government is finding that compliance by fiat doesnt work especially now that it also is aware of the need to balance politics with business interests a case in point for the past two years the government has been thinking about passing a real name registration law for the hundreds of millions of chinese cellphone users who buy prepaid cards that let them hold multiple accounts anonymously the government has blamed prepaid cards for emboldening the transmission of spam no such regulation or even a draft of it has emerged because the government has realized the impact of such a policy on the revenue of cellphone operators "if you have real name regulation the number of users for these operators will decline and that will impact their stock performance " said liu bin an analyst with market research firm bda china the government decided to backtrack on the real name system after industry players argued that it would be impossible to implement fang xingdong who owns a blogging company and attended at least four meetings with the ministry of information industry to discuss the policy told officials the system would kill companies like his mr fang is chairman and chief executive of bokee com one of chinas biggest blog services that he says has million registered users and is growing the real name policy would have required his company to crosscheck every user with data from the public security bureau trying to validate the massive volume of personal information would have been a logistical nightmare he said "imagine if i want to check a blogger from zhejiang" province said mr fang whose firm is based in beijings zhongguancun chinas silicon valley "i dont have the technology " mr liu the analyst says most of chinas blogging companies arent breaking even and the real name system would have added to operating costs potentially crippling many of them and pulling back the development of the local tech sector whether the internet society of chinas proposed solution leaving the industry to promote real name registration will succeed depends largely on whether the countrys leading tech companies sign on so far few plan to support it as they have millions of registered users who may not be willing to convert to the new system and may quit if forced to switch sohu com inc and sina corp two of chinas leading internet portals that have millions of bloggers who dont use real names online say for now they dont intend to create blog services that require a real name a representative at microsofts msn spaces said "in terms of real name registration we will keep pace with the central government " yahoo chinas press officer said the company will "continue to follow the relevant laws and regulations" but declined to say whether it intends to implement the new system google inc couldnt be reached for comment there are those who believe chinas industry led effort at getting bloggers to register their real identities will take off jack zhang president and chief executive of zhanzuo inc operates a web based social networking service for young people that includes blogging the site always has required real name registration he says nascent blogging companies like his that can start using the new system from scratch will multiply and eventually will help entrench the real name culture among bloggers "we could play a role to lead this trend " said mr zhang zhou yang contributed to this
