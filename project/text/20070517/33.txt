fix baseball contest update brewers meche are surprises online edition five of last years eight playoff teams arent in line for the postseason the brewers have at times held the best record in baseball josh hamilton has more home runs than albert pujols and gil meche in reverse contract year syndrome has an era two and a half runs better than it was last year before he signed a megadeal with the royals these are some of the surprises that have confounded many of the readers who bravely forecast the season before the first pitch in the daily fixs fourth annual seasonlong baseball contest nine guests and two fixers who have been equally flummoxed offer commentary below along with an update on how the contest has played out so far who are these guys find out and see their picks here will leitch obviously for a cardinals fan it hasnt been the most pleasant way to start the season it has been a true test of my theory that no matter what happened this season id be happy after last years postseason thats still pretty much the case actually im not crying over the total lack of a cardinals offense their best player this year has been braden looper because i still have those dvds of the world series that doesnt make their games any more fun to watch though and if theyre gonna be dethroned in the division this year and boy it sure does look that way id rather it be the brewers than anyone else that fan base deserves it jason fry from now on the only prediction im making is that baseball is the greatest art form ever to spring from the mind of man i mean josh hamiltons second act that final faltering smile lou piniella gives chicago reporters before he decides "the hell with this " and lets the smoke pour out of his ears john maine and oliver perez jose reyes how wonderful is this game predictions bah i mean barry bonds is going to pass aaron before beaches open roger clemens is a yankee again and the brewers are storming the baseball world the orioles arent nearly as awful as angelos deserves the cardinals could go from a world series title to last place the yankees are going to be so tired of soap operas by july that theyll oh theyll just trade for todd helton or something hey i figured out the nationals would be bad im a genius the basics point value in parentheses asterisk means partial credit will be awarded  what do you think of the yankees signing roger clemens for a prorated &# million points ok the fixers didnt ask this question of readers but several of our guests had comments on this one and were collecting those here alex belth it is rare enough that a man his age can perform at a high level but it is unprecedented that a year old has dictated the events of his career like clemens has remember steve carlton struggling around for the final years of his career clemens is earning the biggest paydays of his life in his mid s and getting the kind of perks that nobody receives hey even barry bonds has to go to spring training just two wins shy of clemens has capitalized on his living legend status like no other player not even cal ripken has before jon bois roger clemens will not finish the season with his era below leitch i couldnt be more bored by roger clemens coming back unless hes busted for hgh in which case welcome back i dont see how the yankees win that division at this point but a rod has to be pleased rogers back its funny how after all the exciting talent that has come in the league over the last oh years were still talking about roger clemens and barry bonds more than anyone else  which six teams will be division winners points each readers picks current leaders in bold where applicable asterisk denotes partial credit will be awarded al east new york yankees boston toronto al central detroit minnesota cleveland chicago white sox al west anaheim not of los angeles oakland texas seattle nl east new york mets philadelphia atlanta florida nl central st louis chicago cubs milwaukee houston cincinnati nl west los angeles san diego arizona san francisco colorado holy nl east late wednesday the mets reclaimed the division lead from the braves picked by fewer readers than any other top team the two divisional rivals have been swapping the top spot seemingly every day while regularly residing in baseballs overall top the al central has four legitimate contenders while the al wests mediocrity has left three teams within a game of first place bois i am proud of my prediction of the yankees descent into mediocrity and bostons ownership of the al east and im abrasively cocky over my atlanta braves re ascent to baseballs elite theyll prove me right as long as they keep mark redman with a era as far from their starting rotation as they can if i were to pick a traditionally mediocre likeable al central team to win i should have gone all out and picked the brewers instead of the reds larry borowsky the brewers are no team but theyre legitimately good only one player j j hardy is drastically exceeding expectations theyve got a game lead in a division full of weaklings start printing the playoff tickets the majority of the teams that are off to hot starts have done it largely with homegrown talent rather than with market bought players the braves mets brewers indians d backs tigers and athletics all have lineups and or pitching staffs dominated by players developed in house nick dallamora if you could only see the look of disdainful remorse on my face its sickening i sit here wearing a red sox hat atop my shaughnessy like curls checking the picks we posted to make absolutely sure that i picked the yankees to win the al east almost immediately after submitting my picks i began scrubbing feverishly at my arms with a dry bar of soap but the dirt it just wont come off whatever clemens is going to turn that place around anyway right i dont know whats more surprising the yankees playing like the devil rays or the brewers playing like the yankees the brewers have one of the best records in baseball at and it doesnt seem like a fluke to me im still waiting for ben sheets to turn into the strikeout pitching god i read about i guess thatll be right around the time jeremy bonderman wins the cy young im still banking on the reds making a decent run at this division because well someone has to id like to see houston step into gear but ive seen the ugly side and im scared its sort of like seeing your dream girl in sweatpants and no makeup for the first time sure she looks good now but all you see is a girl clutching onto a bag of cheetos asking you how you knew where she lived joe sheehan i definitely dont want to overreact to the way my predictions look this early the rangers failure to score the brewers dominance of the nl central the diamondbacks young hitters struggles all of this might be moot in another month hey four of my picks for division winners are over thats something i could still see all of them winning their divisions even the trailing yankees and cubs dave studeman in my mind the two biggest surprises of the offseason have been the brewers great start and the yankees awful start the yankees poor showing is pretty simply the result of bad pitching a return to health by chien ming wang and friends will help as will the clemens signing but mariano rivera will have to turn himself around is rich gossage willing to sign on the other hand the brewers surprising start has been fueled by their excellent pitching who knew that jeff suppan would be one of the best offseason signings or that derrick turnbow would find himself again editor note hes lost himself again since studeman wrote these words these performances arent illusory the brewers have earned their hot start the old fashioned way the injury bug may yet hit them and hardy will almost certainly cool down soon but i think the brewers are for real so are the cubs by the way theyve had some tough luck but the talent is there and theyre capable of a strong run my guess is that they will make the nl central a two team race eventually alas i dont have the same optimism for the white sox  which two teams will win the wild cards each al boston new york yankees cleveland detroit minnesota chicago white sox toronto anaheim oakland baltimore tampa bay nl philadelphia new york mets atlanta los angeles san diego st louis chicago cubs milwaukee arizona houston florida colorado pittsburgh san francisco for the last five years at least one wild card team made it to the world series this year readers think their pick for the al wild card will win the league championship while think the same about the nl wild card kansas city and washington are the only teams chosen by no one to make the playoffs  which two teams will go to the world series each al new york yankees boston anaheim detroit minnesota cleveland chicago white sox oakland toronto baltimore nl los angeles new york mets philadelphia st louis atlanta chicago cubs milwaukee san diego arizona san francisco cincinnati houston florida was st louis a fluke champion three teams in the nl got at least twice as many votes and just three of the who pick the cardinals think they can beat als champion last year no one picked the tigers to win the al but the cardinals were the top pick to win the nl and the world series  which team will win the world series new york yankees boston new york mets detroit los angeles anaheim minnesota chicago cubs cleveland philadelphia atlanta milwaukee oakland san francisco st louis san diego arizona baltimore chicago white sox houston hope springs in april if not eternal of teams get at least one vote just readers or fewer than a third pick an nl team to win it all despite the cards five game world series victory last year  which team will have the best regular season record new york yankees boston new york mets anaheim detroit philadelphia st louis cleveland los angeles oakland atlanta chicago white sox minnesota san diego houston the red sox are and have outscored opponents by runs the mets have the next best run differential with readers top pick the yankees are three games under  which team will have the worst regular season record washington kansas city tampa bay pittsburgh baltimore colorado seattle cincinnati florida kansas city is one game worse than washington though the nationals have the majors worst run differential seattle is the only team chosen by readers with a winning record sheehan the royals are making a run at this but i think their hitting will perk up from here on out  who will win the al and nl cy young awards each al johan santana roy halladay daisuke matsuzaka rich harden c c sabathia jeremy bonderman john lackey mariano rivera josh beckett andy pettitte erik bedard bartolo colon kei igawa kevin millwood jonathan papelbon francisco rodriguez curt schilling justin verlander chien ming wang nl roy oswalt carlos zambrano ben sheets jake peavy chris carpenter barry zito brett myers jason schmidt brandon webb dontrelle willis john smoltz chris young tim hudson randy johnson derek lowe pedro martinez bronson arroyo matt cain zach duke cole hamels chuck james anthony reyes in the al josh beckett has the gaudy record his boston teammate tim wakefield has been as good but stands at with little run support similarly afflicted are oaklands danny haren and gil meche the much maligned kansas city free agency signing who each have sub eras but just three wins in the nl brad penny jake peavy and tim hudson have been best john maine and jason marquis are right behind that group along with braden looper whose transition from bullpen to starting rotation is one of the few bright spots for the cardinals roy oswalt readers top pick is with a era last years winners johan santana and brandon webb have been good but not great dallamora jake peavys strikeout total has hovered near double his hits allowed total the last starting pitcher to sustain that ratio over a full season was randy johnson in he may be the only guy ever to have done it neither nolan ryan nor sandy koufax ever achieved that over a full season brandon stroud i think my choice of randy johnson as cy young was born from some subconscious re living of great sports moments passed like the big unit was going to hobble onto the field and start throwing mile an hour bird killing sliders and regain some sort of form and flair now that hes back in the national league maybe ive watched professional wrestling too long and naturally picked the returning old guy to go over as champion the diamondbacks wear jerseys that look like they say "d bags " what the crap do i know  who will win the al and nl mvp awards each al alex rodriguez david ortiz grady sizemore vladimir guerrero derek jeter travis hafner joe mauer manny ramirez mark teixeira robinson cano justin morneau ivan rodriguez gary sheffield vernon wells michael young bobby abreu johnny damon carlos guillen nick markakis

andruw jones derrek lee aramis ramirez jason bay barry bonds carlos delgado adam dunn bill hall chipper jones carlos lee jimmy rollins alex rodriguez remains the als best hitter but hes cooled down considerably since his torrid start vladimir guerrero magglio ordonez and david ortiz have been catching up all three play for first place teams the angels tigers and red sox respectively last years winner justin morneau is second to a rod with home runs seven time award winner barry bonds has been by far the nls best offensive player hitting home runs in at bats and getting on base more than half the time he comes up to the plate see no if voters have bonds fatigue chipper jones j j hardy and prince fielder have been the best offensive players on contending teams while shortstop jose reyes is hitting with extra base hits and steals for the mets ryan howard has fallen sharply from his mvp year in hitting though he has nine more walks than hits and the mvp albert pujols has exemplified the cardinals poor start with his seasonlong slump belth it was hard not to think of bonds as alex rodriguez torched the american league during the first three weeks of the season as curt schilling noticed it is one thing when a good player is on a hot streak and another thing altogether when a great player is on a run rodriguez has since come back down to earth but its incredible to think that bonds had a hot streak like rodriguez only it lasted a few seasons instead of just one month i still stand by my playoff prediction that has the yanks missing october bois as usual whenever i make preseason predictions about sports i made a few calls that were pretty far fetched and as usual before the seasons a quarter of the way over i look like an idiot this spring i predicted alex rodriguez to crash and burn and he responds by posting arguably the best start in the history of baseball id like to note however that although it may seem at this juncture that i could not possibly be any more wrong there is plenty of time left for the yankees to crawl back into contention rendering their games important and thus returning a rod to his ineffective state and andruw jones will quit joking around and stop making me look like a jerk for picking him as mvp right  who will win the al and nl rookie of the year awards each al daisuke matsuzaka alex gordon delmon young b j upton

cole hamels corey hart chris iannetta conor jackson andy laroche andrew mccutcheon tony pena jr felix pie luke scott ryan theriot justin upton daisuke matsuzaka has been good but not dominant for the red sox with a record and a era john danks has a nearly identical era for those other sox of pale hue but his more sparse run support has spelled a record among other al favorites alex gordon and delmon young have been woeful at the plate youngs teammate b j upton has been much better but hes used up his eligibility for this award another devil ray akinori iwamura has excelled in limited action but is on the disabled list other rookies to watch include travis buck who has just seven singles but extra base hits for the as in the nl arizonas chris young readers top pick has six home runs and a batting average while cole hamels has been as good for the phillies fix goof the padres chris young is not a rookie oops josh hamilton has eight home runs for the reds and carlos ruiz is hitting for the phillies both have been much better than popular picks kevin kouzmanoff and troy tulowitzki mike pelfrey has been disastrous for the mets getting sent to the minors after an era start hunter pence has hit well for the astros since his debut in late april as has tony gwynn jr in limited duty for the brewers brandon stroud pujols is batting under and only has six home runs bonds is batting over and has homer bailey plays for the bucksnort dogfish or something and matsuzaka is winning the al rookie of the year unless he gets hit by a school bus i had to check the mirror just now and make sure im not the bizarro version of me im going to use the time tested "its still early you guys " defense and hope that when we do a second update i have not cemented myself as the guy who should be making mid season predictions about tv shows and barbies the nitty gritty points each all questions include regular season games only asterisk denotes partial credit will be given  which

la russa st louis none no obvious candidates so far as the only truly awful teams werent expected to be much better bois charlie manuel will be fired but the phillies will not get better or worse because of it dallamora i picked mike hargrove to be the first manager to be fired this year but im thinking it might be sam perlozzo or john gibbons id say john gibbons for sure but the amount of injuries the blue jays have faced so far this year is bordering hilarious firing him right now is probably a good idea but it just isnt the right time in the publics eye wait until he argues a call incorrectly or makes some small mistake sheehan charlie manuel might be safe but all the injuries seem to have insulated gibbons he doesnt bring much to the table clint hurdle and jerry narron might

here  name two teams that will have only one all star counting those who are on the active roster for the game and those who are chosen but skip it for each team you get correct washington kansas city

one representative baltimore toronto cleveland kansas city anaheim oakland washington cincinnati chicago cubs arizona san diego and san francisco of those teams just oakland made the playoffs the all star ballot has been released and the nats and royals look like good choices shawn hill is the closest thing to an all star on the nationals but hes out for a month with injuries to both arms the royals are a better bet to get two all stars with catcher john buck excelling and gil meche sporting a sub era  on what date will barry bonds hit career hr no just readers dont think hell pass hank aaron on the all time list this year of the who expect it this year the median and mean is august the most popular answer is july bonds has homers in giants games hes on pace to hit no in the teams th game on friday june against the diamondbacks belth i think the bonds story is fascinating hes completely unrepentant aaron faced a lot of resistance when he approached ruths record for very different reasons but bonds is going to break the all time home run record shortly and for a variety of reasons it will not be embraced as a joyous moment bonds is the public face of the steroids era yet he has not faded away like mark mcgwire or rafael palmeiro hes still making things uncomfortable for everyone i have to admit there is something i admire about that bois barry bonds could very well break the record at fenway the giants play there in mid june nearby convenience stores will sell out of d cell batteries while fans load them into their boomboxes and chuck them on the field one conveniently detachable piece at a time dallamora so its now an absolute certainty that bonds is going to break the home run record i pretended it wasnt a lock for as long as i could but i give up im going to the giants game on june so im actually rooting for him now so he can break it there people will be jumping off the green monster to attack him with clubs as he rounds the bases the biggest question now is whom to boo harder at fenway bonds or clemens is it bad that i enjoy booing players more than cheering for them am i a bad person what a grim march toward the milestone the worst part of it to me has been bud seligs righteous pose the pretense that he might not be in attendance for the record breaking clout that coward damn well better be there when bonds sets the new standard nobody is more complicit in the steroid scandal than the commissioner sheehan bondss performance is nothing short of amazing and at some point hes going to have to get proper credit for it whatever you think he did the man has been passing steroid tests for four years now and hes a year old whos the best hitter in baseball write to carl bialik at carl bialik wsj com
