mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q i am in the market for a new smart phone should i wait for the apple iphone when will it be available and when will you review it a apple says the iphone is on track to go on sale in "late june " and i expect to be able to test it and publish a review around that time there will also be many other reviews around then that you can consult i stand by my earlier advice which is that people shopping for a smart phone who can wait until then and who could imagine shelling out &# the iphones base price should wait to read the reviews of apples first phone and take a look at it before making a decision however if you need a smart phone now or cant imagine spending that much then you can ignore the hype and buy a blackberry or a treo or another competitor three other key factors could also make you reasonably ignore the iphone it will lack a physical keyboard relying on virtual keys that appear on the screen so if you prefer a real keyboard the iphone would be a nonstarter for you also it will only work on the at&amp t wireless network formerly cingular in the u s so if you prefer another wireless carrier forget the iphone finally it will only operate on a relatively slow network technology called edge so if you want a smart phone that operates on the fastest cellular networks the iphone is the wrong choice even though it will also include wi fi wireless networking q the wireless connection to my wifes windows xp computer keeps going down the computer is about feet but through three walls from my dell truemobile router should i assume i need a better more powerful router and finally will it also connect to my macbook pro laptop a a more powerful router might help but wireless reception varies greatly depending on home construction and layout you might look for a new router that features a technology called mimo which i have found in my tests can improve both speed and range even with a new router you might also have to move its location there are also various boosters and repeaters that can be used though some of these require more technical expertise to install than most folks have one good method for extending the range of a wireless connection is to buy a set of so called powerline adapters these carry your network signal over plain old electrical lines and some models allow you to create a wireless network by plugging a wireless router into such an adapter in a distant room i described these adapters in more detail in a column you can find at ptech allthingsd com powerline adapters access in my own home i have used both mimo routers and powerline adapters successfully with mixtures of windows and apple macintosh computers including the macbook pro and various dell lenovo and hewlett packard laptops q can i remove the junk programs that came with my new computer the ones you call "craplets" by using the "add or remove programs" control panel in windows a yes but that is a tedious manual process and may not get them all also in windows vista that control panel has been renamed and is now called "programs and features " instead i would suggest first downloading and running a free program specifically designed to eliminate craplets the crippled trial programs and advertising come ons that are now packed into so many new windows pcs this program is called "the pc decrapifier" and can be found at pcdecrapifier com if this program misses a few of the junk items you want gone you can then use the manual method
