sec decision forces investors to make choice limit on fee based programs at brokerages could spark shifts to pricier accounts an sec decision this week that backed pulling the plug on a popular type of brokerage account is expected to force about a million investors to choose anew where to put their money the securities and exchange commission said monday it wouldnt appeal a recent federal court ruling that sharply curtailed fee based brokerage accounts which allow brokers to offer fee based services to their clients including some advice without being registered as investment advisers the accounts at such firms as merrill lynch &amp co morgan stanley and ubs ag hold some &# billion in assets many brokerage firms are now scrambling to retain their clients who are currently enrolled in fee based brokerage accounts by offering to move them into alternative types of accounts and by minimizing the headaches of closing one account and opening another still the development has the potential for major disruptions at some brokerage firms if investors dont make an alternate selection the firms could automatically enroll them in traditional commission based accounts some firms also are saying that if investors choose other types of accounts that also offer advice they are likely to pay more an extra or higher than they did in a fee based brokerage account where annual fees average of total assets the sec asked the court for a four month delay in implementing the ruling to september so brokerage firms can figure out what to do with the accounts "this is a big deal " says jeff strange a senior analyst at cerulli associates inc a boston research company "clients are going to have to deal with some sort of change from what they were comfortable with " while the court decision could benefit some investors who may have been overpaying in fee based brokerage accounts by moving them to traditional brokerage accounts others who may have been happy just getting periodic stock tips from their broker might be forced to move into an advisory program where they might pay more for holistic advice mr strange says some brokerage firms have begun winding down their fee based brokerage programs also known as wrap accounts in which clients pay an annual fee for an unlimited number of transactions and can obtain basic advice from brokers on whether to buy hold or sell a stock wachovia corp this week asked its brokers to stop opening new accounts of this type while morgan stanley says it is likely to do the same next week morgan stanley also expects by the fall to launch a new fee based advisory program offering investors comprehensive advice as an alternative to fee based brokerage accounts and ubs last week held a conference call with its brokers to discuss alternatives to its fee based brokerage program and contacted clients in these accounts but other firms including merrill lynch appear to be resisting the court decision the firm which has the most at stake with more than &# billion in assets in its merrill lynch unlimited advantage fee based brokerage program told brokers in a memo issued tuesday that it strongly disagrees with any action that would end fee based brokerage accounts the firm said in its memo that it would work with regulators "to preserve our clients choice" and encouraged advisers "to continue to use the full range of services that make sense for your clients " merrill declined to comment further the sec has said it will consider additional rulemaking or interpretations that could provide some support to fee based brokerage accounts the controversy stems from a sec proposed rule that excepted stockbrokers from certain elements of the investment advisers act of the rule formalized in allowed brokers to give clients "incidental" advice without having to become registered investment advisers that helped spawn fee based accounts which have been heavily promoted by the brokerage industry although fee based brokerage accounts were meant in part to keep brokers from making excessive trades in a clients portfolio the accounts have attracted regulatory scrutiny in recent years as the national association of securities dealers investigated firms for missteps such as placing buy and hold investors who may have been better off in commission based accounts into fee based brokerage accounts instead in march a federal court overturned the sec rule in response to a suit by the financial planning association which objected to brokers giving advice while having to meet a lower standard of care for clients brokers are required to sell clients only products that are "suitable " investment advisers by contrast must meet a more rigorous standard as a fiduciary which means they must place the interests of the clients first although firms were required to disclose that fee based brokerage accounts werent advisory accounts that distinction was probably lost on most investors "the average investor has no clue what standard a broker is held to " says chip roame of tiburon strategic advisors a financial services consulting firm for investors who trade infrequently the most economical move may be to a commission based brokerage account which charges per transaction and wealthier investors may be persuaded to move to their firms managed accounts where they could end up paying fees ranging from to of assets a year but many investors are expected to opt for a middle of the road type of fee based account known in the industry as a non discretionary advisory account these offer more comprehensive advice from a registered investment adviser and because the accounts are similar in many other ways to fee based brokerage accounts industry officials expect it will be easier to shift clients seamlessly between these accounts in a non discretionary account clients must give permission for the firm to conduct a transaction a discretionary account allows the firm to act on its own firms including citigroup inc s smith barney royal bank of canadas rbc dain rauscher and most recently merrill lynch have launched non discretionary advisory accounts and morgan stanleys planned offering is of this type assets in these accounts jumped to &# billion in the first quarter according to cerulli associates ubs wealth management us says it mailed letters last week to clients in its fee based brokerage accounts alerting them of the potential sec decision the firm which has roughly clients in its fee based brokerage program insightone is considering moving some of those clients into traditional brokerage accounts or into one of its fee based advisory programs such as ubs strategic advisor a non discretionary program its mutual fund wrap accounts or managed accounts says spokeswoman karina byrne most brokerage firm clients arent likely to see any disruption in their holdings during any transition although some investors in moving to a fuller advisory relationship may be encouraged to change their asset allocation if their portfolio isnt diversified investors who switch accounts also may find their investment options limited in advisory fee based accounts so called principal transactions in which clients buy securities from the firms own inventory often arent available due to regulations designed to address conflicts of interest but principal transactions sometimes help clients get a better price on a bond or access to shares of an ipo firms say the more limited investment options "puts the client at a disadvantage " says jim searles senior vice president at d a davidson &amp co a brokerage firm in great falls mont he says the firm is often able to offer bonds more cheaply in a principal transaction than through a third party d a davidson which stopped opening new fee based brokerage accounts in march plans to launch a non discretionary advisory account later this year see related letter "letters to the editor blame the brokers not the
