the group of eight leading industrialized economies long before the year old became a successful and well connected property developer mr hilpert was an undercover agent code name "monika " decorated by both the german democratic republic and fidel castros cuba germany has struggled with some success to honestly confront its dark past and publicize the crimes of the nazi and communist dictatorships of the past century the movie "the lives of others" won an oscar this year for its portrayal of how the stasi blackmailed east germans into spying on and betraying one another but although former stasi agents are often barred from public service jobs mr hilperts coup in putting up the g meeting at the lake schwielow resort shows they are increasingly accepted as normal business partners for the new germany indeed numerous former stasi agents are thriving in business thanks to the experience and connections they acquired during the cold war among others who have adapted well to change former stasi recruiter matthias warnig went to work for dresdner bank a firm he used to spy on he now heads a russian german venture building a natural gas pipeline under the baltic sea martin schlaff an austrian who helped the stasi get around trade embargoes to acquire western computer technology is a successful private equity financier mr hilpert did not respond to fax and telephone requests for comment the german finance ministry which picked lake schielow for the g meeting says it sees nothing wrong with hiring mr hilperts property for the occasion "if theres no criminal case against him i dont see that there is a concern " says a spokesman for the ministry a spokesman for mr brown currently the united kingdoms finance chief declined to comment a spokeswoman for the u s treasury declined to comment in mr hilpert teamed up with a former political adviser to german chancellor helmut kohl and won government subsidies to build the lake schwielow resort until now little has been publicly known about mr hilperts espionage career other than that he was a stasi informant for years but reporters at german public broadcaster rbb have reassembled parts of mr hilperts record by sifting though duplicate copies of documents in official stasi archives long thought destroyed the wall street journal has seen the documents the paper trail shows mr hilpert was no ordinary informant passing on gossip about neighbors or office colleagues in the s and s east germany needed hard currency to pay for imports that propped up its ailing planned economy regular foreign exports werent enough so the regime set up a secret business empire known as "koko " for commercial coordination to bring in foreign money by legal or illegal means including the international sale of arms and art mr hilpert worked at a front company for kokos art and antiques unit stasi files show as a regional head he oversaw the acquisition of valuable antiques from east german citizens for sale abroad the firm tracked down people who collected antique furniture or art objects and paid them below market prices in east germanys near worthless currency says ulf bischof author of a book on kokos trade in art and antiques koko then sold the items in the west for hard currency and a big profit if owners didnt sell their antiques willingly koko often enlisted the stasi with which it had close connections and tax inspectors they would confiscate the objets dart as fines to cover trumped up tax violations "if push came to shove they had ways to get their hands on whole collections " mr bischof says in the s revenue from such antique dealing was declining and koko experimented with other ways of raising money mr hilpert traveled to cuba where his deals with the castro government included arranging the delivery of u s made firearms sold to cuba before the revolution to canada via east germany reports to the stasi by a koko colleague in late describe the trip the cubans were so happy with mr hilperts help they made him an honorary colonel and gave him a cuban uniform with a colonels insignia they also paid for his return flight first class back in east germany a los angeles arms dealer agreed to pay &# for colt caliber pistols the bulk of the cubans merchandise but mr hilperts work for koko was also a cover for his double role as a valued stasi informant mr hilperts business and travels brought him into contact with many people who were traitors or enemies in the stasis eyes his information helped the stasi apprehend them the stasi archives show in mr hilpert delivered a former east german army doctor and his wife into the stasis hands according to an affidavit by a stasi officer on the case the couple wanted to escape to the west via hungary mr hilpert who befriended them over several months offered the couple the use of a vacation apartment owned by koko on lake balaton in hungary in the apartment which was bugged the stasi gathered the evidence it needed about the couples escape plans and it then arrested them the doctor got a four year prison sentence his wife six months the couple never even suspected mr hilpert the wife apologized to him later for the trouble caused according to the affidavit but the stasis anticorruption division suspected mr hilpert of skimming from his antiques deals investigators opened a probe which was eventually quashed by the deputy minister for state security according to an internal report from november the stasi officer involved in the arrests in hungary says mr hilpert was an unusually helpful operative enjoying high level protection "herr hilpert often contacted us and offered his services we didnt have to ask " he says in the affidavit shortly before the berlin wall came down in the stasi awarded him a prestigious silver medal for "loyal services " documents show after germany was unified in mr hilpert went into the real estate business he soon made headlines he boasted to reporters
