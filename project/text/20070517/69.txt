music service from amazon takes on itunes the music download service amazon com inc announced yesterday represents the latest attempt by a digital retailer to meet one of the biggest challenges facing the industry how to sell music that consumers can play on a wide variety of devices including apple inc s dominant ipod for now the easiest way to sell music to create such a flexible consumer experience is to deliver music in a format such as mp that doesnt include copy protection software known as digital rights management or drm music sold through apples itunes store historically has come with drm meaning it can be played only on an ipod likewise music sold on most other services is incompatible with the ipod bill carr amazons vice president of digital media says that consumers find that arrangement "confusing and off putting " and amazons store will only sell music that comes without copy protection meaning it can be played on whatever digital device the consumer chooses amazon one the biggest and best known retailers in the world already has deep knowledge of its customers music tastes that comes from years selling compact discs to them its the latest in a growing line of retailers attempting to challenge itunes but amazons track record and its approach to digital music may not give it much advantage at least early on amazon isnt the first player to offer only music that isnt copy protected dimensional associates inc s emusic service does the same and it could face many of the same problems others have chief among those its library is likely to lack most of the biggest names in music because for now only one of the four major music companies has agreed to license its library to the service emi group plc the worlds third largest recorded music company by sales and the fourth largest in the u s market announced yesterday it would license its catalog to amazons drm free service the three other major music companies havent said publicly whether they expect to play ball with amazon but people close to all three companies said they dont expect to license content to amazon in the near future that means consumers shopping for downloads on amazon will be able to buy tracks from emi artists like norah jones and coldplay but are unlikely to be able to find music by most other major artists including for instance each of the top selling albums last week another complication apples itunes is moving toward offering music without copy protection and also plans to release emis catalog in that format amazons mr carr declines to comment on discussions with other record labels the company says it expects to launch with content from record labels but declines to name any of them beside emi furthermore it is unclear whether typical consumers even think about the kind of problems the amazon service is trying to address thats because apples tightly integrated itunes store and ipod so thoroughly dominate their respective markets that most people may not even be aware that there are restrictions on what they can do with their downloads record company executives say some weeks itunes is responsible for or more of digital music downloads while the ipod commands a market share according to npd group a market research company consumers dont seem all that upset by existing digital rights protection from apple and others analysts say "who cares the answer is music retailers care and record labels care " says eric garland an analyst at research firm bigchampagne llc "who doesnt care satisfied itunes customers " but amazon coms promise to get rid of those restrictions has already attracted people like caroline mage a year old in durham n c ms mage buys a song or two from itunes every few weeks from classic rock and country artists like fleetwood mac and jonny lang ms mage recently bought a new computer and tried to use it to listen to songs she had previously bought on itunes but apple restricts the number of computers customers can use to play music theyve bought and because ms mage had already put her itunes music on several other computers she had to go to apples web site to unregister one of them she also finds it "annoying" that she cant email songs to friends indeed such problems are a reason why most digital music consumers simply download from itunes for use on an ipod the other players in digital music sales comprise two major groups services that sell individual song downloads "a la carte" as amazon plans to and "all you can eat" subscription services such as realnetworks inc s rhapsody which let users listen to unlimited amounts of music for a fixed monthly fee as long as they keep paying apples itunes sells tracks for a flat cents each though it recently said it would sell higher quality downloads without drm for &# wal mart stores inc sells digital tracks through its walmart com for an appropriately discounted cents each but they play only on ipod competitors that support microsoft corp s windows media format niche retailer music giants inc sells downloads of major label content for &# the site has gained little traction with consumers in part due to a combination of high prices and incompatibility with ipods the three biggest subscription services have roughly similar offerings for a fixed monthly fee users of rhapsody napster inc and yahoo inc s yahoo music unlimited gain access to as much music as they can listen to the catch if they dont keep paying they lose their libraries none of the services can be used with an ipod and the rented music cant be burned to cd or otherwise stored permanently for a few dollars more per month music can be copied to a handful of models of portable player but even those devices use special software to stop letting users listen to music theyve downloaded if they havent paid and users are often frustrated by gaps in the catalogs that are even more confusing and arbitrary than those in itunes collection many tracks by popular acts like beck arent available except as second samplers while albums are often missing one or more key tracks often the biggest hits one operation emusic offers a sort of hybrid of these two approaches users pay a flat monthly fee but instead of renting temporary access to music they are allowed to download a number of songs that varies based on the rate they pay as amazon plans to emusic sells only mps that are almost universally playable for that reason its offerings include no major label content the company is unlikely to add even emis drm free offerings when they become available because emi sells them for a premium whereas emusics subscription fees can work out to as little as cents a song digital moves some changes planned for online music amazon com will sell music downloads with no restrictions on how consumers use the files apple expects to offer more than half its catalog without copy protection consumers will be able to listen to songs from amazon com on any device including the ipod corrections &amp amplifications apple inc s itunes store plans to sell some music in a copy protection free format that isnt mp a table accompanying a personal journal
