leisure &amp arts mickey and donald meet dali and durer once upon a time walt disney montreal museum of fine arts through june montreal have you heard the one about the roadside diner on cape cod that got slapped with a lawsuit from walt disney studios the owners had this little pinocchio thing going on in the decor they called their place geppettos and the complaint unfair competition never mind its ancient history now and possibly apocryphal still anyone who ever ran afoul of the disney legal department and there have been many will know how zealously the company controls its monopolies you would not imagine much enthusiasm there for a scholarly show investigating the founding fathers indebtedness to artistic currents modern and historical yet bruno girveau head of collections at the ecole nationale superieure des beaux arts paris hatched just such a notion lo and behold disney gave him unrestricted access to the studio archives and its store of undiscovered treasures "once upon a time walt disney the sources of inspiration for the disney studios" is the result a smash hit at the grand palais in paris the exhibition has now reached its second and final stop the montreal museum of fine arts where it hangs through june some pieces document the fortunes of the disney empire from the breakout performance of mickey mouse in "steamboat willie" eight minutes through the posthumous completion of "destino" seven minutes a collaboration between walt disney and salvador dali first announced to the frank incredulity of the press in it was shelved after an second animation test but chiefly the show concentrates on walt disneys personal golden age and the animated features produced under his supervision the trajectory begins in with the release of "snow white and the seven dwarfs" and terminates with "the jungle book " released in the year after disneys death at age and what are we looking at media mixed beyond belief many of the exhibits preliminary drawings painted panoramas specially prepared for the cumbersome and expensive multiplane camera cels sculpted models of characters in action are material evidence of the work process as samples of disneys finished product there are stills and film clips "steamboat willie" and "destino" run continually at full length as do a few brief enchanting european items from the dawn of animation otherwise the video material consists of an anthology of splendid snippets those clips alone are worth the price of admission these for sure are what parents and children are flocking to the galleries to see but for the story mr girveau wants to tell what counts even more is the huge cache of reference materials picture books cartoons museum quality works of art clips by other filmmakers the classic disney style draws on all these and more you might well expect to encounter arthur rackham and maxfield parrish in this context but not even gustave dores illustrations for dantes "divine comedy" or durers "four horsemen of the apocalypse " which also show up here are all that incongruous disneys sources range from the sublime to the ridiculous his quotations running the gamut from homage to pure spoof the cartoon "modern inventions" recapitulates "modern times" with donald duck sitting in for charlie chaplin snow whites prince charming bears more than a passing resemblance to leslie howard in george cukors "romeo and juliet" the wicked queen owes her glacial beauty to joan crawford her bearing we are assured to the statue of uta wife of the margrave of meissen at the cathedral of naumburg and her metamorphosis into a witch to films of "dr jekyll and mr hyde " theres more the castle in "sleeping beauty" has antecedents in the exquisite illuminations for the "tres riches heures du duc de berry" as well as the cuckoo architectural fantasies of ludwig ii of bavaria when the sorcerers apprentice played by mickey mouse takes his ax to the brooms in "fantasia" the violence is shown in shadowplay just as in silent age classics like "the cabinet of dr caligari" seeing source material and adaptations side by side is revealing and often hilarious much is made of walts european shopping spree with his older brother roy in when they snapped up illustrated publications by the cartload to lay the cornerstone for the studios rich image bank at the same time more glaring debts go unacknowledged engravings in th century editions of the fables of aesop or la fontaine show anthropomorphic mice to be sure but they look just like mice how one wonders might they be said to prefigure mickey mouse with his limbs like rubber bands his four fingered white mitts and those twin satellite dishes he uses for ears appearances aside in what sense was mickey ever a vehicle for aesopian moralizing apart from his guest shot as the sorcerers apprentice his stock in trade was pure slapstick an obvious missing link in his family tree if not the missing link would be ignatz mouse ignatz you may recall was the love interest of george herrimans krazy kat whose surreal three decade career in american newspapers began in to judge by this show disney never heard of him impossible "it all started with a mouse " disney liked to say yes and maybe his name wasnt mickey but hey as picasso said good artists steal and its a scholars job to call them on it the analytical thinking does get fuzzy at times consider for instance the wall label on "cinderella " which neatly differentiates between th century french german romantic and victorian sources "the mice gus and jaq " the text goes on to say "were pure disney inventions directly inspired by beatrix potters illustrations for the tailor of gloucester " pure invention directly inspired by another source well which and how on earth could potters prim well behaved victorian menagerie ever morph into the jazzed zany critters in disneys zoo the truth is that disney assimilated all he touched growing up in rural missouri he showed an early love for drawing painting and comedy but his greater genius was as an impresario along the way "once upon a time" recognizes his dizzyingly international roster of remarkable studio artists claude coats whose gauzy preliminary study for "the sorcerers apprentice" in oil is muted droll and spooky bill tytla evoking the demons of "night on bald mountain" from "fantasia" in the sleek lines of a rocket engineer mary blair who charted the course for "alice in wonderland" in jaunty gouaches gustaf tenggren whose gothic sensibility tinges the preliminary watercolors for "pinocchio " kay nielsen whose pastels are pure art deco and many more their biographies also appear in the lavish exhibition catalog published by prestel as much as their personalities transmuted their eclectic source material disney the mastermind appropriated their personalities to his often whimsical often sentimental quintessentially american vision but the process did not stop there a witty sometimes scathing coda to "once upon a time " on a separate floor traces disneys influence on marquee artists like roy lichtenstein claes oldenburg and andy warhol as well as others who are more obscure in robert combas an in your face exponent of the "bad painting" school scrawled the following subliterate caption across his crummy likeness of the mouse that started it all "mickey nest plus la proprietee de walt il appartient a tout le monde " mickey is no longer walts property he belongs to everybody yes but steer clear of the legal department mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on culture and philanthropy
