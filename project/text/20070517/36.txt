fatal vision how a bid to boost profits led to a law firms demise tax shelters paid off for jenkens &amp gilchrist until irs took interest in chicago tax lawyer paul daugerdas approached a dallas law firm jenkens &amp gilchrist with a proposition he said he sold tax shelters and advice to wealthy clients charging them in part a percentage of their tax savings if jenkens brought him aboard he said he could generate as much as &# million a year in revenue according to three former jenkens partners to jenkens a medium size firm with big growth plans that was serious money much more than any of its lawyers were then bringing in billing by the hour and the overture came at the right time jenkens had recently lost some tax lawyers and mr daugerdas was offering to bring several others with him some jenkens lawyers worried that tax shelters might attract scrutiny from the internal revenue service "if there was a danger we were crossing the line there was no sense in going there " toby gerber a former jenkens partner recalls saying at one management meeting but william durbin jr who sat on the firms board and later became chairman championed mr daugerdas to fellow board members who unanimously approved the hire "we made the case he would be profitable from day one which is a rather extraordinary feat and that this was not a terribly risky" way to give the firm a presence in chicago mr durbin recalled in a recent interview that risk assessment proved catastrophically wrong mr daugerdass tax work attracted lawsuits from tax clients and became enmeshed in a sweeping governmental assault on abusive tax shelters sparking an exodus of lawyers and clients in march after the firm entered into a nonprosecution agreement with federal prosecutors and agreed to pay a &# million irs penalty jenkens &amp gilchrist which once numbered more than lawyers closed its doors for good it was a rare case of a major law firm being entirely wiped out by a scandal in the wake of the fiasco some partners have been wondering aloud whether the firms hunger for more profits and prestige clouded judgments about mr daugerdass practice "the task of leaders is to say no to what is wrong and evil " says mr durbin "i wish i could have been more courageous i played a very large part in bringing about the demise of a firm that i had played a large part of for years and that i loved " david laney chairman of the firm from to says he regrets that the firm didnt part ways with mr daugerdas in when serious concerns arose about the tax lawyers temperament and his side business dealings "if we had taken action i think the firm would have weathered any issues that followed " he says mr daugerdas years old declines to discuss the matter his spokeswoman says he "firmly believes that the tax advice he provided to jenkens &amp gilchrist clients was well within the scope of federal tax law at the time " his tax opinions she says "were approved by senior tax lawyers" at the firm former jenkens lawyers say tax lawyers at the firms austin office vetted mr daugerdass work jenkens &amp gilchrist was formed in under a different name as the primary outside law firm for clint murchison sr the late texas oil tycoon as the murchison family diversified jenkens built a real estate practice and forged ties with local banks over the years the firm helped bring the texas rangers baseball team to the city and served for a time as counsel to the dallas cowboys then owned by clint murchison jr by the early s jenkens had grown to more than lawyers it was known as collegial and laid back former partners say employees would share big buffet lunches on fridays on compensation matters the firm was forgiving former partners say typically not cutting back on the pay of partners called shareholders within the firm whose billable hours fell temporarily due to marital or health problems a bust in texas real estate and banking in the s hit the firm hard costing it business and leading to the firing of some lawyers by the early s as big law firms across the nation focused more on profits jenkens did so too former partners say it decided it had to diversify beyond its dallas base to draw talent it needed attractive finances "a lot of recruits would ask us how stable are you what is your balance sheet like how profitable are you " recalls roger hayse an accountant who functioned as jenkenss chief operations officer when mr daugerdas began talking to the firm in the average jenkens partner was earning about &# a year according to one former member of firm management less than half of what american lawyer magazine reported partners were earning at many leading firms in big cities mr daugerdas who developed tax shelters and headed the tax department at chicagos altheimer &amp gray told jenkens he was dissatisfied with the compensation arrangements at the chicago firm according to mr durbin who took the lead in recruiting him altheimer later disbanded for reasons unrelated to mr daugerdass tax work jenkens had long paid its partners partly based on the firms overall profitability mr daugerdas wanted an above average cut of his own earnings which "was the subject of a lot discussion " says john gilliam a former litigation partner now helping to liquidate the firm "that was contrary to our normal method of compensation " in the end the full partnership approved his hiring and his compensation demand and mr daugerdas joined in late some of the tax shelters mr daugerdas helped put together involved the purchase of foreign currency options according to a lawsuit filed in new york federal court by former clients the transactions were designed to generate paper losses that could be used by wealthy clients to offset taxable income but they were hedged such that clients had relatively little money at risk the irs later took the position that such transactions fail a key test for legitimacy they lack "economic substance " in part because clients put little money at risk in relation to their sizable tax gains the work paid off quickly in mr daugerdass tax shelter team generated almost &# million in revenue about of the firms total according to one person with knowledge of the firms finances that year jenkens averaged almost &# in profits per partner a record high this person says during his seven years at jenkens mr daugerdass total compensation exceeded &# million according to three jenkens sources with knowledge of the firms finances mr daugerdas could be charming especially when dining with lawyers and clients at charlie trotters a favorite chicago restaurant says marshall simmons a former jenkens attorney "he could be as nice a guy as you ever wanted to know " says mr simmons but some partners say his behavior in the office could be annoying "his attitude was that his view was the definitive one and if you didnt agree with him it was because you simply didnt understand him " says mr hayse the former chief operations officer mr daugerdas frequently disagreed with the firms board over compensation says mr hayse "mr daugerdas believed our compensation system didnt adequately compensate the people in chicago who assisted him with opinions " says mr hayse if mr daugerdas felt that he was getting short changed adds mr laney the former chairman "it was like the wrath of khan " mr daugerdas repeatedly locked horns with michael cook an austin lawyer who was supposed to make sure mr daugerdass work accorded with the latest court rulings and irs pronouncements "i would regularly get a read that it was increasingly unpleasant dealing with daugerdas " recalls mr laney "it was a very difficult interaction and it grew increasingly difficult mike would say no you cant do it this way paul didnt like to have his opinions tinkered with " mr cook now at winstead p c an austin law firm did not return calls for comment in the diversified group inc a new york company that sold tax shelters sued mr daugerdas in new york federal court accusing him of selling a tax strategy that diversified had devised without sharing the profits with diversified the litigation was eventually settled for an undisclosed amount that lawsuit uncovered something that surprised mr daugerdass partners while working at jenkens mr daugerdas allegedly had an interest in a company called treasurex financial ltd that received fees from his tax shelter clients according to several former jenkens lawyers mr daugerdas hadnt disclosed that when he joined the firm they say the treasurex issue coupled with mr daugerdass difficult personality prompted the board to discuss whether mr daugerdas should remain at jenkens according to three former members of the firms management mr laney who was then chairman says he took a straw vote in late five of the six board members favored asking mr daugerdas to leave mr laney says he took another vote about a month later he says because "i wanted to have two votes to reassure myself " the result was the same but the board didnt act it was the fourth quarter of the year and the firm was concerned about collecting on clients unpaid bills mr laney says the board feared that firing mr daugerdas would have disrupted the tax lawyers own collection efforts and distracted the entire firm he says "we wanted to wrap up the year in good shape " then take action the following year he says in january mr laney stepped down from the board and mr durbin became chairman mr laney left the firm the following year mr durbin had joined jenkens in working first as a real estate lawyer then for banking clients "he would say that a law firms stock price is its profits per partner " says david cibrian a former member of the management committee says mr durbin "i had a reputation for being bottom line oriented " the new board did not act on the earlier straw vote around that time the irs moved to clamp down on abuses in the booming tax shelter industry which had been fueled by new fortunes made in the bull market of the late s since then the irs has collected more than &# billion of unpaid taxes through a series of settlements involving improper shelters according to the agency in late former tax shelter clients began suing the firm in new york federal court accusing it of peddling fraudulent tax shelters in court papers the former clients say they were notified in that the irs planned to audit them they claim that the irs had previously issued notices calling into question tax shelters similar to ones promoted by jenkens many of the lawsuits were consolidated in a class action suit which accused jenkens of failing to warn clients about the irs concerns so that the firm could continue collecting fees the irs and the u s attorney in manhattan launched investigations mr durbin says he had mr daugerdas shut down his tax shelter practice soon after the suits started flying as the firm responded to the accusations mr daugerdas remained arguing that the shelters were valid many lawyers wanted him fired to "avoid the bad publicity precipitated by the civil litigation " says mr simmons the former jenkens lawyer but if any cases went to trial the firm figured it would need mr daugerdas "you dont want to be at war with someone who is a primary witness in defending yourself " mr simmons explains mr daugerdass earnings started to decline in says mr durbin former partners say mr durbin pressed other lawyers to work harder and to take on more profitable work at a partnership retreat in mr durbin said in a speech that the firm could boost profits per partner by cutting partners recalls mr cibrian the former management committee member in some partners threatened to leave if mr durbin was not replaced as chairman in part because of his relentless focus on the bottom line former partners say thomas cantrill a veteran partner took over top partners began leaving anyway jenkens settled the class action lawsuit for about &# million in early and its insurance covered most of it in late under pressure from his partners mr daugerdas left the ongoing irs and criminal investigations made it difficult to recruit new lawyers and clients "you had these two huge swords of damocles hanging over our head every day " mr simmons says by last fall the firms management had decided that jenkens could not survive intact the firm tried in vain to arrange a merger eventually groups of lawyers from various offices began cutting their own deals with other firms the end came in late march the u s attorney in new york agreed not to prosecute the firm for criminal tax violations in exchange for its "acceptance of responsibility" for fraudulent shelters that purported to "eliminate hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes owed by wealthy clients " the prosecutors said jenkens admitted in a statement that "certain attorneys developed and marketed fraudulent tax shelters those responsible for overseeing the chicago tax practice placed unwarranted trust in the judgment and integrity of the attorneys principally responsible for that practice and failed to exercise effective oversight " the irs simultaneously announced its &# million penalty asserting that an estimated investors had underpaid their taxes it assessed no fines against individual lawyers jenkens clients had to pay some back taxes but none have been prosecuted according to a lawyer who represented them as part of its deal with prosecutors jenkens agreed to close its doors by the end of march mr daugerdas is pursuing a claim in arbitration that jenkens owes him additional compensation "we are contesting his position " says mr gilliam the former partner mr durbin says he has undergone an "interior change" and gotten out of corporate law "i emphasized economics too much " he says "theres a lot more that people bring to a law firm than profitability " he says he is now studying spanish with the intention of helping underprivileged latino children
