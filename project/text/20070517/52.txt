posed by economic globalization some even advocate trade protectionism such irresponsible acts can only obstruct economic globalization and hinder the fundamental interests of both china and the u s our peoples and the sustainable and steady growth of the world economy china and the u s need to based on our respective national conditions properly address issues arising in the course of our respective economic adjustment and resolve bilateral economic and trade issues through enhanced dialogue and consultation and in a reasonable manner attempts to politicize trade issues should be resisted as we know trade deficits are caused by a number of factors associated with economic globalization such as savings and investment correlations the international division of labor and investment relocation the u s trade deficit with china in goods is also a reflection of these macroeconomic factors it does not reflect the overall and genuine movement of interests in china u s
