readback fact vs historical fiction yourcenar makes a roman emperor more real than a historian ever could which gives a truer picture of the past history or historical fiction this question might inspire hoots of derision from professional historians who are rigorously trained never to say a thing happened unless they can prove it sticking to verifiable facts is hard and tedious work especially if those facts occurred when people were taking notes on scrolls of papyrus how much easier it would be just to cheat to make educated guesses about the unknown that would tell a better story that historians might say is what writers of historical fiction do and yet as william styron once said about "war and peace " "a historian can tell you just what happened at borodino but only tolstoy often dispensing with facts can tell you what it was really like to be a soldier at borodino " historians know only the barest facts about the emperor hadrian who ruled the sprawling and fractious roman empire between a d and a d even what historians do "know " they dont all agree on marguerite yourcenar a french writer sidestepped the whole what was hadrian really like problem by writing his memoirs for him no more documents or artifacts about hadrian need come to light nothing could expose his triumphs sins and regrets with such regal dignity as ms yourcenar did in her novel "memoirs of hadrian " she made a real man more real than any historian ever could how do we know if her portrait is true we dont and we never will too many facts about hadrian have been lost to history but when historians "cant agree on what did or didnt happen and no documents exist to support or gainsay their opinions " wrote daniel aaron an english professor at harvard university "why reject the historical novelists ingenious guesses and fabrications " ms yourcenar herself once dismissed the average historical novel as "merely a more or less successful costume ball " but "memoirs of hadrian" is more like a funeral than a fancy dance the novel begins with hadrian on his deathbed as he contemplates his approaching end he records his thoughts in a letter to his young adopted grandson and eventual successor marcus aurelius or mark as he calls him it would be he says the "written meditation of a sick man who holds audience with his memories " ms yourcenars hadrian is a solemn man as befitted his almost divine status "the more the state increases in size and power the more does human faith aspire to exalt the image of a human protector at the end of this mighty chain " he says yet he goes to great sometimes cruel lengths to get the job and takes full advantage of its perquisites "my appetite for power and for money was undeniable as was the craving for glory to give that beautiful and impassioned name to what is merely our itch to hear ourselves spoken of " once when angry with a servant he slaps him forgetting he is holding a sharp pen in his hand he blinds the mans right eye "i had not wished to injure the wretch " he says "i sent for him and asked him humbly to fix the amount of compensation which was his due he replied with a wry smile that he asked of me only one thing another right eye he ended however by accepting a pension " hadrian looks back on his childhood his military campaigns his passions he has a miserable and childless marriage but falls deeply in love with a young man he reviews his record as emperor which historians agree is a good one in "decline and fall of the roman empire " edward gibbon wrote "if a man were called to fix the period in the history of the world during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous he would without hesitation name that which elapsed from the death of domitian a d to the accession of commodus a d " hadrian was emperor for of those years in notes for her book ms yourcenar who died in at the age of said she was experimenting with time in "memoirs of hadrian " on the one hand the period she was imagining seemed "a time that has died " yet measured by human generations that time didnt seem so far away "some five and twenty aged men their withered hands interlinked to form a chain would be enough to establish an unbroken contact between hadrian and ourselves " she wrote in i assume ill be hearing from some readers who prefer their history pure and unadulterated as a history major ill feel a twinge of guilt then ill point out that historians are interpreters too or as ralph ellison put it "historians are responsible liars " finally ill give prof aaron the last word "the best historical novels are loyal to history " he wrote "but it is history absorbed and set to music " write to cynthia crossen at cynthia crossen wsj com
