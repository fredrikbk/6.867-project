capital closing the door going private offers rewards chrysler has a way of marking epochs in american business in the s it represented the rise of the auto industry as onetime railroad man walter chrysler forged a car company out of ailing auto makers and clever engine design in chrysler became the poster child for government rescue of collapsing companies in the s it stood for globalization as it married germanys daimler benz now chrysler is the latest brand name public company to agree to be swallowed by a private equity outfit that makes this a good moment to wonder why so many publicly held companies are going private private equity firms which draw billions from rich folks and institutions and supplement it with gobs of borrowing have plenty of money to spend they have shown investors very fat returns largely because they bought companies cheap in and past performance may not be a guarantee of future returns but it attracts investors banks and the bond market have been eager to lend at generous terms and prices so its clear why buyers are flush but why are companies and chief executives so ready to surrender the advantages of publicly traded stock the ability to raise capital readily on good terms from investors who want diversified portfolios and liquidity the quick answer from those who think the u s overreacted to the corporate scandals of the s is that companies are fleeing the costs of excessive scrutiny by regulators prosecutors class action lawyers accountants and the media but while the hassles of being public have risen more on that in a moment this argument is undermined by the rise of private equity elsewhere in the world part of the answer lies in financial engineering publicly held companies from the standpoint of their shareholders may be too reluctant to take on debt leverage can sometimes increase potential profits despite the textbook arguments to the contrary and debt financed private equity takeovers are one way to leverage corporate assets to that end banks may lend more readily to firms run by no nonsense private equity managers than by image conscious public company ceos if so one would expect profit minded public companies to face pressure to borrow more on their own pressure from activist shareholders to do just that suggests there is something to this but that isnt the whole story one intriguing notion is that public companies in the u s and europe have so much scrutiny and so many stakeholders that they cant do what is right for the business the layoffs restructurings investments that wont pay off for years so they close the door go private and come back as leaner and stronger public companies that is the case made by john snow the former public company ceo and treasury secretary who is now the public face of chryslers new owner cerberus capital management "we think at this particular point in chryslers history there may be opportunities in the world of private investment that create more room for growth and expansion that allow management to focus with greater intensity on the day to day business of producing better cars " perhaps but the past decade or two have hardly seen a reluctance of publicly held companies to turn businesses inside out unions are in decline the u s governments willingness to interfere in business decisions is waning and globalization offers management more clout and flexibility to cut costs steven kaplan an economist who ponders all this at the university of chicagos graduate school of business suggests one driver of this trend is the growing pool of talented proven chief executives who prefer private equity owners to public shareholders private owners are tough they want profits not excuses in the old days being ceo of a public company was easier shareholders were largely passive directors were friendly and forgiving no longer it isnt only accounting rules and lawsuits that followed corporate scandals of the past decade but the welcome in his view aggressiveness of boards of directors and institutional investors in addition private equity can be more lucrative "ceos understand that when they go to run a private equity funded company they have more upside " mr kaplan says particularly as companies back away from stock options and ceo cant lose compensation "private equity owners really pay for performance " he says "and the ceos wont be criticized for making a lot of money" by gaming stock options or other gimmickry "because private equity investors are clearly at arms length " whatever the cause and all these factors play a role this isnt a permanent shift the leveraged buyout boom of the s ended when credit got tighter takeover targets got expensive and squeezing fatter profits from acquired companies got tougher and that will happen again the only question is when
