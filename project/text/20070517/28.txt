dow jones board wont act as bancrofts deliberate directors meet discuss offer from news corp a legal safe haven dow jones &amp co s board met yesterday to grapple with the companys future as a standalone entity and agreed to stay on the sidelines as the companys controlling bancroft family continues to ponder news corp s &# a share offer in a regularly scheduled meeting at company headquarters in lower manhattan the board decided to take no action on the latest letter from news corp chairman rupert murdoch which was addressed to the bancrofts it also heard presentations about the companys status and discussed a number of other matters raised by the offer one such topic the prospect of adopting a change of control package for executives in order to attract executives during an uncertain period for the company according to a person familiar with the matter the boards independent directors are in a delicate position whatever their personal feelings about the offer and regardless of their fiduciary duty to all shareholders both the bancrofts and others the majority voting power of the company is still controlled by the family so far bancroft family members initially opposed to the deal comprise of the overall voting power but the family is divided on whether to rebuff the offer outright or collect more information the ottaway family with an additional of voting power has said it opposes a sale outright the boards position is that to assess the offer at this point would be futile if the controlling shareholder would vote it down anyway that is a safe haven legal experts agree that the board has no obligation to act but legal precedent indicates that the board could make a recommendation at any time its next meeting is set for june but family members have been in frequent contact with one another the company declined to comment michael b elefante a dow jones director and partner at boston based law firm hemenway &amp barnes who represents much of the bancrofts holdings couldnt be reached for comment "the view of corporate law in the u s is that directors dont always have to do what shareholders tell them to do " said lucian bebchuk a professor at harvard law school who studies corporate boards and governance issues "it is reasonable to think the dow jones directors should explore the offer investigate it and make a formal recommendation to shareholders " but the board has no plans to formally consider the offer unless the familys opposition to the bid falls below of the overall voting power according to two people familiar with the boards thinking assessing the offer which is at a premium over dow joness stock price prior to news of the offering becoming public would serve as an admission that the company is "in play" and could open the board up to a confrontation with the bancroft family according to one of those people the boards independent directors have retained simpson thacher &amp bartlett llp to advise them on their legal obligations fried frank harris shriver &amp jacobson represents the company at yesterdays gathering directors also considered the companys position in an increasingly consolidating media world clare hart president of the companys enterprise media group made a presentation to the board on that division which includes dow jones newswires dow jones indexes and factiva the companys newswires compete directly with thomson corp reuters group plc and bloomberg lp and board members have expressed concern that dow jones could be at a disadvantage to those larger rivals especially in light of the thomson reuters merger mr murdoch is arguing that news corp would help dow joness strategic position with its deep pockets and global reach todd larsen the chief operating officer of the companys consumer media group which includes the wall street journal barrons and marketwatch also made a presentation to the board while the board is officially taking no action on the murdoch bid directors are hardly unanimous in their view of the murdoch offer according to two people familiar with the boards thinking several board members were surprised that the bancrofts lodged their opposition to such a rich premium these people said the person board has been chaired since last month by m peter mcpherson president of the national association of state universities and land grant colleges and former president of michigan state university other board members include chief executive richard f zannino four directors affiliated with the bancroft family and other independent directors the change in control issue was seen as potentially important for recruiting executives dow jones doesnt have a provision in its proxy that provides for benefits to executives if the company is sold so the board discussed detailing such benefits particularly if the offer hangs over the company for months although the board is taking no action now it could be more forceful later on the roles of corporate boards and controlling shareholders have been addressed a number of times in the delaware courts many u s companies including dow jones are incorporated in delaware "delaware case law says that the controlling shareholder cant dictate the terms of any transaction and the independent directors must have real bargaining power" with potential suitors says eric chiappinelli a professor at the seattle universitys law school who studies takeover issues and family run businesses mr chiappinelli and others who specialize in corporate governance and takeovers cited a case in which the delaware chancery court denied an effort by media baron conrad black to block the board of hollinger international from selling britains telegraph newspaper mr black was a majority shareholder of hollingers holding company and opposed the deal saying that it required a shareholder vote "controlling stockholders have no inalienable right to usurp the authority of boards of directors that they elect " wrote delaware chancery court vice chancellor leo strine in a page decision in the case that situation however involved the sale of an asset not the whole company
