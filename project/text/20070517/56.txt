library branches in full flower new york this is a spring story a story of the greening of new york the kind of story that hides in small spaces in a big noisy city where being noticed has become a function of hype and excess and the merely wonderful languishes invisibly in unexpected places while mayor michael bloomberg has called for the citys greening with a thousand trees an inspired outreach program of the new york horticultural society called greenbranches has been quietly creating gardens for the carnegie branch public libraries in manhattan brooklyn the bronx and queens a few less distinguished later additions to the system have also been included modest in size but far reaching in impact these tiny islands of tranquillity and beauty are a social and environmental amenity that far exceeds their visibility or size to tour them right now beds of tulips and daffodils standing at attention in the breeze trees and trellises leafing out over inviting seating areas is not only a pleasure of the season but also a lesson in how effective something can be when it balances professional expertise with community needs and does the whole thing right the horticultural society has set the bar high specifying that the design and plantings of these small spaces must be of a quality equal to the architectural standards set by andrew carnegie for the branch libraries he underwrote at the turn of the th century the work of the best architects of their time they were constructed of substantial materials in a restrained classical or beaux arts style that produced handsome buildings and allowed considerable variety many now anchor troubled neighborhoods as the only reminder of the dignity and humanity of a societys cultural heritage where hope has succumbed to poverty and decay the horticultural societys program began in and to date gardens have been completed in four boroughs two others are well along and there are plans for more the gardens are fully funded and maintained by the society in collaboration with other nonprofit agencies and community groups irrigation systems are installed where needed and maintenance is provided by caretakers called greenteams many of these local libraries had setbacks from the street or entrances that might once have been landscaped but had descended into a few tired trees and trash collecting pockets of bare earth those derelict patches have been reclaimed and replanted and the before and after pictures are stunning talk about extreme makeovers the transformation from blight to beauty works miracles called learning gardens they extend and expand the libraries functions from reposeful reading to outdoor classes on nutrition and health there is a read&amp seed program for children that combines gardening and literacy the spaces also function as community gardens for neighborhood activities the way these programs have all been integrated into a seductive environmental amenity is a lesson in the kind of concerned creativity and social involvement that the architectural profession is increasingly abandoning for high decibel pricey glitz it is the landscape architects who are picking up the pieces the greenteams led by a society horticulturist include neighborhood volunteers and interns which brings us to another interesting horticultural society program the society maintains greenhouses on rikers island which jane garmey recently wrote about on these pages and among the greenteam interns are former prison inmates receiving training for horticultural and landscaping jobs the society solicits and receives end of season plant material from commercial nurseries that would otherwise be discarded and digs it in at rikers nurturing it for the next years gardens among the contributions that have sojourned in the rikers greenhouses are plantings from rockefeller centers channel gardens at the end of their display of the very diverse gardens on my tour two in brooklyn and one in manhattan were particular delights in red hook an architecturally anonymous example built in had a narrow bare earth alley along one side that has been filled with diagonal planting beds lush with spring color and perennial greenery a path threads through beds and benches to a sheltered reading or activity area in a kind of pergola at the rear funding was by the independence community trust surprisingly a barbecue stands at the center of the garden something the community requested as a replacement for one that was being used on the abandoned strip of land another surprise is a self planted hops vine on a fence an unexpectedly delicate and ornamental survivor from the time when many old brooklyn breweries were in red hook the zigzagging horizontals of the planters manipulate our perception to make the static narrow space seem larger wider and livelier this bit of design magic by kevin gerard turns the awkward and unlovely into something irresistibly inviting in the brownsville section of brooklyn where public housing seems to stretch desolately to the horizon with endless streetscapes of auto shops and fast food the horticultural society has just completed and dedicated a fearlessly cheerful garden for the stone avenue branch built in by william tubby as the first childrens library designed by linda pollak and funded by the city gardens club of new york city a small surrounding plot of land has raised planters of changing heights accessible to different age groups low benches are built into the planters frames and crushed bluestone walks border old tree stumps that will be carved into sculptures by local artists clematis vines are beginning to climb a wooden trellis in an offset seating area perfect for storytelling brilliant bursts of golden tulips and blue grape hyacinths compete for honors in rows of individual beds the source for the planting plan and the distribution of the colors is an old quilt in the brownsville heritage museum housed on an upper floor of the library a collection founded by rosetta gaston to encourage young people to study black history and culture stone avenue has been renamed mother gaston boulevard the lessons of the learning gardens are as varied as their locations libraries stay and neighborhoods change the aguilar branch on th street in east harlem a solid limestone and granite structure enclosed by giant doric columns designed by herts and tallant in brings us back to a part of manhattan that has cycled up and down today it is surrounded by the familiar signs of gentrification including the five month old savoy bakery next door a simply designed deceptively understated purveyor of plain and fancy pastries and curried beef buns to die for a long morning in brooklyn can make you hungry i have a soft spot for the aguilar garden because it is pure new york all stone and concrete and brick and a hard surfaced grittiness where nature is stubbornly evoked by a horticultural tour de force made up of imagination optimism and minimal means this ultimate city garden is another project sponsored by the city gardens club of new york city designed by mary riley smith and john cannizzo illusion has been achieved with an overlay of natural wood trellises and strategically placed wood planting boxes painstakingly handmade by people who obviously cared a lot about what they were doing the boxes have been filled with the tough indestructible shade loving large leaf plants that city dwellers rely on the way other gardeners favor fairy roses and clouds of aquilegia young wisteria vines reach hopefully for the sun and a sky still partly visible beyond a recently erected building a construction site across the street provided stones for the taking that have been appropriated and assembled into a wall like corner planter what better indigenous environmental expression than a garden growing confidently out of the best manhattan schist the scale may be small but the message is large and it extends beyond the greening of new york to the quality of the city and its people ms huxtable is the journals architecture critic
