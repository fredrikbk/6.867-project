style fashion journal finally womens wear for the hard hat set after years spent making do female workers have choices donning a pink tool belt in blue collar building trades these days women cant get enough pink "they love pink " says dede hughes executive vice president of the national association of women in construction in fort worth texas "they love pink hard hats you know pink " barbie pink pepto pink hot pink this wasnt true years ago when women stormed the gates of engineering construction and architecture fields that can require heavy duty gear and clothing but as the catcalls have softened over the years and many women have climbed the construction ladder a certain femininity is seeping into the laboring trades regardless of your views on pink its appearance on construction sites is symbolic of a new level of confidence for blue collar women this isnt unlike the progression in white collar jobs where women first sought to blend in with the masculine workplace in the s then jettisoned those manly power suits for colorful feminine styles but theres a hurdle that blue collar women are just now leaping these women need flame proof coveralls rugged carpenter pants welding gloves and hard hats for years theyve been piecing together wardrobes from mens wear hiking gear and wrangler jeans theyve suffered inadequate protection from wind cold and flying sparks not to mention ill fitting clothes ellen colglazier the narrow footed director of operations for portolesi construction inc in palm desert calif wore four pairs of socks to fill out her mens steel toed boots now at shes supervising the building of the clubhouse for the bob hope classic golf tournament with a pink hard hat on her head her male employees dont give her a hard time she says but she notes wryly "i also give them their paychecks " getting work clothing that fits isnt just about self esteem cindy johnson construction administrator for road builder granite construction co in indio calif alters her work clothes and safety gear so that loose fabric doesnt get caught in heavy equipment hiking clothes are expensive and not always durable enough for a building site so the former home economics major removes cuffs from long sleeved work shirts cuts off six inches and sews the cuffs back on more than million women work in construction in this country their participation is growing at roughly the same rate as men up in just the past three years according to the bureau of labor statistics notably of these women run their own businesses says ms hughes who adds that construction accounts for the largest growth in new women owned businesses so how come they had bike seats shaped for womens derrieres before they had steel toed boots for their feet these women have long been begging work wear companies like carhartt inc and the makers of dickies williamson dickie manufacturing co to make clothing to fit their curves shorter arms more flexible hips and slimmer hands and feet for years the dearborn mich home office of carhartt received more than letters a month asking for jackets and bib overalls cut for women and narrower more fashionable five pocket jeans with stretch many requests came from women who didnt work in construction or agriculture at all but wanted the clothes for gardening or working around the house or plain sturdy comfort two high school girls wrote in pink highlighter to emphasize their yearning carhartt launched a line of childrens clothes more than a decade ago it expanded to europe but it dragged its feet on womens wear "were a very conservative company culturally " says john mozena a spokesman for carhartt founded in carhartt built its reputation making sturdy overalls for railroad workers its de rigueur in agriculture construction and engineering two years ago carhartts senior merchandise manager jill makinen says her bosses asked her to create styles for women "finally are you serious " she recalls saying she persuaded them to do styles carhartt tests its clothing in the real world so it had to find women like sarah omalley a park maintenance worker in sterling heights mich she says carhartt didnt go far enough the womens pants she tried were cut too much like the mens levis and dickies that she currently wears at work "i do have hips " she says still a test collection last fall sold out in stores around the country now the full fall "carhartt for women" collection is being shipped widely and should be available in coming weeks in the clothing hardware and other specialty stores carhartts staple jackets and vests for men have recently reached cult status among some teens and hollywood types brad pitt gave mens carhartt clothes to the crew of one of his recent films the spokesman says dickies last year launched its own line of womens work wear the gear isnt as hard core as for instance carhartts "double front dungaree" with carpentry pockets and a two layer knee with openings to insert kneepads but the fort worth texas company thinks the womens workwear market has the promise of "a diamond sitting there just waiting to be chipped " says jon ragsdale vice president of marketing "shame on us for not listening to women earlier " carhartt did try once before to tap the womens market six items in brown duck flopped in "it wasnt what women wanted " says ms makinen which is pink carhartt receives so many letters asking for the color that the company keeps them in a file folder marked "pink " still carhartts designers couldnt bring themselves to do a genuine pink so prepare for "vintage rose" an almost maroon color that appealed as much to the men in my office as the women terri piasecki made the same mistake when she launched her web site charmandhammer com in these days she carries a hot pink leather electricians tool belt and a soft pink safety harness "at first i refused to carry pink because i didnt want it to be too frilly " she says "i gave in and now im so glad i did pink is the best seller "
