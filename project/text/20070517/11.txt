can durability trump price in laptop wars hong kong in lenovo group ltd s latest advertising campaign thinkpad laptops get hurled against walls dropped off cranes stuck in the deep freeze and dragged underwater by scuba divers facing tough competition from rivals like taiwans acer inc which makes lower cost notebooks and a revitalized hewlett packard co lenovo is pitching the durability and engineering pedigree of its laptops as a part of the push the companys sales reps regularly stand and bounce on the laptops during sales pitches to corporate clients in an industry dominated by a brutal pricing rivalry championing quality over cost is a bold tactic thinkpad laptops which are typically bought by businesses for their employees are priced about higher than the industry average and lenovo is poised to launch one of the most expensive notebook computers on the market a &# thinkpad laptop aimed at top corporate executives the laptop comes with support services including a promise that if you have a problem a technician will meet you in person within hours to help solve it the average pc sold to a corporate user in the u s costs &# according to research firm gartner inc "were not trying to sell the cheapest computers money can buy " says deepak advani lenovos chief marketing officer mr advani draws a parallel with apple inc "they have a higher price point but people buy for the brand reputation " he says lenovos torture test campaign follows last weeks launch of a new line of thinkpads black laptops with a red dot mouse that have been a staple of the corporate world since their debut in the early s lenovo which has headquarters in both raleigh n c and beijing inherited the thinkpad line from international business machines corp when the chinese company bought ibms personal computer division for &# billion two years ago the tagline for the new campaign will be "from the worlds best engineers come the worlds best engineered pcs " the campaign will include posters and online ads and will be incorporated in other marketing events durability has long been a theme in the companys ads but the company says this is the first time a whole campaign has been organized around its engineering the campaign comes at a critical time for lenovo as the company begins to phase out the ibm brand name and strike out on its own in the u s market while lenovo dominates the computer industry in china controlling more than of the countrys computer shipments the company is struggling to turn profits in the u s the worlds largest pc market lenovo has been mainly dependent on sales of thinkpads to big businesses but that segment of the pc industry has stagnated as growth in the consumer side of the market has surged lenovo controls about of the global corporate laptop market in terms of shipments behind dell inc which controls and hp which has a share according to research firm idc the company intends to make an aggressive push into the consumer side of the market in the coming months as it tries to make its u s business less dependent on the corporate oriented thinkpad line while lenovo isnt permitted to mention the ibm name directly in its ads they are aimed at infusing the lenovo brand with ibms legacy of quality engineering the spots designed by wpp group plcs ogilvy &amp mather will begin appearing in parts of asia in the next few weeks and will launch in the u s later this summer in airports frequented by business travelers in new york chicago los angeles and elsewhere lenovo is allowed to use the ibm logo on its thinkpad products until and can show products with the logo its ads however in an effort to wean customers off the ibm brand lenovo has already started to remove the ibm name from thinkpads shipped to some long term clients and the ibm logo wont appear on products in the new campaign "we want to stand on our own " says craig merrigan vice president of marketing strategy and design at lenovo still lenovo has fought hard to hold on to ibms engineering reputation most of the design and engineering team has stayed in place since the acquisition "ibm paid fastidious attention to every detail regarding quality " says leslie fiering research vice president covering the laptop market at gartner "lenovo is investing very very heavily in this because they recognize that they cannot afford to let quality drop or the perception of quality " the original thinkpad line pioneered many of the durability features that have become standard across the industry including spill resistant keyboards if you flip over a thinkpad youll see two small drains designed to let liquid flow out other thinkpad features include an airbag technology that senses when the computer is being jerked around and instantly protects the hard drive new features include "battery stretch " a setting that lets users extend battery life to more than eight hours on some models by shutting down energy sucking features like cd drives and usb ports and a security function that allows users to log on to web sites by swiping their thumbs instead of remembering a password the redesign tries to reduce the laptops quiet whirring sound which some users complain is like a mosquitos buzz with new fans a lenovo engineer in japan created fan blades in the shape of owls wings which the company says cut through the air more quietly the new models are also slightly lighter than previous generations although thinkpads are still heavier than the industry average in part because of added durability features such as a magnesium roll cage that lines the inside of the case to protect the computer if it is dropped some analysts say lenovos engineering edge has weakened as other companies have caught up and added new durability features "lenovo still has that legacy of good engineering but if you look at their intellectual property they have cross licensed a lot of it so they dont have exclusive use of it anymore " says roger kay president of the research firm endpoint technologies associates inc he also warns that corporate buyers may be more concerned with price than with quality "the issue is that end users dont want to pay for that extra engineering " he says "you tell them youve got a roll cage and an airbag and they say ok how much do we have to pay for that " other companies have also started pitching durability to business customers panasonic corp for example which long made high priced ultra rugged computers for the military and law enforcement has developed a line of toughbook products aimed at business users but they are generally costlier than most thinkpads assessing quality differences between computer brands is difficult because most of the big computer manufacturers including lenovo outsource manufacturing to the same set of companies in taiwan but many branded companies including lenovo still maintain strict control over design and testing specifications that can lead to quality differences while companies closely guard failure rates the thinkpad line typically scores well on reliability in surveys of corporate technology buyers "from a toughness perspective theres still a pretty big gap between thinkpad and their closest competitors " says kirk yang a technology hardware analyst for citigroup inc in hong kong "but now that pcs are a commodity product theres a big market of consumers who care only about price "
