in trade deal a shift on generics agreement opens the door to cheaper drugs abroad easing some patent rules washington a new trade agreement between congress and the white house contains provisions that open the door to more sales of generic drugs in developing countries the plan reversing earlier gains for american drug makers backed by president bush marks the first big setback for the pharmaceutical industry since democrats claimed capitol hill for now the provisions likely only affect pending trade deals with peru panama and colombia but the plan also signals a broader shift as congressional leaders give greater weight in trade talks to providing cheaper medicines for the poor even if it means denying the republican friendly drug industry some of the protection it says it needs the administration "has permitted the weakening of intellectual property protections in these agreements " said billy tauzin president of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america the drug industrys main trade group in an interview "they were desperate to get continuing trade authority" from democrats in congress he said "the fact is their leverage changed since november " the main focus of the bipartisan trade deal announced last week involves requiring u s trade partners to meet new standards for giving their workers labor rights and ensuring environmental protections but the deal also allows developing countries more flexibility in dealing with u s drug makers than they would have had under earlier versions specifically the policy would ease requirements on developing country regulators to prevent the sale of patent infringing products it also releases trading partners from a requirement to extend the time for patent protections as a form of compensation for delays in drug approvals public health advocacy groups have argued for years that u s trade policy under mr bush often protected brand name drug makers at the expense of poor countries in need of more affordable treatments many of those groups said they werent satisfied with last weeks deal even with the changes they say the peru and panama deals advance many of the protections the drug industry wants just fewer than would have existed if the bush administration had stuck with its earlier trade stance "compared to the many steps backward that have been taken since this is a bit of relief for people who want access to affordable medicines " said ellen shaffer co director of the center for policy analysis on trade and health in san francisco "compared to an actual policy that would provide affordable medicines for people and fairly balance that with innovation it is a small step forward " trade is just one of many fronts where the pharmaceutical industry faces a less friendly policy environment after enjoying strong support during years of undivided republican rule some democrats want to rewrite the medicare prescription drug benefit to allow the government to negotiate lower prices with manufacturers some democrats also want to legalize imports of cheaper medications from canada and other countries the bush administration has maintained its support for the industry on those issues and the senate has blocked those policy changes but on exports the administration last week changed course for the last several years u s trade officials and drug companies have worked to push new protections for drug makers in countries such as signers of the central american free trade agreement companies say stronger safeguards for their patents and proprietary data are needed in many countries to delay generic competition and make it worthwhile for the industry to continue to invest in research and development of new treatments under the new american trade strategy the biggest loss for the industry is a change that may shift more responsibility to drug makers for preventing the marketing of patent infringing products under recent trade agreements the u s pressed countries to agree to "linkage " which requires local drug regulators to make sure a generic product doesnt violate any patents before allowing it on the market public health advocacy groups have said this puts makers of brand name drugs at an advantage and burdens regulators drug companies support linkage because it prevents copies of their products from being sold during lengthy court battles without it companies will have to be more vigilant to take industry concerns into account the new policy calls for countries to set up fast procedures for resolving patent disputes another change in the new trade policy would weaken a common provision in past trade agreements that local regulators "shall" compensate drug makers for delays in the process of approving their products by awarding extra time to sell their products free from competition some democrats said this unfairly penalizes consumers in those countries for slow bureaucracies a description of the changes to the peru and panama agreements says countries "may" extend a companys patent to make up for delays suggesting more flexibility on what they are required to do to compensate drug makers health advocacy groups complain the new policy still preserves the data exclusivity provision used to block generic competition in many countries including the u s makers of generic drugs can often win approval by proving their products are equivalent to the original drugs in that process regulators use test data submitted by makers of brand name drugs the data exclusivity provision typically prevents such use of the data for five years acting as an effective hurdle for generics the new policy does however place more restrictions on the five year data exclusivity than previously existed in the panama and peru agreements
