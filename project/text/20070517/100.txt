the morning brief willing to go if he isnt asked to leave online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here the art of the possible a classic example of catch call it what you will there is something illustrative about power and bureaucracy in paul wolfowitzs willingness to leave the world bank but only on the condition that his resignation isnt attributed to the reasons that are forcing him out though a panel of the poverty fighting institutions board has declared him guilty of violating ethics rules and his own contract by dictating the terms of his girlfriends raise and promotion mr wolfowitz is "adamant that he be cleared of wrongdoing" before he resigns people familiar with his thinking tell the new york times but his quest for vindication comes as the white house seems less willing to spend its diminished political capital on his behalf and spent much of the day trying to broker his exit as the washington post reports senior bank and bush administration officials tell the post the compromise proposed by the white house would see mr wolfowitz and a bank committee both admit to erring in the matter thus allowing him to resign but if he cant secure satisfactory terms mr wolfowitzs voluntary departure shouldnt be taken for granted officials tell the financial times resignation by a world bank president in good health would be unprecedented as the ft notes if mr wolfowitz doesnt leave on his own accord his future could be put to a vote by the board whose executive directors represent the banks shareholder governments as the biggest shareholder the u s has the most votes but the europeans and other countries have banded together to remove mr wolfowitz and stand against an all but isolated u s as ft correspondent krishna guha explained on the "newshour with jim lehrer " "nobody wants this to end in a majority vote the world bank has always operated through a tradition of consensus " mr guha said "and at a time when the bank is already riven with strife it would be further damaging to force this to a vote with europe and its allies in asia and latin america and many other parts of the world voting down the u s but that remains a possibility " the antipathy toward mr wolfowitz only continues to spread and german officials are even saying he wont be welcome at a meeting next week in berlin the end game of mr wolfowitzs tenure will undoubtedly affect his succession and the next chief will have to rebuild the organizations credibility among its members as the wall street journal points out he or she will also have to decide how strongly to pursue the anticorruption agenda mr wolfowitz championed but the most uncertainty revolves around washingtons future influence on the bank whose president it has traditionally chosen the journal notes the bush administration can look forward to a protracted hiring process needed to produce a candidate who can please all sides "the previous bank presidents have all been americans and many economists and development experts as well as some member nations contend it is time to change that tradition " the paper adds "though the u s so far has given no indication it would choose a non american the bush administration and its main partners in the bank nonetheless face tough decisions on who should be its next leader " democrats to seek higher domestic spending house and senate democrats agreed to a &# trillion proposed budget that includes &# billion more than the white house requested for domestic spending notably on education veterans and health care programs that sets up a confrontation with the bush administration since "the white house has threatened to veto spending bills that exceed president bushs targets a threat budget director rob portman reiterated yesterday " the washington post notes "democratic budget leaders defended their proposal saying an administration that has increased federal spending by more than since and added more than &# trillion to the federal debt has little standing to complain about a increase over bushs goals for domestic programs " still what amounts to a declaration of budgetary principles represents what the new york times points out is a "broad alternative" to mr bushs agenda it would extend by two years the white houses tax cuts for middle class currently set to expire in but sets budget balancing goals that assume tax cuts for the wealthiest americans will expire the house and senate are both expected to pass the bill today soon to debut amazon vs apple it was only a matter of time but amazon coms announcement that it will start selling digitized music online sure produced some buzz in part because of the companys success as the worlds biggest online seller of cds and because all the music sold through the new service will come free of copyright protection those two factors make it one of the most serious challengers to apples dominance in the online music field since amazon said its songs in the mp format would be playable on the ipod microsofts zune and any other such device as the seattle post intelligencer notes amazon will start with just record labels essentially the catalog of emi which also reached a deal with apple allowing its songs to be sold without the digital strictures that limit copying and sharing and which are favored by much of the recording industry among the uncertainties amazon didnt say when the online music store would open or how much it will charge as the los angeles times reports and just as uncertain in judging the competitiveness vis a vis apple is whether it can match the user friendliness of the itunes store as the wall street journal notes "it is unclear whether typical consumers even think about the kind of problems the amazon service is trying to address thats because apples tightly integrated itunes store and ipod so thoroughly dominate their respective markets that most people may not even be aware that there are restrictions on what they can do with their downloads " still the journal adds amazon brings to the business a deep knowledge of what its customers like that comes from years of being their source for cds also of note associated press u s iran talks about iraqs security will begin in iraq on may irans foreign minister said adding that the negotiations would be exclusively about iraq and that a first meeting in the presence of iraqi officials would be aimed at setting a
