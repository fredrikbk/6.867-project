the daily fix nbas worst nightmare arrives as spurs edge undermanned suns online edition the nbas worst nightmare came true the phoenix suns took on the san antonio spurs in game last night minus amare stoudemire and boris diaw suspended for leaving the bench after mondays flagrant foul by the spurs robert horry suspended for game and game on steve nash the two were suspended despite the fact that they stopped after a few steps despite fans of both sides wishing the league had interpreted the leaving the bench rule with even a smidgen of flexibility despite the importance of last nights game so what happened the suns lost and its hard to believe their top scorer and second best playmaker wouldnt have made the difference and so now the stoudemire diaw suspensions arent just a one day story or a what if they may well cost the suns the series and never be forgotten the nbas commissioner david stern found reason to cancel an appearance in phoenix but defended the suspensions on dan patricks radio show and his sarcastic comments didnt exactly increase the peace "justice lost " writes dan bickley in the arizona republic "so did six exhausted men who tried valiantly to right a terrible wrong and now the well of civic anger is turning to nausea alas were watching history in the making here folks the ugly kind if the suns cant rebound to win this series the nbas decision will be something were moaning about for the next years if not longer " its not the exact ruling that torments fans mr bickley writes "its the net effect of rewarding a team that has been hitting below the belt all series its the realization that the league may have just stolen away a great chance for the suns to win their first nba championship and given the salary cap luxury tax concerns that likely will affect next years roster this could be the suns best chance in a long long time " in the san antonio express news buck harvey notes that the spurs recovered from a poor first half pulling out their victory thanks to late free throws by manu ginobili and a key three from bruce bowen whom suns fans hate slightly less than well theres a long line right now but they dont like him "the spurs franchise hadnt seen this kind of anger on the road since dennis rodman was robert horry times " he writes "but manu ginobili had hed played across the globe especially in some tough spots in europe where the nicer rivals are the ones who throw small objects and so its no wonder hes the one who stood up in front of a few mean signs and boos coming up with points in the fourth quarter game will be in san antonio tomorrow night with the suns back at full strength but also facing elimination on the road game should it occur would be in phoenix sunday espn coms bill simmons filed his take on the suspensions after yesterdays fix and before game but its still a must read he criticizes the nba for being too stubborn for changing the leave the bench rule after it helped bounce the new york knicks from the playoffs but then moves on to what he sees as the larger problem "the nba turned the competitive sport of basketball into something else its still basketball only its a bastardized version of it a certain amount of instinct and competitiveness has been compromised why because of the leagues misguided attempt to create a fairy tale universe in which world class athletes can play basketball without ever raising their voices trash talking bumping bodies exulting after a great play or rubbing each other the wrong way " that gets mr simmons going "now hold on to your seats the pilot just turned off the dont hold back sign " indeed he did and what follows is a blast thats furious impassioned and consistently clear eyed the suns are facing elimination so are the new jersey nets and the chicago bulls the nets kept their season alive last night by beating the cleveland cavaliers to cut the cavs series lead to the nets trio of jason kidd vince carter and richard jefferson were of last night compared with of r in game and the cavs lebron james was held to points in the bergen record ian oconnor looks back at mr kidds contributions last night and his time with the nets "kidd was the one who gave birth to this era " he writes "fitting he was the one to nurse it back from the dead way back when he arrived in the wake of a win season to proclaim over muffled laughter that the nets would be a team and eventual champion of the metropolitan marketplace over the lead tenant knicks no kidd didnt carry those win nets to a record his was a read my lips no new taxes lie he led them to victories and a place with shaq and kobe in the nba finals instead " but lest that get nets fans blood up mr oconnor has a warning "even if the nets win games and the heavyweights to follow pack a bigger punch than these counterfeit cavs the nets ultimately will lose this fight kidd knows it nets president rod thorn knows it nets part owner jay z knows it too thats why thorn considered trading kidd to the lakers in february hell weigh any and all offers this summer that might make the nets bigger younger and better for the long brooklyn haul " the chicago bulls have come roaring back from a deficit to cut the detroit pistons series lead to and usher in every familiar disparagement of the pistons character and toughness no nba team has ever won a postseason series after being down tonight the bulls will try to force a deciding game in detroit on monday night "the series leaders from detroit have the damper armpits and jumpier gag reflexes " jay mariotti crows in the chicago sun times "they do because they have a suspicious problem of struggling to close out a series a byproduct of not being nearly as cool and wonderful as they think they are that was the bugaboo last may when they assumed a lead over lebron james and the cavaliers lost three straight then needed to win game on the road and the clincher at home to survive after wearing down and blowing the subsequent series to miami the pistons vowed things would be different this spring they were wrong theyre still the same phony windbags while theyve yapped and laughed and rejected any reason to worry the bulls have taught them lessons about heart focus and professionalism " in the detroit free press mitch alboms cry from the heart is win it for antonio "mcdyess is the long tall voice of reason on a team full of cowboy swagger " he writes "when other pistons say theyre serious mcdyess says were playing around when other pistons say theyre focused mcdyess says their focus is out the window if mcdyess seems willing to go where other pistons wont its because they have been someplace he hasnt atop the throne nba champs chauncey tayshaun rip and rasheed all have rings mcdyess does not " "come on pistons " mr albom urges "if for no other reason you should hunker down finish this series and win a title with mcdyess as your rallying cry its true at this stage the spring loaded power forward from alabama can no longer jump out of the gym cant impose his will at will cant outmuscle younger players or zoom past smaller ones but he brings a serious intensity onto the floor that is frequently lacking from the pistons second unit and sometimes even from the first " tip of the fix cap to readers thomas cervino and garey g ris found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to
