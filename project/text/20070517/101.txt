this time samsung has made a tiny pc thats practical to use one of the best things about high tech products and services is that they can improve quickly in the high tech world failures are viewed as learning experiences and even negative consumer reactions are taken seriously and internalized immediately so last year when samsung introduced a new class of tiny windows computer called the ultra mobile pc i gave it a harsh review and advised waiting for an improved model that first effort the q was spurned by consumers despite the high hopes of microsoft and intel which conceived the umpc but samsung now has come up with a much better version called the q ultra which will go on sale at major electronics stores starting next month ive been testing the q ultra and at least for certain classes of users i believe its a pretty good product despite some lingering downsides and compromises it addresses the biggest weaknesses of its predecessor and throws in other improvements yet starts at a significantly lower price &# compared with &# for the original q the biggest improvement even though the ultra is a tablet computer still able to accept handwritten notes and meant to be controlled by a stylus this new model now has a built in keyboard its just a tiny blackberry style keyboard but it makes writing emails and typing in web addresses practical the samsung umpc still isnt a mainstream product or one that id recommend for most average users it does run the full version of windows vista or windows xp but its still too compromised to replace a small laptop for most folks however i do see the q ultra as a decent choice for people willing to put up with some limitations in return for the ability to carry a real windows computer that is as small as a thin hardcover book and weighs almost nothing these users include students and frequent business travelers who mainly want to take notes write emails do instant messaging and web surfing and play music and videos for people who want to do a lot of word processing or to create spreadsheets or presentations it would be better to stick to a small laptop the q ultra is a sleek shiny black tablet with a bright sharp seven inch screen that feels great in the hand and has a built in stand on the back so it can be used upright it weighs about pounds is less than nine inches long and five inches wide and is under an inch thick its slightly smaller and lighter than last years model the q ultra is run by a special low horsepower intel processor and has only one gigabyte of memory which cant be expanded but it runs vista acceptably if not exactly speedily you can get one with windows xp for faster performance the main flaws in the first model were a high price the lack of a keyboard a screen that had too little resolution to manage windows weak battery life no built in mouse buttons and no built in cellphone modem to augment its built in wi fi wireless networking in the new ultra model the built in keyboard meant for thumb typing is split with half of the keys on either side of the screen this approach looks daunting but works pretty well once you get the hang of it unfortunately samsung and microsoft didnt build any intelligence into this keyboard so it doesnt automatically complete words add punctuation and capitalize the first letters of sentences unlike the keyboards on most smart phones while still the same size the screen is both brighter and has a higher resolution so open windows can be easily moved and closed there are now mouse buttons and an optional internal high speed cellphone modem is available the navigation pad is simpler and is easily programmable though you have to manually set its arrow keys to mimic the arrows on a real keyboard alas the battery life problems remain in my tests where i turn off all power saving software use maximum screen brightness turn on the wi fi and play an endless loop of music the standard battery lasted just two hours and five minutes which translates to about three hours in more normal usage the &# optional extra large battery which adds a little bulk and weight did only about better and this little computer can still be pricey the base model is &# but there are three better equipped models that can range up to &# thats almost as much as a tiny fujitsu tablet with a regular keyboard and way above microsofts &# target price for the umpc another big problem is start up time even with no programs running it took me over four minutes to reboot the q ultra and over two minutes to boot it after a complete shutdown to speed up start times samsung suggests either turning off vistas snazzy graphics or ordering the one model with windows xp which costs &# still if you dont do a lot of document creation and value small size and weight enough to put up with some hassles the umpc finally is an acceptable choice email me at mossberg wsj com find all my columns and videos online free at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
