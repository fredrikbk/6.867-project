pimcos gross living down a big mistake wrong bet on rates lands big bond fund near bottom of pack at a companywide barbecue last week william h gross celebrated years as skipper of pimcos total return bond fund a job that has earned him a reputation as perhaps the savviest bond manager around and this week pimco could boast of having signed none other than alan greenspan to help it with its economic forecasting unfortunately mr gross is having to accompany both occasions with a mea culpa last year mr gross chief investment officer at pacific investment management co became convinced that the u s housing market was in dire shape and that the federal reserve would have to cut interest rates as a result so he stocked up on securities that would gain from a rate cut and he avoided high yielding corporate bonds on the assumption that a slowing economy would hurt riskier debt that call mr gross acknowledges was a "big mistake " while he was right about the housing market he was wrong where it counts on interest rates the fed hasnt cut rates and high yield bonds have been on a hot streak as a result the &# billion total return fund is trailing far behind the competition for the past year in the past months the fund is up compared with an average for similar funds that may not seem like a lot but in the world of bonds a few hundredths of a percent make a big difference today the total return is trailing roughly three quarters of its peers this is a rare extended spell of bad performance for mr gross in the past years total return fund has provided investors with better returns than of the competition until last year it had never once landed in the bottom half of its category for a calendar year according to fund tracking firm morningstar inc since mr gross took the helm of the fund in may total return has posted an average annual return of compared with for the average fund in morningstars intermediate term bond fund category during this period the average bond fund gained and the average stock fund gained pimco is a unit of germanys allianz ag despite the current woes observers and clients say it would be a mistake to count mr gross out "certainly styles go in and out of favor but bill gross is an example of a portfolio manager whos demonstrated through different market conditions that hes a great investor " says michael travaglini executive director at the &# billion massachusetts state pension fund which has &# billion in the total return fund mr gross years old is a rarity in the traditionally anonymous world of bonds highly visible and outspoken thanks to television appearances he even gets recognized in elevators having mr greenspan on board as an economic consultant fits into mr grosss investment strategy "a lot of mental energy is expended at pimco trying to figure out whats going to happen with interest rates " says paul herbert a fund analyst at morningstar that differs from some other bond managers who place more emphasis on picking individual bonds or sectors of the bond market and try to minimize the importance of getting the precise interest rate calls correct mr herbert says early last year mr grosss outlook for the u s bond market hinged on housing "we did our homework " he says "we sent out scouts into middle america down to florida " they did make some correct calls such as predicting a drop in long term interest rates last summer what pimco didnt foresee was the impact on the u s of the strength in the global economy led by china and the rest of the asia mr gross says they recognized there was inherent strength abroad but they counted on issues such as the u s trade deficit and increasing leverage around the world to have "snapback potential like a rubber band" that would restrain growth and allow the fed to lower rates that didnt happen instead with u s corporations getting a huge chunk of their profits from overseas the overall u s economy and markets were resilient in the face of the housing woes that in turn kept the fed from lowering interest rates "we missed that " mr gross says last week in addition to the anniversary barbecue pimco held its annual gathering at which its investment team gathers with other experts to discuss where the global economy and markets are headed "we see the next months as shifting from the glass half empty to a glass half full " mr gross says "for the rest of the world it looks pretty darn strong" in coming years he says for the u s economy in the near term mr gross remains convinced that conditions will weaken and that the fed will have to cut rates before long as a result he hasnt made any substantial changes to the total return portfolio he concedes that given the economic strength elsewhere it wont be "a roaring bull market" in the u s "itll probably be more stunted " he says
