home &amp family beyond the nest egg what to ask yourself about retirement key questions include go to work or not relocate or stay put when it comes to planning for retirement most people focus first on money am i saving enough is my nest egg big enough yes a healthy savings account is important for later life but unless you have a good idea about what you want to do in retirement how you plan to fill your days and what that lifestyle might cost questions about the size and adequacy of your nest egg are premature here are some of the steps that individuals should take to figure out the life they want to lead in their s and beyond testing the field if many of us fail to consider how finances and lifestyles go hand in hand its because we tend to regard retirement as an event something that happens on a weekday afternoon actually the best retirements are a process one in which many decisions and refinements are made along the way start by taking an inventory of your interests activities and hobbies and ask which of these deserve more of your time if you value reading and education perhaps you see yourself attending classes at a local college or volunteering in a reading program at an area school do you enjoy the outdoors the open road if so maybe you see yourself buying a recreational vehicle or becoming a search and rescue volunteer do you like to collect things perhaps retirement might involve opening an antiques shop or starting a business on ebay the first step is figuring out whether your interests will translate into daily activities whether the activities are doable and fulfilling is the second step we listened to the story of one man who had dabbled in art when he was younger and decided that retirement would be the time when he could indulge this passion but in his first art class he found the work to be much harder and more time consuming than he had imagined and he came to the realization that art wasnt his calling the discovery was something of a shock he had assumed that art would fill his days in later life the point is to do some field testing of your retirement plans before you retire if you think you want to pursue a career in art wonderful but take a few art classes while youre still working to see if the idea makes sense if not you can start exploring other interests to work or not to work at least of retirees today are going back to work and the number of older americans either holding jobs or looking for work has been rising for the past years after dropping steadily for decades increasing life expectancies the end of traditional pension plans and rising health care costs help account for the change how do you decide for yourself whether to work in retirement helen dennis a gerontologist in redondo beach calif recommends that you ask yourself these questions first do you need the money medical costs and other bills are pushing some folks to return to work second would work make your retirement more worthwhile volunteering and taking some classes here and there may keep you busy and happy then again it might not feel like enough the real question is do you want your life to continue to revolve around work or do you want more time to do things you havent had time for third would working in retirement help or hurt your social life as you consider when to retire its important to think about whats going on around you particularly if youre a young retiree and most of your friends are still working fourth if you do decide to work should you go full time or part time before you start a job search decide whether you would prefer a part time job with less responsibility or a more consuming full time job especially if youre intrigued by a new career that would require additional training one idea for how to work in later life is just starting to get some attention holding serial full time jobs in retirement with breaks in between to travel do a home project or otherwise recharge your batteries the experts call it "cyclical employment " volunteering in later life many people say they plan to do volunteer work in retirement but finding the right place to offer your time and services can be a difficult task start by asking yourself what really matters to you homelessness education could you rekindle any volunteer experiences you already found fulfilling or give something a second try tapping skills and knowledge from earlier jobs could help you settle into a volunteer role more easily and help you be more effective in addition having an emissary who can connect you to a nonprofit and explain your skills often helps match you with a meaningful opportunity faster you might want to tap someone you know who has a connection to an agency you would like to help or network until you find such a person to make some introductions even if using your work related skills isnt your ultimate goal those talents might help you get involved with a group in which youre interested keep in mind that the biggest incentive for volunteering may be what you get from the work a chance to go behind the scenes at the local theater pats on the back or friendships with fellow volunteers groups organized to train and put volunteers to work tend to offer more educational opportunities the chance to mingle with fellow recruits behind the scenes access to museums and theaters and recognition all of which may take on increasing importance when volunteer work replaces a career unfortunately volunteer work can be as fickle as any paid job leaders come and go missions change and budgets expand and shrink in the end you might have to try something without knowing that it will be the right fit and you may wind up working with a few different groups to satisfy your goals relocating in retirement baby boomers say theyre more inclined than their parents to pull up stakes in retirement some surveys estimate that as many as one third to one half of retired boomers could be filling out change of address cards even if those figures prove to be exaggerated the sheer size of this generation means that millions of americans now in their s s and early s will end up relocating in retirement changing homes can be jarring in the best of times and a move in retirement can be particularly unsettling couples normally have enough on their hands adjusting to new routines and ironing out new wrinkles in relationships if youre considering a move start by asking what will you miss the most about the community youre leaving what trade offs big and small will you be making are you breaking ties with a supportive church are you walking away from a great community college be realistic too about your chances for "fitting in" with your new surroundings particularly if youre moving to a small town from a big city consider for instance this bumper sticker often seen in florida "we dont care how you did it up north " while you certainly could become part of the local inner circle youre more likely to find yourself joining the ranks of other retirees in the area especially those who have relocated from the same part of the country at the risk of overgeneralizing retirees who relocate tend to be more assertive and more likely to have been managers or decision makers after all starting a new life in a distant locale isnt for the faint of heart however a strong personality that might have been a big help in the business world may not work as well in a rural unhurried environment with a population that has always done things a certain way ask yourself if the temperament of a possible retirement destination is comparable to your own would you prefer the energy of a city or the serenity of a small town still almost everyone should make the possibility of moving a part of retirement planning remember even if you have no intention of relocating in retirement your body might have other ideas the longer you live the greater the likelihood that youll need some kind of care or assistance a recent study notes that nearly of people who reach age will need long term care at some point in their lives and will need it for five years or longer about million americans already are living in continuing care retirement communities or assisted living housing by the year an estimated million older americans will need long term care adapted from
