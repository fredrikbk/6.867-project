at j p morgan in tokyo but even with aggressive expansion and new models honda faces unavoidable challenges higher rawmaterial costs are weighing on all japanese car makers last month toyota said expensive raw materials and sluggish u s demand were the main factors causing weaker than expected growth in net profit for the january march quarter nissan motor co in april said raw material costs cut its net profit in the same period honda says higher prices for platinum aluminum and other metals could weigh on profit this year the company says that it will try to reduce costs in mass production wherever it can but that it isnt planning any layoffs or massive cost cutting measures "unfortunately theres no magic way to overcome higher material prices " hondas mr endo says analysts say honda is too conservative about one factor exchange rate fluctuations last year the weak yen helped japanese auto makers boosting the value of overseas earnings when they are converted into the japanese currency honda expects the yen will eventually strengthen this year it based its earnings estimates on an exchange rate of yen to the dollar so far the yen has remained at about yen it was at yen to the dollar late yesterday in new york many analysts expect the yen to stay around that level they say honda may have to revise its earnings forecasts higher in the middle of the fiscal year if it recalculates the exchange rate with a weaker yen honda didnt comment on whether it will revise its forecasts but the car maker says that if the average exchange rate this fiscal year stays at the yen it was in the year ended this march hondas operating profit will be about the same as last year not all analysts see brighter days for honda seiji sugiura of hsbc worries that a faster than expected rise in costs as well as dependency on the slumping north american market could mean that hondas profit has "hit an impasse "
