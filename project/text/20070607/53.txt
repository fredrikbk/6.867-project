marketers try conquesting to get on rivals nerves in the ad business its called "conquesting " another way of putting it raining on the other guys parade in an increasingly popular form of online advertising marketers are taking out ads right next to editorial content about their rivals the aim is to convert consumers from one brand to another and also to issue a public challenge "we use it to get under the fingernails of the competition " says rick corteville executive director of media at organic an omnicom group inc digital marketing agency whose clients include bank of america corp and geek squad inc a computer support provider one recent conquesting target daimlerchrysler ags dodge brand automotive site edmunds com has dubbed the dodge ram pickup an editors top pick praising the truck as both a capable workhorse and a dependable daily ride but in recent weeks adjacent to the glowing review a prominent ad for rival general motors corp s chevy silverado appeared which the ad noted was the motor trend truck of the year "why would you drive anything else " the ad asks clicking on the ad takes the user to the edmunds com review of the chevy daimlerchrysler and general motors declined to comment the practice which started in the auto industry is now spreading to other industries including entertainment technology and financial services and has even sparked a new verb "to grow a business you need to defend and conquest " says edmunds com ceo jeremy anwyl "the internet is the most effective way to conquest that has ever existed " in recent days anyone clicking for movie times and other information about the dreamworks animation skg inc s family animated movie "shrek the third" on fandango com would see an ad for sony corp s family animated film "surfs up" opening this weekend on the shrek page sony declined comment conquest buys are evolving into a cat and mouse game some marketers are securing ad space up to a year in advance so their rivals dont get it first ad executives say some web sites are actively pushing the practice by setting aside dedicated space for these ads creating new ad revenue streams that didnt exist previously advertisers for years have tried various tricks to undermine their competitors of course but the web which offers marketers the ability to do extremely targeted ad buys right next to specific editorial content gives marketers a more efficient way of trumping each other search engines created the blueprint allowing companies to bid on an adversarys trademarked search terms a recent search for "taco bell" on google for example revealed a sponsored link advertising wendys new steakhouse double melt sandwich monster worldwide inc s employment web site monster com bought search words related to its rival careerbuilder com an online job site owned by gannett co tribune co mcclatchy co and microsoft corp after last years super bowl when careerbuilder ran tv ads showing monkeys working in an office but anyone searching online for careerbuilder related terms saw an ad with the headline "dont monkey around" that took visitors to monster com according to reprise media a search marketing firm owned by interpublic group of cos careerbuilder says it didnt notice a drop in traffic because if people were searching for "careerbuilder" they most likely knew they were looking for the namesake company conquest strategies now are shifting to the display ads that appear next to editorial content on web pages a form of web advertising that is attracting increasing interest as improvements in technology allow marketers to buy precisely targeted ads these display ads also called banner ads are attractive because marketers can deliver a clearer message to undercut the editorial content of another company such tactics were more difficult if not impossible to pull off in the old media world but on the web advertisers often can choose to target their ads specifically to certain topics or key words in the auto industry sites like kbb com the online version of kelley blue book a directory of car reviews and edmunds com regularly publish reviews of new cars selling adjacent ad space to the car makers usually the ads are for the products being reviewed but edmunds com recently began encouraging the conquesting strategy conscious that selling the space to rivals will increase demand for ad space and drive up prices it banned an auto maker from buying out the entire ad inventory adjacent to reviews about its own brands that way some space is always reserved for a competing car maker to buy an ad to further encourage conquest buys edmunds coms ad sales teams prepare charts for their clients that show just how conquest ads can boost traffic to web sites in comparison with ads placed elsewhere on the web if "you go to edmunds and you dont know what car you want to buy clearly you want to use our content to buy a product clearly thats an advertisers dream " says mr anwyl edmunds com ceo "with the advertising consumers have the opportunity to learn about all the choices " because of the competitive nature of the conquest buys many advertisers are close mouthed about their strategies a spokeswoman for general motors for example says only that competitive buys are an important part of the companys online marketing strategy the increasing popularity of "conquesting" is forcing marketers to buy space on sites far earlier than theyre used to fandango com for instance recently started selling more of its premium ad space with most of the major studios on an annual basis some sites make conquest buys more difficult mainly they say to avoid alienating existing ad clients at the edmunds competitor kbb com as well as yahoo inc s finance site marketers have the first dibs on ad space next to editorial content related to their specific products at yahoo finance which lets companies buy ads next to articles mentioning specific stock tickers companies can stop conquest ads if they see a competitor has bought a spot next an article containing their stock ticker the company can match the ad buy and take the space themselves
