the sure bet turns bad funds howl as bear stearns buys mortgages just a few months ago bets against securities backed by shaky subprime mortgage loans were among the most alluring trades on wall street but the market for those securities has since stabilized potentially hurting those who bet against it and left a messy squabble in its wake a band of hedge fund managers accuse wall streets bear stearns cos of attempting to manipulate the market for securities backed by subprime loans by purchasing shaky mortgages bear retorts that it has the right to repurchase mortgages and that sometimes it can help a struggling borrower meanwhile an industry association that oversees derivatives trading has been drawn into the middle of the matter the confrontation provides a window into complex trading and complex ethics in the nations mammoth mortgage market which played a critical role in financing the housing boom hedge funds might not win much sympathy for making indirect bets against the financial health of struggling homeowners but they say they are trying to protect the integrity of a burgeoning derivatives market that stands at the center of the controversy the episode also shows the complicated relationships between hedge funds and the investment banks which trade with them and often fund them bears main antagonist in the squabble hedge fund executive john paulson of paulson &amp co used to work for the investment bank and says even after a series of highly contentious exchanges "we have a very good relationship with bear in all aspects of the business " bear is one of wall streets largest players in the market for credit default swaps or cds instruments that act as insurance policies on various kinds of bonds including those backed by subprime mortgages many hedge funds have bought these swaps effectively making a bet on an acute downturn in subprime home loans bear is widely believed to have taken the opposite position selling swaps and making a bet that conditions will improve or wont deteriorate as much as some people think a bear spokesman says "we are both long and short the market " back in february the shorts looked like they were making a great trade many hedge funds had been shorting a derivative index called the abx that is tied to a basket of subprime bonds with weak credit ratings the index had a value of when it was launched this past july by late february it had plunged to a low of bringing millions of dollars in paper profits to the short sellers the plunge also caused ripples of worry through the stock and bond investors about the broader health of the u s economy the index has since turned around reaching in mid may before sinking back to according to its administrator markit group back in january at a las vegas industry conference bears head mortgage trader scott eichel talked with a small group of traders over drinks in the venetian hotel about propping up the abx index by buying and rescuing some struggling subprime bonds say two people who were there a bear stearns spokesman said mr eichel disagrees with the account but wouldnt elaborate with any details the recovery of the abx index has led to howls from hedge funds which are short subprime including mr paulson who manages a &# billion hedge fund mr paulson says bear wanted to prop up faltering mortgages backed securities by purchasing individual mortgages that were rapidly losing value to avoid doling out billions in swap payments bear denies the allegations "none of the mortgage servicing decisions we make are driven by any activity or outstanding positions in the cds market " says tom marano who runs bears mortgage business in april when the abx was trading at about paulson executives called mr eichel to ask whether he was contemplating a plan to repurchase mortgage backed securities "maybe we are maybe were not " mr eichel replied according to two paulson executives who say he added they should call him if they were interested a bear spokesman said the paulson executives recollection of the conversation is inaccurate the prior day bears mortgage desk had sent paulson a copy of new language it was proposing to the international swaps and derivatives association the industry group that represents traders of swaps and other complex market instruments it exacerbated the controversy the proposed rules would codify its right to prop up a faltering pool of home loans in a mortgage security even if it knew its clients bet those loans wouldnt perform "we were shocked " says paulson vice president michael waldorf that a firm "like bear would introduce language that would try to give cover to market manipulation " also on his mind with a big bearish bet on the abx his firm stood to lose a lot if the index didnt fall mr marano says bear was simply trying to clarify trading rules to "ensure participants understood the terms of the underlying documents " paulson fired off letters of complaint to bear and isda the firm also began rounding up other hedge funds to voice concerns nearly players including the san francisco hedge fund passport capital the dallas hedge fund hayman capital and deutsche bank ags deutsche bank securities unit rallied behind it "all were after is very simply to maintain the markets integrity " says kyle bass a former bear employee who is now managing partner of hayman capital which oversees about &# billion in the subprime market credit default swaps are relatively new to the markets and despite the guidance provided by isda the rules of play in using swap information to drive mortgage security decisions remains a gray area in the world of securities regulation to sift through these issues isda is considering convening a meeting for swap market players this month mr paulson says he is "still friendly" with many people at bear and that he doesnt plan to take his hedge funds prime brokerage account which is housed at bear elsewhere still he says "whoever proposed this language was trying to give people carte blanche to manipulate the market "
