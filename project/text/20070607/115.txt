what battlestar galactica taught me about verdi when season three of "battlestar galactica" ended on the scifi channel not long ago with by my count a blazing quadruple cliffhanger i could have filled the void in my life in many ways i could have watched season three again since id downloaded all the episodes from itunes i could have rewatched season two which has just been re released on dvd in a new complete edition featuring the dark and twisted episodes the producers called season instead i did something truly obsessed "battlestar galactica" is a remake of a truly silly tv series so i filled my void by downloading all episodes of the original show and watching every one of them but heres a lesson as vast as interstellar space nothing is wasted those adorable old episodes taught me something about the work i do which is among other things writing and speaking about the future of classical music the original "galactica" helped me explain something id sensed but hadnt quite understood why some classical masterworks might be starting to recede into the past let me explain both versions of "galactica" share the same premise long ago far away in space killer robots the dreaded cylons almost wiped out humanity a few survivors fled in battered spaceships searching for a legendary planet known as earth we know they made it because their commander is named adama thats a little obvious but the new show makes us believe the whole scenario the survivors are racked by loss and longing the cylons are a mystery theyre edgy sexual even religious humanity might have started the war all this is reflected in the music which starts with a main title theme by richard gibbs that seems to echo the loneliness of space the rest of the sharp and sensitive score composed by bear mccreary after mr gibbs moved on to other work lets the story breathe on its own because it never takes sides often it sits in the background blending into the quiet roar of the spaceships the old show cant compare its cylons are idiots talking in stupid robot monotones astronomy is garbled the producers have a thumb fetish whenever anybody jets into space we see a closeup of his or her thumb pressing a joystick the music heard strictly as music isnt bad at all composed by stu philips a hard core tv veteran its solidly classical in fact grandly symphonic with a main title theme a "star wars" ripoff but not a bad one that gleams with trumpets and triumph but that emphasis on triumph dates both the show and the score it tells us that the war with the cylons in todays terms would be world war ii the war in the new show feels more like iraq and i might note that classical music specializes in triumph almost every great classical symphony ends triumphantly but whats even more dated in the old series is the role the music sometimes plays in what must be the hokiest moment in all episodes adama rallies the survivors "it is my intention " he says with pomp and self importance "to seek out the last outpost of humanity " "this other world where is it " a breathless woman asks "and what is it called " "it lies " adama says "in a galaxy much like our own on a planet called earth " after the pause music sounds intoning a solemn new take on the main title theme and thats when i had my epiphany i remembered that id found a moment much like this in a classical masterwork verdis opera "don carlo " which id heard this year at the met carlo the hero threatens his father the king of spain shock and then who steps up to disarm him but his closest friend double shock in the silence that follows the orchestra plays a tune a rather blatant one linked to their friendship even in the opera house with no thought of "battlestar galactica " i sat there shaking my head i love verdi but that friendship melody was too much too obvious maybe it had power in the th century but now it just made me smile and when i saw the old "galactica " i knew for sure that i cant give verdi a pass on this if something seems dated in a tv show why not in a th century opera times change and if were honest with ourselves were going to find that certain things in the art of the past dont quite work for us any more mr sandow is a veteran critic composer and consultant whos writing a book on the future of classical music
