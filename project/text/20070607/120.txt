would grandma make the cut actor michael j fox the late news anchor peter jennings and gov arnold schwarzenegger are all immigrants they each came here long ago and found a path to a successful career but could they have come here under the "point system" now being considered by the senate as part of an immigration overhaul lets see the proposed point system has a possible score of in four categories employment education english civics and family ties applicants can earn a maximum of points for employment for education and for english when scoring more than points in these three categories combined applicants may qualify for bonus points for having close relatives in the u s incredibly the proposed statute does not indicate how many points a person needs to immigrate there is no minimum no cutoff the choice of who can come in and who is shut out is left to the discretion of the department of homeland security so how would our famous immigrants fare under the proposed system mr fox was born in canada and came to the u s at age he gets no points for education hes a high school dropout or age he also gets zero points for employment because acting is not a specialty occupation nor is it a high demand field just ask anyone in l a and doesnt require a college degree add a few points for speaking english having an employer and maybe even some work experience under a temporary work visa and his score still tops out at enough to stay not likely jennings who died in august was also from canada he had no college degree another dropout but could get points for being a journalist a "specialty field " jennings picks up points for english and six for having an employer plus three for being between and jennings total a paltry points probably not enough to become a major network news anchor mr schwarzenegger came to the u s from austria at age in he had limited english and earned his degree from the university of wisconsin more than a decade after arriving if the point system had been in place for him his total would have been negligible he sold exercise tapes and worked in real estate before becoming mr universe and a superstar none of these jobs are specialty or high demand occupations he could get two points per year for u s work experience with a maximum of lets award him the limit for five years of work here assume he had learned english by that time points and was over age for three more he gets six points for his austrian high school education and six more for having a sponsor thats a meager points enough to terminate his chances now lets compare a fictional miguel gonzales age from mexico he is a skilled horse groomer working legally most of the past five years with a temporary hb visa for a stable trying to win an equestrian olympic medal he earns points for his employment in the u s and more because he holds a high demand job as few americans will do this work his high school diploma gives him six points his u s employer will gladly sponsor him giving him six more points plus three for his age and for his english skills and i almost forgot his brother is a u s citizen four points who filed immigration papers for him a few years ago two points mr gonzales collects an impressive points while messrs schwarzenegger fox and jennings would most likely not make the cut mr gonzales has a good chance to stay highly educated technology workers would also fare better than the california governor with college degrees job offers and a good command of the english language they can easily score points whoever dreamed up this plan has no understanding of the needs of our economy or how our current system operates and apparently little understanding of how the new one will function under current law the foxes jennings and schwarzeneggers would be able to immigrate with a visa for those with "extraordinary ability " the new system would do away with this visa category making it likely that such people will find the doors closed our current employment based immigration system is not broken it actually works pretty well by requiring employers to prove worker shortages or the foreign national to prove extraordinary ability what were lacking is sufficient visa numbers immigration is all about nation building our nation before the system is changed radically we need congressional hearings to look in detail at how the proposed rules will work and who will be able to satisfy the criteria and who will not well want to know if the new system will allow for the immigration not just of silicon valley entrepreneurs and cancer researchers but actors news anchors and possibly even a few governors mr lawler an immigration lawyer is author of "professionals a matter of degree" th ed the american immigration lawyers association
