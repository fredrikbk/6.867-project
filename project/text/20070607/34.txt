home &amp family cranky consumer calling a caterer for an everyday event we try alternatives to costly spread a daunting platter special to the wsj for families with calendars chock full of birthday parties family gatherings and visits by friends the thought of calling a caterer is appealing many caterers though arent thrilled about taking on such small potato soirees but an increasing number of unconventional caterers now offer to bring something out for your guests even if it doesnt qualify as a big and big budget event restaurants have beefed up their take out divisions while high end grocers offer many catering platters to see what kind of service and food you can expect for around &# per head we checked out five nontraditional caterers two gourmet grocers a supermarket a fast food chain and for comparisons sake a local restaurant to see if they could satisfy our food savvy friends we had a group of adults and children and our budget for each caterer was &# overall we were pleased with the easy ordering and delicious platters our guests didnt leave hungry and seemed to be happy after downloading the catering menu from gourmet grocer dean &amp deluca we found mouth watering options like duck and cranberry salad and pita sandwiches of jumbo crab cakes but given our tight budget we were limited to breakfast platters settling on a "broadway basket" of mini pastries fruit salad and cheeses the catering expert suggested we visit the store instead of requesting delivery since the grocery store levies a stiff &# fee for weekend delivery what she didnt tell us we discovered the day of delivery was that an &# charge was tacked on for paper goods if we had that extra amount to use we wouldnt have blown it on paper napkins and plates still the food which arrived just a few minutes late was nicely displayed and downright delicious it would have been smarter moneywise to save dean &amp deluca for a more formal affair placing an order with a whole foods catering specialist was a snap after checking out the options by clicking on the web site we settled on the new york continental which featured an assortment of pastries fruit salad and fresh orange juice &# per person she then reminded us about coffee which they sold by the box for &# add on the delivery charge &# and tax and our bill was a budget busting &# our guests though were impressed by the large quantity and quality of fruit and pastries there were even wheat croissants for the health conscious with so much food we had leftover fruit salad for two days supermarket pathmarks three foot round hero platter drew a lot of oohs from our guests but proved ultimately an unwise choice several guests were daunted by the heros size and were afraid they would spill food all over their clothes those who dared were surprisingly impressed finding the filling a mix of ham salami pepper ham hot ham and provolone cheese to be fresh should we ever hold a super bowl party we wouldnt hesitate to reorder this hero the &# price was right and ordering from pathmarks catering division via deli was a breeze but we were unable to order a dessert platter since our local pathmark didnt have an on site bakery hiring subway required a bit of persistence not only did we have to call back because the staff was too swamped to take our order but we then had to cancel it because we wouldnt be the one picking it up the chain requires the credit card holder to pick up to avoid disgruntled customers but ordering from a location closer to us instead of near the party site also needed to be canceled after being told two days later that the store would not be open in time to fulfill our request so back to the original place we went where luckily they remembered our order so we didnt waste too much more time the pickup was a more pleasant experience the order was ready within minutes and the staff even helped load up the car popular local restaurant le petit cafe in brooklyn n y proved accommodating going over party options for our casual lunch bash despite what sounded like a lively lunchtime crowd after hearing us out they recommended eight paninis sliced to serve guests a mixed salad and a selection of cakes they didnt disappoint the paninis were yummy and most of the cakes were just as appetizing too bad we suffered sticker shock we were &# over our limit after tipping the delivery man write
