the morning brief doctors move closer to stem cell therapies online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here two scientific efforts reported today make tremendous leaps toward applying human understanding of our genetic makeup toward the treatment of disease and the potential cellular regeneration of ailing hearts livers and other organs three separate groups of researchers have been able to create stem cells from the skin of living mice rather than embryos which could prove a boon to doctors hoping to find stem cells therapies for humans nature reports though the near term ramifications for humans are uncertain "if researchers succeed it will make it relatively easy to produce cells that seem indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells and that are genetically matched to individual patients " nature says embryonic stems cells have already been heralded as the source of future cures because they can propagate themselves indefinitely and become any type of cell in the body but they have raised ethical questions because embryos are destroyed when the stem cells are harvested and to attain cells with an individuals own dna patients must in effect be cloned a procedure fraught with technical difficulties on top of the ethical complications the new procedure sidesteps the problems since embryos arent used last year shinya yamanaka of kyoto university was able to use mouse fibroblasts a common type of cell taken from skin to "code" four proteins that triggered cells to "become pluripotent meaning that they could potentially become any of the bodys cells " nature says mr yamanaka calls them "induced pluripotent stem cells " or ips the results were met with amazement and skepticism especially following the false genetic breakthroughs reported by a korean scientist in but this year a second generation of the ips cells passed scientists tests and then a group at the whitehead institute for biomedical research in cambridge massachusetts and another team from the harvard stem cell institute and ucla obtained similar results "from the point of view of moving biomedicine and regenerative medicine faster this is about as big a deal as you could imagine " irving weissman a stem cell biologist at stanford university who wasnt involved in the new research tells the new york times richard doerflinger a spokesman for the u s conference of catholic bishops which opposes human embryonic stem cell research tells the times it "raises no serious moral problem" since no human embryos would be destroyed in the process the advances reported in nature come at a time when the u s stem cell industry is starting to gain political traction after years of being held back by such concerns and opposition to embryo stem cell research by the bush administration the wall street journal notes california has said it will spend &# billion on such research over years and many democratic and republican presidential candidates have voiced support for it separately scientists in britain made what the guardian calls "a major leap in unraveling the genetic causes of seven common diseases including diabetes arthritis and high blood pressure by completing the largest analysis of the human genome " these findings also increase the prospect of finding cures for such problems and preventing them in the first place the findings were produced by research groups and scientists who analyzed the dna of people across the u k the independent says the result is a database handling billion items of genetic information and it could increase understanding of ailments that range from bipolar disorders to crohns disease and at the g group of eight summit host and german chancellor angela merkel has accepted defeat in the european effort to secure backing from president bush on hard targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and stabilizing the rise of global temperature but the financial times reports she attained a commitment from mr bush that the u s will work within the united nations to forge a successor to the kyoto protocol however bleak the prospect mr bush tells the wall street journal and other news organizations that his government is scrambling to reach some kind of compromise with european and japanese leaders at the summit on a climate change plan and even hopes to salvage a political win on the issue for ms merkel today ahead of his meeting with vladimir putin mr bush said he also hoped to convince the russian president that the two countries dispute over a proposed american missile defense system in europe is nothing "to be hyperventilating about " on another bilateral front while meeting with stalwart ally tony blair mr bush said he was "nostalgic" as they faced their last international summit together "this is the last meeting i will have with him as prime minister " mr bush said "im sad about that " the departing british prime minister who said he still hopes to get an agreement on substantial reductions in long term greenhouse gas emissions said "to be absolutely frank at the moment i havent had time to be nostalgic " baghdad embassy builder accused of abuse federal prosecutors are investigating allegations that the kuwaiti company employed to build the u s embassy in baghdad brought foreign employees to work on the project against their will and kept them from leaving iraq the wall street journal reports former employees accuse first kuwaiti general trading &amp contracting of bringing them to iraq when they had been told they were being sent to dubai and then confiscating their passports people familiar with the matter tell the journal the company tells the paper it isnt aware of any justice department investigation and that the allegations had already been looked at and rejected by the state department first kuwaiti had beat out several better known firms in bidding to build the &# million project which includes a heavily fortified compound of buildings in the green zone "though iraq is wracked by high unemployment the company was barred from hiring iraqis because of concerns they might pass information to insurgents or try to smuggle explosives into the compound " the journal says "instead it hired nationals from poor countries such as bangladesh egypt and pakistan for whom the wages about &# per month were far higher than they could earn at home " the allegations come at a time when the bush administration has made a high profile commitment to fight world wide human trafficking but "u s officials have expressed growing concern about human trafficking by companies working on american funded projects in iraq " the journal adds last year the pentagon said a probe "identified a number of abuses some of them considered widespread " committed by pentagon contractors and subcontractors including american firms separately army briefings prepared for the services medical department last february said that "combat medical units in iraq use electronic health record systems based on an outdated microsoft operating system limiting their use on battlefield networks " government executive reports "at the same time medical maintenance and equipment technicians struggle with dysfunctional computer systems used to track equipment readiness " moreover the army briefings said ""combat health care providers deployed to iraq are not adequately trained on the use of battlefield health records systems and patient tracking applications " bae gave saudi prince bandar millions the british defense contractor bae systems paid prince bandar bin sultan the longtime saudi ambassador to the u s million pounds &# million a year for more than a decade at a time when he was helping to broker the billion pound &# billion sale of british warplanes to saudi arabia the bbc reports the u k defence ministry was fully aware of the

is only seven episodes into a episode run with the nazis just having invaded france but "its political message is already starting to come through " variety reports director hassan fathi has avoided the anti semitism of mr ahmadinejad in favor of what the trade publication calls "a more humanist message about how well irans jewish citizens were treated by their hosts" and "draws a stark contrast with treatment meted out to europes jewish population during the same period " mr fathi citing what he said were historical documents tells variety he was trying to show how "iranian people have played an important role in saving the lives of hundreds of jews from this nazi hell " also of note financial times world equity markets fell heavily yesterday as investors reconciled themselves to higher interest rates in europe and little prospect of a cut in the u s bond yields have jumped sharply in recent weeks amid growing evidence of the resilience of the u s economy and as robust growth
