wage gains fan inflation worries slower productivity growth has businesses struggling to control labor costs new evidence that american companies are having a hard time keeping labor costs under control raised worries about a pickup in inflation sending stocks tumbling the labor department reported that the sum nonfarm businesses pay their workers for each unit of production rose at an annualized rate of in the first quarter sharply exceeding its initial estimate of the jump in so called unit labor costs stemmed from a combination of factors sharper compensation growth which was revised upward to from and lower growth in productivity or output per hour which was revised down to from while strong growth in jobs and wages is good for workers it raises the possibility that companies unable to offset higher labor costs by increasing productivity will try to pass those costs along to consumers a trend that could fuel inflation and prompt the federal reserve to raise interest rates in response "even if economic growth is not gangbusters the fed could end up with an inflation problem " said stephen stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital in greenwich conn concerns that the fed might ride harder on the economic brakes contributed to yesterdays decline in stocks market participants said "people are worried " said robert pavlik chief investment officer at oaktree asset management in new york "higher unit labor costs strengthen the bears argument for higher inflation and the need for a rate increase from the fed " the dow jones industrial average yesterday closed at down points or investors in futures markets however made little change in their bets on what the fed will do with its short term interest rate target which has stood at for more than a year the odds remained slightly in favor of a rate cut by the end of this year the trend in labor costs and productivity means a lot to policy makers at the fed who are trying to set short term interest rates that will control inflation without unduly damping economic growth a lower rate of productivity growth would mean that the fed would have to keep interest rates higher effectively sacrificing growth to make sure inflation stays in check yesterdays labor department report added to economists concerns that slower productivity growth could be lowering the longer term "speed limit" at which the economy can grow without overheating during the technology bubble of the late s some economists thought that speed limit was as high as a year in inflation adjusted terms now some think it could be as low as the latest data have shown the economy regaining momentum after a slow first quarter in which it grew at an annualized inflation adjusted rate of just the slowest rate since late the feds preferred gauge of inflation slowed to in april at the top of the central banks perceived comfort range the u s economy is coming off a decade long boom in productivity growth in and labor productivity surged at an average annual rate of almost then slowed to about growth in and since then it has grown at an annualized rate of about much of that decline is the natural result of the economys slowdown when economic growth slows faster than companies cut back on hiring and shifts output per hour also slows some economists see the recorded drop in productivity as modest given the sharpness of the recent slowdown in growth "what were looking at in the first quarter is a cyclical slowdown in productivity " said brian bethune u s economist at global insight "underlying productivity growth is still very good " with the economy regaining momentum in the current quarter he expects productivity growth to rebound to or more many economists though see the decline in productivity growth as part of a longer term structural change a sign that the big productivity gains from technology advances in the late s and cost cutting in the first part of this decade are beginning to peter out in one study three fed staff economists concluded productivity is on track to grow more slowly than in the past decade but still at a faster rate than in the two decades that preceded the boom "at this stage you have to assume that theres some kind of a structural slowdown in productivity " said ethan harris chief u s economist at lehman brothers in new york he noted that the year to year growth in productivity for nonfinancial corporate businesses which tends to be more accurately measured than the overall rate was only in the first quarter the slowest rate since "theres really two pieces of bad news here in one number its the risk of greater cost pass through to inflation and a lower speed limit for economic growth " mr harris said separately the national association of realtors again lowered its forecast for the housing market it expects sales for previously owned homes to decline this year to million compared with a previously forecast drop of new home sales are expected to tumble to compared with a prior forecast of a drop michael corkery contributed to this article
