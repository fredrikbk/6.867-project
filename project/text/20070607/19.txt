buyout firms have to settle for smaller stakes in india in recent years the worlds largest private equity firms have rushed to india their big idea invest lots of money to tap into one of the worlds fastest growing economies so far its not working out that way even though billions of dollars have been raised for investing in india hardly any big deals are being done the few that have happened are much less sophisticated and lucrative than the deals that the private equity business is renowned for world wide rather than full blown buyouts where private equity firms purchase publicly listed companies take them private restructure them and sell them two or three years later for a fat profit big private equity deals in india so far have involved the purchase of small passive stakes in companies thats a strategy more common among plain vanilla mutual funds take carlyle groups &# million purchase late last month of just of hdfc bank ltd a publicly traded indian bank the u s firm wasnt even the first major foreign stakeholder citigroup inc already owned a bigger stake despite its relatively small size that deal was the second biggest private equity transaction in india last year kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co bought an stake in flextronics software systems ltd for &# million carlyles purchase may turn out to be lucrative for its investors because hdfcs stock price has been rising but it also highlights the fact that opportunities for private equity to follow its classic playbook have proved elusive so far this year just of the &# billion spent by private equity firms in india has gone to buyouts according to the centre for asia private equity research in hong kong the rest has gone to purchases of stakes in public companies and on seed capital for smaller firms and other forms of financing there are a host of reasons for that among the biggest many of indias largest public companies remain family controlled and many families are reluctant to sell what they consider the familys crown jewels "families are very aware of the growth opportunity they have no one at this stage is willing to sell " says ajay relan an india based partner at cvc international citigroups private equity arm he says buyouts will remain hard to come by unless conglomerates choose to spin off noncore operations even then the indian stock markets meteoric rise the past two years has driven up prices that firms would need to pay typically private equity firms prefer to pounce on undervalued companies nor has india yet seen the kind of major upheaval that has created buyout opportunities elsewhere in asia in the past south korea for instance realized it had a massive bad debt problem in and within a year newbridge capital now part of tpg formerly texas pacific group had bought korea first bank indias robust stock markets represent another hurdle for private equity companies are accustomed to raising money on domestic stock exchanges which have been in existence for more than years the mumbai exchanges benchmark index has doubled in the past two years so its relatively easy for local companies in india to raise funds from investors by issuing stock without losing control of the company or having to adapt their business practices to suit private equity the result is that "there arent that many large transactions in india period " said ravi adusumalli head of india operations at saif partners a hong kong based private equity firm managing more than &# billion in asia the gold standard for private equity in india dates back to when a u s buyout fund paid &# million for just under of mobile phone carrier bharti tele ventures like more recent investments in the country the deal didnt give warburg control over bhartis business instead bhartis growth amid indias roaring economy has allowed warburg to realize a profit of more than four times as it has sold slices of the stake in the past few years private equity firms say that they are established here for the long haul and that until buyout opportunities pick up they are content to invest in fast growing companies which are legion here as the indian economy grows at an annual rate of around and india still represents a more promising prospect for the industry than china where regulators have resisted buyouts of former state owned companies "given the large size of the indian economy the quality of companies and their high growth potential private equity firms will have plenty of opportunities " says rajeev gupta carlyles partner in india hdfc is carlyles first major indian deal anil ahuja co head of asia for british venture capital firm i group plc says that spending &# million to &# million on stakes in large companies across a wide variety of industries is a good way to tap indias growth "were talking about very small stakes in very large companies " he says the venture firm expects one such investment indian media and entertainment company nimbus communications to list later this year but small deals even in large numbers may not be enough to soak up the private equity money that is being targeted at india the private equity business has raised &# million in the first four months of this year from sources inside and outside india for investing in india last year &# billion was raised up from &# million two years before according to
