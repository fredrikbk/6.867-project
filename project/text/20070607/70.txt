opera at spoleto festival usa charleston s c message to pascal dusapin whose minute opera "faustus the last night" had its american premiere at the spoleto festival usa spoletousa org here its tough to hang an opera exclusively on a philosophical debate mr dusapin is a skilled composer and his haunting score especially the cool antiphonal trumpets bolstered by accomplished vocal writing is engaging yet one feels as though nothing ever moves musically or dramatically that you could nap for minutes and wake up in the same spot mr dusapin who also wrote the libretto imagines the final night of the life of faust the legendary scholar who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for wisdom as faustus waits for midnight and the end a lost rather moth eaten angel and an insecure mephistopheles make their pitches for his soul they are joined by a drunkard and a mysterious nihilistic figure togod the text drawn from shakespeare and other sources touches on time light music and the creation of the world and finally nothingness the opera demands attention to the text it is sung in english but doesnt reward that attention with clarity or insight so the mind eventually wanders the music has more meat especially the contrasting vocal styles of the angel stratospheric and mephistopheles cavernously low roles forcefully sung by heather buck and stephen west the other capable singers were john hancock faustus adam klein sly the drunkard and daniel mobbs togod john kennedy was the adept conductor director david hershkovits did what he could to create some movement in this static affair carol baileys set hung faustuss study in mid air so that characters had to clamber up and down ladders and a firemans rope to reach or leave it lenore doxsees lighting helped evoke the star studded mystery of night and the final flat glare of nothingness david zinns costumes ably mixed the modern and the fairy tale especially the angels yellowed garb an outfit that made her look as though shed been ridden hard and put away wet utopia as a dubious prospect was a theme in the spoleto festivals two other operas the brecht weill polemic "aufstieg und fall der stadt mahagonny" and glucks satire "lile de merlin " "mahagonny" takes human desire to its logical extreme in a city where you can do anything you want as long as you can pay for it what happens when the money runs out "merlin" posits a world in which lust greed and pretension dont even exist naturally its a comedy in contrast to two productions of "mahagonny" mounted earlier this year elsewhere in the u s spoletos version had unusual clarity "mahagonny" is edgy and assaultive but it also has moments of comedy and tenderness and co directors patrice caurier and moshe leiser and conductor emmanuel villaume were able to switch modes and control the pace so that all the dislocations came through in the first act jenny and her fellow whores clearly at the end of their tethers crawled into mahagonny with an almost impossibly slow rendition of the "alabama song" jimmy mahoney and his lumberjack friends arrived singing a brightly optimistic quartet as the cartoon like "round green moon of alabama" blinked merrily above them christian fenouillats set started as a completely empty space and the three criminals who invent mahagonny filled it up with flat bits of scenery a palm tree a bar and lured in the suckers with a sparkling disco ball agostina cavalca designed the luridly colored costumes at its height mahagonny is a city of clowns using the original german instead of the pallid michael feingold english translation gave this "mahagonny" bite so did mr villaumes precise conducting which made the most of the scores brash pit band qualities and brought out its funky musical colors such as banjo and hawaiian guitar one clever thought was to have orchestra members on stage for the eating loving fighting scenes in act ii adding to the bread and circuses aura the cast played off one another as an ensemble standout performers included karen huffstodt as a big voiced widow begbick and timothy nolen as a vicious trinity moses richard brunner as the luckless jimmy who is hanged for failing to pay his bar bill and tammy hensrud as the tough unsentimental jenny made a tragic couple their fierce back to back arias in act ii had particular intensity too bad that their more lyrical "crane duet" a moment of repose in the operas inexorable and sometimes manic push to destruction was cut glucks minute "lile de merlin" is musically slight especially when compared to his "orfeo ed euridice" though conductor harry bicket made the most of its pretty tunes with his lively orchestra director christopher alden updated the opera to his usual dysfunctional present day two stoner slackers pierrot and scapin are "shipwrecked" in what looks like a particularly sterile and empty hotel lobby furnished only with a pair of electric green armchairs designed by andrew lieberman denizens appear including two automaton like girls a buxom doctor and a philosopher who tell them all about this perfect world where there is no corruption or dishonesty of course its a cult one cant tell whether gluck and his librettist louis anseaume intended that negative connotation but no matter the main problem is the one joke directorial idea that doesnt really develop so the piece drags "lile de merlin" also includes texts that would have been set to the music of popular songs of the day for satiric effect spoleto had kevin burdette who sang the small role of the notary and looked blissfully demented accompanying those moments with sappy hymn like tunes on an electric keyboard there was also a gospel style jam for the transformation of scapin and pierrot into cult members the musical juxtaposition may have worked with pop tunes of vienna here it was just weird the game cast sang very well it included eugene brancoveanu and keith phares as the guys monica yunus daughter of muhammad yunus the nobel peace prize winner and champion of microfinance and amanda squitieri as the girls constance hauman as the doctor and richard troxell in six roles including the unhappy philosopher immured in an enormous yellow happy face costume designed sadistically by kay voyce ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
