penalizing the victims while protecting the perps i was greatly disappointed to read that the expected settlement between the sec and brocade communications systems inc regarding the backdating of stock options may pave the way for similar cases "backdating fine may set model " leading the news may the approach expected here would simply penalize the victims and protect the perpetrators in many options backdating cases as the journal has reported options backdating appears to have been an all too common occurrence typically selected executives would achieve a greater stock option payout at the direct expense of stockholders in the process i suspect irs rules were violated due to the lack of expensing of "in the money" options and sec rules were violated due to under reporting of compensation expense most disappointing however is the thought that the oversight mechanisms in these companies failed either through outright fraud or lack of attention as an individual investor i expect the board to protect my interests with the proper management of executive compensation and financial reporting being high on its priority list where illegal options backdating occurred this was obviously not done stockholders interests were damaged with selected executives benefiting assessing a penalty against a company because of improper options backdating is making the victims that is the shareholders pay again for the poor or illegal performance of the executives and directors who are being paid to serve them and all the while these executives and directors would be allowed to escape without any financial penalty you note that "democrats argue that penalties serve as deterrents " i agree but to be effective i suggest deterring the perpetrators not the victims donald c berman wilton conn
