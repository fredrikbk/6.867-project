consolidation on wall street with american express co snapping up lehman brothers and sears roebuck &amp co buying dean witter reynolds famously known on wall street as "socks n stocks " but the financial supermarket concept floundered despite numerous attempts over the years to make it work prudential stumbled particularly with a settlement with regulators over the selling of &# billion of limited partnerships it agreed to compensate investors in certain limited partnerships which cost the company about &# billion prudential announced yesterday that people including about stock analysts will lose their jobs prudentials decision turned heads on wall street because the firms stock unit while small compared with firms such as merrill lynch &amp co which has more than analysts world wide was often a force to be reckoned with in its year history analysts such as michael mayo who covered banks nicholas heymann who researched general electric and other industrial companies and wayne hood known for his calls on retailers frequently moved stocks with their recommendations "i think the traditional model of buy and sell a stock is having an increasingly difficult time differentiating itself and clients are demanding research that has something proprietary in it " said doug atkin executive of data focused research firm majestic research in new york which charges &# and up for its reports "we dont think this will be the last firm to fold its tent " mr atkin said the shutdown of prudential equity group wont affect the firms other investment businesses such as asset management and retirement planning but the firm will no longer issue "buy" and "sell" recommendations on individual stocks in prudential wound down its investment banking business and it sold a majority stake in

salaries of stock analysts to their investment banking work a move that has caused wall street to shrink its commitment to research prudential which didnt have an investment banking business and so wasnt part of the settlement touted its independence and its willingness to take a strong viewpoint in its research mr mayo drew so much attention for his stock calls that j p morgan chase &amp co ceo james dimon once criticized his track record in front of an audience of roughly investors and ultimately apologized for his remark but prudentials research effort failed to overcome several strong forces that pressured the business the settlement combined with the ease of communications provided by the internet spawned a legion of specialized research firms such as majestic which cater to hedge funds and other professional investors willing to pay up for sophisticated research that isnt distributed to thousands of other investors indeed prudentials move is further evidence of how wall street has turned its attention from small to professional investors since the end of the internet stock bubble "on wall street increasingly you have to sell a great deal of stuff or do something unique " mr
