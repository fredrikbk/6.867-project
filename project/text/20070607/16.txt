big three try to rev up weakened political clout congress is asked to ease its plans on fuel standards washington detroits big three auto makers are making a concerted push to slow the momentum to raise fuel economy standards in a test of the industrys weakened but still considerable political clout the chief executives of general motors corp ford motor co and daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group met with lawmakers in washington yesterday amid an escalating energy debate that is playing a central role in the presidential election the companies are weighing in as they struggle under the weight of deep losses in north american operations and falling market share as early as next week the senate will debate a bill requiring auto makers to build cars and trucks that achieve a fleet wide average of miles per gallon by a considerable jump from the current corporate average fuel economy standard known as cafe of about mpg after that the bill mandates annual mileage increases for several years after detroits auto makers and toyota motor corp of japan have said such a drastic increase will be costly and could force companies to build cars americans arent willing to buy one bush administration estimate put the cost of annual increases in mileage standards between and at &# billion for the big three the bills overall goal has broad support but could be in for contentious debate as some senators push for tougher regulations others notably michigan democrats carl levin and debbie stabenow plan to introduce an amendment significantly easing the burden for their auto constituents in private meetings yesterday with lawmakers in washington gms rick wagoner fords alan mulally and chryslers tom lasorda told congressional leaders that a mpg fleet wide target isnt cost effective or technologically achievable according to people familiar with the matter instead the industry lobbied for lower targets and asked for government investment in biofuels and advanced batteries for plug in hybrids these people said stopping the momentum could be difficult sen byron dorgan d n d criticized the auto industry for running ads in newspapers saying that congress is looking to force consumers to drive smaller cars he said instead of running those ads detroit should be working with congress on raising fuel efficiency standards "i just want you to know i think the issue is over i think you lost that issue " mr dorgan said at a manufacturing summit yesterday attended by lawmakers and auto executives "i believe youre going to be confronted with a congress that says tougher cafe standards are on the way " detroits political clout has weakened as the big three have ceded market share to rivals toyota and honda motor co which enjoy a reputation for being more fuel efficient they have also gained support in washington by setting up manufacturing facilities in the u s today many lawmakers view domestic auto makers as builders of gas guzzlers despite detroits recent foray into hybrids and other more efficient vehicles mr wagoner said auto makers have raised fuel economy as required under the year cafe program "thirty years later weve done our part " u s dependence on foreign oil has grown nevertheless he told senators including presidential candidates hillary clinton and joe biden mr biden has been a proponent of tougher mileage standards in the senate sen clinton has supported increasing fuel efficiency by mpg over the next decade according to a spokesman still mr wagoner acknowledged the momentum toward tougher mileage standards saying "my sense is there will be increases in cafe but we hope they will be responsible levels " the auto maker hasnt outlined its specific desire for such legislation but allies in the senate are scrambling to push softer legislation while also pushing detroits call for government subsidies to develop further out technologies such as batteries and hydrogen fuel cells in prepared remarks delivered to senators mr wagoner pointed to a japan trade ministry announcement last week that it will spend billion yen just over &# billion to help develop that countrys next generation cars and fuels to cut emissions of carbon dioxide the main gas blamed for global warming "we would greatly appreciate congress and the administration leading this effort just as is happening in other countries " mr wagoner said other proposals include a potential amendment by mr levin and newly drafted legislation in the house mr levins plan would allow auto makers to avoid fuel economy regulations altogether if they demonstrate they intend to build vehicles that would get far better mileage than required by cafe such as gasoline electric hybrids and flex fuel vehicles capable of running on e a blend of ethanol and gasoline "weve got to do a heck of a lot better in supporting our manufacturers " mr levin said any fuel economy increase has got to be "responsible" and "achievable " he said the proposal co written by ms stabenow and other lawmakers would also maintain the current regulatory distinction between passenger cars and light trucks allowing light trucks to meet a lower standard passenger cars would have to achieve an average mpg by while trucks would have to achieve a mpg average by
