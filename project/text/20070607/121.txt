youre using itunes but are you missing some of the fun it has been many years since apple lost the battle of the computer platforms to microsoft today or more of laptop and desktop computers use microsofts windows operating system but in the past few years apple has mounted a sneak attack on the windows world its weapon has been the windows version of itunes the free media organizing recording and playback program that most people think of as just a companion to apples ipod music and video players i think of itunes as the most subversive software on the windows computer not because it does users any harm or does anything underhanded but because it is allowing apple to subvert from inside microsofts dominant platform position thats because itunes is much more than a companion to the ipod much more than a media playback program and even more than a front door to apples online download service its a sort of miniplatform hiding right within windows that allows apple and other companies to connect a host of hardware and software and to create media sharing networks without engaging with windows itself or with microsofts built in windows media player there are way more copies of itunes installed than were bundled with apples million or so ipods in fact at last weeks d all things digital conference see allthingsd com apple ceo steve jobs estimated more than million copies of itunes were installed many people download and use itunes to play music and video and to purchase media for use on their computers even if they dont own ipods and the vast majority of itunes installations probably or more are on windows computers not macs ironically that makes apple microsofts ancient rival one of the biggest software developers for windows many people dont realize that every time they install itunes on a windows pc they also are installing apple networking software called bonjour which operates independently from the microsoft built in network software controlled from the windows control panel this apple network layer isnt harmful and doesnt interfere with the microsoft networking functions its designed to allow itunes users to share their music out of the box each copy of itunes looks for other shared itunes music libraries on your local network it doesnt share your library unless you authorize it to do so the user merely has to go into itunes preferences function under the edit menu in the windows version click on the sharing tab and select "share my library on my local network " you can choose to share your entire library or just selected playlists you can require people to enter a password to gain access or not you can also turn off the function that allows you to see others libraries if you use sharing youll see in itunes left hand panel a list of shared libraries on other itunes equipped computers on your local network whether they reside on windows or macintosh computers clicking on these libraries allows you to play the songs they contain it doesnt allow you to transfer the song files among the computers in many homes offices and college dorms itunes users have access to numerous libraries on nearby computers for instance as i write this on a mac laptop in my home office i am playing a song that resides on a windows vista desktop pc in another room to achieve this feat i didnt have to fiddle with the often confusing network settings in the windows control panel or in the macs similar system preferences program i just had to use itunes on both machines and click a couple of buttons in effect each copy of itunes with the users permission broadcasts a sort of beacon that signals its presence to other copies of itunes on a local network regardless of the operating system underneath it makes the operating system irrelevant this independent itunes networking capability goes way beyond sharing music among computers a modified version of this function is what allows apples new apple tv product to fetch all the music and videos from all the computers in your house and play them back through your tv set even if all those computers are windows machines it could also allow apples forthcoming iphone to wirelessly stream music and videos from computers on a local network if apple chose to build in such a function and the use of itunes as a platform goes even beyond this networking ability small companies have released a slew of programs such as ilike last fm mog and nutsie that read the itunes library with your permission they use this information to determine your musical tastes and suggest new songs to try to connect people with similar tastes or to allow you to listen to your songs over the internet microsoft its hardware partners and other third party companies have achieved similar feats with other music programs and with hardware such as xbox game consoles using similar sharing technologies but the popularity of itunes and apples position as microsofts rival makes the itunes platform far more significant and interesting email me at mossberg wsj com find all my columns and videos online free at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
