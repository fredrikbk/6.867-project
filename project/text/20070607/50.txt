it is whats inside that dazzles kansas city mo nighttime is the best time to see the new addition to the nelson atkins museum of art thats when it runs down the side of the kansas city sculpture park like a string of paper lanterns following the contours of a suburban lawn thats when it shows why according to time magazine its the "most anticipated building" of designed by steven holl the bloch building as its called stretches below ground for feet equivalent to a story skyscraper and provides square feet of space two thirds for galleries the building emerges above ground in five translucent glass pavilions that aside from glowing in the dark are said to gleam gold as the sun sets i wouldnt know the day i was there was overcast and from the lawn the bloch building resembled an industrial shed but no matter many new museum wings dazzle from the outside only to deliver a disappointing environment for the art the bloch building which opens officially on saturday dazzles from the inside it is neither a big sterile white cube divided into smaller cubes nor a sharp angled slant walled space that competes for attention with the works on view rather mr holl has designed a series of elegant asymmetric galleries that descend with the landscape gracefully leading visitors through the art and subtly luring them to wonder whats beyond the next bend the galleries have several entry points to one another to an internal promenade and to the park outside so that no one feels trapped forced to retrace steps to get out the bloch building enchants in another way too standing inside especially in the three story atrium lobby feels like being inside a luminaria natural light pours in through the vaulted ceilings and the twin layered glass walls the effect is ethereal light can be regulated on too sunny days at night the process reverses with artificial lights inside illuminating the sky all of this is a fine thing because as museum director marc f wilson tells it the expansion was far more about the art than about adding space to the original nelson atkins an imposing neoclassical structure completed in building the bloch which will hold contemporary art photography and special exhibitions created an opportunity for a reinstallation of the museums item permanent collection the better to engage more visitors its no secret that the high arts everywhere are worried about audiences only about a quarter of americans visit a museum or gallery even once each year government statistics show in mr wilsons view "every person has the potential to be touched by art " but "museums have failed to make those visual experiences gratifying rewarding and beyond that enjoyable " he blames the convention of using art history as the spine of exhibits arranging them chronologically and according to what he calls natural history taxonomy that separates paintings from sculpture from decorative arts "i am not here to teach you a body of knowledge that somebody has sanctified " mr wilson says the nelson atkins had a gallery of sculpture from the renaissance through the late th century for example "did you understand sculpture from it " asks catherine l futter curator of decorative arts or might those works be better understood in the context of paintings made at the same time tampering with tradition has another virtue many museums lack the necessary works to truly illustrate the various chapters of art history the nelson atkins has a strong collection of items from all cultures and periods but it has holes "we used to have a room of just spanish painting " says ms futter "but we couldnt tell the complete story of spanish painting " there was no velazquez for one thing the trick of course is reorganizing without pandering when a few years ago the brooklyn museum turned its american galleries into a teeming mix of paintings furniture sculpture and decorative objects set against bright walls of orange green and blue with lots of labels they drew criticism for being dumbed down and heavy handed in the museum of modern art adopted display themes like utopia human anatomy and science again thumbs down comments prevailed the denver art museum and the high museum in atlanta are among others whove experimented with thematic display usually earning brickbats at the nelson atkins teams of curators educators and designers began their rethink by devising "affinity diagrams" showing how works of art in each main curatorial department european american and so on relate to others in the collection these would aid the search for "moments " or "windows of engagement " that would connect people to art in the first stage of the reinstallation of the european galleries completed last year changes are subtle medieval sculpture and stained glass are now joined in one gallery by religious paintings of the same period for example resulting in a churchlike setting that provides context in another room portraits by rembrandt and hals and paintings by van huysum van vliet and jan steen have a few new neighbors a french cabinet like one in the steen pulled from storage a german ivory goblet once on view with italian bronzes and an owl shaped staffordshire jug made in a recent acquisition all three objects might have been owned by people in the paintings ms futter explains and they "break up" the monotony of a room full of paintings its still a room that shouts "golden age of dutch painting " and the new items might prompt people to study the paintings longer museum experts peg the average at about five seconds when i ask mr wilson to take me to the most successful gallery he heads into the deep blue walled french baroque room at one end stands a marquetry ormolu commode flanked by cases holding gilded english chocolate cups english silver sugar casters and french silver candlesticks in the center is a bronze of louis xiv on the walls hang a chardin still life a picture of a woman and her servant by liotard a portrait of augustus the strong two portraits of aristocratic women a pair of domestic scenes by jean francois de troy and a gilt clock "the first thing i think is that the french lived pretty damn well in the th century " mr wilson says then he says notice that the gilt pattern on the commode looks like the engraving on the cups "it makes you think hey ormolu is drawing " earlier ms futter had also noted the similarity between the silver designs and the ormolu mounts as well as the supercilious air and flowing curly hair of both louis xiv and augustus and she said the clock in one de troy is like the clock on the wall these juxtapositions again might prompt lingering and perhaps send visitors to the wall labels which are limited to words the contemporary galleries also looked fairly conventional and jan schall the contemporary art curator agreed one gallery contains abstract expressionist works plus giacomettis painted "chariot" from for example "its not an earth shaking new approach " she says her team discussed two themes one "people places things" the other more conceptual but decided they didnt work "so we chose a stylistically based mostly chronological installation " she says "the one thing i was thinking about these are linear galleries with multiple entries was how every wall can be a pow " thats achieved in one gallery where a large black louise nevelson sculpture faces a striking wall a black vertical painting by ad reinhardt an agnes martin called "white flower ii " ellsworth kellys "white black " and a black white blue gray swirl by bridget riley called "arrest " most people would get the color connection and the minimalism with the wall labels ms schall says viewers can go further "these are expressive works about profundity delicacy the dualities of light and shadow and movement " respectively she says the rethinking is more evident in african art where works are typically organized by geography tribe village type of object and so on in the bloch building galleries visitors are greeted by a vitrine with a message it displays the oldest piece in the collection an equestrian figure from mali th to th century and an earthenware pot from by kenyan magdalena odundo "they show the long history of african art " mr wilson says the rest of the works are arranged around themes like royal power works include a prestige pipe from cameroon and a mask from tanzania and the wilderness a monkey mask from zaire and an antelope headdress from mali i recall here a complaint mr wilson had made about art historical installations "art history splits things into smaller and smaller divisions but no one puts it back together into something people can understand " these displays do make links mr wilson promises similar revelations when the native american collection is reinstalled in the coming months instead of being displayed inanely with african and oceanic art those works will occupy galleries that flow into the american art galleries which will no longer be arranged on a theme of people places things instead the works will illustrate six key dates in american history and american art history and that means for example that portraits by john singleton copley john singer sargent and thomas eakins will be separated going to and respectively where they will meet landscapes still lifes furniture and decorative arts from those eras it promises to be big change yet given what the nelson atkins team has produced so far im not worried there are no radical ruptures here no phony narratives or concepts that strain the imagination these changes both play to the collections strength and frequently prove revealing ms dobrzynski writes about the arts and culture for the journal
