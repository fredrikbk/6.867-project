pervasive infringement against broadcom patents in your june "chips ahoy" editorial you rail against the u s international trade commission as you did in an editorial last summer and decry the use of that federal body as a forum for chip innovators like broadcom to redress patent infringement by companies like qualcomm your position ignores four key points first qualcomm is a serial infringer having been found to infringe four broadcom u s patents to date just last week a federal district court jury found qualcomm liable of willfully infringing three broadcom patents and the itc found that qualcomm infringed another separate patent our company has invested heavily in r&amp d and weve amassed more than u s and foreign patents weve got to believe that you agree with the right of an american company to protect its investments and innovations secondly the nice thing about the itc to lift your own wording in a different context is that the itc has developed specialized expertise in patent law having some of the most experienced patent jurists in the country in the last five years the itc has handled more than patent infringement actions third the itcs unique remedies are crucial to stopping qualcomms pervasive infringement just last week qualcomm general counsel louis lupin told journal reporter don clark that a district court injunction would have little effect on qualcomm because nearly all of its sales of cellphone chips take place outside of the u s and therefore out of the reach of u s court rulings if mr lupin is to be believed the itc offers the last line of protection against patent infringers like qualcomm who seek to skirt u s patent laws finally your editorial notes incorrectly that broadcom and qualcomm are fighting "over patents that each says the other is violating " in reality qualcomm has either lost or withdrawn all of its patent claims against broadcom david a dull senior vice president business affairs &amp general counsel broadcom corp irvine calif
