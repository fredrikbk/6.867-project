politics &amp economics iraq upheaval may move north fear of turkish incursion rises as kurdish rebels intensify their attacks iraqs north has remained the most consistently tranquil part of the country since the u s invaded but some observers worry a series of interconnected problems could turn the region into a trouble zone in the coming months while the u s military is focused on trying to calm the rest of iraq yesterday reports of a turkish military incursion into iraq appeared to heighten tensions but the turkish and iraqi governments denied any turkish troops had crossed the border and u s officials say they have seen no evidence of an incursion the reports come amid growing turkish anger at an insurgency by a kurdish faction aimed at turkey and directed in part from havens in northern iraq an impending referendum on the fate of the disputed northern city of kirkuk has also raised friction there as kurds seek to annex the oil capital into their region something both the turks and iraqi arabs deeply oppose fears that a big cross border incursion by the turkish military could be in the works have grown in recent weeks turkey has staged a significant buildup of troops and tanks near its southeastern border with iraq the buildup came in response to an upsurge in attacks on turkish military targets by the kurdistan workers party or pkk which seeks an independent kurdish state militants attacked an army outpost monday killing seven turkish troops and wounding seven others then yesterday rebels detonated a remote controlled roadside bomb near the southeastern city of diyarbakir injuring six soldiers as the attacks have increased turkish politicians and generals have kept up a steady drumbeat of warnings that a large scale operation into northern iraq is now unavoidable "every day there is some sort of terrorist activity and the military cant stand idly by " a leading member of the governing ak party said in an interview the reaction reflects growing frustration in turkish political and military circles that pkk guerrillas are being allowed to operate freely in kurdish parts of iraq supposedly controlled by coalition troops but much of the rhetoric appears largely designed for domestic consumption turkey holds parliamentary elections next month and security will be a key campaign issue both the army which has a history of intervention in turkish politics and the ak party want to prove their toughness in the face of kurdish militancy the danger is that the politicians increasingly aggressive words could soon turn into actions "given the rising casualties from pkk attacks and the heightened political tensions in turkey the military and politicians may be forced to act in a matter they might otherwise have shied away from " says bulent aliriza of the center for strategic and international studies some observers said there was nothing unusual in the recent military buildup "it is a routine seasonal operation" against the pkk said wolfango piccoli a turkey expert at eurasia group a risk consultancy analysts said whatever yesterdays military activity was it was more likely to be a case of hot pursuit by the army than a full scale incursion kurds who are scattered across syria iraq and iran and make up roughly of the population of turkey have long struggled for autonomy that struggle erupted into armed conflict in when the pkk launched an intense guerrilla war against the turkish state for a separate homeland in the southeast of the country an area that is predominantly kurdish the confusion yesterday captured the dilemma turkey faces on the kurdish issue on the one hand it wants to remove the threat posed by pkk bases in northern iraq once and for all on the other it knows any unilateral cross border raid would harm its relationship with the u s and could torpedo its bid to join the european union "turkey is trying to show it means business and wants the u s to act against the pkk " says tolga erdiz an emerging markets strategist with lehman brothers "but no one wants to risk a fight with the u s and eu " the last big invasion by turkey of northern iraq was in when tens of thousands of troops were involved turkey then set up a buffer zone along the border but international pressure forced it to withdraw most of its troops about soldiers were left inside iraq as monitors pkk activity dropped off after when turkey captured the organizations leader abdullah ocalan he later called on his supporters during his trial to lay down their weapons but in the group resumed its armed struggle against the turkish state attacks have steadily escalated though the violence has been on a much lesser scale than it was between and when more than people were killed on both sides the turkish concerns and troop buildup adds to an increasingly volatile situation in iraqs north the hotly contested city of kirkuk symbolically important to the kurds and sitting at the center of the norths oil production has experienced increasing episodes of violence iraqs constitution calls for a local referendum by the end of this year on whether the city will become part of the autonomous kurdish north iraqi kurds insist that kirkuk be incorporated into the region they control kurdish factions have aggressively pushed other residents out of the city including turkoman minorities who look to the turkish government for protection the turks have remained against iraq kurds gaining control of kirkuk seeing it as part of an attempt by the iraqi kurds to eventually establish an independent state that the turks fear could incite similar aspirations among turkeys much larger kurdish population many observers worry that if problems with the pkk are allowed to persist the turkish military could use the group as a pretext for a larger invasion aimed at thwarting iraqi kurds move toward full independence bill spindle contributed to this article
