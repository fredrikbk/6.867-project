politics &amp economics giuliani health proposal seeks individual coverage candidate to unveil market based plan easier on employers washington former new york mayor rudy giuliani moving his presidential campaign beyond its signature issue of national security is preparing to lay out a health care plan that would mark a significant change in how health insurance is paid for in the u s mr giuliani currently leading opinion polls for the republican nomination wants to move tens of millions of people from employer based health insurance to the individual market as a way of giving people more coverage choices it is an idea he alluded to in tuesdays republican debate in manchester n h and later expanded on in an interview mr giuliani meanwhile took a significant political step in announcing he wouldnt participate in augusts straw poll of iowa republicans a traditional test of candidates strength before the january iowa caucus that opens the nominating process his campaign cited the high cost of organizing for the event arizona sen john mccain backed out in turn with his campaign saying the straw poll wouldnt be meaningful without two leading candidates mr giuliani and potentially former sen fred thompson who isnt officially in the race yet the plan which mr giuliani said he hopes to unveil in detail this summer launches the health care debate among republican candidates and provides a contrast to the push for universal coverage aided by government subsidies emerging from the democratic field the principles mr giuliani identified for health care mirror president bushs call for an "ownership society" in which the power of the free market could eventually shore up health and retirement security programs alike that concept proved a political failure when mr bush used it in to argue for partial privatization of social security but in the campaign to woo republican primary voters it could provide mr giuliani with an issue to appeal to economic conservatives at a time when some social conservatives have misgivings about his support for abortion rights and gun control in mr giulianis view the u s health care systems major problem is a lack of consumer choice "its your health you should own your own insurance " he said in tuesdays debate "the reality is that we need a free market " he envisions a system where neither state regulations nor federal tax law push people into expensive plans rich in benefits rather health insurance should be more like car insurance he said where people pay out of pocket for minor repairs and maintenance it is a risky move most people dont want to see their insurance plans cover fewer services and experts say that providing greater benefits encourages patients to see doctors before an illness progresses too far and is costlier to treat today most americans million get health coverage from an employer a system decried by both liberals and conservatives though they differ over what should replace it some large employers too have complained that the burden of rising health costs has fallen disproportionately on them still states experimenting with health reform and democratic presidential candidates have talked about building on the employer based system not replacing it mr giuliani wouldnt scrap employer based coverage but in the interview he said washington needs a "paradigm shift" toward an individual insurance marketplace covering perhaps three times as many people as it does now about million people buy insurance on the individual market now coverage costs are directly related to the buyers age and health status making it difficult for older sicker people to find affordable coverage or in some cases any coverage at all many health policy experts say the individual market will only work well if americans are forced to buy insurance thus injecting into the system younger healthier people who are now uninsured and balancing out sicker more expensive patients that was the approach taken by massachusetts under former gov mitt romney one of mr giulianis rivals for the party nomination democratic candidate john edwards has called for a similar mandate for individuals buying insurance and sen hillary rodham clinton also in the running is expected to as well but mr giuliani rejects a government mandate that all individuals purchase coverage to do that he said the government would have to subsidize the bill for those who cant afford coverage which would drive up the overall cost in massachusetts the state is subsidizing coverage for poor and low income families for example a family of three earning as much as &# a year could receive a subsidy more important mr giuliani says is to give consumers more choice he would supplant state regulations which require that insurance companies offer benefits ranging from chiropractic care to fertility treatments instead people across the country could buy insurance from any company in any state meaning they could find cheaper more basic plans than those now available in their particular state he also embraced mr bushs proposal to give people a tax break to buy insurance regardless of whether they get it from an employer or elsewhere as is employees get insurance tax free but only if they participate in their employers plans changing this could push people to the individual market where they would pick and choose among plans "what i would do is change the whole model that we have for health insurance in this country " mr giuliani said "the problem with our health insurance is its government and employer dominated people dont make individual choices " giving people more choices may sound good but public opinion surveys show that most americans prefer getting insurance from their employer to buying it on their own said robert blendon an expert on public opinion and health at the harvard school of public health "people think its more convenient to have it through an employer and think that employers get a better deal " he said he added that people who already have insurance are very nervous about anything that would change their coverage still he said talking about insurance in this way turns the issue into one of values which is effective dr blendon said "its using the power of individuals to take care of themselves "
