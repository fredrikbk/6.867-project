politics &amp economics how a strong sarkozy aids france parliamentary mandate would give country improved global posture paris frances conservative ump party looks likely to win parliamentary elections and give president nicolas sarkozy the backing he needs to push through changes he has promised will revive the nations economy a cooperative parliament would also give the newly elected president an edge in europe where leaders in germany and italy have been hampered by divided legislatures if mr sarkozy pursues his current agenda with strong legislative backing france could become once again a leader on the continent internal political bickering within the right and the left was one of the reasons france voted down a proposed european constitution two years ago mr sarkozy has made restarting european political integration one of his priorities polls ahead of the two round legislative elections on june and suggest mr sarkozys ump could seize more than two thirds of the seats up for grabs in the lower house of parliament unlike his predecessor jacques chirac who also enjoyed a strong ump parliamentary majority but focused on international affairs while leaving national policies to his prime ministers mr sarkozy has said he aims to be a hands on president "who governs " the year old son of a hungarian immigrant has thrown himself into the parliamentary election campaign urging voters to provide him with a solid majority in parliament in order to ensure that a series of tax labor justice and education bills get approved quickly mr sarkozy has so far kept prime minister francois fillon and his cabinet in the shadows and taken the lead on key foreign and domestic issues since taking office three weeks ago mr sarkozy has sent the message that he means business he has toured much of europe to promote his "simplified treaty " an alternative to the aborted european constitution publicly admonished his new budget minister over proposed fiscal incentives for home buyers and revived talks with the colombian government to free a french hostage who has been held by rebels for five years mr sarkozy has also given details of planned economic and social overhauls he unveiled during his presidential campaign these include measures to loosen the countrys hour workweek by giving tax breaks to companies that let their employees work longer hours at a higher salary and a proposal to lower the maximum overall income tax rate to from mr sarkozys focus on fiscal exemptions has alarmed some of frances european neighbors which fear paris may abandon a commitment to return to a balanced budget by last year france the worlds sixth largest economy recorded an estimated budget deficit equivalent to of its gross domestic product neighbors worry that if mr sarkozy overreaches the french economy could stumble and drag down the rest of europe "france must decide what is possible and what isnt " luxembourg prime minister jean claude juncker warned on monday ahead of a meeting of euro zone finance ministers meanwhile in france mr sarkozys hands on management style is raising eyebrows under the french constitution the president is charged with the role of referee while the prime minister and his cabinet are supposed to deal with daily governing "it is quite peculiar " said centrist lawmaker gilles artigues "the president fills the roles of prime minister interior minister et cetera and everybody toes the line " a key factor working in mr sarkozys favor ahead of the elections is the lack of strong opposition to his center right ump party the socialist party the strongest contender plunged into a leadership crisis after its candidate in the presidential election segolene royal was defeated by mr sarkozy on may "our goal is to limit the extent of the debacle " in coming parliamentary elections former socialist finance minister dominique strauss kahn said recently centrist leader francois bayrou who had emerged as a potential opposition force when he collected of the votes in the first round of the presidential election has since lost much of his support as most of his aides have rallied around mr sarkozy under frances two round voting system lawmakers are elected if they collect more than of votes in the first round or if they win in a second round runoff a poll of people conducted by csa last week suggested that mr sarkozys ump party could get to seats in the lower house the socialist party would get to seats the communist party up to and mr bayrous newly created mouvement democrate from one to six seats though polls predict a landslide victory for mr sarkozys party a key uncertainty is whether all of the recently named ministers who have opted to run for lawmaker posts will be elected

for a parliamentary seat has said that any minister who loses will have to resign immediately among those who risk losing is former conservative prime minister alain juppe who is environment minister
