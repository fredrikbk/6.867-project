politics &amp economics benefits of issuing visas on merit are questioned as immigration bill faces senate test family pluses cited washington proponents of the pending immigration bill argue that current u s policy does more harm than good to the economy by issuing most visas based on applicants blood ties to earlier arrivals rather than on skills and education but it turns out there is scant evidence to back up arguments that a merit based system which would award points for job skills education and other favorable attributes would help ensure immigrants become a boon rather than a burden some economists pointing to the dearth of academic literature on the matter question whether there is a significant difference in the contributions made by either type of newcomer "people are more than the sum of their tax payments minus benefits " says ben johnson of the immigration policy center a washington think tank that is generally sympathetic to immigration the family versus merit issue is one of many contentious questions buffeting the debate over the comprehensive immigration package another involves how to handle the estimated million illegal immigrants that are already in the u s conservative critics say the current version of the proposal offers an unfair "amnesty " and are trying to make it harder for those people to stay in the country the debate over family immigration came to a head last night as the senate rejected an effort by sen robert menendez d n j to grant permanent residency to some people who have applied for legal status based on family ties though the proposal fell on a procedural move requiring votes the votes it received show a strong interest particularly among democrats for giving greater weight to family connections the senate debate stretched late into the night and other family related amendments were expected to be considered one amendment proposed by sen barack obama d ill would eliminate the merit based system after five years and was viewed by republicans as anathema to the bipartisan immigration deal the senate also was set to vote on whether to make english the official u s language the senate passed an amendment giving law enforcement officials access to the rejected applications of illegal immigrants seeking to gain legal status a change that makes it easier to track down people who dont obey orders to leave the immigration bill is set to face its most serious test yet today with a vote on whether to end debate republicans want more time to air their proposals while senate majority leader harry reid d nev says there must be an endpoint soon the survival of the legislation largely depends on whether senate leaders are able to work out an agreement on a limited set of amendments many critics of the merit based approach frame the debate as one pitting morality whether to bring families together or keep them apart against economics but some of them say even the economics in favor of the proposed changes arent sound in testimony before the house last month former urban institute economist harriet duleep argued that family based immigrants dont hurt but help the economy by adding flexibility that can more readily fill holes in a changing labor market family based immigrants are more likely than employment based immigrants or native born americans to jump at opportunities by acquiring skills she argued many learned construction skills during the recent home building boom or have enrolled in certification courses to meet health care shortages for example that adaptability means that while many enter the u s job market at low wages their paychecks grow faster than those of employment based immigrants whose salaries start higher ms duleep said some economists also argue that family based immigration promotes entrepreneurship family members pool their resources and labor to open small businesses or factories many of those are in struggling inner cities or rural towns where the cost of starting a business is lower and immigrant owned restaurants and shops have become a force behind economic revitalization james p smith a rand corp economist who backs skill based immigration says entrepreneurs account for "a relatively small part of who comes mostly immigrants do jobs like the rest of us " low skilled immigrants free up time for higher skilled workers to be more productive argues columbia university economist jagdish bhagwati they run day care centers so better educated women can enter the labor force or train as nursing aides who free nurses for higher skilled work for example and not all family drawn immigrants are poor and poorly educated the sibling of an immigrant cardiologist is also likely to be or become a professional last year family based immigrants were in management or professional jobs or almost as many as those admitted on employment based preferences in any event no one is talking about ending family based immigration or even adopting a system that gives the majority of immigration visas to skilled workers under the senate plan the spouses and minor children of legal immigrants still could come in unlimited numbers but their parents for the first time would face an annual cap and siblings and adult children would have to compete with everyone else around the world who wanted to come to the u s last year the u s issued immigration visas to people who the u s citizenship and immigration services concluded had "extraordinary" talents were outstanding scientists or were key executives with multinational companies it issued visas to the brothers and sisters of earlier immigrants advocates of a high skills preference argue that immigrants admitted because of family ties are a fiscal drain on the economy because they tend to be poorer and less educated they pay less in taxes and draw more on public services than those chosen for their talents "it doesnt make sense in these times when everybodys crying for skilled labor that you would bring in people" on any other basis than merit says alan simpson the former republican senator from wyoming who argued for a skills based system during the last big congressional immigration debate in the heritage foundation a conservative think tank estimates that a quarter of legal adult immigrants arrive each year without a high school diploma which largely consigns them to low skilled jobs low skilled immigrant households legal and illegal paid an average &# a year in taxes in it calculates while receiving &# in benefits and services including education food stamps and medicaid "family unification is a bad deal for taxpayers " says steve camarota of the center for immigration policy which favors restricting immigration of people admitted last year to join their families were age or older and because siblings and adult children of immigrants often must wait years for a visa that allows them to follow their families many arrive past their peak earning years last year listed their occupations as "unemployed" and as homemakers still a system that awards points for desirable attributes isnt guaranteed to do a better job getting the u s the higher skilled newcomers that senate backers of the measure want a university of texas study suggests the study showed that recent immigrants to australia and canada which use a points system had more education than those to the u s but after excluding hispanic immigrants who account for the majority of illegal immigrants the u s attracted better educated immigrants even using a preference system based on family reunification
