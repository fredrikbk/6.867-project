the march of the machines a culture of improvement by robert friedel mit pages &# theres a certain dark pleasure to be had by thumbing through the pages of futurist books and magazines from decades past to see how wrong the authors projections turned out to be flying cars jetpacks and the yk apocalypse never arrived radio newspapers and affordable oil havent gone away sometimes futurism fails for narrow technical reasons an avenue of research turns into a dead end or a technology doesnt develop as quickly as expected more often though projections fail because they do not account fully for the human factor the unexpected unintended complexities of social and political affairs this lesson is best taught not by futurists but by historians conveying something of the contingency of unfolding events robert friedel is one such historian he can not only impart the lesser known details of a familiar story but masterfully show how strange and wonderful it is that things happened the way they did in the past mr friedel has written about the plastics industry edisons work on the light bulb and of all things the triumph of the zipper in each case he has shown how everyday technologies were born of creative genius hopeful investment clever marketing shifting social arrangements and often enough sheer serendipity in "a culture of improvement " mr friedel widens his gaze to survey the entire past millennium of technological advancement its an ambitious project seeking to explain how the west moved from horsepower to jet engines from gothic vaults to skyscrapers from gutenberg to google mr friedel zooms in and out sometimes describing long trends sometimes dwelling on a pivotal figure galileo daguerre or a startling invention in a chapter called "land and life " he takes up all sorts of things cheese making the use of guano as fertilizer the process of pasteurization the discovery of antiseptic medicine in "airs and lightning " he covers the early scientific study of gases the invention of ballooning and the discovery of electricity in "scale " he moves from massive engineering projects like the hoover dam to henry fords assembly lines to the monumental enterprise of the manhattan project along the way mr friedel takes a special pleasure in busting myths james watt made a fortune from the steam engine he notes but that "enormous personal success has interfered with the historical appraisal" of both watts contribution and the role of steam power in remaking th century british industry in fact watt didnt invent the steam engine he critically improved an invention already a half century old and widely in use the line middle schoolers are fed about how eli whitneys cotton gin "was responsible for the rise of the cotton south" and by extension for solidifying slavery and causing the civil war is one of "oversimplification and hyperbole " mr friedel argues the south had already turned to cotton because of international markets and its commitment to the plantation system and whitneys invention was only an improvement upon an extant mechanism similarly robert fulton shouldnt be remembered as the father of the steamboat especially since fulton himself well understood that major technologies dont have one father but are "incremental and derivative " as mr friedel puts it working steamboats had already been demonstrated but their inventors lacked fultons "capitalist vision and fortitude " here then is one of mr friedels major themes key inventions were often "preceded by similar machines that incorporated most if not all of the principles of the famous devices " he writes "too often the existence of a key patent or the success of a manufacturing enterprise has diverted attention from the long and gradual history of creativity " despite quick leaps from artillery to windmills to gliders in one paragraph mr friedels book never achieves the wild eyed madcap fun of james burkes "connections" romps through modern science and invention nor is "a culture of improvement" a celebration of mans impulse to discover and create like daniel boorstins majestic histories mr friedels intentions are more down to earth he seeks to put technology in its proper place as a human activity technology is not he seems to say the inevitable expression of advancing human reason or a great impersonal force directing the course of history rather it proceeds by fits and starts held back pushed forward or diverted by social and biographical contingencies one inventor mr friedel shows was stymied by his lack of "social grace and diplomacy" another prevailed thanks to "social connections and focused ambition " the royal societys motto nullius in verba "on no ones word" derived from the attitudes of th century protestantism "with its reliance on personal witness rather than received orthodoxy " the flood of cheap indian cottons into th century england protectionists protested with "calico riots" goaded the textile industry into its storied labor saving innovations mr friedels emphasis on the complexities of history unfortunately makes it difficult for him to tell stories with beginnings and endings and vivid protagonists but "a culture of improvement" is far from dull and mr friedel doesnt truck in high flown academic theories and abstract models to the extent that he makes a broad claim it is that the western world has come to institutionalize the means of "improvement" using patent laws organized research best practices and countless other ways of remembering and building on what has come before note that it is "improvement " not "progress " as mr friedel observes some technical advances like those behind the eugenics movement or the th centurys powerful new tools for dealing death surely do not represent progress in a morally defensible human sense but that is part of mr friedels achievement to show that technologys development is as flawed tangled wondrous and unpredictable as man himself mr keiper is the editor of the new atlantis and a fellow at the ethics and public policy center
