rivals answer the iphone other makers feature rich phones could benefit from apple devices buzz apple inc s iphone may be the most anticipated device in the history of the wireless industry but when it hits at&amp t inc and apple stores june it will face plenty of competition nokia corp has already begun selling the n a high end smart phone that like the iphone has a large color screen can surf the web and can play music and dvd quality video lg electronics inc has brought a sleek minimalist touch screen phone to market in europe and asia that was co designed with the fashion house prada a slightly different version will be offered later this year in the u s market taiwan based smart phone maker htc corp is introducing a handset called "touch" this month in europe and asia the phone allows users to navigate its features by sweeping across the touch screen with their fingers much like the multitouch feature of the iphone and samsung electronics co has released a super thin music phone with the introduction of the iphone just weeks away the battle to woo customers to feature rich phones is moving into high gear and that could produce benefits for everyone "we think the iphone buzz is very good " says peter a skarzynski senior vice president of samsung telecommunications america "it helps people understand the convergence of phones and music players " at&amp t executives hope that the iphone will liven up the phone companys wireless brand as it makes the transition from being cingular to being at&amp t they also figure the device will attract customers to at&amp t stores even if they dont purchase it according to people close to the company iphones rivals cant tap into apples itunes store which millions use to download music and most of them dont have phone company partners in the u s yet but the iphone will be priced at &# for four gigabytes of memory and &# for eight gigabytes and it will require a two year contract with at&amp t mr skarzynski predicts that will create an opening for other phone makers to market expensive phones that will double as minientertainment units executives at rival carriers say theyre prepared verizon is redesigning and perhaps rebranding its lg chocolate music phone a person familiar with the companys plans says the ipod look alike was panned by some critics for a clunky interface verizon is also toying with the idea of carrying lgs prada phone after testing it to make sure it works on verizons network this person says denny strigl president of verizon communications inc which co owns verizon wireless with the united kingdoms vodafone group plc says the carrier doesnt want to go head to head against iphone with any single device instead it plans to rely on a broader set of mobile services and phones to win over customers "with what we have as an overall product line im confident we wont lose market share to the iphone " mr strigl says sprint nextel corp tried to beat apple to the punch with its release of samsungs slim music phone "upstage " which costs &# with a two year service contract mr skarzynski at samsung called it "the nano of the phone industry " referring to an inexpensive apple ipod he expects upstage to be popular among those consumers who dont want to pay more than &# for a cellphone about of u s phone users "by naming it upstage theyre clearly trying to upstage the iphone " says avi greengart an analyst at current analysis he thinks the samsung device is innovative and attractive but not that easy to use "i wouldnt call it an iphone competitor " he says even alltel corp which serves mainly rural markets is getting into the music business the company recently launched a service that lets users with select handsets transfer songs from their computers to their phones meanwhile apple predicts it will sell million handsets globally by the end of at&amp ts new chief executive randall stephenson has also been bullish about iphone sales some people close to at&amp t though believe apples projection is overly ambitious the first edition iphone has the drawback that it wont be able to surf the web as fast as some of its rivals but apple and at&amp t are already developing a successor device with a so called third generation chip that will speed up web access people familiar with the companies plans say the two companies are also exploring whether to make a version that is slimmer than the original the people say representatives of at&amp t and apple decline to comment on future product development long term one of iphones fiercest rivals will likely be nokias n multimedia smart phone analysts say the phone is equipped with a sharp image screen a music player with an equalizer and an internet browser that pulls up a minimap automatically it even comes with more bells and whistles than the iphone including a five megapixel camera and a gps navigation system but all these features also come with a high price tag &# in the u s market plus more for the gps service unlike the iphone the n lacks a major u s carrier partner that will distribute it at thousands of retail stores and back the device with a big marketing budget the gadget will be available only at nokias two flagship stores in new york and chicago its online store and a few independent retailers buyers will have to arrange to link the n to a carrier that uses the same network technology the company has been in discussions in recent months with several u s partners including at&amp t a person familiar with the matter says "were definitely in the process of building more robust channels in this marketplace " says william plummer vice president of nokias north american operation industry observers say apple is being smart by launching the iphone first in the u s market because nokia and sony ericsson two of apples strongest competitors in the high end multimedia handset category dont have a strong presence in this country in many cases the most sophisticated nokia and sony ericsson phones arent equipped with the radio components that work on advanced networks in the u s "the device is only part of the solution to compete with the iphone " says yankee group analyst john jackson "any handset maker is more than capable of making clever devices but its really about business models thats where apple maintains its business advantage " both nokia and sony ericsson have a wide range of high end phones that are popular in europe and asia analysts expect the iphone to face much stronger competition from the two companies products when it is launched in europe in the fourth quarter "n has everything that the iphone has " says mr greengart the analyst "it could have been an iphone killer in europe it may well be "
