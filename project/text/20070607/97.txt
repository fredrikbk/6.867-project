terrorist due process on monday military judges dismissed war crimes charges against two terrorism detainees at guantanamo bay and the usual suspects are hyperventilating about this "setback" and "rebuke" to military tribunals these rulings turned on a technicality however and shouldnt impede antiterrorism prosecutions for long after the supreme courts hamdan decision last fall the bush administration and congress hashed out the military commissions act establishing a framework for trying "unlawful enemy combatants " a body called the combatant status review tribunal or csrt makes a threshold determination of whether or not detainees ought to be classified as enemy combatants if so they proceed to military commissions similar to conventional courts though with different standards of secrecy and evidence the two judges who threw out the war crimes charges in separate proceedings made procedural objections csrt had only screened for "enemy combatants " not "unlawful enemy combatants " they said and the military commissions act grants jurisdiction only over the latter this reasoning is deficient on several levels by international law and custom an unlawful enemy combatant fights out of uniform or targets civilians the military order that created csrt defines "enemy combatant" in a way that is inherently "unlawful" that is a member of "al qaeda the taliban any international terrorist organization or associated forces" that are "engaged in hostilities against the united states or its co belligerents in violation of the law of war " the problem is that csrt did not use the word "unlawful" itself but this is a pedantic distinction these decisions also had nothing to do with the guilt of the accused which is hardly in doubt one is omar ahmed khadr an al qaeda operative who killed an american soldier with a grenade in in afghanistan the other is salim ahmed hamdan who acted as osama bin ladens driver and bodyguard many on capitol hill and in advocacy groups like human rights watch are cheerleading as terrorists like khadr and hamdan get off on technicalities they argue that the military commissions act must now be rewritten or even repealed this is a pretext for what theyve wanted to do all along which is transfer the gitmo prisoners to civilian courts or military courts martial however the bush administration and a bipartisan majority in congress rightly determined that terror cases require a special judicial architecture fortunately there are remedies here prosecutors can appeal to the court of military commission review which is the likely first step they could also restart the entire csrt process reviews so far to make their determinations more explicit or they could simply make technical amendments to the existing determinations with the magic word "unlawful " in a better world gitmos critics would at least concede that the hamdan and khadr decisions demonstrate that military tribunals arent the star chambers of liberal caricature alas the only thing that now matters to some people is that the bush administration lose even to terrorists
