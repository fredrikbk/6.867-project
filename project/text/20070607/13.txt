china nurtures a clean tech hub as pollution woes weigh industrial park seeks eco friendly projects hong kong chinas pollution problems are legion now in an effort to alleviate some of them chinese government officials are creating a "clean tech" industrial park to spur investment in businesses focusing on environmentally friendly industries such as renewable energy and water purification provincial and municipal leaders are hoping that the park along a planned high speed railway line in xuzhou a key transport hub in jiangsu province halfway between beijing and shanghai will serve as a blueprint for an era of cleaner economic growth the jiangsu government seen as one of chinas most progressive spent two years looking for partners on the project before teaming up with cleantech group llc based in ann arbor mich which links investors with clean technology projects looking for start up capital also on board are two companies affiliated with tsinghua university the countrys leading technology university tsinghua holdings wholly owned by the university and tsing capital a chinese fund manager devoted exclusively to investing in clean tech projects amid a slew of environmental disasters china has made environmental protection a top policy priority on sunday chinas state council or cabinet issued a warning to government officials and company leaders that failing to improve energy efficiency and curb pollution would result in negative performance assessments the xuzhou park is an example of how government officials are finding new ways to nurture and raise the profiles of companies willing to take clean tech ideas to market including improving energy efficiency air and water quality and waste management the government is spending &# million on the project and could extend tax incentives beyond special rates currently offered in the xuzhou economic development zone in addition to financial incentives and the potential for more access to investment capital the parks promoters are hoping companies will be lured by the prospect of exchanging ideas with like minded thinkers nearby don ye president and chief executive of tsing capital said four companies including a chinese japanese joint venture have committed to the xuzhou park ahead of any formal solicitation process mr ye declined to name the companies citing continuing negotiations qin jingan deputy mayor of xuzhou and director of the economic development zones administrative committee declined to comment on the project calling it "too early" to reveal details cleantech group and the tsinghua affiliated capital groups which are putting up money to get the park started are hoping their close involvement with the project will give them access to deals and help them identify potential investment prospects they have contributed initial capital and are discussing future capital requirements cleantech group declined to disclose the companies contributions cleantech earns money from membership fees and by organizing conferences through its venture capital arm clean technologys roots in the u s go back just a few years but growing concern for the environment has boosted its profile with a handful of cities in california and texas slashing taxes and dangling incentives to lure environmentally friendly businesses though still a nascent industry in china clean technology already has garnered attention research by cleantech shows investors put &# million in so called clean tech deals in china last year more than double the investment in tsing capital was one of those companies taking an early stake in china sunergy co a solar company that raised &# million in its debut on the nasdaq stock market last month tsing capital also invested in ldk solar co a chinese company that listed on the new york stock exchange last week it raised &# million in one of the largest initial public offerings by a mainland chinese company in the u s in recent years simon littlewood chief executive of london asia capital plc a member of cleantech groups venture network calls china the fastest growing market in the world for clean tech companies with a shortage of financiers willing to make big bets in the niche sector but the industry has yet to prove it can survive fluctuating energy prices and government subsidy programs that can come and go with little warning and some foreign companies concerned about intellectual property protections hesitate to bring their innovations to china others meanwhile fear that oversupply in some clean tech industries like solar power could hurt growth prospects in addition beijings sometimes capricious policies have been known to cool investor interest in industries such as wind power in early for instance beijing changed course on how it would implement a renewable energy law suddenly scrapping an announced tariff that would have fixed wind generated power at a premium to coal fired power since then a number of investors have been "sitting on their hands" or launching smaller projects at the municipal level says angelika pullen a policy director with the brussels based global wind energy council which represents the wind power industry chinas clean tech industry also faces an uphill battle making the technology affordable in the lower income chinese market because its energy sources are generally much costlier than traditional alternatives like coal and oil despite these obstacles many investors and environmental groups are convinced chinas leaders wont waver in their long term interest in clean tech since the push is driven both by security concerns like access to oil and by worries about the health and economic effects of pollution "you will see several of these parks in a few years " says mr littlewood of london asia capital citing growing governmental concerns about water shortages in northern china and the creeping conversion of arable land into desert chen dongmei the beijing based director of the climate change and energy program for the chinese branch of the wwf formerly the world wildlife fund said recent moves by the central government showed a determination to explore sustainable development and "to achieve that target through real action " many of the worlds most polluted cities are in china whose burgeoning economy is largely powered by air polluting coal and whose relatively recent industrial surge has badly tainted rivers in september beijing released the results of a two year "green accounting" study that pegged the cost of pollution to the country at &# billion in slicing the equivalent of three percentage points off that years growth in gross domestic product also spurring the new industrial park project are some strong market incentives as china strives to leapfrog developed countries in emerging clean tech industries jiangsu one of chinas wealthiest provinces is home to two of the worlds largest producers of photovoltaic cells taras wankewycz vice president of shanghai based horizon fuel cell technologies says chinese consumers are more adaptive and willing to try new technologies he points to the widespread acceptance of electric scooters in cities like shanghai which has banned motorbikes "this is not a trial project " says jerry li china country director for cleantech group who studied resource management and ran a sustainable enterprise network before joining cleantech "this is a real industrial park we really want to make it a demonstration in the country and perhaps in the world "
