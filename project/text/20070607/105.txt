u s investigates firm building embassy in iraq former employees allege abusive labor practices company denies claims washington federal prosecutors are investigating the kuwaiti company building the u s embassy in baghdad probing allegations that foreign employees were brought to work on the massive project against their will and prevented from leaving the country the department of justice launched the probe of first kuwaiti general trading &amp contracting co after former employees alleged that workers at the company were told they were being sent to dubai only to wind up in iraq instead people familiar with the matter said according to the allegations first kuwaiti confiscated the workers passports so they were unable to depart baghdad these people said a statement by first kuwaiti said "we are not aware of any doj investigation involving first kuwaiti the dos state department has already fully investigated these ludicrous allegations and has found them to be without merit first kuwaiti is proud of its accomplishments and of its efforts to build the u s embassy in baghdad on time within budget and in compliance with the law " the &# million project involves a heavily fortified compound of buildings on acres in baghdads green zone and is set to be completed by september first kuwaiti won the project in a competitive bidding process besting several better known firms though iraq is wracked by high unemployment the company was barred from hiring iraqis because of concerns they might pass information to insurgents or try to smuggle explosives into the compound instead it hired nationals from poor countries such as bangladesh egypt and pakistan for whom the wages about &# per month were far higher than they could earn at home the bush administration has made combating human trafficking world wide a high profile priority in addition u s officials have expressed growing concern about human trafficking by companies working on american funded projects in iraq last year the defense department said it conducted an investigation into such problems following media reports about labor trafficking in iraq the pentagon said its probe "identified a number of abuses some of them considered widespread " committed by pentagon contractors and subcontractors including u s companies violations included confiscation of passports and deceptive hiring practices allegations similar to those justice is pursuing in the first kuwaiti matter the defense department responded with a number of measures to closely monitor the hiring and employment of foreign laborers in april gen george w casey then the top u s commander in iraq issued specific guidelines to all defense contractors in iraq and afghanistan chief among them was a mandate that they cease holding or withholding employee passports people familiar with the first kuwaiti situation said an american who formerly worked for the company in baghdad john owens told prosecutors that dozens of pakistani and west african employees on a first kuwaiti charter flight from kuwait to baghdad received boarding passes that wrongly indicated the flight was going to dubai he also told prosecutors he had personally seen a safe at the construction site in baghdad containing hundreds of passports belonging to some of the foreign workers at the site the people said justice spokeswoman cynthia magnuson said she couldnt confirm or deny whether an investigation is in progress and declined to comment further state department spokesman tom casey said the department is unaware of such an investigation mr owens and rory mayberry a second american who had worked for and unlike mr owens was fired by first kuwaiti submitted written accounts of alleged labor trafficking and mistreatment of first kuwaitis foreign work force to u s officials late last year they also have had frequent email and telephone conversations with the officials in recent months according to the people familiar with the case mr owens has filed a separate false claims act lawsuit against first kuwaiti alleging that the company overcharged the u s government and failed to properly install many of the embassys security fortifications according to a copy of the sealed complaint reviewed by the wall street journal the false claims act allows private citizens to file suit alleging the government was defrauded and to receive a portion of any penalties levied against a defendant the contours of the probe were detailed by government officials with direct knowledge of it as well as by mr owens and others who have been contacted by prosecutors several government officials said the inquiry had accelerated in recent weeks but they said it is unclear when or if prosecutors would bring criminal or civil charges the embassy compound is one of the only major u s funded construction projects in iraq that appears likely to be finished on schedule and within budget the first state department personnel are slated to begin moving into the new compound in september with the remainder settling in by years end first kuwaitis work on the site has been dogged by accusations of various labor abuses in september state department inspector general howard krongard visited the embassy locale after receiving allegations that workers had been deceived about where they would be working and had their passports confiscated upon arrival he said in a report released by his office earlier this year mr krongard later reported he found no evidence of wrongdoing workers he interviewed told him they knew they were going to iraq and had handed over their passports voluntarily for safekeeping he reported in an interview mr krongard said he stands by the report and was unaware of the justice probe the u s military also investigated first kuwaiti over similar allegations in a report released in march the inspector general for the u s led coalition in iraq said workers from nepal india pakistan bangladesh and sri lanka complained of "fraudulent hiring practices" by recruitment firms in their home countries the employees said they had been promised more time off and higher pay than first kuwaiti was giving them the report cleared first kuwaiti of wrongdoing noting that investigators had found "no evidence of trafficking in persons violations " it said workers at the site "were being paid and had the ability to quit at any time and return to their home country " while justice may ultimately clear the company of the present allegations its involvement suggests they are serious enough to merit investigation the u s maintains jurisdiction on american funded projects anywhere in the world and unlike the state and defense departments justice has the power to issue subpoenas and bring charges on its own the new probe could be perilous for first kuwaiti if justice found prosecution warranted and convictions were obtained the company and its executives could face steep civil and criminal penalties including possibly being forced to return the nearly &# million it has been paid by the u s government any executives proved to have taken part in alleged human trafficking meanwhile might face lengthy prison sentences according to the companys web site first kuwaiti is a privately owned company founded in with annual revenue topping &# billion in interviews two ex employees who triggered the probe said that while still with the company they reached out to the government after witnessing numerous instances of workers being deceived or mistreated mr owens who had supervised construction of the embassy building said he was waiting for a first kuwaiti charter flight to iraq in march when he noticed that the pakistani and west african workers held boarding passes for dubai he asked a first kuwaiti official about the discrepancy and said he was told it was a way to get the workers past kuwaiti customs mr owens who lives in the u s assumed the workers knew they were going to iraq he said mr mayberry the second former employee said he himself had been given a boarding pass marked for dubai on a first kuwaiti charter flight that he knew was bound for baghdad "it was the first sign that something was a bit off with the company " he says a former army medical technician who was hired to run the sites infirmary mr mayberry later wrote to u s military and civilian officials alleging that first kuwaiti ran a dirty dilapidated medical facility that lacked running water and needed supplies mr owens meanwhile said he began to hear dozens of workers complain that they had been told they would be sent to dubai and kuwait not iraq later he said he saw a large safe that contained the passports of hundreds of workers he alleged the company began confiscating passports after filipinos fled in search of other work in iraq mr owens resigned according to his statements in the sealed false claims act complaint "because he could no longer countenance this misconduct" by first kuwaiti mr mayberry who now is in oregon was fired by the company less than a week after he arrived in iraq after the company criticized his medical skills he questions the timing of the dismissal though since he says it came almost immediately after he began complaining about the infirmary conditions "i felt bad for those folks every day that i was in iraq and the feelings just built and built " mr owens said in an interview "they were basically being treated like slaves "
