global warming irrational assumptions and speculation as dogma after reading and re reading r glenn hubbards "capitalism against climate change" editorial page may i think a more honest title would have been "how to profit from a climate of fear " the journal and mr hubbard both could be said to be concerned with economics and so his opinion piece is quite at home here your readers and i presumably wish to invest and profit from investment opportunities as well mr hubbard does not credential himself as a recognized climatologist however in his support of the legislation proposed by sens jeff bingaman and arlen specter he justifies the need for this emissions trading program by stating that "the case for action to combat global climate change has grown increasingly compelling " that "we know that concentration of carbon dioxide has increased significantly due to human activity " that "we also know that the surface temperature of the earth is warming partly to that increased concentration " and that "most serious students of climate change believe that the likelihood of adverse climate change is sufficiently great to warrent action " of the total co greenhouse gas mankind contributes about and that has increased a small fraction not that it has not been much higher in the past when the weather was hotter and also colder yes the weather is always changing nothing new here the head of nasa has recently said as much some of mr hubbards statements are blends of facts and scientifically unjustified conclusions while not as vehement as mr gores film and rhetoric they perpetuate speculation as dogma i refer mr hubbard and your readers to commentaries on your pages such as "there is no consensus on global warming" by richard s lindzen june and "climate of opinion" business world april by holman w jenkins jr which offer a scientific analysis rather than the politically correct media line gregg easterbook is quoted as predicting that the next cooling cycle in global weather is due around or sooner the public is being warmed up by these various scare tactics to accept arbitrary carbon caps i e limited energy usage and higher prices for all forms of energy who will set the caps the eu would like to the energy companies would like to they presumably will profit by offering more expensive energy to customers under the guise of complying with their self imposed caps does mr hubbard expect us to believe that the "safety valve" price caps he mentioned are to be set and never revised upward i agree with mr hubbard that we should not be "betting the bank" on climate change as another financial commodity trading scheme this proposal will find favor as a means of changing the weather i would not bet on it charles battig m d charlottesville va mr hubbard presented multiple assumptions as facts and a multi national political solution was offered reportedly the national commission on energy policy ncep proposes an "emissions trading program that safeguards the economy " for the last years scientists have observed a slight increase in the earths recorded temperatures namely degrees celsius the largest assumption made by political pundits is that mans industrial activities contribute significantly to this temperature increase the reliable community of scientists recognizes the effects of the suns increased activity on "global warming " but that reporting is almost absent from the medias accounts any thinking person can view the massive size of the globe its vast oceans its huge uninhabited land masses and then compare the composite human city and industrial concentrations and realize that all mans industrial output is fairly minuscule compared with the earths total aerosphere another assumption is that measured slight increases of the "greenhouse gas " carbon dioxide co contribute significantly to global warming totally dismissing the effects of water vapor across the globe which far outweighs the effects of co the purveyors of gloom over mans activities continue to jump on the bandwagon of manufactured public opinion and decry the increased emissions of it they forget the positive effect of increased co on all vegetation and plant life on the planet the lead sentence of mr hubbards piece reads "the case for action to combat global climate change has grown increasingly compelling in recent years " what this really means is that the results of frequently repeated claims of ecologists and anti capitalistic reporters has bombarded the public and politicians to such an extent with the claim that mans primarily americas industrial complex is the main cause of the so called phenomenon of "global warming " therefore this must be slowed by political means even extending it to include all industrialized nations they propose "tradable permits " lest we forget political solutions require new bureaucracies and large expenditures of our tax revenues to set up and micromanage citizens affairs political solutions in this case are unacceptable because they are agenda driven capitalism is the system that provides for the needs and wants of the people consumers in the best and most efficient manner if adjustment to increased temperatures is beneficial then the great marketplace will develop new technologies and industries to deal with it to claim that the industrial growth of mans activities effects our planets temperature and is more important than the increased activity of the sun on the earth is an irrational assumption at best david l wood m d long beach calif see related letter "letters to the
