stem cell advance may skirt ethical debate scientists return adult cells back to embryonic state well all get more money scientists have created embryonic stem cells without using eggs or destroying embryos an advance that may sidestep the knottiest ethical dilemmas that have slowed stem cell research in experiments on mice four independent teams pulled off a feat that is the biological equivalent of turning back time they returned mature cells such as those from skin to a primordial embryonic state further experiments showed that those reprogrammed cells had the same properties as true embryonic stem cells such as the ability to turn into muscle heart nerve and other tissue types no matter what kind of mature cell they had started as "weve shown that we can reset the clock " says rudolf jaenisch a scientist at the whitehead institute for biomedical research in cambridge mass and lead author of one of the studies which is published in the journal nature however he cautions "were very far away from this being turned into routine medical treatment " crucially three of the experiments didnt use eggs or require the destruction of embryos which some people believe is immoral because it kills nascent human life "this is a startling advance " says donald landry interim chairman of the department of medicine at columbia university in new york who believes it is immoral to derive stem cells by destroying living human embryos if it could be done in humans "i would say that ethically this approach would be pristine " the latest advances come at a time when americas nascent stem cell industry after being hobbled by years of controversy and regulation is gaining political traction since federal funds may only be used to pay for research employing the roughly stem cell lines derived from human embryos that existed at that time however many candidates for the u s presidency republican and democrat support human embryonic stem cell research an indication that funding could greatly increase after the next presidential election in addition several states have started paying for such experiments themselves california has pledged &# billion over a decade the newer reprogramming approaches could reinvigorate interest in all manner of embryonic stem cell research "states will pour more money into this research well all get more money " predicts kevin eggan a scientist at harvard stem cell institute and lead author on one of the new papers embryonic stem cells are primitive master cells that may one day help treat a wide range of diseases for example a person who has had a heart attack could be treated by fresh undamaged cardiac tissue grown from stem cells with the same genetic makeup as the patient that would prevent the immune system from rejecting the transplanted heart tissue until the latest reprogramming advance however that meant having to create and then destroy a cloned human embryo which has been too high a price for some policy makers and ethicists a far less controversial path is to use adult stem cells different parts of the human body contain a small number of these special regenerative cells whose main function is to replenish dying tissue when the body gets damaged or as it ages these special cells can also be manipulated to create other tissue types thus adult stem cells found in bone marrow may be turned into fat or cartilage but these cells are limited because many scientists believe they cant produce as many tissue types as embryonic stem cells scientists have now turned their attention to another more unlikely source mature cells though these cells have already committed to being a specific type of tissue such as skin the latest research suggests that these cells too can be returned to a primordial "embryo like" state "this is very exciting basic research with tantalizing data " says robert lanza vice president of research and scientific development of advanced cell technology inc based in alameda calif dr lanza has read the four papers but wasnt involved in any of them it all started with the birth of dolly a cloned sheep a decade ago scientists in britain created dolly by taking genetic material from the mature skin cell of her "mother" and substituting it for the genetic material inside the nucleus of another sheeps egg to their surprise the egg mysteriously "reprogrammed" the skin cell and returned it into an embryonic state from which dolly was then born the experiment involved cloning an obviously controversial move if applied in humans but for a small group of scientists it sparked an intriguing question could mature cells be reprogrammed in other ways that dont require cloning shinya yamanaka of kyoto university made the breakthrough in a study published in he and a colleague showed that by inserting four specific genes into a mature mouse cell they could reprogram it to an embryonic like state "it was remarkable " says konrad hochedlinger of the harvard stem cell institute and co author of one of the new papers "a lot of people didnt believe it " what dr yamanaka wasnt able to do was implant these reprogrammed cells into other mouse embryos and have them accepted and incorporated into the live mice that were later born the gold standard test for the viability of embryonic stem cells now three separate studies have confirmed dr yamanakas original discovery successfully tested it in embryos and pushed the science a step further dr yamanaka and dr jaenisch are lead authors of two separate papers appearing in nature the third study co authored by dr hochedlinger appears in a new journal called cell stem cell each of the research teams focused on four specific genes that dr yamanaka had identified last year using viruses as a transport vehicle the scientists inserted the four genes into mature mouse cells and were able to return them to their youthful embryonic stage they were then able to implant those cells into embryos that produced healthy mice in addition the offspring of those mice also carried the genetic information from the reprogrammed cells passing a sort of double gold standard test achieving the same result in humans is likely to be a far tougher challenge no one knows whether the same four genes that reprogrammed mice cells would do the same for humans and at least two of the genes are known to trigger cancer indeed of the baby mice born in dr yamanakas latest batch of experiments developed tumors "i would predict that making embryonic like cells from human cells is more demanding " said dr yamanaka via an email the fourth feat of cellular reprogramming unveiled yesterday is based on much more established science but it doesnt eliminate the ethical concerns that have bedeviled stem cell research in another paper appearing in nature scientists at harvard produced embryonic stem cell lines by using fertilized eggs of mice essentially one celled embryos this too has big implications if it can ever be replicated in humans it had been thought that only unfertilized eggs could be used and getting unfertilized eggs from women for the purpose of experiments is expensive invasive and in some states that have stringent rules extremely difficult however thousands of fertilized eggs are stored in freezers at fertility clinics across the country furthermore the harvard scientists showed that even damaged fertilized eggs can reprogram an adult mouse cell and return it to its embryonic state genetic material from an adult cell was inserted into a fertilized egg which served as host and provided the chemical signals necessary for creating embryonic stem cells and live cloned mice many supporters believe that using damaged fertilized eggs which they say would result only in miscarriages if implanted in the womb would lower the ethical bar for their use to make stem cells but dr eggans experiment doesnt satisfy everyone "theres nothing ethically different in this approach then there is in using a one celled embryo that doesnt have defects its still a living embryo " says james shirley a stem cell biologist at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge mass who opposes research on human embryos "the public still has to give a lot of thought to using embryos that seem defective in this manner " the study offers dr eggan a way to revive a study that failed last year because of a dearth of unfertilized eggs dr eggan and his colleagues received approvals from harvard to produce stem cell lines containing the genetic material of patients who have diabetes and parkinsons disease but they didnt find a single egg donor because such women under massachusetts law cant be fully compensated for providing eggs for research the latest research findings have prompted dr eggan to now seek egg donations from women who have their fertilized eggs already stored at in vitro fertilization clinics several have agreed "we dont know if it will work in humans " said dr eggan noting that his lab was now gearing up for experiments with human cells but at least he says "we now can use the large number of fertilized embryos in ivf clinics that are routinely discarded "
