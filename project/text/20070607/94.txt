style fashion journal thats so you just click here to buy it retailers are infiltrating shoppers networking sites a threat to legitimacy carrie zavar is one of a growing number of shopaholics who belong to an online shopping community she visits her favorite shopstyle com as often as several times a day and she values the site as an independent venue for shopping chatter untainted by retailers "pushing me into liking or buying something " but a few weeks ago shopstyle com featured a contest with a prize donated by shopbop an online retailer intrigued she checked out shopbop and wound up spending almost &# there on paige jeans and a juicy couture bag attention online shoppers more retailers pitches are coming your way increasingly stores and designers are trying to tap into "social shopping" sites where avid shoppers gather to chat and swap ideas nordstrom and online discounter bluefly com are about to launch pages on shopstyle com that feature look books of outfits they sell and gap and trendy los angeles boutiques such as lisa kline and ron herman recently signed on to create interactive pages on stylehive com a myspace like site where shoppers exchange tips and post pictures of their favorite finds it isnt just the shopping oriented communities that are drawing retailers interest h&amp m this week partnered with creators of the life simulation game the sims to create a virtual store where people who play the game can choose clothing from h&amp m thats actually in stores now and sign up their cyber selves for fashion shows to be staged on yahoo this summer later this month r lilly tuckerwear a maker of apparel for tweens is launching a "fashion fantasy" game that will allow girls to create online personas who design sell or buy clothing and companies from sears to christian dior have created stores in the virtual world secondlife com when coty inc launched its latest calvin klein fragrance ck inu it created a space on secondlife com that allows participants to strike up conversations by "spritzing" others and to buy the scent by clicking through to ckinu com the growing commercialization of the shopping sites could signal the beginning of the end of truly independent online conversations about fashion for true shopaholics these sites many of which arent even a year old have been a rich source of creativity and support for example one particularly handy feature on many of the sites is the ability to "follow" a fellow shopper whose style you admire whenever that shopper raves about a bag she has just bought you get an alert offering you a chance to check out her latest find while retailers say they are giving shoppers a convenient way to buy the items they see their presence blurs the line between informal shopping chats and having a store push specific items "social shopping is only appealing if people think the site that theyre going to has legitimacy " says gordon gould chief executive and founder of thisnext com a month old site that so far has resisted overtures from retailers wanting to pay to set up prominent pages "we want people to connect outside of any commercial interest " still mr gould says he cant bar companies from setting up member pages on his site alex kump co owner of apparel company topo ranch for example has his own page on thisnext com where he touts his labels t shirts though he also raves about items he likes but doesnt sell thisnext com receives about of each purchase that occurs as a result of a click through from the site retailers of course are eager to reach avid shoppers online sales of apparel and accessories now actually exceed those of computer gear according to the national retail federations shop org and forrester research and many users of social shopping sites end up buying more than they intended to before interacting with others on the sites says ray valdes research director for gartner inc a technology research firm that last month published a study on "social shopping " that was clearly the incentive for gap "when we recognized that these communities were out there we decided that we needed to engage in dialogue with them " says will hunsinger vice president and general manager of gap online who has also been closely monitoring social networking sites such as kaboodle com and thisnext com the trouble is that it isnt always clear when retailers fork over money for placements on stylehive com for example neiman marcus fans initially created a page devoted to the store but last month the site struck deals with several retailers allowing them to create prominent pages to tout their wares the only way of telling the difference between the two types of pages is that the actual retailers pages appear more polished and feature magazine style look books another example stylehive user nataliezee offers her favorite picks in a section on the sites "featured people " while her bio notes that shes an associate editor of craft magazine a magazine that also sells kits to make accessories such as wallets it doesnt mention that the magazine has a business deal with stylehive com to prominently feature its wares and nataliezee stylehive com ceo michael carrier says retailers make it clear on the site when the advice is coming from stylists that retailers employ before launching what he calls nectar hives web pages run by retailers who pay for placement either directly or through commissions the site derived revenue from more traditional advertising and a to commission for items purchased after a click through jewelry retailer ice com has taken the trend a step further by creating a blog sparklelikethestars com that features fashion and news tidbits on celebrities the site doesnt mention that the retailer runs the blog making it no coincidence that all the links to purchase rings or earrings that resemble pieces actresses such as lindsay lohan are wearing lead back to ice com but some of these efforts may fizzle with shoppers laura hamlyn a year old regular on stylehive com says she hasnt checked out the pages that gap and lisa kline set up there "if its a store posting what theyre selling on their site i dont really care about that " she says "i can find that by going to their site "
