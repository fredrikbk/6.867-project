dirty work in nigerias violent delta hostage negotiators thrive joshua benamaisia helps rescue captives more woes for big oil yenagoa nigeria in january gunmen dynamited their way into the compound of a construction firm here forced nine south korean workers onto waiting boats and sped off into the niger river deltas maze of mangrove lined creeks the next day joshua benamaisia was on the case a year old adviser to the local government mr benamaisia leads a band of state sponsored vigilantes and plays another murky role gumshoe and hostage negotiator mr benamaisia phoned an old friend who is a prominent militant leader and two days later the koreans walked out of the swamps unharmed with violence rising nigerias handful of unofficial middlemen like mr benamaisia have become indispensable in this increasingly anarchic corner of the global oil patch moving easily among nigerian officials oil executives and foreign diplomats on one side and militants and criminals on the other they have helped win the release of an estimated kidnap victims in the delta so far this year but the middleman role has a dark side it underpins an unofficial kidnapping market that is emblematic of the lawlessness and failed governance plaguing africas most populous nation an ad hoc system of shadowy go betweens threats and ransom payments has allowed hostage taking to flourish into a lucrative industry that is roiling the global oil market the oil rich niger delta is nigerias wealthiest region and its most troubled its descent into chaos is having grave consequences on the outside world in recent years nigeria had become a crucial supplier of low sulfur crude which is easier to process into the types of cleaner burning fuels valued by the west since january spooked oil companies have been closing fields and withdrawing workers shuttering a quarter of the countrys pumping capacity nigeria can produce some three million barrels a day or almost of global demand and the violence has stoked global oil prices dozens of nigerians have died in shootouts between kidnappers and security forces and while foreign hostages usually emerge unscathed late last year a british oil worker was killed in a bungled rescue attempt by the nigerian military the violence is so bad mr benamaisia who once opposed the heavy handed tactics of federal forces is now lobbying the government to step up its security presence "if we let these people keep doing what theyre doing there will be nothing left " he says the kidnapping of foreign workers has long been a feature of modern life in the niger delta a mangrove swamp that extends some square miles across the southern coast of nigeria for many years the acts were primarily used to protest alleged oppression by federal authorities or slights by oil companies but in the past few years gangs of unemployed youth and well organized criminal cells have joined in motivated by payments increasingly doled out to win release of hostages five years ago a company buying kidnap insurance in nigeria would need to shell out about &# a year for &# million in coverage according to willis special contingency risks a unit of insurance broker willis group holdings ltd in london today that same coverage goes for about &# nigerias botched elections in april made things even worse the countrys elections in years past have been marred by violence and voter intimidation but the scale and audacity of irregularities in aprils votes led international observers to condemn them as tainted after the election hostage takings and other attacks dramatically escalated into a low grade insurgency against the federal government seated in the capital abuja a week after the first round of voting gunmen fought government forces in a running street battle here that federal officials say was a failed kidnapping attempt against the regional governor a few weeks later men shot their way into the governors home near here killing a number of policemen before dynamiting the place according to local press reports on may a rebel group attacked a chevron corp oil export terminal in the offshore waters near here and kidnapped six workers one american one croatian and four italians in an email to reporters the group sent photos of the hostages including one where the unshaven chevron men sit glumly around an extinguished campfire on may area gunmen kidnapped at least seven more foreign workers believed by local officials to have been working for a nigerian oil services firm the group included three americans and four britons u s and u k officials confirm last weekend the chevron workers were released but the group responsible threatened in an email to launch more kidnappings down the road the other american and british hostages remain in captivity clashes in recent weeks have been fiercest near yenagoa capital of the nigerian state of bayelsa in the central part of the delta high oil prices have swollen bayelsas coffers and yenagoas elite are building an american style suburb of large gated homes but the state is also a showcase for nigerias brazen brand of corruption in late the former governor of the state was impeached as part of an anticorruption drive he is now contesting the governments corruption charges which he and supporters say are trumped up and politically motivated the vast majority of the states million residents most of whom are members of the ijaw ethnic group live in deep poverty nestled in a steep shoulder below the towns main road henry ezeonyes shop and home flood during the regions frequent heavy rains because there are no sewers his neighborhood gets reliable power one or two days a week "what we need is roads lights " he says in early a new militant group called the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta or mend started terrorizing the facilities of royal dutch shell plc and kidnapping workers in emails to reporters the group demanded the central government give the niger delta region more control of its oil resources and called for the release of two men the former bayelsa governor held on corruption charges and a prominent militant gov goodluck jonathan who had taken over as head of bayelsa state reached out to an old friend from university days a former nigerian diplomat named godknows igali to spearhead negotiations with mend the state also turned to mr benamaisia the son of a civil servant mr benamaisia hails from lagos nigerias biggest city in college he was drawn toward ijaw political movements aimed at winning rights for one of nigerias historically oppressed ethnic groups while he defended an ijaw neighborhood under attack from a rival ethnic group several years ago mr benamaisia and other community leaders say hes otherwise limited himself to the peaceful side of the struggle after moving to yenagoa in mr benamaisia made his own fortune in a number of business ventures his large and well appointed home in port harcourt a two hour drive away from yenagoa has its own generator and his new sport utility vehicle is equipped with a small blue police siren that mr benamaisia frequently relies on to bypass traffic jams including perks and allowances mr benamaisias take home pay for his government job is over &# a month a handsome sum in a country where annual per capita income is just &# tough talking and impatient mr benamaisia constantly juggles two cellphones switching easily between english and a local dialect he laughs readily especially when talking about his dangerous work and seems unfazed by the death threats hes gotten since taking the job "i told them ill get them before they get me " he says from his days in ijaw politics mr benamaisia has many contacts inside past militant movements he and mr igali soon teamed up with ijaw elders and won the release of two batches of foreign hostages seized at shells facilities mr benamaisia was then tapped to organize a militia to protect bayelsas coastal villagers from pirates after hearing about the korean kidnappings in january of this year mr benamaisia called up his militant friend a prominent mend leader the mend leader told him the rebel group wasnt involved but said he knew the hostage takers local thugs out for ransom mend was tired of being blamed for all the kidnapping in the region mr benamaisia says so the friend used his influence to force the kidnappers to turn over the hostages employees of south koreas daewoo engineering &amp construction co in a press statement gov jonathan praised mr benamaisias role in the release of the hostages in this case money didnt change hands mr benamaisia says but ransom payments are commonplace say officials western diplomats and company executives here while mr benamaisia and other government officials say they never pay ransom they say other kinds of payments have become standard procedure for instance they will reimburse militants and middlemen for "logistics" anything from gasoline for motorboats to room and board for foreign hostages who are often treated to expensive bottled water and air conditioning "when a hostage is taken money has to be spent" not only to identify the kidnappers but also to reimburse them for feeding and caring for hostages explains mr igali the bayelsa official typical logistical costs can be as much as a million naira per incident or about &# he says critics call the payments dressed up ransom and allege that officials are likely getting a cut of these transactions "they themselves that are negotiating are negotiating for their own pockets " says nengi james a local ijaw activist who also consults for the state government mr benamaisia and mr igali deny taking a cut of the hostage settlements they say the payments arent big enough to make kidnapping worth the effort and the government has no choice if it wants to ensure the hostages safety on april the day of the vote for local officials many observers expected an uneventful election day in yenagoa because gov jonathan head of bayelsa was running as the ruling partys vice presidential candidate instead it was a fiasco government officials failed to open many polling places until late and kept some shut all day according to reports filed by outside monitors and interviews with residents these observers allege the government did so to fix the vote which the ruling party swept the governments foes in the region were outraged as the second round of voting to choose the president approached on april at dusk the day before polls opened dozens of armed men in motor boats swarmed yenagoas trash strewn waterfront of lumber yards and sand lots peter ogege security supervisor for one of the citys water pumping stations says he watched a half dozen men scale the stations wall they planted dynamite behind one of the plants buildings and carefully spooled out wire a minute later mr ogege and other workers say the building exploded raining down bits of concrete and corrugated metal roofing "if i hadnt been on the other side i would have died that day " mr ogege says for several hours gunfire and explosions rocked the city as government forces battled gunmen parker osumawei says he huddled with his family on the lobby floor of the parklane hotel which he owns as machine gun fire and loud explosions echoed outside the blast knocked all the hotels doors out of their frames and sent the courtyards metal gate hurtling yards into mr osumaweis car on april the day of the presidential election abuja officials said the attacks were by militants trying to kidnap gov jonathan in order to disrupt the voting in an email to a local newspaper a group claiming responsibility said the attack was to "warn the nigerian government of the ballot injustice inflicted on the ijaw and the entire niger delta " although gov jonathan is ijaw himself he was viewed by some critics as a stooge of the ruling party establishment on may the day mend kidnapped the six chevron workers the paid militia run by mr benamaisia took the law into its own hands raiding a pirate camp suspected of stealing one of its boats in a clash that followed one pirate was killed and anothers arm was severed called the "bayelsa volunteers " the militia group is supposed to be unarmed on may mr benamaisia worked the phones from the plush couch in his living room trying to find the chevron hostages when asked about the militia mr benamaisia said his men took up arms only in defense and the injured man confessed to the theft "probably he died on his way to the hospital " he shrugged "the boat was recovered " after several days of making calls mr benamaisia realized he wouldnt be able to get the chevron hostages released any sooner and he backed out of negotiations after more than a month in captivity the group was released last saturday ian mcdonald in london contributed to this article
