politics &amp economics ban on tax plan patents congress is skeptical of their legitimacy washington congress is moving to ban government granted patents for tax planning strategies the change responds to critics who see the practice as a symbol of the flaws in both the tax and intellectual property systems where companies have devoted significant effort to cutting their tax bills and in some cases essentially equate clever accounting schemes with innovations like a new semiconductor or a pharmaceutical product patents on tax planning strategies still represent a minuscule share of those issued by the u s government since the practice began nearly a decade ago only have been cleared by the u s patent and trademark office covering things like estate planning and financial products at least another are pending review but many tax experts say the practice is troublesome and could someday be used to put the governments stamp of approval on unscrupulous tax avoidance schemes creating new enforcement problems for internal revenue service for main street americans the patents if they expand could aggravate the complexity of preparing taxes forcing them to research the esoteric environs of the patent system or risk of being sued for damages mixing the tax and patent systems "raises serious questions " the bipartisan leadership of the tax writing house ways and means committee said in a letter circulated on capitol hill this month "the tax laws belong to all of us and we all have an obligation to comply with them " chairman charles rangel the new york democrat and louisiana rep jim mccrery the panels senior republican wrote in their joint letter "we shouldnt have to pay a royalty to do so " the registry of those securing the complex patents with tax planning implications as defined by the u s patent &amp trademark office includes some big financial companies such as morgan stanley fannie mae and a unit of j p morgan chase &amp co as well as smaller investment advisers and other firms one patent outlines a system for administering a sophisticated financial instrument another the management of a "virtual mutual fund " attorney stephen milbrath who represents a florida firm that holds a patent on an estate planning technique likens the practice to an architect patenting a new water drainage system and charging fees for use of the innovation "its nothing different than what happens in the building industry " said mr milbrath suggesting the proposed ban is really meant "to protect tax attorneys and cpas " the tax patent ban is incorporated in broader legislation overhauling the patent code which is rapidly moving through congress a spokesman for j p morgan said the company is supportive of the broader bill but declined to comment on the proposed ban spokesmen for morgan stanley and fannie mae had no comment the big patent overhaul package passed the house earlier this month with wide bipartisan support on a vote the provision banning the issuance of tax patents was inserted by voice vote in the house judiciary committee in july the senate is expected to take up the big patent bill this fall the tax patent measure isnt currently part of the senate bill but has some high profile proponents there has been no groundswell of lobbying to defend tax patents though some voices of caution are being raised the financial services roundtable which represents large financial institutions is working to "dial in the language" of the houses proposed ban to ensure it doesnt unintentionally capture "legitimate" financial services activities said andy barbour a spokesman for the group the proposal approved by the house would be effective the date of enactment of the bill and would not only ban new patents but cancel all pending applications already approved patents would still be in force though some lawmakers want those also to be re examined patents on tax filing software used by millions of americans wouldnt be covered by the amendment a federal court decision in cleared the way for patents to be issued on business methods and it wasnt long after that the government began approving patents on tax planning strategies washington attorney stephen schreiner who specializes in intellectual property issues warns that banning patents on tax planning strategies would carve a big exception into the patent system though the system does include a limited grant of immunity for doctors who use patented medical techniques in surgery it is traditionally meant to be neutral not tilting for or against the use of new technologies and ideas under the existing system if an idea is deemed be new of some use and isnt an obvious innovation then it can be patented whether it covers light bulbs or seat belts or obscure business methods used by financial companies with a patent come monopoly rights for years "this is a case where theres a knee jerk reaction " mr schreiner said concern has been building in congress for several months particularly after mr milbraths client in florida wealth transfer group llc last year filed suit against a connecticut man over use of an estate planning technique the patented strategy involved the transfer of stock options into a trust the parties involved in the suit agreed to a settlement this spring mr milbrath said the proposed ban is "regrettable " and complains his client has "been singled out as a bad guy "
