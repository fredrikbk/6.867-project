moving the market can brokers erase the past too easily talk about wiping the slate clean despite a new rule aimed at making it harder for brokers and their employers to erase misdeeds from the public record arbitration panels have approved requests to wipe out of alleged misdeeds in certain types of awards according to a study due today by the public investors arbitration bar association that the piaba says shouldnt be happening so readily a rule passed in says complaints typically by smaller investors asserting that brokers made questionable trades or moved money without permission can be removed only if an arbitration panel or court determines the claim to be false inaccurate or doesnt involve the broker named the study by the piaba an association of attorneys who represent investors in disputes with the securities industry indicates the arbitration panels are rubber stamping many expungement requests without a thorough review according to the study the arbitration panels didnt hold hearings before approving expungement requests in so called stipulated awards where both sides agree to a settlement without the help of arbitrators that equals of those types of cases in which the request was granted hearings were held for the remainder overall expungements were approved in all but three of the stipulated awards the piaba says the financial industry regulatory authority the regulator that was created by the consolidation of national association of securities dealers and new york stock exchange didnt dispute piabas findings but says the study focuses only on stipulated awards and therefore reflects just a small sliver of all expungements steven caruso president of the piaba said the arbitration panels need to examine individual cases more closely before reaching a decision "how can you make an affirmative finding without holding a hearing " he asked take the case of mutual fund broker joseph karsner the study points to the baltimore area financial adviser who entered into stipulated agreements in in which the arbitration panels agreed to expunge the record the panel didnt hold a hearing in of the cases before approving that all of his alleged misdeeds be erased according to the study a federal court must still grant final approval before they get removed from the public record and the state of maryland has raised objections a complaint filed by the maryland securities commissioner alleges that mr karsner who provided financial planning advice mainly to telephone company retirees recommended risky investments to clients during the internet bubble era shifting hundreds of them in without their approval from a diversified portfolio to a single mid size mutual fund the commissions complaint filed in state administrative court hasnt been resolved mr karsners attorney richard magid denies any wrongdoing he said many of mr karsners clients lost money as did many other investors after many dot com stocks collapsed mr magid said some clients "panicked" and sold their holdings at the bottom of the market but most held on and have since recovered instead of fighting the claims mr karsners lawyer says his clients insurance company worked out settlements with investors over mr karsners objections that resulted in payments of &# to &# on average mr magid said mr karsner sought to get the complaints expunged from his record he said the arbitration panels held telephone conferences to discuss the cases but not formal hearings "mr karsner believes he played by the rules and the expungements were properly granted " mr magid said finra says that while many awards are stipulated or settled without the help of arbitrators the lions share go to a full hearing mostly in front of a panel of three arbitrators before being decided overall the number of expungements dropped to last year fewer than the in according to finra the new rule has helped reduce the number of cases that get wiped clean said jay cummings finras executive vice president of regulation and disclosure "the rule is working " he said while the number of expungements are down so are the number of investor complaints there were cases closed last year fewer than the cases in it isnt clear how many of those were settled without the assistance of arbitrators the piaba study examined stipulated awards issued by arbitration panels where someone requested an incident be erased and found the expungements were granted in all but three of them the association decided to focus on stipulated awards because the terms are hashed out between parties and in these cases it is up to finra to ensure the rules for holding a hearing are followed when an expungement is requested the absence of such hearings shows that many expungements are getting approved without a proper review according to the piaba for its part finra says the arbitration panels have been holding more hearings this year on cases surrounding stipulated awards through june the arbitration panels held hearings in or of the cases involving stipulated awards it said no hearings were held for the other the piaba study only looks at cases the securities industry and investor advocates have long tussled over how much information about brokers should be available to the public expunging complaints from a brokers record is one of the more hot button issues that have divided the industry and investors eliminating complaint records hamstrings investors who want to learn more about a broker before investing with him or her likewise employers and regulators may find it more difficult to root out problem brokers brokers fear that bogus claims can haunt them for years damaging their reputation and increasing their insurance costs
