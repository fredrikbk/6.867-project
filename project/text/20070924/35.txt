garden statism if jon corzine is the new henry david thoreau then civil disobedience has been defined down the new jersey governor is winning accolades for his defiance of the bush administrations rules for the state childrens health insurance program how fitting that mr corzine should be the one to resort to lawbreaking given that his state exemplifies everything thats gone haywire with schip schip was created in to help insure children from low income families but it has since become a stealth vehicle to expand government control of health care schip expires next week and house and senate negotiators are hashing out a "compromise" that would expand the program by about &# billion over the next five years plus a budget gimmick concealing at least &# billion president bush reiterated his veto threat last week not least because the &# billion expansion he supports would pick up the remaining uninsured kids that schip was intended to serve by contrast democrats want to expand schip well beyond the original boundaries households at or below of the federal poverty line or &# for a family of four and make it a middle class entitlement many states like new jersey have been taking advantage of schips "flexibility" and covering more affluent children their parents and even childless adults in a tardy response to this trend the federal department of health and human services announced in august that before states could further expand their schip programs beyond of poverty they would have to enroll of children below of poverty this limit moves the most disadvantaged children to the head of the line before subsidizing those who need it less in practice it also checks schips mission creep such directives are a legitimate tool that all administrations use to shape policy the usual liberal precincts claim to be enraged governor corzine declared that new jersey would unilaterally disregard the hhs rules and "vigorously continue" to enroll at of poverty the highest ceiling in the country and hed do so even though about new jersey children under of the poverty line remain uninsured and although the state spends of its yearly schip grant insuring adults for several years the number of uninsured new jersey children under has held steady while new jerseys schip rolls have grown by about a year one major reason is that the state continues to enroll families with incomes up to &# whats more this public coverage is mostly substituting for the private variety a recent working paper from the national bureau of economic research estimates the crowd out for schip at meaning that in order to cover four new kids the government is paying for six more who already had private insurance this effect is even more pronounced at higher income levels nationally of children between and already have private coverage governor corzine could always tax his own residents to pay for this largesse then again new jersey already has one of the worst tax burdens in the country and trenton has raised taxes five times in the last six years for the governor the political beauty of schip is that it allows new jersey to finance its spendthrift ways on the backs of more responsible states federal schip funds are allocated in block grants which the states are supposed to match if a state doesnt spend all of it the leftovers are redistributed to states that overspend then congress makes things worse by regularly topping off states that have made promises beyond even their redistributions new jersey has been bailed out in this manner for the last three years mr corzine defends his uncivil disobedience by arguing that the new hhs limits "deny" coverage to new jersey children but he knows this is false because kids and adults are grandfathered in and will not be retroactively removed from the rolls only his expansion plans have been impeded thats entitlement logic for you and soon enough every state may become new jersey as senate finance chairman max baucus recently noted "i think the childrens health insurance program is another step to move toward universal coverage everyone realizes that the goal of this legislation moves us a giant step further down the road to nationalizing health care " at least mr baucus isnt disguising his socialist goal unlike mr corzine with his veto pledge mr bush is trying to hold schip to something close to its original intent we hope enough republicans appreciate the policy stakes to sustain it corrections democratic finance chairman max baucus said "i think the childrens health insurance program is another step to move toward universal coverage " republican senator judd gregg said "everyone realizes that the goal of this legislation moves us a giant step further down the road to nationalizing health care " the latter statement was misattributed to mr baucus in the september editorial "garden statism " wsj sept
