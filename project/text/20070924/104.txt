which way is scarier fed move to steer away from recession threat awakens inflation fears the federal reserve cut interest rates last week in order to address a pressing concern the risk of recession and of a breakdown in credit markets by lowering rates before it really wanted to however the central bank has revived another fear that had been dying down inflation that has left the fed and the investment world in a tight spot if the fed gets it just right the economy will slip through this crisis and keep expanding with only modest inflation making investors happy if the feds rate cuts are too little too late recession fears will return sending another cold wind through credit markets and the stock market if the fed cuts rates too much inflation could loom what was troubling some investors after the fed rate cut last week a reduction in short term rates by half a percentage point to was the latter risk the risk of inflation until the credit crisis struck the fed had signaled no intention of cutting rates so soon lower rates typically stimulate the economy by making it easier for companies consumers and investors to borrow if the fed continues cutting rates before inflationary pressures have been stifled it risks pushing inflation higher the fed has acknowledged the concern noting in the statement announcing last weeks rate cut that "some inflation risks remain " inflation could come from the still booming global economy and from the lower rates themselves which push more money into the economy making it easier to raise prices some money managers already are warning that inflation may force the fed to raise rates early next year taking back last weeks gift higher rates would hurt stocks because they stifle the economy and make it harder for investors to borrow something similar happened in when the fed had to raise rates after cutting them during the financial crisis the economy ended up in recession in although these worries are spreading in the bond market stock investors generally are shrugging them off there is no technology stock bubble today they note as there was in the late s last week stock investors were celebrating the dow jones industrial average rose to it finished just points or short of its record set july if inflation worries become more widespread some of that elation could turn to hand wringing marc stern chief investment officer at bessemer trust months ago began cutting his clients exposure to risky u s and developing country stocks and bonds whose prices had soared in recent years those were among the main casualties of the summers market swoon and lately they have been recovering even so mr stern isnt ready to bet that their recovery will be lasting although "buying opportunities are developing in several formerly overpriced areas including high yield bonds " he says he isnt jumping back in yet "inflationary pressures are evident in the pricing of many commodities such as gold agricultural products and energy " mr stern says "our concerns would grow if the fed cut short term interest rates from current levels " investors who fear inflation generally are keeping more money than usual in cash they are moving toward bigger more stable stocks a weakening dollar also adds to inflation it makes foreign holders of the dollar such as the chinese less eager to own dollars expectations that such investors would shift toward other currencies helped push the euro sharply higher last week while a weakening dollar helps u s exports boosting earnings for companies that compete with foreign multinational companies it also pushes up import prices which can make inflation quicken "who would have thought that the fed would lower rates by more than investors expected with the dollar within a breath of an all time low against all the major currencies they did and inflation expectations are accordingly rising " richard bernstein chief u s investment strategist at merrill lynch said in a report last week benjamin pace chief investment officer at deutsche bank private wealth management and many other money managers dont share that concern sure mr pace says the textbooks say to fear inflation if the dollar weakens but he isnt seeing signs of inflation in import prices he says because global competition is holding prices down "i still think we are in a disinflationary environment where inflation numbers will continue to come down at least this year " mr pace says mr pace acknowledges that treasury bond yields shot up last week which some took as a sign the bond market feared inflation he says yields had gotten abnormally low during the summers credit market turmoil as investors fled to the treasury markets safety and he views last weeks surge in treasury yields as mainly a return to normal levels last month anticipating that markets would stabilize mr pace began buying high yield or junk bonds which were beaten down during the credit crunch in july and august

next quarter analysts expect a profit increase of almost and for next year the expectation is both well above the average of around or of the past few decades if interest rates stay down companies

markets panagora asset management which oversees &# billion began shifting more money into stocks expecting a rebound as the fed made it easier to borrow money "while this continues it will be good for stocks " says edgar peters panagoras chief investment strategist "but i am concerned about the longer term there is an inflation risk here i think the fed realizes that there is a strong possibility that when the crisis passes the fed will take these rate cuts back as they have in the past "
