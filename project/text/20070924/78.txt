politics &amp economics swedens prime minister battles legacy of welfare stockholm swedens conservative prime minister fredrik reinfeldt ousted an entrenched social democratic government last september but he is still battling its legacy after a year in office in which mr reinfeldt carried out a slew of changes aimed at revitalizing swedens social economic model including a big income tax cut economic growth remains robust and unemployment is down but his governments popularity has slumped and shows no signs of turning around mr reinfeldt said he will continue cutting income taxes in in an effort to increase the incentive to work in sweden where unemployment benefits are ample but he adds that another challenge is communicating his vision to the public in a country where he said the social democrats spent years sowing distrust of policies aimed at changing swedens model of free markets strong unions and a vast social safety net "the social democrats have governed sweden for of the last years for many of these years they have actively tried to cast suspicion on right wing policies " mr reinfeldt said in a recent interview "that means that the weight that lies on us isnt only in implementing reform politics at a high speed but also explaining where we are going in the long term were trying to do that " so far he is struggling "you can say theyre not succeeding so far politically " said johnny munkhammar an author and director at swedish free market think tank timbro "they seem to be doing a lot but saying to people theyre not doing much " mr reinfeldt almost immediately ran into credibility problems the year old former economist said on the campaign trail that he planned to tweak swedens labor market but keep his hands off the rest of the welfare system his goal was to increase labor supply in sweden where the government estimates one million people of working age or more than a fifth of the work force arent working because they cant find a job are on long term sick leave or have retired early higher employment would keep swedens growth strong he said which in turn would keep money flowing in to fund welfare "more at work more to share" was his coalitions slogan but critics said the government cut back on that "sharing" soon after taking office by trimming unemployment benefits cutting tax deductions on union dues and raising unemployment insurance fees "he said lets fight unemployment and then he lowered the support from society " said mona sahlin leader of the social democrats mr reinfeldt said these were the labor market tweaks he was talking about before the election but the moves sparked outrage swedish unions staged one of their biggest protests in decades over the changes claiming the moves punish those who need state assistance the most mr reinfeldt has pressed on with other tax cuts saying "bad opinion poll ratings and questioning" are to be expected in times of change in a country that has grown used to the benefits previous social democratic governments provided but he has run into another problem swedens economy is at risk of overheating strong growth up from a year earlier in the second quarter and falling unemployment is fueling inflation the finance ministry said thursday in its budget bill that inflation will rise next year to well above the central banks target policy makers have raised interest rates nine times since early but say they need to keep increasing rates to curb rising price pressure despite recent global financial market turmoil inflation last year was mr reinfeldt acknowledges the potential danger "were at a fork in the road as is usually the case with a strong economy you can either tighten government spending or you can try to increase labor supply and thats what were trying to do " he said economists support much of what the swedish government is doing sweden isnt spending beyond its means and this years budget is likely to come in at a surplus of nearly of gross domestic product the finance ministry said thursday when its budget proposal was submitted to parliament but public support remains elusive "it just feels more expensive here in sweden with everything like housing prices going up and interest rates unemployment insurance " said anja hallberg a retail worker in stockholm "thats the governments fault "
