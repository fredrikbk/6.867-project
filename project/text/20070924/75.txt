small business link three approaches to reining in customer debt cut off offenders tie sales commissions to payments and establish formal policies even one bill outstanding can make a big difference to a small companys bottom line but small companies are less likely to have a collections specialist on staff than larger companies which typically have their past due bills spread over numerous accounts heres a look at the steps three small companies took to turn around their lackluster collections cutting off late payers company slack &amp co contracting inc a employee company that lays pipe and clears earth for construction jobs around its houston headquarters problem customers owed so much money in past due bills about half were more than days past due that slack borrowed as much as &# million a month from bankers to pay employees and finance equipment some customers had a long history of paying late or only partially after claiming that the company did only part of the work solution jim slack jr the companys president cut off rogue customers taking his cue from other companies he had read about about five years ago mr slack began poring over his payment records and spoke with others in the industry to determine which companies habitually stalled on payments or refused to pay bills in their entirety results slack wont do business with of houstons top commercial building contractors some are companies the firm worked with but decided to cut off others were put on its blacklist based on their reputations mr slack no longer has overdue debt he estimates the company saves close to &# each year because of reduced borrowing and employees no longer waste time chasing after so many delinquent accounts "i would rather sell less and make my margin than sell a whole lot more lose sleep get gray hair and have a heart attack over not getting my money " mr slack says cost he hired a new employee to follow up on invoices before their due dates making sure clients have no reason not to pay drawback some employees questioned whether they should turn their backs on big customers "people confuse volume with profit " says mr slack especially for a smaller company "to turn your back on business is a scary proposition " enlisting the sales team company nicholas &amp co a salt lake city food distributor with nearly employees problem the company strained under the weight of customers unpaid bills "a lot of customers were spoiled" by years of lenient credit terms and most took more than a month to pay longer than the industry average says susan archibeque director of credit "we made it too easy for them " solution about five years ago the company changed its sales pay structure to base commissions partly on how much of a sales representatives accounts are current and how long customers take to pay for example if a bill is more than days overdue commissions are reduced by previously sales representatives pocketed their commissions before customers paid their bills the change makes sales representatives more aware of a customers creditworthiness and less likely to sell to someone who is unlikely to pay his or her bill ms archibeque also helped create a new credit policy with stricter payment standards such as cash on delivery for higher risk customers results the average number of days it takes customers to pay their bills has fallen by nearly half ms archibeque estimates that the company has &# million more in the bank each day because of the faster payments plus she adds nicholas saves more than &# million each year because of reduced borrowing needs cost the biggest expense was in the time spent in meetings over the course of a year with executives who initially resisted the change "for the first three months after i got here i had to stop myself from grabbing my purse and leaving " ms archibeque says she enlisted the help of finance department executives to persuade the top brass that the changes would help the companys bottom line drawback a handful of salespeople three or four of around left the company "when i first started " ms archibeque says "i had salespeople in my office constantly saying how dare you do this " and when she asked customers for payment upfront or on stricter terms some "hated me " she adds formulating a formal policy company ktm auto inc an auto repair and diagnostics shop in plymouth n h with six employees problem when customers asked for a little more time to pay the company extended credit to them on an ad hoc basis "next thing you know people owe you money and you dont know what to do " says brian kendrick the firms service manager solution about two years ago ktm adopted a credit policy outlining borrowing terms along with a more formal collections process for instance mr kendrick works with customers to choose a payment due date ahead of time that works for both the shop and the customer someone who requests credit is asked to complete a formal application that includes an address phone numbers place of employment and personal references "being more proactive about it upfront gives the customer the impression that were serious " says mr kendrick when a bill is overdue the customer receives a collections letter mailed in a u s postal service priority envelope "it just makes it look that much more formal " he says results the shop slashed overdue bills to less than &# from about &# before the policies were instituted and mr kendrick estimates that his new collections practices save him &# in annual bad debt write offs "people understand " he says "when they see you have a policy in place theyre going to take it more seriously " cost about &# in discounts on car repairs in return for advice from a customer who is a credit counselor at the counselors urging mr kendrick studied a book on collections and crafted his new credit policy the counselor michelle dunn executive director of credit &amp collections association llc a consulting firm in plymouth n h says her consulting packages start at &# for a half hour session drawback "nobody likes being the bad guy " says mr kendrick "when i started out picking up the phone was kind of daunting " mr kendrick doesnt believe he has lost business as a result of his more stringent policies
