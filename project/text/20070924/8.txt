an unusual race to become glaxos next ceo glaxosmithkline plc is nearing the end of an unusual horse race to select its next chief executive even though the three front runners are internal candidates david stout president of global pharmaceutical operations chris viehbacher president of us pharmaceuticals and andrew witty president of european pharmaceuticals glaxo hired outside consultants to evaluate their leadership capabilities the companys chairman sir christopher gent is discussing the selection process with shareholders and retiring ceo jean pierre garnier has given the candidates special tasks to see how they tackle big picture problems the next ceo of glaxo the worlds second largest drug company behind pfizer inc with &# billion in sales will face a host of challenges glaxo shares on the london stock exchange have fallen by since late may when safety concerns first arose about avandia a diabetes treatment that is one of the companys most important drugs the shares closed at gbp &# on the london stock exchange friday sales of avandia have fallen sharply since may otherwise glaxos overall sales have continued to grow in recent years but investors arent convinced that the company has enough drugs in development to keep sales growing long term under dr garniers leadership for the past seven years glaxo has taken steps to restructure its research and development effort but many investors arent yet won over some investors have also been pressuring the company to consider selling the unit that makes nonprescription drugs aquafresh toothpaste and drinks because it is less profitable than glaxos main prescription drug business and some analysts are concerned that the protracted ceo selection process which began in is distracting management "youve put the four people most involved in running the business including j p in the position where as well as running the business theyre thinking of whats going to happen when j p retires " says paul diggle a pharmaceutical analyst with nomura code securities in london "protracted and highly public horse races are the worst " says david nadler a senior partner at oliver wyman consulting a management consultancy in new york the inevitable rivalry "undercuts the whole concept of teamwork " dr garnier says the company started the process "very early" because the board wanted a full understanding of the candidates "i know these people very well but i live with them every day the board doesnt " dr garnier said in an interview earlier this year companies rarely have several people with potential to become ceo dr garnier said "its unusual many companies dont even have one they have to go outside " he said "because there are a number of very qualified executives that creates the need to have a fair process its maybe a bit intense but its a fair process " sir christopher fired the starting gun in september by telling the times of london that he was considering internal candidates as potential successors to dr garnier the following spring when messrs stout witty and viehbacher delivered speeches about their businesses at glaxos biennial executive retreat in florida glaxo executives nicknamed the event "the beauty contest" and parsed their delivery several glaxo officials who attended say mr witty was particularly notable because he spoke passionately for nearly minutes without notes slides or a teleprompter dr garnier who turns next month was originally scheduled to step down this october but the board extended his term until may because it didnt want the handover to disrupt the brentford england company while it was attempting to gain regulatory approval for a raft of important new drugs this year sir christopher and two other directors who make up the boards nominations committee will make a recommendation to the entire board before a final vote which could come as soon as next month dr garnier declined to discuss the candidates messrs stout witty and viehbacher and sir christopher through a spokesman declined to comment in an unusual move the company hired outside consultants to evaluate the three executives consultants from a global search firm came to glaxo offices in the u s and united kingdom and interviewed the three mens subordinates and bosses in a " degree assessment" this summer managers who report to them were asked to describe what it would be like if their boss ended up at the helm each candidate also assessed his rivals and not surprisingly described them as great guys according to a person close to the situation the consultants also interviewed dr garnier the consultants didnt recommend a specific candidate but summed up their findings in a report sent to glaxo board members the person familiar with the matter says in addition to assessing their everyday work dr garnier has tested the candidates leadership by giving them special assignments asking them to solve key problems facing the industry mr viehbacher for example recently hammered out plans for improving glaxos surveillance of side effects of marketed drugs and presented his ideas to senior management this summer mr stout is working on how to outsource some of glaxos manufacturing and improve its supply chain mr witty is evaluating the best ways to sell drugs examining sales calls and electronic communication with doctors and consumer advertising glaxo top executives regularly receive special tasks on top of their everyday work to improve their executive training they typically report on their progress during monthly meetings of glaxos person corporate executive team mr witty a year old briton has reorganized glaxos european operations to run more efficiently assigning marketing executives by disease and centralizing some back office jobs he won praise internally for delivering solid sales in europe despite tough generic competition and increasingly frugal state health care systems mr stout a year old american has clout in washington an important asset as politicians increasingly speak of the need to rein in drug prices he started his career as a drug sales representative for warner lambert and has focused on improving sales force performance at glaxo and ensuring that all sales reps globally adhere to the same ethical guidelines he worked with dr garnier at schering plough before both men jumped to smithkline beecham which merged with glaxo wellcome in to form glaxosmithkline mr viehbacher raised his exposure with investors and the media this summer by steering glaxo through the avandia safety crisis a dual citizen of canada and germany he speaks english french and german and ran the european business before taking over the u s in giving him broad global experience the candidates have been getting public exposure as well as face time with the board they have each made presentations about their businesses at board meetings and met directors over dinner people familiar with the matter say they have also spoken often at conferences and meet frequently with key investors and analysts last fall for instance mr viehbacher and his top managers described their business results and plans before sir christopher during an all day session at a glaxo facility in research triangle park n c mr viehbacher tried to showcase how well his team had worked despite some challenges in the market a former glaxo executive recalls "it was kind of an audition " he says when succession races are public companies risk having the runners up leave after they have been passed over as pfizer discovered last year when vice chairman karen katen announced her exit within weeks after not getting the top job following an month race it was a similar story at general electric co where three executives competed to succeed jack welch the two also rans decided to jump ship within nine days of the succession decision in late the same scenario might unfold at glaxo says one informed individual "thats on everybodys mind "
