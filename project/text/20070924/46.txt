irans german enablers jerusalem business opportunities in iran were the theme of a german government sponsored conference last week in darmstadt germany "iran is accustomed to crises " the conference invitation delicately noted "but somehow always keeps going forward " in fact irans resilience is made possible in no small measure by germany itself which remains one of irans largest trading partners now berlin is balking at international attempts to intensify economic sanctions against the tehran regime for its nuclear program just how discordant germanys iranian policy is even within the european union was made clear to me last spring when i participated in a "roving seminar" on iran and nuclear weapons that visited paris brussels and berlin as the sole israeli participant in the seminar jointly sponsored by the german marshall fund and the american enterprise institute i assumed that my role was to play the heavy reminding naive and self righteous europeans of the unpleasant truths of the middle east instead i encountered sobriety about the iranian threat loathing for the ahmadinejad regime and sympathy for israels fears the europeans i met were keenly aware of the danger of a nuclear arms race in the arab world triggered by fear of a shiite bomb in paris a senior french diplomat said that while he opposes a military strike against iranian nuclear facilities he well understands why israelis see matters differently in brussels a senior eu official went further telling me how necessary it was for the u s and israel to maintain the threat of a military option which only strengthens european efforts at a negotiated solution everywhere our panel appeared we met opinion makers who understood that the greatest threat to world peace was a nuclear iran everywhere that is but berlin there government officials spoke of giving the iranians one more chance to prove their peaceful intentions when i raised the possibility that at least part of the iranian leadership holds apocalyptic religious beliefs that could encourage a nuclear strike against israel former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani declared in that "even one nuclear bomb inside israel will destroy everything" i was dismissed as an alarmist one senior german politician declared that a military strike against iranian nuclear facilities would be the worst of all scenarios worse even than nuclear weapons in the hands of a regime that denies the holocaust and threatens to launch another holocaust against israel this politician did however manage some outrage over israels settlements policy in berlin it seemed to me that afternoon the decision had already been made to learn to live with the iranian bomb inevitably germans and israelis approach the use of force with very different sensibilities world war ii taught us opposite lessons for germans to suspect power as immoral for jews to regard powerlessness as untenable still i expected greater understanding among germans of their responsibility in helping to resist the iranian threat especially toward israel germany after all is israels most reliable friend in western europe since the early s for example germany has on several occasions upgraded israels submarine fleet offering it second strike nuclear capability to counterbalance threats from iraq and iran when the iranian government sponsored its notorious conference on holocaust denial last december the german government sponsored a simultaneous conference on holocaust remembrance why then the german obstructionism on efforts to contain a nuclear iran business interests of course offer one explanation last year german exports to iran totaled about &# billion though german trade with iran has reportedly dropped this year by some german companies including major corporations like basf siemens mercedes and volkswagen continue to do business in tehran as michael tockuss former president of the german iranian chamber of commerce in tehran boasted last year "some two thirds of iranian industry relies on german engineering products " still however substantial business interests alone cant explain germanys refusal to seriously confront the iranian threat the men and women i met in berlin are obviously concerned about the stability of the middle east and the safety of the jewish state and recognize that a nuclear armed and expansionist shiite regime is a danger ultimately to europe as well perhaps another reason for german blindness on iran is a misplaced sense of contrition in insisting on engagement rather than confrontation with tehran germans seem to believe they are keeping faith with the lessons of their history all problems should be peacefully resolved no aggressor is irredeemable that was the message offered last week by german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger who even as he insisted that germany was ready "if necessary" to confront iran quickly added that berlin was prepared to give the ahmadinejad regime "a chance to recover the international communitys lost confidence in its nuclear program if iran is ready to do this then i think we can spare ourselves future sanctions debates " the message germany is inadvertently sending the ahmadinejad regime is continue to hold out because the west is divided and ultimately will abandon not only the military option but the economic one too germanys iran policy undermines its own lofty goals by weakening the sanctions effort germany is sabotaging the only real alternative as french foreign minister bernard kouchner has described sanctions to war with iran by strengthening the iranian regime germany endangers israel to whose well being it is committed and perhaps most ironic of all by appeasing evil rather than resisting it germany compromises its profound efforts to break with its past mr klein halevi is a senior fellow of the adelson institute for strategic studies at the shalem center and the israel correspondent for the new republic
