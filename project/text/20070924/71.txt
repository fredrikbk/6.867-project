politics &amp economics torn lebanon looks to army military provides stability amid strife possibly new president beirut lebanon amid an escalating standoff between the u s backed government here and opposition parties led by hezbollah the countrys ability to hold together in the coming months appears increasingly dependent on an unlikely institution the army a political crisis deepened last week when a government aligned parliamentarian was killed by a car bomb the third killing of a lawmaker in the government since opposition members pulled out last fall the assassination derailed a series of meetings between government and opposition leaders seen as crucial for allowing parliament to open as scheduled this week and begin the process of selecting a new president both sides in the standoff blamed each other for the charged atmosphere and this weekend each called on the other to compromise but both sides have shown little desire to back down threatening to name their own governments if a consensus candidate for the presidency isnt named by nov when president emile lahouds term expires a split could have broad implications for the region threatening in a worst case scenario civil war the hardening position of the opposition parties amid the assassinations is also worrying washington which would see its influence wane markedly if the current government collapses amid the political paralysis the army is being seen as a crucial stabilizing force but it is unclear how long that may last "the army is now holding the country together " says retired army general walid sukkarieh "if the government splits each political party will try to pressure the army and if the army cracks we will be in civil war " in lebanons long civil war through the s the army split along sectarian lines with christians sunni and shiite muslim soldiers fighting alongside their respective militias in the s the army was re integrated but has long been regarded as weak poorly trained and badly equipped without a strong army militants from hezbollah the shiite islamic movement that the u s calls a terrorist organization thrived hezbollah claimed its militia and weapons caches were necessary to defend against israel and other enemies but this summer the member army won new popularity and respect after battling islamist militants in the northern refugee camp of nahr al bared earlier this month the army succeeded in routing the militants after a three month standoff since then soldiers have been feted as heroes in the local media the militants were better equipped than the army in the first week of fighting the army used up of its total ammunition the government had to plead with its western supporters for assistance some help arrived from the u s and other western countries giving the army a small boost in its capabilities the armys rising profile is also thanks to a fresh perception that its commanders and soldiers have risen above the sectarian strife paralyzing lebanese politics lebanon is governed by a complex power sharing arrangement brokered by its three most powerful sects the countrys president is drawn from the maronite christian community the prime minister must be a sunni muslim and the speaker of the house a shiite muslim last october opposition parliament members including lawmakers from hezbollah which is backed by iran and syria walked out of a unity government to demand more cabinet seats the decision coming shortly after a day war with israel in the summer of has left the government paralyzed this weeks presidential deliberations in parliament were seen as the countrys best hope for forcing both sides to sit down together and reach a compromise as the armys national standing grows so has that of its commander in chief gen michel sulaiman a christian nationalist and an independent he has been mentioned as a possible consensus candidate for president for that to happen though the government must amend a constitutional mandate that restricts the president from holding any official positions for a period before his appointment president lahoud has indicated that if his replacement isnt named by the time his term expires he will appoint gen sulaiman as caretaker of an interim government until new elections are held gen sulaiman has said he would only consider the presidency if both sides agree to it he declined a request for an interview last week as political factions scrambled to work out a compromise a massive car bomb killed antoine ghanem a parliamentarian from the u s backed bloc this third assassination has whittled the governments parliamentary majority to of the seats the government has blamed the killings on damascus which held political sway here until syrian troops pulled back in after mass street demonstrations syria denies the allegations "i hope the army takes charge they prevailed in nahr al bared and it was the first time in my life i ever saw the lebanese army achieving something " says samir karam whose sanitation equipment company was destroyed in the blast "they prevailed and now in this terrible security situation we need them " he says in the aftermath of wednesdays carnage political negotiations between the two sides were tabled it is unclear if talks will resume in time for parliament to start considering presidential choices so far both sides
