tokyo throwback all you need to know about japans political trajectory is that a year ago yasuo fukuda was considered too old to lead the nation yesterday he became president of the liberal democratic party and is expected to be elected prime minister tomorrow this is a triumph for the ldp old guard that former prime minister junichiro koizumi worked hard to dismantle the year old mr fukuda is above all a consensus politician adept at backroom negotiations and offering little in the way of economic reform or foreign policy vision at home hes expected to rebuild public support for the ldp through pork barrel spending abroad he wants to soften japans posture vis a vis north korea and china some of mr koizumis reforms may stick through their own momentum and mr fukuda portrays himself as a "reformer " but he also hints at equalizing rural and urban incomes translation the ldp wants to reclaim the rural votes it lost in julys upper house elections through public spending and pay for it with higher taxes in a press conference yesterday he pledged to negotiate with the opposition about raising the consumption tax thats not what japan needs especially as the global economy starts to slow japan is going to grow faster when it becomes an easier place for entrepreneurs to start businesses for existing companies to conduct mergers and acquisitions and for foreigners to add competitive spark and raise standards of corporate governance on foreign policy mr fukuda is a mixed bag he has vowed to continue japans ties with the u s and will likely push to renew an antiterror law that allows japans navy to refuel u s led coalition warships in the indian ocean that support the effort in afghanistan the legislation authorizing the naval mission expires on november so this will be an early test for the new prime minister on north asian diplomacy mr fukuda has sounded a softer note than his immediate predecessor shinzo abe he wants to talk to north korea without demanding concessions beforehand such as the return of japanese citizens abducted by pyongyang mr fukuda may have learned the wrong lessons from mr abes brief tenure mr abe lost the publics trust not because of his vision for a reinvigorated strong japan he lost because he fell into the old trap of factional ldp politics he readmitted the anti reform legislators whom mr koizumi had ejected his entire second cabinet was filled with faction picks in the process he lost momentum on economic reform which helped sour the public mr abe was premier for less than a year and mr fukudas immediate task will be holding onto his job a general election isnt required until september but the new prime minister inherits an unpopular government and his partys hold on the lower house is shaky the upper house which the ldp lost in july to the democratic party of japan can block government policy mr fukuda hails from the ldps mori faction which also produced messrs abe and koizumi if mr koizumis fellow reformers many of whom are still in government want to revive their agenda perhaps its time to ditch the ldp and start a new political party
