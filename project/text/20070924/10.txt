bipartisan fix needed for surveillance act in his commentary on the foreign intelligence surveillance act "the wiretap flap continues " editorial page sept bruce berkowitz offers some constructive criticism and suggestions the real issue here is whether the administration and some in congress want to continue using fisa as a wedge issue or to clarify its intent within a framework mike mcconnell director of national intelligence says is "elegant and right " as one who opposed the amendments to fisa rammed through congress in late august i believe there is a way to build a bipartisan fix that provides the new tools needed to track communications of terrorist operatives and ensure that americans civil liberties are not violated mr berkowitz writes that the bush administration made mistakes by operating its domestic surveillance program outside the law hes right congress and the courts should insist that fisa is the exclusive means to conduct foreign surveillance that way the careful balance in fisa which requires individualized court issued warrants if an american is under surveillance and builds in oversight by congress is retained mr berkowitz also writes that telecommunications companies deserve retroactive immunity for allegedly complying with what they believed to be legitimate executive branch requests for phone records that may make sense if prospectively court approval for the contours of the program so called "basket" approval and for future cooperation by telecommunications firms is required the terrorism threat is real but the choice is not simply between a blank check and going soft the threat of unfettered executive power is also real thats why fisa should not be gutted rep jane harman d calif washington
