the doctors office being available to patients can be stressful but gratifying online edition we live in a society where the expectation of immediate gratification and instant service is the norm health care has been slow to catch on but now instant service is popping up usually for cash only in urgent care and retail health clinics when a doctor offers round the clock service it can make a splash because so many people find getting health care so inconvenient but the commitment to a hour a day medical practice requires endurance and the right temperament ive been at it for years and havent burned out but the schedule can be almost as stressful as it is rewarding let me be clear im not talking about taking care of a small group of healthy people who can afford concierge care that wouldnt be so hard im talking about availability for pregnant women small children the elderly medicaid patients and the chronically ill my home phone number is listed my answering machine tells patients to call the hospital and have me paged if im needed after hours my wife and i chose a house half a block from the hospital so i could get to obstetrics in a hurry treating lots of patients with a variety of illnesses helps keep me sharp real doctoring ive found takes experience and regular reinforcement of clinical skills how do i manage it first im lucky to have a partner who shares my views and the load technology also helps ive got a beeper a cellphone and a web site where patients can leave a message request a prescription refill or schedule an appointment i can access my records from any internet connection after all these years im so conditioned to the beeper that i reach for my hip at the sound of the alarm on a french fry cooker at a fast food place it happens even when im on vacation and the beeper hasnt been hanging from belt for days being available at all hours can make for some interesting days recently i was paged out of the shower at a m for a delivery i made it to the hospital in less than five minutes and delivered a baby girl to start the day i deliver almost all the babies of my pregnant patients i might miss one or two of a year i keep the office open every weekday those hours cut down on after hours calls if i took a full day off during the week like many offices in the area i think id get bogged down meeting the demand the next day most days i get one call at most when the office is closed on weekends i average two or three calls those arent usually from one of my several thousand patients but from the hospital er or from a nursing home there is a natural ebb and flow to weekend patient calls and requests they peak in mid morning and again about p m i can usually count on quiet when the chicago bears are on tv every once in a while when i leave the office early to run errands i seem to get a flurry of calls the same day i delivered the baby first thing in the morning i took a call in the afternoon from a fellow who was golfing miles away in wisconsin his golf partner was stung by a bee and his lower lip was swelling like mad what should they do they were miles from the nearest hospital but just happened to have some benadryl in one of the golf bags i advised him on an initial dose of medication and it was enough to help get the man by until he could get medical attention in person another patient called for advice about a migraine next came a call about the year old girl whose ear had been bitten by the family dog i attended her birth and three of her brothers our office was closed and i was out of town its also corn and bean harvest season here so my partner combination country doctor and farm wife with three kids couldnt break away either she arranged for the girl who lives nearby to come by the farm for a look she evaluated the child in her kitchen the ear laceration was deeper than she expected and more than a simple fix so she sent the girl miles to the hospital for me to treat i placed seven sutures in the back of her ear to repair it mending the damage from the dog bite meant that i missed dinner that night but being there when patients need me is also gratifying as tiring as the doctoring life can sometimes be i cant imagine living any other way due to his schedule and the volume of email he receives dr brewer may not be able to respond to all reader email he does participate in his forum where readers are urged to post his email address is thedoctorsoffice wsj com
