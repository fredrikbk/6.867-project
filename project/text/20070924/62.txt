office technology do it yourself software new tools let businesspeople avoid the it department and create their own computer applications but they arent for everybody if you want something done right the adage goes do it yourself today many businesspeople are taking that maxim to heart when it comes to software rather than asking the it department to create software applications for business processes such as budgeting client billing project management or order tracking these tech savvy businesspeople are using new do it yourself tools to write such programs themselves while using these tools isnt as simple as creating a word document or using email no knowledge of computer code is required users work with building blocks of prepackaged code to create programs that suit their needs "its a drag and drop thing with menus and with a canvas you drop things onto" to create an application says jason buell the managing director of colorlab custom cosmetics inc in rockford ill describing coghead inc s web based software tool mr buell has used the coghead platform to create an application that tracks the progress of his companys cosmetics products from concept to delivery coghead is one of several companies that offer web sites where users can build and store applications other companies sell application building software that users install on their own computers either way users say theyre saving time and money by creating their own applications and are able to build exactly what they want without having to explain what theyre looking for to someone else the do it yourself trend is still young but some liken it to other turning points in corporate computing such as when businesspeople learned how to create their own presentations with microsoft corp s powerpoint application "presentations were the same " says anthony bradley research director at research firm gartner inc in arlington va "you had to go to the graphics department and have them build them for you these do it yourself services portend the future " the field is a broad one with tools including dataweb corp s dataweb online platform bea systems inc s aqualogic pages jackbe corp s presto and many more international business machines corp s qedwiki is one of several programs that allow users to create their own mashups applications that combine data from a variety of sources in new ways for example qedwiki could be used to build an application that allows salespeople to map their visits to customers combining address information from the companys contact database mapping data from google maps and traffic data from a government site "we are using coghead to build our own customer relationship management system " says paul fu san francisco based chief information officer and vice president of corporate development for morrison express corp a privately held logistics and supply chain management company based in taiwan "our customers need maximum visibility into where their products are being shipped " says mr fu rather than relying on the it department to address those needs five business analysts at morrison express used cogheads online platform to build an application to improve the tracking of shipments "you dont have to be a programmer to get benefit from coghead " mr fu says "now business users are not gated by the it department " mike curtis president of gibson advertising marketing &amp public relations in billings mont used dataweb to create an application for tracking billable hours invoicing and project budgeting now when a client calls with a question about a project from the previous year mr curtis can check his application online and provide an answer while the client is still on the phone rather than having to call back hours later after locating the data on various bits of paper or in an employees spreadsheet there are a variety of reasons why companies are using these applications instead of depending entirely on their it departments to develop programs or buying off the shelf software mr fu for example cites the money he saves based on standard pricing he estimates that even when accounting for the time it took his staff to build a shipment tracking application using coghead the do it yourself service is about one third the price of a comparable standard application cogheads list prices start with a plan that allows five users to create an unlimited number of applications for &# a month and provides a base level of storage others like being able to write programs that would have been too minor or personalized to bother the it department with moreover once theyve been written adjusting do it yourself or diy programs can also be simpler than asking the it department for program tweaks or updates "ive designed it for us " says colorlabs mr buell "if something isnt working i can go in and tweak it " diy tools can also cut down on the steps required to create an application by eliminating the need for businesspeople to explain their desired functions to a programmer who may not understand much about the businesspeoples daily processes a programmer might not know "an airway bill from a customer code from a bill of lading " says mr fu "before the salesperson would need to explain this to a programmer " but of course there can also be downsides to diy tools since many of them are sold by small start ups there is some risk in the lack of a track record for such companies and in the possibility that a provider will fail leaving its customers without access to the applications they developed online also the fact that many diy programs are hosted online may be an issue for those who worry that their data would be more vulnerable online than if it were stored behind a corporate firewall some diy mashup makers complain of the difficulty of extracting data from programs written in a nonstandard format or from sites that dont have an open application programming interface but software from companies such as kapow technologies inc of palo alto calif and worklight inc an israeli company with u s headquarters in newton mass can make such data accessible still some businesspeople may underestimate the effort required to write their own programs just as hobbyists often expect to build a backyard deck on a single saturday afternoon "writing software is always way more complex than you think " cautions mr fu mr curtis who admits to having spent a lot of time getting his advertising agency application just the way he wanted it says "they give you a blank slate and that can be a little frightening " ms borzo writes about business and technology from california she can be reached at reports wsj com
