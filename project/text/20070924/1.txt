americas beware of venezuelans bearing gifts when argentine customs officials caught a venezuelan businessman trying to smuggle almost &# in cash into the country last month they parted him from his loot but allowed him to leave the country he flew to uruguay and then to florida where as someone who also holds an american passport he has a home the mystery of where the money came from and where it was going has not been solved but thanks to investigative reporting by the argentine daily la nacion we now know that there was good reason for guido alejandro antonini wilson to think he could just walk off that plane with a bag of money as it turns out the argentine government of president nestor kirchner has a policy of allowing venezuelans tied to the government in caracas to come and go freely at buenos aires aeroparque airport with no scrutiny of their baggage whatsoever this revelation has raised serious questions about argentine sovereignty and about the relationship mr kirchner has established with venezuelan president hugo chavez more to the point argentines now want to know whether unchecked venezuelan traffic through the country is whats behind the acceleration of mr chavezs bolivarian revolution in argentina as it was in bolivia they also want to know if the money was destined for the political campaign of mr kirchners wife cristina fernandez kirchner who is the peronist candidate in next months presidential elections the argentine government appeared happy to get rid of mr antonini in the early morning hours of aug when the money was discovered with him out of the country it apparently believed the whole thing could be easily swept under the rug but then a local cable tv station reported the incident soon the wider argentine media picked up the story and the public learned that the venezuelan bagman had arrived on a charter flight from caracas with two argentine government officials and three executives of the venezuelan state owned oil company pdvsa this sparked a political firestorm for the kirchners now argentina wants washington to extradite mr antonini that process could take up to a year in the meantime the presidential race is heating up and the first couple is claiming to know nothing about what mr antonini was up to for a while that seemed at least plausible but as details have emerged about the circumstances at aeroparque the governments umbrage at the suggestion that it could have been complicit in the matter is looking downright theatrical mr chavezs influence has been rising in argentina for some years now in part because mr kirchner has much in common ideologically with the venezuelan like mr chavez mr kirchner has surrounded himself with former left wing terrorists and their sympathizers and has made anti americanism a central theme in his policy agenda mr kirchner is also a practical man and after argentina was branded a deadbeat for its debt moratorium the chavez offer to play international banker and buy up government bonds was an offer he couldnt refuse now the antonini affair has exposed another facet of the chavez kirchner alliance open access to argentina for chavez foot soldiers la nacion reported on aug that pdvsa flights receive "preferential treatment" when they arrive in argentina the planes drop their passengers in the military zone at aeroparque where they clear customs and immigration but according to the paper that zone has one special feature that makes it relevant to the suitcase scandal "there are no scanners to examine baggage " the plane mr antonini was on which was hired by the argentine state owned energy company enarsa seems to have parked at the wrong terminal thats why he got nabbed la nacion also reports that sources familiar with airport activity say that in the past few months at least eight pdvsa flights have landed at the military zone in aeroparque and that at least one pdvsa plane lands there every month given what was found on mr antonini it is reasonable to ponder what these flights might be carrying as la nacion has pointed out one of the organizers of the anti american rally in buenos aires when george w bush went to uruguay in march admitted that the event was paid for by venezuela but how the money got to argentina is still not known quite apart from money there is also the question of revolutionary personnel coming and going citgo the venezuelan gasoline company that operates in the u s but has no business in argentina or bolivia has a u s registered plane that has landed more than once in aeroparque the same plane in july was used for an official visit to a presidential summit in cordoba argentina "but " according to la nacion "in that moment it was operating as the transportation for the cuban delegation " in fact the paper says "these planes are used for both government and business purposes and it is difficult to know the nationality of the passengers because they fly venezuelans cubans and bolivians " the highest ranking argentine official on mr antoninis flight was claudio uberti the director of highway concessions la nacion says that mr uberti flew out of argentina times in the past months and six of those trips were to venezuela the paper reports that he went more frequently than that to venezuela but sometimes flew from bolivia when he arrived home on charter flights he repeatedly used the military zone at aeroparque "if that had happened this time mr antonini wouldnt be famous " writes la nacion reporter daniel gallo for his part mr antonini reportedly entered argentina times in the past year according to mr gallo "the pdvsa flights are peculiar in that their passengers supposedly high ranking venezuelan representatives do not appear on the registers or meeting agendas of argentine officials as they should by law neither planning minister julio de vido nor mr uberti report meetings with pdvsa that would have required the trips by such visitors " it may take a good long time to figure out just where mr antonini was going with his stash speculation ranges from laundering money to paying a bribe to funding political activity but in a sense it doesnt really matter what has been revealed since aug is that mr kirchner has sacrificed argentine national security in order to satisfy mr chavez that cant be good for the stability of the southern cone
