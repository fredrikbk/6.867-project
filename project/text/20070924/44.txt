innovation awards managing innovation how to get the most out of your companys big ideas managing innovation is one of the biggest challenges that companies face they not only need to come up with new ideas but they also need to foster a culture that encourages and rewards innovation otherwise they risk being overtaken by their competitors at a recent panel discussion at the tech museum in san jose scott thurm management news editor for the wall street journal talked about managing innovation with four experienced managers at silicon valley technology companies marthin de beer senior vice president of the emerging markets technology group at cisco systems inc judith l estrin chief executive of packet design inc a network technology company douglas merrill vice president of engineering and chief information officer of google inc and douglas solomon chief technology strategist at ideo an innovation and design consulting firm following are edited excerpts from their discussion thinking long term wsj in a big company how do you get people to think beyond months if the whole company is focused on months mr solomon i think its very difficult to do in most big companies and very few big companies have been able to do it there are a number of different models that have been tried they dont have sufficient resources in small companies to do everything theyd like to do which is probably a good focusing effort but in big companies they have the resources but they dont always have the thought processes and the skills to really think outside their current business nor the permission to really do it corporations inherently have antibodies that come out and try to envelop and kill any innovation ms estrin ill draw an analogy that may oversimplify but may make it easier for people to think about in thinking about large companies think of them as farms and what youre trying to do is grow rows of corn you dont want surprises you want it to work well you apply incremental innovation to be as productive as you can and then when youre thinking about start ups or disruptive innovation think about that as either a greenhouse or maybe a small garden plot where surprises are fun all of a sudden you look out into your garden and theres something out there that makes it look better and is interesting you have a different level of nurturing that you need for the small garden then the greenhouse is a step further where you really want to control the conditions and keep out the elements so i think what we have seen as the most disruptive innovation has come from start ups and research because they naturally operate in that fashion with a clean slate or you can decide to develop greenhouses and small garden plots on the farm but you have to keep them separate and then the trick is transplanting and im not a gardener even though i use this analogy but transplanting is the trickiest part of growing things and so you really have to build in a culture and figure out for your organization how are the best ways to transplant do you move people how much do you let the business grow before you transplant it how do you prepare the soil changing the culture wsj it seems were getting to this issue of how you would change the culture of a company to make it more innovative doug earlier you mentioned antibodies and you say companies come to ideo just for this purpose how do you make a corporate culture more innovative mr solomon i think the short glib answer is with great difficulty but fortunately there have been some very interesting success stories i think there are four main factors that need to change in companies among many other possibilities to help them become more innovative the first one is really awareness and attitudes the second one is ways of thinking the third one is processes and tools and the fourth one is managing risk going back to the first one there are many companies that just dont have the awareness that they need to change there are still people who say "if it aint broke dont fix it " and i dont think these companies are in a good position to really change because theyre happy with where they are so you have to have a certain degree of discomfort in your business to be willing to make the changes that are necessary the support for change and innovation has to come from the top but thats not sufficient i think its really building a culture from the top down and the bottom up the second point is the way you think most of us are trained in what i would call analytical thinking analytical thinking is really good for certain things its good for description of data and description of the world its good for analysis and cutting things apart and slicing and dicing the world its also good for extrapolation or prediction from the past into the future what analytical thinking isnt very good for is trying to envision a new future and figure out how to change it so we try to encourage companies to use what we call design thinking in design thinking basically youre very generative youre goal driven youre trying to create a future design thinking is rooted in optimism and the goal to get something done and to bring it to the marketplace the third piece is processes and tools its not enough to just say "think differently and go be creative " you have to actually build processes you have to support people you have to give them time much like google and other companies provide employees with some time to think on their own in some new creative ways you have to provide rewards and a reward system for encouraging innovation and then the final piece is managing risk you have to have a tolerance for risk if youre going to try to be innovative a lot of companies dont have that tolerance the good news though is that there are processes that you can use to minimize the risk like rapid prototyping and testing so you dont get so attached to your ideas that you cant throw them out and get some new ones to try ms estrin everybody uses the word "risk " but what it really means is an attitude toward acceptance of failure and people dont want to use the word "failure " and so its not just that companies need to be willing to have projects fail people need to know that its ok to fail as long as its not for someone not trying or somebody just blatantly misexecuting failure is actually a good thing and not a bad thing mr de beer if you can draw on the collective intelligence of the organization or what others would say is the wisdom of the crowd it becomes an incredibly powerful phenomenon if you dont have that openness in a company or the ability to collaborate with peers across multiple functions it is very hard to drive an innovation especially through a bigger company mr merrill every company in the world says "dont ask permission ask forgiveness " every company in the world says "its ok to fail " and for of them its probably not true the place where those decisions get made are your annual reviews one of the organizations that never gets mentioned in innovation and is actually critically important is human resources companies where it is ok to fail review processes promotion processes compensation processes if you promote people compensate them give them that kind of love even though they have failed youre taking one step in the right direction wsj weve talked a little bit about cooperation and collaboration mostly within the enterprise is it better to open yourself up to even more things by going outside the boundaries of the enterprise mr de beer one of the biggest surprises to me was we draw heavily on mass collaboration to basically get input from all employees inside of cisco weve acquired companies most of them small those employees didnt stop being entrepreneurial when they joined cisco in fact of them are still there so the question is how do we harness how do we draw on that collective wisdom that exists if you can harness the collaboration culture in the company if you can use mass collaboration tools and you can draw on the collective wisdom of the crowd inside of your organization its a powerful thing ms estrin i absolutely agree with you that collaboration and getting as much input from diverse places in making your decisions is really important but i think there are some people who look at taking this a step further which is "lets let people vote lets let this be a popularity contest well put up ideas and the wisdom of the crowd will tell us which is the best idea " and i would argue that you will get incremental innovation that way there are some people who are more talented in innovation and there are other people who are more talented at execution you have to be able to recognize that not everybody is uniform let those people rise up who really are the ones who have better instincts and are going to pick the ideas that are more likely to be interesting down the line if you make decisions either by consensus or a little bit of a herd mentality or the wisdom of the crowd thats the way to gather information its not the way to make the decision as to which ideas to follow there i think you want people who have instinct and judgment mr de beer i completely agree the final decision comes back to me and my boss to what we actually invest in or not because youre right the majority of people are not risk takers and few of them would be willing to make that big leap barriers to innovation wsj what are the key barriers to innovation ms estrin one of the challenges i think about is that all of the things that companies have done for quality and efficiency are essentially enemies of innovation they are the things that have made us so efficient and so productive weve taken out all of the slop and all of the room that you need for innovation if youre very successful in one business it tends to take all of the oxygen of the company new ideas everybody says theyre too small in order to start an idea you have to go in front of a committee you have to show a return on investment thats going to meet a certain return over a period of time those types of processes that are put there to vet ideas that stop people from trying are just the type of things that will kill the surprises that are going to end up being big mr merrill if you look at the source of some of googles most interesting innovations many have come from places in the organization that you wouldnt expect wsj can you give us an example mr merrill we have had great ideas related to the way our content publishing systems work that came out of our finance organization finance organizations are important to businesses but not commonly thought of as the source of interesting innovations i think all of us would agree that cultures kill whats not like them by definition innovation is something which isnt like me today the thing your culture is best at is killing your next idea the trick is how do you protect it wsj at the end of the day the company the country the university wants payback how do you figure out if youre getting payback ms estrin you can only measure innovation in hindsight you can review it you can ask questions you can make sure people are not just off listening to the radio on their time off so you can engage people in trying to understand what theyre doing but you cant measure innovation in process mr de beer it probably takes about four years at minimum to get from an idea to a successful business wsj but is that the time frame you would apply to it four to five years before you look back mr de beer no i think you can do checkpoints along the way you can ensure youve built a good product and you can get feedback from customers along the way you can look at early market adoption so there are checkpoints but the ultimate measure is looking back after a few years and saying "has this become a successful business "
