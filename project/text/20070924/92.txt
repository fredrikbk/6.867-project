the wall street journal technology innovation awards ahead of the pack among this years winners a hypertension drug a device that pulls drinking water from the air and a service that delivers tv over the web high blood pressure is a killer nearly a billion people around the world and one out of three in the u s suffer from the condition yet no new therapy has been developed in a dozen years until now scientists at switzerlands novartis ag and speedel holding ltd have developed a drug that promises to control hypertension by blocking an enzyme that can trigger it the drug tekturna has been approved by u s and european union regulators tekturna is the gold winner in the wall street journals seventh annual technology innovation awards contest judges from business research and academic organizations chose winners in categories along with overall gold silver and bronze winners and one honorable mention a wall street journal editor screened more than applications narrowing the field to about entries the judges picked the category winners and runners up a technology had to be a breakthrough from traditional methods not just an incremental improvement the silver went to aqua sciences inc miami beach fla which has devised a way to pull drinking water from the air even in the driest parts of the world similar systems work effectively only in places with high humidity the technology uses a blend of salts to collect water then employs a combination of heat chemistry and mechanics to extract the water from the salts aqua sciences has sold systems to the u s army and the federal emergency management agency the bronze went to joost nv luxembourg for a free service that delivers tv programming over the internet unlike youtube and other video sites joost offers full length and full screen programs founders janus friis and niklas zennstroem also developed the skype internet phone service and kazaa file sharing service like kazaa joost uses peer to peer technology for faster more reliable downloads but unlike kazaa which faced charges that it encouraged piracy joost is signing deals with big media companies honorable mention went to electronic learning products inc tampa fla for tune in to reading software that helps students boost their reading skills while seeming to improve their singing students sing into a microphone following along with lyrics on a computer screen the software scores the singer by how much of the performance is on pitch at the same time repeatedly reading the lyrics improves word recognition and sight reading skills here are the winners in the industry categories along with comments from the judges computing systems ncomputing inc redwood city calif won for a low cost method of sharing a personal computer with as many as users people get a box on their desk wired to a central pc with connections for a monitor keyboard and mouse as well as software that shares the processing power and applications of the host pc ncomputing says that of its sales are to the u s k market and that it has signed a deal to provide its system to schoolchildren in macedonia in partnership with chinas haier group energy co winner firefly energy inc peoria ill developed a power supply that replaces the heavy lead plates in typical vehicle batteries with a carbon graphite foam the result is smaller and lighter yet can deliver as much power as more advanced and more costly technologies though its batteries arent yet on the market firefly has signed a deal with swedens husqvarna group to provide batteries for the outdoor equipment makers planned line of electric lawn mowers and lawn tractors and in march firefly received &# million from the u s army to develop a prototype for possible use in combat vehicles the other co winner a group of scientists at los alamos national laboratory led by physicist gregory swift the team used highly compressed sound waves to convert natural gas into a liquid unlike traditional methods which can produce millions of gallons a day this thermoacoustic process produces smaller quantities at a low cost and greater reliability los alamos has licensed the technology to swift lng inc of houston environment abe sher chairman and chief executive launched silver winner aqua sciences in using technology from a team of israeli scientists the water from air system "looks very useful for disaster relief and may be much more practical than transporting water into remote harsh environments " says robert drost an engineer and director at sun microsystems labs materials and other base technologies bill ward chief technology officer of alis corp and nicholas economou president and ceo took top honors for a device that promises a significant improvement over electron microscopes the technology uses helium ions instead of electrons to illuminate atomic level structures producing sharper higher contrast images and making it possible to display ever smaller materials alis of peabody mass sold its first model early last year and has five more in production the company is owned by germanys carl zeiss smt ag media broadcasting bronze winner joosts internet television service launched in may it offers free advertiser supported programming from viacom inc s mtv and vh documentary specials from time warner inc s cnn and classic shows from warner bros television among others compared with other video sites the full screen service "seems a better user experience which potentially could increase the actual take up of this service " says barry jaruzelski vice president and lead marketing officer at booz allen hamilton medical biotech in the early s novartis developed a model of the enzyme that controls the onset of high blood pressure and designed a molecule to block it but making commercial quantities looked too expensive so novartis licensed development of the drug to speedel which found a solution in novartis bought back the drug called tekturna in the u s and rasilez in europe both developers shared the gold novartis says the drug is effective alone or combined with others it also lowers blood pressure for hours compared with for other drugs judges noted that it isnt yet clear that tekturna will prove more effective than existing treatments but "i thought the fact that we had a new approach was really in keeping with what the award is about " says richard lang chairman of the general internal medicine department at ohios cleveland clinic medical devices sequal technologies inc san diego won for portable equipment that provides concentrated oxygen usually patients in long term oxygen therapy must use bulky units that concentrate oxygen from the air or costly portable ones with limited capacity sequals eclipse introduced in june concentrates oxygen but weighs just pounds and runs on a battery that is easily recharged the device "is likely to be a very substantial advance for the two million people with chronic lung disease " says anthony komaroff professor of medicine at harvard medical school and editor in chief of harvard health publications network internet technologies broadband tellme networks inc mountain view calif a unit of microsoft corp stood out with technology that gives cellphone users visual results for directory searches users ask for the listings using voice commands and tellmes service delivers a visual list of the results users can connect directly to the listing get driving directions or a map or forward the listing via a text message network security pgp corp palo alto calif won for its pgp encryption platform a system for managing different computer data encryption programs for instance a company that uses encryption to protect the data on employees laptops could use the system to easily add email or file encryption without the hassles of setting up separate controls the platform introduced in also lets computer departments manage encryption products from other vendors "encryption suffers from being hard to implement and thats probably the no reason its not more broadly deployed " says asheem chandna a partner with venture capital firm greylock partners of san mateo calif "these guys have made it really easy to implement " semiconductors bioident technologies inc of menlo park calif shared the win for its photoniclab which makes it possible to test liquid samples such as contaminated water on the spot without sending them to a lab for analysis bioident employs a process developed by its parent austrias nanoident technologies ag for using an inkjet printer to print microprocessor circuits on any substance the technology enables it to apply photosensitive semiconductors to existing test equipment to make a "lab on a chip " kris kwiatkowski a researcher at los alamos national laboratory also won for a superfast chip that lets cameras capture extremely short lived phenomena such as an explosions shock wave the device developed with researchers from a teledyne technologies inc unit combines a sensitive chip for capturing light radiation and a separate one for storing and processing the light signal software electronic learning products founder carlo franzblau originally set out to sell software that helped people learn to sing as the program was being tested one of the trial users a middle school student discovered that her reading was improving research found that students using the software could improve their reading by more than a full grade level on average the honorable mention product was released in september transport siemens vdo automotive ag a unit of siemens ag won for its electronic wedge brake the system sends electronic signals to the brakes on each wheel and uses the wheels own kinetic energy to help bring them to a stop reducing the amount of force drivers must apply the system promises faster braking times and shorter braking distances developed in it is expected to be in production by the end of the decade mr totty is a news editor for the journal report in san francisco he can be reached at michael totty wsj com
