networking in india rural poor are key to cellular firms expansion heat high costs pose problems for towers mr prices innovations gurgaon india don price got his start in the cellphone industry in the s installing clunky phones in luxury cars in orlando fla today most of his millions of prospective customers dont have cars regular electricity or even running water the year old former navy technician is the director of networks for indias largest cellular company bharti airtel ltd which is trying to blanket this hot mostly poor country with radio towers mr price spends his time directing experiments with cold gel packs and solar panels in an effort to solve a puzzle how to make service cheap enough for the rural poor yet profitable "when you look at cost it is really a challenge " he says cellular providers initially tapped developed markets and when those were saturated big cities and suburbs in the developing world provided easy growth but to expand further cellular companies want to reach hundreds of millions more potential customers who live outside the main population centers almost two billion new subscribers are projected to start using mobile phones in the next five years and of them live in developing world markets according to estimates by swedens telefon ab l m ericsson in india alone more than seven million new cellphone subscribers recently have been signing up each month bringing the total close to million subscribers in a country of billion the economics of that growth get dicey indian cellular companies charge less than two cents a minute among the lowest rates in the world and the average bill is under &# a month compared with about &# in the u s the more that cellular companies penetrate indias rural areas the higher the costs to set up and maintain networks yet rural customers living on an average of less than &# a day tend to spend even less on phone service than their wealthier urban counterparts only companies that can cut costs while expanding their networks can profitably pursue the untapped market india with most of its people living in villages in the countryside has become a laboratory for how to make networks work cheaply in areas where hot climates and unreliable electricity drive up costs as companies figure it out here their successful experiments are being exported to other developing regions including africa and southeast asia the finnish german joint venture nokia siemens networks is testing new small antennae that can be stuck to the roof of a hut to bring service to a tiny village indias essar group is experimenting with liquefied petroleum gas to replace more expensive diesel fuel to run backup generators ericsson and indias idea cellular ltd are jointly testing some unusual alternative fuels they have abandoned the idea of using methane "biogas" generated in pits of cow dung and water and are experimenting with using waste oil from deep fryers at restaurants at bharti mr price says he has trimmed the cost of running its towers by a year since he joined the company in company officials declined to discuss figures but said he had achieved a "healthy reduction " thats made it commercially viable for bharti to add towers in the next six months to the it operates bhartis competitors are also expanding rapidly in the u s companies need far fewer towers because they operate a more effective frequency that in much of india is reserved for the military t mobile u s a inc has towers for instance and verizon wireless only even more bharti towers are on the way "we are trying to get deeper and deeper into india but we have a long way to go " mr price says in an interview at bharti headquarters in a suburb of new delhi "we will have sites by march but a couple hundred thousand is what we need " already bharti is reaching customers whom it didnt consider worth pursuing not long ago in july bharti commissioned one of its newest towers in the sleepy village of madilage about miles south of mumbai to let the villagers know cellular service had arrived bharti staged a traditional dance performance on the back of a truck parked under the new tower about villagers a fifth of the local population gathered to watch the show and learn how cellphones work "incoming calls are totally free " announced the bharti emcee peanut farmer sandeep pati years old is one of the first subscribers in madilage but his investment he says he spends less than &# a month on calls is already paying off he rents out his tractors to other farmers and his cellphone means he can arrange more rentals quickly with less downtime "i can run my business even from the field " says mr pati outside his simple home where his water buffaloes sleep on the ground floor below his bedroom "when i had problems with the tractors before we would just have to leave it where it was for a day now i can call and get it fixed right away " mr price who grew up in portland ore entered the telecommunications business almost by accident after his stint in the navy where he got a crash course in electrical engineering and communications equipment he went to work in his familys import car business in orlando he got hired by mccaw cellular communications to help install car phones then after more training he helped mccaw set up its first towers around orlando and was gradually promoted to help build new networks across the u s after mccaw was sold to at&amp t in mr price stayed with company founder craig mccaws new company mccaw international and built networks in china indonesia and the philippines mr price was back in the u s working as a technical supervisor at mccaw company nextel partners inc since acquired by sprint nextel corp in pensacola fla when bhartis chairman sunil bharti mittal asked him to come to india to be his networks director in mr mittal who now plans to build a big indian retail company with the help of wal mart stores inc had been scouting mr price for years because of his experience setting up networks in developing markets he knew he enjoyed living abroad but he wasnt sure if he was ready for india with its power interruptions and cows roaming the streets mr mittal sent him plane tickets to come to new delhi for a weekend to get a better feel for india and the companys big plans for its cellular business which then had less than a million customers mr price was impressed but says it was the hole arnold palmer signature golf course near bhartis office that convinced him to take the job mr prices arrival in coincided with increasing competition in indias cellular industry as the government eased restrictions on entry into the business newcomers including one of indias largest conglomerates reliance group launched national networks and slashed rates to capture customers at a meeting in a hotel near the taj mahal that year bhartis managers realized they couldnt outspend their new competitors or afford to sell their service at a loss for very long they decided to cut operating costs to try to maintain profit margins even as rates slid rivals also had to look for new ways to cut costs to survive mr price focused on transmission towers the backbone of every cellular network in india they usually stand feet high one tower is needed to provide a signal for an area ranging from three to nine miles in radius depending on the equipment and terrain electrical equipment at the base of the towers needs power as well as air conditioning to operate in indias extreme heat and indias frequent power outages mean the towers need backup generators as well "we had to budget for eight hours a day on generators " says mr price "that was a killer " running them on diesel is expensive and the valuable fuel is often pilfered mr prices managers suggested installing big backup batteries to last through power outages and using stacks of chemical gel cooling packs to replace electric powered air conditioning an indian company acme tele power ltd helped bharti develop both and now is making the parts in china and exporting the technology to sri lanka tanzania indonesia and kenya mr price also persuaded bhartis suppliers to shrink their equipment so it requires less power and is experimenting with solar and wind energy the cost of building and equipping a bharti tower has dropped around to &# while the time the average rural site runs on diesel generators has been slashed to four hours a day from eight mr price says bharti has survived the competition and emerged as indias largest cellular operator by number of subscribers now million and a share of the market in the year ended march earnings jumped to &# billion as its net profit margin rose to from a year earlier its indian rivals are innovating as well essar telecom infrastructure ltd which manages towers for cellular provider vodafone essar ltd and others is building towers with lighter steel and more efficient designs to reduce construction costs its also working on running its towers on liquefied petroleum gas which is cheaper than diesel reliance communications ltd plans its own massive tower rollout this year it is using factories in china to build easy to assemble tower kits for export to india to double its coverage companies in india are also beginning to explore ways to share their infrastructure to cut costs as cellular operators regularly do in developed markets now there are as many as four towers in one spot ericsson also has developed what it calls "expanders" to extend the coverage of each tower antenna by the technology partly developed in india is now being used in nigeria and bangladesh mr price and other executives in the indian cellphone industry say they have been consistently surprised by the pent up demand for phone service in the countrys hinterland often when bhartis new towers go into operation the added capacity is quickly overwhelmed with new users mr price points to the state of bihar one of indias poorest regions where half the population of around million lives below the poverty line as one of bhartis fastest growth areas "in the whole state of bihar we cannot put in the sites fast enough " he says "it is rocking it is just rocking " such success is gratifying for mr price who got a taste for the rough side of expatriate life when he first arrived in india with regular blackouts in his apartment and such persistent stomach problems that he lost pounds he didnt know if he could see out his first two year contract "my best friend was the gastroenterologist " he recalls now mr price spends long weekends every other month on his foot yacht off the coast of thailand he says he has no plans to leave india anytime soon tariq engineer
