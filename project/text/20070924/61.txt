nvidia takes on intel over graphics chips nvidia corp is picking a broader fight with intel corp and vowing to sharply boost the capabilities of low end personal computers the battle focuses on chips that generate graphics on computer screens a key technology for playing games and using some other kinds of software nvidia has the largest sales volume in high end "discrete" graphics chips which typically require a separate circuit board plugged into a pc intel makes the microprocessors considered the electronics brains in pcs but it also has the largest sales of sets of accessory chips that work like the other organs in a system and come with graphics as a built in feature now nvidia is driving into that field announcing such "integrated" graphics to go with intel microprocessors targeting pcs with a mainstream price point of around &# the company had previously only offered such chips to work with microprocessors from advanced micro devices inc "we are entering a much larger market " said david ragones an nvidia product manager the two successful chip makers both based in santa clara calif historically have led separate niches but the picture is changing intel for example last week discussed a future product code named larrabee that is expected to combine special purpose circuitry with or more microprocessors to accelerate tasks that include graphics nvidias mr ragones notes that an increasing number of programs such as microsoft corp s windows vista require sophisticated three dimensional graphics in fact nvidia says of the most popular videogames dont work at all with intel an integrated graphics product called g and another run with performance "issues " intel says nvidia should be comparing its products with a newer intel chip called g that plays all d programs well a product that it expects will top nvidias in performance an nvidia spokeswoman said it focused on intel g because it tends to be used in computers in the &# range josh newman a marketing manager for intel chip sets responded in an email exchange that it is making the g "a very attractive solution for our customers and expect to see the g used in more affordable pc price points in the future " whatever the comparison nvidias graphics expertise and the size of the opportunity suggest its new products should do well said jon peddie an analyst with jon peddie research in tiburon calif besides intel nvidias products will compete with those from amds ati unit via technologies inc and silicon integrated systems corp he said nvidias mr ragones said major makers of motherboards used in pcs have already committed to using its new chips with announcements of support from computer makers expected soon systems based on the technology are expected to be available next month he said
