business solutions making sense of it all new software aims to put corporate data into the hands of decision makers and in a form thats easily understood collecting useful information about a companys business is one thing presenting that information in a way that allows it to be put to the best use is something else entirely thats where new business intelligence tools come in their biggest advantage is that they allow information about a business to be displayed as it becomes available and in a form thats easily understood thats a big step beyond the previous generation of business intelligence software which was limited to churning out periodic detailed reports of a companys or departments past performance the new tools display up to date information in visually appealing charts and graphs that enable users to explore the underlying data in detail with a few clicks in addition to basic graphical displays they employ advanced visualization techniques including animated graphics which can be used to display data changing over time or three dimensional charts that at a glance can reveal underlying patterns in complicated data by making information more accessible these tools make it useful on a daily basis for decision makers throughout a business from executives to call center employees to production workers "business intelligence has become something for all users in the company not just the information workers and business analysts " says cindi howson founder of biscorecard com a site that evaluates business intelligence software "its a tool that all workers need " companies are finding myriad uses for these tools marketers at stubhub inc the ebay inc unit that owns a web site where people can buy and sell event tickets use business intelligence software to help them adjust their campaigns based on whats hot or not at the moment at truck maker freightliner llc a daimlerchrysler ag unit business intelligence software alerts production supervisors if parts shortages emerge or the number of defective parts starts to rise and allows them to track such problems to their sources at dow chemical co the human resources department can use business intelligence software to run simulations of future work force needs based on retention rates retirement rates and recruitment efforts giving people the ability to use these advanced analytical tools "is the difference between rear view management and more forward thinking management " says timothy d rey a manager in dow chemicals data mining and modeling group stubhub began using business intelligence software from frances business objects sa early last year when says rob singer director of business intelligence "we realized that we needed to be more of a data and metrics driven organization " that meant developing a better understanding of stubhubs customers and their ticket trading habits how often they trade where they live and whether they tend to jump in early or buy and sell closer to the event date it also meant getting a better handle on the effectiveness of the companys various marketing efforts including radio and television spots email and search advertising using its business intelligence tool stubhubs marketing department can link information from several sources for instance they can track how many people are clicking on the companys various online ads to get to the site with a few clicks of their own they can then view the transaction history of any customer who comes to the site through a given ad or view the total number of transactions that ad has generated or the total number of tickets offered or requested by people who clicked on that ad the tool also enables the marketers to spot when demand for an event is increasing suddenly so marketing can be adjusted accordingly last summer for instance stubhub marketers noticed that ticket sales and searches on the site for the rock band tool suddenly took off one day the surge in searches attracted attention because it indicated the need to give greater visibility to the band in stubhubs promotions so the company began promoting the band on the sites home page resulting in a big jump in sales of tool tickets "were now able to make marketing decisions on a day to day basis " mr singer says one feature of the new business intelligence software that makes many of these uses possible is the interactive "dashboard" a web page that displays important information in bar pie or fever line charts or as simple red yellow and green buttons indicating the status of something being measured dashboards enable users who might not be skilled with advanced analytical tools not only to see at a glance a wealth of information but also to drill down to the underlying data and to run "what if" scenarios about four years ago freightliner turned to business intelligence software from ottawa based cognos inc when it began using a "balanced scorecard " a common method of assessing a companys activities based on measuring financial sales employee and process performance the tool makes it possible to start with the corporate level scorecard and personalize the views so that individual managers can see their departments goals and how well it is doing in meeting those goals "managers can look at how our business is functioning on a day to day basis " says kelley platt general manager for total business excellence for freightliner in portland ore "its not like i get a canned report once a month " on the dashboard which is accessible on the corporate intranet from any workstation a manager can start with an overview of his or her departments performance for each performance measure a green circle indicates that the department is at or more of its target a yellow triangle means that it is hitting at least of the target and a red square appears when measures fall below most measures are updated daily though for some production lines performance is tracked in real time previously managers had to rely on monthly printed reports which generally appeared after a one month lag now if a manager in charge of a production unit sees the indicator that tracks whether a production line has a sufficient number of parts turn from green to yellow he can click on the display and see exactly what segment of the line is experiencing shortages he can drill down into the charts to identify the cause for instance whether a particular vendor is late on a delivery once the problem is identified he can put a plan for corrective action into the system and create a new series of measures to make sure that its followed "it allows us to give people tools they can actually do something with " ms platt says "all of a sudden it changes your data into information " because business intelligence software typically has tackled big complex problems it has required fairly large and complicated installations on companies computer systems as a result it generally has been limited to big organizations with lots of resources to make business intelligence available to companies with more modest information technology organizations many vendors are making their software available online to be used as needed that means "the technology has changed so that its available to everyone " says ms howson of biscorecard rob meinhardt co founder and chief executive at kace networks inc a provider of appliances for managing corporate computer systems in mountain view calif sees himself as a "metrics driven manager " but until recently pulling together all the information he needs to monitor the performance of his company was a tedious and time consuming process each of his important software systems for accounting for tracking customers among others had its own method of reporting results compiling all that information into a single spreadsheet could take days so he was limited to reviewing performance measures only about once a month since late last year he has been using an online business intelligence tool from lucidera inc based in san mateo calif with the service he says he can run alternate scenarios and perform more ad hoc analysis on trends that werent previously a part of the regular reports the list price for the service is &# a month for up to users for instance mr meinhardt recently wanted to find out how an increase in the number of large customers was affecting the business did the deals take longer to close were the competitors different were the size of the discounts the payment terms and late payments the same as with the companys traditional customers in the past he would have had to gather reports from his accounting and customer management systems and then compile that information into a single account with the business intelligence system he was able to perform the analysis in about minutes "if you look at the historical cost and effort enterprise class business intelligence was too much for a company our size " mr meinhardt says "its very nice to have the tools for the big boys at a price we could afford "
