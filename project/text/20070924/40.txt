how can patients evaluate health care in his prescription for fixing the health care crisis "republicans can win on health care " editorial page sept karl rove uses the language of market derived freedoms e g "putting the patient in charge " this sounds good to those of us who equate buying a car with buying health care services but we all instinctively know that when buying health care patients are either incapable of negotiating a fair price or lack any incentive to do so we just want our illness cured those with insurance dont care about the price those without insurance cant afford it one of mr roves curative measures is to pool risks in order to lower the costs this describes the insurance mechanism which generally works very well unfortunately mr rove apparently chose not to champion this concept when the new medicare prescription drug programs were in development the government is prohibited from using its buying power risk pool to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies mr rove knows that the market thrives on transparency but this doesnt work when purchasing health care unless were a trained medical professional we have no idea what a particular course of treatment or procedure should cost mr roves assertion that "putting information about cost and quality in the hands of patients would lower the cost and improve the quality" is patently wrong and counter to human nature whether i have cancer or need a physical exam i want the very best treatment i can get not the least expensive the notion that a working class single mother who works for the minimum wage will have the wherewithal or time to correctly evaluate competing health care options is preposterous and absurd on its face she is literally at the mercy of the system mr roves penultimate sentence says that people should not "surrender control of their health decisions to government bureaucrats " unfortunately most of us have no real control on surrendering we have to settle for what we can get donald j riggin salem mass
