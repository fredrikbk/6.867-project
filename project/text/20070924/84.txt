the daily fix chargers and bears struggle to remember the good times online edition last season the chicago bears and san diego chargers held the top regular season records in their respective conferences winning a combined of games chicago didnt lose its second game of the season until week san diego lost its second in week then won the next but today both teams are combining for just one fewer loss than all of last season and each is in crisis after falling again on sunday the gnashing of teeth is louder in chicago where quarterback rex grossmans latest statistical stinker three interceptions no touchdowns in a loss to the dallas cowboys has fans and media howling once again for brian griese to take mr grossmans place "i speak for a city in demanding that he not start another game " jay mariotti writes in the chicago sun times about mr grossman "and while lovie smith volunteered his standard refrain after the stinker rex is our quarterback he droned on he also added curiously that a change could come at any position after he watches the horror films "watch closely coach the quarterback stinks i mean still stinks " bears coach lovie smith resisted calls for mr grossmans head throughout last season a stubborn stance that partially paid off the bears advanced to the super bowl but in the title game mr grossman threw two interceptions and lost a fumble in chicagos loss to the indianapolis colts it was logical to stick with grossman then since the bears dominant defense and special teams were propelling the team to victory no need to mess with success this season though "the bears are " rick morrissey writes in the chicago tribune "grossman threw three interceptions folks its time whether griese is the answer is impossible to tell until he gets into the lineup but whats going on now isnt working and hasnt for a long while " as for the chargers the biggest malcontent may be most valuable player ladainian tomlinson who feuded with quarterback philip rivers during their loss to the green bay packers and was ominously tight lipped afterward saying hes going to bite his tongue "for now" but that hes not happy kevin acee reports in the san diego union tribune "in the muted wake of the chargers loss to the green bay packers tomlinsons soft voice conveyed frustrations common among the vanquished visitors " tim sullivan writes in the union tribune "yet his reluctance to elaborate would seem to suggest longer standing concerns it seemed to suggest that the recent espn magazine profile that hinted at tomlinson misgivings about general manager a j smiths administration was not so much creative speculation as informed innuendo " not everyone is so somber however the surprising packers are after their seesaw victory over the chargers "it doesnt get a whole lot better than this " bob mcginn gushes in the milwaukee journal sentinel "with brett favre playing like a man time forgot mike mccarthy making all the right moves and greg jennings reminding everyone what theyve been missing the green bay packers outlasted the san diego chargers on sunday in one of the greatest games played at lambeau field in the last decade " randy moss meanwhile might already be the greatest receiver to ever wear the new england patriots uniform after just three games with the team "this is where cooler heads would offer a reminder to exhibit restraint " jackie macmullan writes in the boston globe after mosss latest masterpiece a yard two touchdown performance in the patriots rout of the buffalo bills "moss is years old and it could be unrealistic to expect him to continue to perform at his current breakneck speed particularly because of the ever present reality of injuries still one has to wonder what the heck former raiders coach art shell was talking about when he insisted mosss legs were shot and his career was in decline we should all be so spent moss appears otherworldly he doesnt run he glides he doesnt jump he propels and is it me or does this guy float when moss is locked in and engaged and playing this kind of team football he is the scariest receiver in patriots history because he can catch almost anything " in baseball the american league west champion los angeles angels of anaheim are back in the postseason for the fourth time in six years and helene elliott of the los angeles times thinks that general manager bill stoneman deserves credit for doing nothing "stoneman didnt make any moves at the trade deadline though the angels appeared to need a big bat to supply the home run power they lacked " ms elliott writes "the eight game division lead they held on june had shrunk to one game two months later but stoneman and scioscia steadfastly believed that with a prod here and a nudge there the angels could pull away and they did regaining their confidence and a comfortable cushion after a three game sweep of the mariners in the waning days of august at seattle " mr stoneman well known for his conservative stewardship of the angels will next have to decide whether to go all out in the bidding for potential new york yankees free agent alex rodriguez which will leitch suggests may already be going on behind the scenes with agent scott boras "the team that observers believe has the best shot is the cubs " mr leitch writes in new york magazine "theyre up for sale but a source with knowledge of the situation says boras knows which group is most likely to be awarded the team thats not loudmouth dallas mavericks owner mark cuban by the way he has no chance the source says boras has already been in touch with that group about the possibility of a contract that could reach &# million a year over the next ten years while deferring a certain portion of money toward an eventual stake in the franchise " mr boras denied the story to the new york daily news the delaware blue hens one of the perennial powers in the football championship subdivision nee division i aa of college football are off to another strong start at but one of delawares alums is disappointed in his school not for its performance on the field but for its refusal to play nearby delaware state which incidentally was the site of a shooting friday "allow me to be blunt " jeff pearlman writes on espn com "the university of delawares persistent refusal to face delaware state university in football is cowardly pig headed self righteous and worst of all oozing with racism unlike the wealthy white as snow university of delaware african american enrollment percent delaware state is a small black college lacking in prestige finances and facilities its stadium holds spectators delawares holds del state is where the scary black people congregate where those types of folk go to college " seattle times baseball writer larry stone offers his top three picks for american league and national league mvp cy young rookie of the year and manager of the year "if theres an award for manager of the half year give the plaque to mike hargrove wherever he is " mr stone writes a reference to mr hargroves stunning resignation as mariners manager near mid season with seattle and on an eight game winning streak this
