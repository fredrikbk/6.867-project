coming soon a new take on the old double bill movie director wes anderson known for such offbeat films as "rushmore" and "the royal tenenbaums " is adding an especially unconventional touch to his latest project before "the darjeeling limited" is released in new york on saturday mr anderson is urging audiences to see another of his films this one a related minute short called "hotel chevalier" that will be released on the internet this week "hotel chevalier" represents a novel approach to generating buzz for "darjeeling " a quirky film from fox searchlight that doesnt have a powerhouse marketing budget the main film is about three brothers played by owen wilson jason schwartzman and adrien brody who take a comic "spiritual journey" through india after their fathers death like mr andersons past films the new picture isnt easily summarized or boiled down to an easy selling point "hotel chevalier " meanwhile is a prequel of sorts that was made a year before "darjeeling" even began filming it takes place entirely in the paris hotel room of mr schwartzmans character and includes information that later becomes relevant in "darjeeling " the short films premiere will be tuesday night at apple stores in new york chicago san francisco and santa monica calif then starting wednesday it will be available as a free download on apple inc s itunes web site before a recent press screening fox searchlight which says it has no financial stake in "chevalier " distributed a statement from mr anderson saying it was his goal to "get every person who goes to "the darjeeling limited" to see the short first " mr anderson may have a hook the short co stars natalie portman who appears in an extended nude scene but whose character makes just a blink and youll miss it cameo in "the darjeeling limited " if that seems like a hollywood bait and switch mr anderson says it wasnt intended that way the use of "hotel chevalier" as a promotional tool he says is an attempt to put one of his creative works to use and stir up intrigue around the main movie as for choosing to release the short separately from the feature he says "i dont know if its a wildly commercial idea and it is probably a little confusing to people who are thinking why is this separate from the movie but the short is just as important to me as the feature is " ms portman for her part says she was insistent that neither her name nor image be used in mainstream marketing for "the darjeeling limited " "im in "chevalier " which you can see on the internet im not really in wess movie " ms portman says "i asked wes to make sure that im not in the previews because i really think its false advertising " but ms portman says shes happy with the short and will promote "hotel chevalier" by appearing with messrs anderson and schwartzman at the apple store screening in new york where they will participate in a q&amp a with the audience afterward much like at a film festival mr andersons experiment could become more frequent in the coming years as "a certain caliber of filmmaker who has access to talent and some equipment can have a great idea for a film and get the ball rolling on their own without having to go through the traditional studio process " says scott roesch vice president and general manager of atomfilms which distributes digital short films atomfilms is a unit of viacom inc s mtv networks and isnt involved with mr andersons projects "the short is creating a lot of buzz so its hard to see how that doesnt help the film and has got to be a little bit of a marketers dream for fox " fox searchlight is owned by news corp which has agreed to buy dow jones &amp co the publisher of the wall street journal for more than &# billion the story of the two films begins in when mr anderson approached ms portman and mr schwartzman to do "chevalier" as a stand alone short film but shortly before he began filming mr anderson realized mr schwartzmans character would fit perfectly in a feature film he was conceptualizing at the time which ultimately became "the darjeeling limited " he had been finished with "chevalier" for about a year when filming began for the indian movie "i shot chevalier in days and edited it in about a week on my computer " says mr anderson "i had one copy of chevalier on dvd and id show it to people on my laptop that entire year " says mr anderson he says that he financed "chevalier" entirely out of his own pocket he considered filming two additional shorts to fill in background on the other main characters and at one point considered opening the movie with the "chevalier" sequence he scotched that idea in favor of keeping the films separate but did write in a small role for ms portman "wes told me that it wasnt really going to be the first scene in the movie but rather a short on its own thats almost like a prequel to the movie " she says "he asked me come do a cameo in india and it sounded nice and weird and like an unusual way to do things " so the actress says she traveled to the films location in jodhpur india to shoot for about half an hour and then spent days exploring india afterward while viewing "chevalier" before seeing "darjeeling" isnt necessary to understand whats happening in the latter "chevalier" effectively adds a layer of detail to the features plot "you sort of have to see the short in order to get everything thats in "darjeeling " says mr anderson in that sense he is hoping moviegoers will want to flesh out the story on their own "my ideal thing would be to have the audience member come over to my apartment and watch the short on my computer and the next day theyd watch the movie in the theater " he says
