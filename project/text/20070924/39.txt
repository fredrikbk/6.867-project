hard case job market wanes for a law degree isnt necessarily a license to print money these days for graduates of elite law schools prospects have never been better big law firms this year boosted their starting salaries to as high as &# but the majority of law school graduates are suffering from a supply and demand imbalance thats suppressing pay and job growth the result graduates who dont score at the top of their class are struggling to find well paying jobs to make payments on law school debts that can exceed &# some are taking temporary contract work reviewing documents for as little as &# an hour without benefits and many are blaming their law schools for failing to warn them about the dark side of the job market the law degree that scott bullock gained in from seton hall university where he says he ranked in the top third of his class is a "waste " he says some former high school friends are earning considerably more as plumbers and electricians than the &# a year mr bullock is making as a personal injury attorney in manhattan to boot he is paying off &# in law school debt "unfortunately some find the practice of law is not for them " seton halls associate dean kathleen boozang said through a spokeswoman "however it is our experience that a legal education is a tremendous asset for a variety of professional paths " a slack in demand appears to be part of the problem the legal sector after more than tripling in inflation adjusted growth between and has grown at an average annual inflation adjusted rate of since or less than half as fast as the broader economy according to commerce department data some practice areas have declined in recent years personal injury and medical malpractice cases have been undercut by state laws limiting class action suits out of state plaintiffs and payouts on damages securities class action litigation has declined in part because of a buoyant stock market on the supply end more lawyers are entering the work force thanks in part to the accreditation of new law schools and an influx of applicants after the dot com implosion earlier this decade in the academic year juris doctor degrees were awarded up from for according to the american bar association universities are starting up more law schools in part for prestige but also because they are money makers costs are low compared with other graduate schools and classrooms can be large since the number of aba accredited schools increased by to evidence of a squeezed market among the majority of private lawyers in the u s who work as sole practitioners or at small firms is growing a survey of about chicago lawyers published in the book "urban lawyers" found that between and the inflation adjusted average income of the top of earners generally big firm lawyers grew by while income for the other actually dropped according to the internal revenue service the inflation adjusted average income of sole practitioners has been flat since the mid s a recent survey showed that out of nearly lawyers at firms of lawyers or fewer in indiana wages for the majority only kept pace with inflation or dropped in real terms over the past five years the news isnt any better for the of new lawyers who go into government or join public interest firms inflation adjusted starting salaries for graduates who go to work for public interest firms or the government rose and respectively between and according to the national association for law placement which aggregates graduate surveys from law schools that compares with at least an jump in the median family income during the same period according to the census bureau graduates who become in house company lawyers about have fared better their salaries rose by nearly during the same period many students "simply cannot earn enough income after graduation to support the debt they incur " wrote richard matasar dean of new york law school in concluding that "we may be reaching the end of a golden era for law schools " meanwhile the prospects for big firm lawyers are growing richer while offering robust minimum salaries those firms are paying astronomical amounts to their stars now debate is intensifying among law school academics over the integrity of law schools marketing campaigns defenders argue that the legal profession always has been openly and proudly a meritocracy top entrance exam scores help win admittance to top schools where top students win jobs at top firms even the system that is used to issue law school grades a curve that pits student against student reflects the law professions competitiveness david burcham dean of loyola law school in los angeles considered second tier says the school makes no guarantees to students that they will obtain jobs he says it is problematic that big firms only interview the top of the class "but thats the nature of the employment market its never been different " for the majority of students and alumni he says loyola "turned out to be a good investment " yet economic data suggest that prospects have grown bleaker for all but the top students and now a number of law school professors are calling for the distribution of more accurate employment information incoming students are "mesmerized by whats happening in big firms but clueless about whats going on in the bottom half of the profession " says richard sander a law professor at the university of california los angeles who has studied the legal job market "prospective students need solid comparative data on employment outcomes but very few law schools provide such data " adds andrew morriss a law professor at the university of illinois who has studied the market for new lawyers students entering law school have little way of knowing how tight a job market they might face the only employment data that many prospective students see comes from school promoted surveys that provide a far from complete portrait of graduate experiences tulane university for example reported to u s news &amp world report magazine which publishes widely watched annual law school rankings that its law school graduates entering the job market in had a median salary of &# but that is based on a survey that only of that years graduates completed and those who did so likely represent the cream of the class a tulane official concedes on its web site the school currently reports an average starting salary of &# for graduates in private practice but doesnt include what percentage of graduates reported salaries for the survey "its within most individuals nature to keep that information private unless its a high amount " says carlos davila caballero assistant dean for career development at tulane who adds that his office tells prospective students to use the median figure as a guide because starting salaries vary widely academics who have studied new lawyer salaries say that the graduate surveys of many law schools are skewed by higher response rates from the most successful students the national association for law placement which aggregates and publishes national data based on those surveys concedes that it cant vouch for their accuracy "we cant validate the figures we have to rely on schools to report to us accurately " says judy collins nalps director of research a prospective student studying nalp data might conclude that the study of law is a sure path to financial security for graduates who entered private practice or nearly nalp shows a national median salary of &# a rise of adjusted for inflation from graduates the nalp data also show that the percentage of graduates employed in private practice has been steady fluctuating between and for more than a decade but in law schools self published employment data "private practice" doesnt necessarily mean jobs that improve long term career prospects for that category can include lawyers working under contract without benefits such as israel meth a graduate of brooklyn law school he earns about &# an hour as a contract attorney reviewing legal documents for big firms he says he uses of his paycheck to pay off student loans &# for law school on top of &# for the bachelors degree he received from columbia university a glossy admissions brochure for brooklyn law school considered second tier reports a median salary for recent graduates at law firms of well above &# but that figure doesnt reflect all incomes of graduates at firms fewer than half of graduates at firms responded to the survey the school reported to u s news on its web site the school reports that of last years graduates work for firms of more than lawyers but it fails to mention that that percentage includes temporary attorneys often working for hourly wages without benefits joan king director of the schools career center concedes ms king says she believes the figures for her school accurately represent the broader graduating class she says the number of contract attorneys is "minimal" but declined to give a number the university of richmond school of law in the last couple of years started to be more open about its employment statistics it now breaks out how many of its grads work as contract attorneys of graduates working in private practice for example seven were contract employees nine months after graduation schools "should be sharing more information than they are now " says joshua burstein associate dean for career services who put the changes in place "most people graduating from law school " he says "are not going to be earning big salaries " adding to the burden for young lawyers tuition growth at law schools has almost tripled the rate of inflation over the past years leading to higher debt for students and making starting salaries for most graduates less manageable especially in expensive cities graduates in of public and private law schools had borrowed an average of &# and &# up and respectively from the amount borrowed by graduates according to the american bar association students taking on such debt may feel reassured by incessant press reports of big firms scrambling to hire and keep associates making headlines this year was a bump up in big firm starting salaries to &# from &# in many cities and indeed some law graduates of lower tier schools do find high paying private practice law jobs in recent years big firms have boomed thanks in part to the globalization of business and wall street deal making firms have been casting a wider net for new lawyers though they still generally restrict their recruiting at lower tier schools to students at the very top of the class or on the law review some students have leads on a job at a family members or friends practice but just as common and much less publicized are experiences such as that of sue clark who this year received her degree from second tier chicago kent college of law one of six law schools in the chicago area despite graduating near the top half of her class she has been unable to find a job and is doing temp work "essentially as a paralegal " she says "a lot of people including myself feel frustrated about the lack of jobs " she says harold krent chicago kents dean said its not uncommon for new lawyers to wait a few months to more than a year to find a job thats a good fit he added that there is a "small spike" in employment after his schools grads receive their bar exam results several months after graduation because some firms wait until then before hiring the market is particularly tough in big cities that boast numerous law schools mike altmann a graduate of new york university who went to brooklyn law school says he accumulated &# in student loan debt and graduated in with no meaningful employment opportunities one offer was a &# job with no benefits so mr altmann became a contract attorney reviewing electronic documents for big firms for around &# to &# an hour and hasnt been able to find higher paying work since some un or underemployed grads are seeking consolation online where blogs and discussion boards have created venues for shared commiseration that didnt exist before an anonymous writer called loyola l purportedly a student at loyola law school who claims the school wasnt straight about employment prospects has been beating a drum of discontent around the web in the past year thats sparked thousands of responses and a fan base "l" stands for second year law student some thank "ll" for articulating their plight others claim ll should complain less and work more loyolas dean burcham says he wishes he knew who the student was so he could help the person "its expensive to go to law school and there are times when you second guess yourself as a student " he says some new lawyers try to hang their own shingle matthew fox curl graduated in from second tier university of houston in the bottom quarter of his class after months of job hunting he took his first job working for a sole practitioner focused on personal injury in the houston area and made &# in his first year he quickly found that tort reform legislation has been "brutal" to texas plaintiffs lawyers and last year left the firm to open up his own criminal defense private practice hes making less money than at his last job and has thought about moving back to his parents house "i didnt think three years out id be uninsured thinking its a great day when a crackhead brings me &# " mark whitehouse contributed to this article
