business day sign up for the e mail here autumn is officially here and with it the united nations general debate and what has become an annual media contest between president bush and his iranian counterpart mahmoud ahmadinejad also on tap are rival u n and u s conferences on climate change and rhetoric but little sign of progress for the perennial effort to bring peace to the middle east a telling sub heading in the u n s announcement about its climate meeting promises "action not business as usual " secretary general ban ki moon on the eve of presiding over the first debate of world leaders on his watch has convened more than heads of state or government to attend the one day conference aimed at building momentum for climate talks set for december in bali one conspicuous absence will be mr bush who is skipping the days discussions and will focus instead on the gathering he will convene later this week in washington "mr bushs aides say that the parallel meeting does not compete against the united nations process hijacking it as his critics charge " as the new york times reports "they say that mr bush hopes to persuade the nations that produce of the worlds emissions to come to a consensus" that would allow the u s and others to set their own limits but that sets the stage for more international confrontation on the issue and the prospect of the u s again aligned against most of its global partners as washington was regarding the kyoto protocol mr bush has agreed to attend the conferences dinner tonight after much cajoling by mr ban the washington post reports though an impatient mr bush made clear he wouldnt accept anything that restrains u s industry he finally agreed to dine with other leaders who might want to telling the u n leader "ill be there ill be there " as mr ban recounts the conversation to the post since taking office in january mr ban "has demonstrated a rare ability to nudge the white house" on issues that include u s funds for u n peacekeeping and climate change and in turn mr ban has opposed calls for "a swift u s withdrawal from iraq " the post notes and this mutually beneficial relationship and closeness to washington has made some u n member states uneasy the post adds as with climate change "momentum" was the word being cited by participants in weekend talks aimed at reviving mideast peace efforts as the bbc reports the so called quartet the u s russia the european union and the u n emphasized progress they made for a conference bringing palestinians and israelis together later this fall but there has been no progress made toward bringing the nominally elected hamas movement now somewhat confined to a gaza it governs into the process and the roster of attendees may make the effectiveness of the conference appear precarious ahead of time secretary of state condoleezza rice yesterday indicated that syria would be invited acknowledging as the times puts it that the "road to peace between arabs and israelis cannot bypass damascus " but just earlier this month the airspace over such a road was rent by israeli war planes that are widely reported to have targeted some kind of suspected nuclear materials involved in an alleged syrian north korean partnership the incident has generated enormous uncertainty asked about it by newsweek international atomic energy agency chief mohamad elbaradei replied "we have zilch on that " and arab diplomats remain skeptical that u s efforts can accomplish much in promoting israeli palestinian peace after what critics regard as six years of relative neglect al jazeera points out meanwhile mr ahmadinejad who in the words of the los angeles times "has transcended national and religious divides to become a folk hero across the middle east " has been stealing the pre summit spotlight his plans to speak at columbia university a request to visit ground zero refused by the city and his vocal role in the nuclear standoff thats one of the key issues of u s politics and policy have generated headlines as much as any u n event this week and capped what the wall street journal calls his rise " from obscurity to the rank of americas archnemesis " fukuda set to take japans reins one head of government who will miss all the meetings this year at the u n is shinzo abe who still serves as prime minister of japan looking gaunt and speaking in a scratchy voice as the associated press describes him mr abe today told a news conference at his tokyo hospital that it was poor health that made him resign mr abes liberal democratic party yesterday elected as its new leader the party veteran and former cabinet member yasuo fukuda as the nikkei reports since the ldp still controls the lower house of parliament that means mr fukuda is set to be chosen as prime minister as early as tomorrow he faces "one of the toughest situations for a japanese leader with an empowered opposition and an urgent need of his own party to win back popularity " the wall street journal notes and "one of mr fukudas first tasks will be to find a way to extend a law that has enabled the japanese military to aid the u s led allied forces with refueling operations in the indian ocean " something the opposition democratic party of japan has adamantly opposed uaw threatens to strike the united auto workers union has had enough talking with its key negotiating partner general motors and last night told its members that if a deal isnt reached by a m et today the union will call a strike "nine days have passed since the uaws contract with gm expired and though the two sides have been negotiating every day since they have been unable to agree on a deal " the detroit news notes still as the wall street journal notes the uaw has a history of setting strike deadlines to put pressure on the auto companies and uaw president ron gettelfinger has made th hour proposals to sweeten contract deals in the past moreover the journal says "people familiar with the situation indicated that a framework for dealing with the main issue of retiree health care was in place and that bargaining yesterday had shifted to other issues" including the size of "a cash bonus gm will give active workers in exchange for ratifying a deal " shaking up the landesbanken germanys traditional public sector banks may be due for a shake up under pressure from an increasingly

the market to compensate for falling earnings amid the loss of state guarantees two years ago " microsoft tries to sabotage google double click microsoft has been quietly mounting a public relations campaign aimed at scuttling googles planned &# billion purchase of online advertising firm doubleclick by convincing other internet players advertisers and regulators to oppose it the wall street

pantomime personified and master of an art that had little use for the usual high brow low brow boundaries or distinctions of age and obviously language inspired by charlie chaplin mr marceaus physical repertoire spanned the gamut of genre and character from his iconic "walking against the wind" routine to "youth maturity old age and death" the latter described by the new york times as a four minute depiction of "the joy and pathos of life" so succinct and dramatic it rivaled what novelists can do in hundreds of pages more praised abroad than he was in his native france mr marceau it seems safe to say was the best known silent performer in a media age that had evolved far beyond "talkies " was there any greater confirmation of mel brookss particular genius than that the only word
