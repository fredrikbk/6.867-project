arctic becomes tourism hot spot but is that cool interest in global warming is now a selling point seeing glaciers calve disko bay greenland james brusslan is an environmental lawyer with climate change on his mind he cycles to the office and works at a chicago law firm that offsets its carbon emissions he plasters friends suvs with stickers that say "im changing the climate ask me how " to get a first hand glimpse of such changes mr brusslan years old recently spent &# on a weeks camping trip here about miles north of the arctic circle "i wanted to see what was happening " he said as he gazed at an ice fiord where a glacier was splintering into icebergs "in years it probably will be gone " he next plans to see the melting glaciers of sichuan china global warming has given rise to a new niche in the booming eco tourism business climate tourists these visitors seek out places where a long term warming trend subject of a global summit hosted by the united nations this week is starting to have a discernible impact yet some say theres a big irony in this kind of travel any trip by train plane or cruise ship pumps carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and potentially contributes to the warming of the planet "whats the point of your trip to the maldives if the end result is that it will be drowned" because emissions from eco tourists jets contribute to global warming and rising seas says jeff gazzard of aviation environmental federation a united kingdom group fighting to curtail airplane emissions the maldives a string of islands in the indian ocean sit about three feet above sea level and are at risk if warming effects raise ocean levels more than million tourists now visit the arctic each year up from one million in the early s according to the u n longer and warmer summers keep arctic seas freer of ice flows so cruise ships can visit places that were once inaccessible raising other environmental concerns some tourists to norways svalbard archipelago in the arctic hope to catch sight of new islands that have appeared as the ice sheet retreats "theyre just rocks " scoffs rune bergstroem head of the environment department at the governor of svalbards office that didnt stop a recent visitor from england from trying to claim one such island going ashore and writing his bid on a baked bean can it was rejected the annual number of visitors to svalbard has surged in the past five years to about about half arrive on cruise liners with so many more passengers going ashore fragile vegetation on some islands has gotten worn down theres a higher risk of an oil spill a new law requires ships on the eastern part of the islands to use marine diesel instead of heavy oil local wildlife is under threat and not just from direct climate change "regions with polar bears were hard to access but boats can now get there because the sea ice melts " says mr bergstroem "there could be more conflicts between people and bears " still global warming can be a persuasive sales pitch this month betchart expeditions inc of cupertino calif offers a day voyage to "warming island" near greenland melting ice has revealed the long buried island "a compelling indicator of the rapid speed of global warming " says betcharts web site the cost between &# and &# not including flights so far people have signed up earthwatch institute a nonprofit in maynard mass runs trips that allow people to help scientists studying coral reefs in the bahamas and the effects of climate change on orchids in india its day trip "climate change at the arctics edge" priced between &# and &# not including flights involves going to manitoba canada to monitor carbon stores in the permafrost hansruedi burgener didnt seek out climate tourists they found him last summer hundreds trekked to his remote hostel cum restaurant in the swiss alps because it has a clear view of a mountain called the eiger noting that a warming trend had accelerated melting of glacial ice geologists predicted part of the mountain would soon collapse to mark the event mr burgener introduced a coffee and schnapps concoction called a "rockslide " in july about a half million cubic meters of the eiger the volume of a small skyscraper plunged into the valley no one was hurt but dust from the impact blanketed the nearby resort of grindelwald tourists still go there to see where the rock fall occurred "i dont think climate change is good for the environment " says mr burgener "but its made the hostel famous and thats good for me " there are some efforts to keep the trend from heating up the international ecotourism society based in washington d c launched a campaign called "traveling with climate in mind" to help people "minimize their environmental footprint" through better use of energy and offsetting emissions in march the airline sas started a program that allows passengers to pay a fee up to euros for a european flight to offset their flight related emissions the money is spent on a renewable energy project but though the airline carries more than four million passengers a month it has registered only about transactions so far "its low were disappointed " says neils ierek nertun environmental director for sas per stuhaug a year old consultant for international business machines corp in copenhagen took a recent sas flight to visit greenlands vast inland ice sheet he said he was "interested in seeing any changes since my last visit " a camping trip but he dismissed the airlines carbon offset program as a marketing gimmick and didnt pay the fee though they are hardly the main contributor to global warming tourists interested in climate change recognize a dilemma "i have a curiosity about these places but going there to see them causes more damage " says anne patrick a massachusetts schoolteacher who has visited antarctica and greenland "how do you come to grips with that i dont have an answer " most visitors to greenland head to the town of ilulissat a settlement of brightly painted houses with a breathtaking view of icebergs scientists speculate that the iceberg that sank the titanic originated here ilulissat has become a poster child for global warming january temperatures used to routinely hit minus degrees fahrenheit but now rarely fall below minus fahrenheit the nearest glacier jacobshavn has retreated more than nine miles since the bay no longer freezes so fishermen catch halibut all year long depleting stocks says konrad seblon district manager of a provincial agency charged with developing tourism this year the town has hosted nancy pelosi speaker of the u s house of representatives barbara boxer u s senator from california and the president of the european union up to tourists are expected too compared with some five years ago the towns population is people and a lot more sled dogs "tourists are welcome but we dont want too many and we dont want big hotels " says anthon frederiksen ilulissats mayor "wed like to preserve nature and our culture " many visitors shell out &# for a trip to a glacier called eqi when eqi reaches the sea large pieces "calve " or break off becoming icebergs one recent afternoon a boat filled with tourists drew near eqis foot tall ice face suddenly a chunk the size of a small house plunged into the waters unleashing a foot swell the wave slammed into the boat rocking it hard "that was exciting " said ingeborg mathiesen a year old norwegian as she gripped the guard rails "ive never seen anything like it " the day before a similar wave in svalbard pounded a sightseeing boat and injured british tourists next summer ms mathiesen plans to visit svalbard to see icebergs and polar bears says her husband erich "we dont want to wait five years when they may be gone " see related
