best way to save analyze why talent is going out the door few things trouble executives more than watching outstanding talent walk out the door in burgeoning industries such as technology the most creative minds never lack for job offers turnover also is common after changes in the corner office or down the ranks or when a company is acquired even a small flight of out of the box thinkers or managers who prompt the best work from employees can take considerable time and expense to replace some executives try to stop exiting high performers with offers of more pay or promotions but others react defensively telling themselves that whoever is leaving wasnt a big loss "its psychologically threatening to those who are staying to acknowledge theres a reason some people are leaving so executives often dismiss them as untalented or even deny that an exodus is occurring " says gurnek bains chief executive of ysc a london based corporate psychology consultant at one big financial services company he worked with executives insisted turnover was low when in fact of the hundreds of new employees the company had recruited quit within two years many veterans left as well the reason the company was undergoing changes that top executives "didnt sell well to employees " says mr bains instead of asking employees to help "they said everything theyd done in the past was rubbish and stirred a lot of insecurity " rather than deny a talent bleed executives should carefully analyze why it is happening carl bass ceo of software maker autodesk has found that employees are most likely to accept offers elsewhere if they dont think they are being challenged to grow most frequently they leave if they dont get along with their boss "thats a more powerful factor than what an employee feels about the overall company " he says "its like marriage where you may live in a nice house but if your spouse isnt the right one what your house looks like doesnt matter much " mr bass tries to anticipate what employees need and want before competitors come and woo them away he asked one of his most capable employees in his early s to run a start up unit "you have to catch talent and make sure they get opportunities before theyre already at the door " he says autodesk says its annual employee attrition rate is in the single digits and less than half the rate of a typical technology company larry mcclure liz claibornes senior vice president of human resources tries to create jobs with growth potential for the companys gifted employees instead of waiting for openings to occur on the organizational chart "you cant be a slave to your structure and tell a very talented director he cant be promoted to the next rung until a vice president leaves " says mr mcclure he tries to craft stretch assignments for his best employees that may not have existed before but fill a current need he urges employees to get out of their comfort zone and raise their hands for jobs in unfamiliar areas he has encouraged some sales managers to spend time in operations where they can learn about product flow delivery and other technical issues the stint broadens their experience so theyre qualified to become general managers "at any given point your highest potential people will get a phone call from another employer and if you havent kept giving them challenging assignments its shame on you when they take what they learned with you elsewhere " he says he jumped from a job in aerospace to financial services and then specialty chemicals before joining liz claiborne and understands why ambitious managers who feel stalled are apt to head for the door by analyzing who is leaving companies also can determine if they have difficulty retaining women minorities young people or other groups and try to address the reasons why salaries that lag behind the norm leave talent open to even modest offers numerous companies such as united parcel service lehman bros and deloitte touche have launched mentoring and management development programs for diverse employees in recent years to stem attrition the best retention scores belong to executives who can empathize with employees hopes as well as their gripes dawson rutter of commonwealth worldwide a boston based limousine service started out as a cab driver and remembers how disconnected and unvalued he felt "being by myself all day and getting no feedback " as he expanded his business to employees he offered training benefits and higher pay and rewarded veteran drivers with more lucrative routes in an industry where turnover is steep many of his drivers have or more years at his company although employees on exit interviews often cite pay as a main reason theyre moving on theyre often more influenced by what colleagues are doing "if someones best friend is leaving he or she is more likely to leave too " says jim harter of the gallup organization "especially if their interchanges become "gripe sessions
