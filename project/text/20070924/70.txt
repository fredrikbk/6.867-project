politics &amp economics romney tries to show voters he gets it republican reframes democrat owned issues in reach for the middle mitt romney opportunistic flip flopper or the rare republican who "gets it" at a time when his party is losing favor with the general public in the battle to define his presidential candidacy the former massachusetts governor is trying to swat away charges that he has changed positions on hot button issues such as abortion immigration gun ownership and gay rights to appeal to his partys conservative base yet even as he tries to distance himself from his moderate record mr romney also embraces it to reach voters in the middle both republicans uncomfortable with the direction of the party and independent voters he would need in a general election the result is that mr romneys stump speech can sound at times part rush limbaugh part bill clinton braiding red meat conservative lines with feel your pain prescriptions for health care and retirement security "theres a lot of people who say health cares a democrat issue " mr romney said at a recent campaign stop in greenville s c "well baloney " the backdrop to mr romneys appeal is a dramatic shift in public opinion since president bushs re election away from the republican party and toward an issue set that has traditionally benefited democrats a wall street journal nbc poll this month found that of respondents viewed the republican party negatively one of the worst scores since the poll began in the poll showed health care second only to the iraq war as a concern in voters minds more broadly surveys show economic insecurity ranking with national security as a top worry for americans "one of the reasons were gaining some traction is people are saying we need a republican party that gets it " said tom rath an adviser to mr romney and an influential republican in new hampshire one of the early nominating states where mr romney has a lead in polls poor education or health care "are things that can cut against the strength of a family or economy " mr rath said and so mr romney calls for a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage and for developing renewable energy and improving schools he quotes ronald reagans famous put down "its not that liberals and democrats are ignorant its just that what they know is wrong " but he also touts bipartisanship mr romney has so far mainly gotten attention for his efforts to sell himself as a more reliable conservative than front runner rudy giuliani who supports abortion rights and other socially liberal positions in that quest the former massachusetts governor has renounced his previous support for abortion rights and embryonic stem cell research he talks much tougher now about immigration and against gay rights than he did as leader of the democratic leaning state in terms of image the buttoned down former venture capitalist has a hard time competing with the folksy fred thompson an actor and former senator from tennessee with high name recognition who ranks second in most national polls behind mr giuliani where the wonkish mr romney can shine however is by offering a more compelling platform than mr thompson that is what makes mr romney interesting his unique blend of issues seems to most closely reflect of all the republican presidential candidates the economic disquiet among voters mr giuliani speaks mainly to fears of terrorist attacks mr romney can talk more to fears of a bankrupting doctors bill while governor of massachusetts mr romney signed a bipartisan law in requiring employers and individuals to obtain health insurance such government imposed mandates trouble many conservatives mr romney gets around that problem by saying as president he would let each state craft its own program and give them flexibility to use federal funds as they saw fit in a typical pirouette he uses the health insurance issue both to denounce democrats and embrace bipartisanship "a lot of these democrats wanted to raise taxes i said no way " he told a crowd gathered at a cafe in rural newberry s c recently but when it came time to hold the signing ceremony for the health insurance law "ted kennedy hes there too " mr romney says of the liberal massachusetts senator and conservative whipping boy "can you believe it " the bottom line mr romney said "we actually found some common ground "
