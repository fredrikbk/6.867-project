the evening wrap live from new york online edition iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad kept punching his critics buttons in media appearances preceding his big speech at the united nations tomorrow but not without feeling a blow or two himself his high profile day culminated at new yorks columbia university on monday afternoon where he took the stage and fielded questions on his views on israel the holocaust terrorist ties and growing tensions with the u s those and other hot button issues brought protesters to both the u n and columbias campus but before he began speaking on the topics mr ahmadinejad weathered a introduction from columbia president lee bollinger that was startlingly frank he decried mr ahmadinejad human rights record saying "mr president you exhibit all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator " the audience clapped loudly in approval once behind the podium mr ahmadinejad accused mr bollinger of caving into a hostile u s press and political climate and scolded him saying "i should not begin by being affected by this unfriendly treatment " following the opening fireworks mr ahmadinejads speech didnt break much new ground at times he appeared to backtrack slightly from previous statements about the holocaust which he has called a "myth " but he also maintained that he was defending the rights of european scholars to conduct "research" on the topic an apparent reference to a small number who have been prosecuted under some european national laws that govern holocaust denial on perhaps the most crucial pressure point involving iran and the u s at the moment irans development of nuclear technology mr ahmadinejad dismissed suggestions that iran should let others develop nuclear technology on its behalf "some big powers create a monopoly over science and prevent other nations in achieving scientific development " he said the appearance at columbia was perhaps the most heated for mr ahmadinejad in a media heavy day earlier he had defended irans human rights record during an address at the national press club and in an interview with the associated press he said that iran wouldnt attack israel or any other country adding that he doesnt believe the u s is preparing for war suzanne maloney a foreign policy fellow at the brookings institution said mr ahmadinejads seemingly softer tone on israel may reflect some pushback against him at home "theres been widespread commentary in iran even on the far right that mr ahmadinejads position on israel has hurt the countrys diplomatic relations " said ms maloney "the fact that he was frankly unwilling to go as far as he has in the past suggests there may have been some consequences for him at home " president bush said that the iranian presidents appearance at columbia "speaks volumes about really the greatness of america " stocks slump ahead of tomorrows housing news home builder stocks sagged along with the broader market as investors braced for earnings from lennar tomorrow the
