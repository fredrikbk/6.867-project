foreign exchange funds get rattled the euros breach of the &# mark versus the u s currency last week could perk up investor interest in foreign exchange trade but early returns from some expert traders last month show how difficult it can be to assess the foreign exchange markets direction and how quickly the winds can shift currency funds in europe as elsewhere suffered a knock in last months rapid and volatile unwinding of key foreign exchange trades according to early data from some big indexes and managers are urging investors not to abandon the funds it will still be several weeks before the full scale of the industrys performance in august becomes apparent because some benchmark indexes arent ready for release already deutsche bank ags database of currency funds performance shows that more than two thirds of the funds it tracks posted losses last month leaving the average return down nearly an index run out of london by mercer investment consulting inc shows even greater losses mercers index which tracks between and top funds fell last month the long established parker fx index of returns from currency funds will be watched when its august data are released in the next two weeks or so in past years it showed that currency funds made double digit returns but performance has been weaker recently and last months tumult is likely to have eroded returns further last month alone saw records in currency trading volumes and a drop in the high yielding new zealand dollar against the yen in just one day the euro too was up and down as investors tried to gauge the many factors that affect currency moves now with foreign exchange markets still volatile as the global economy recalibrates its growth expectations currency funds may face a period of wariness among investors over their returns "what happened in august has certainly tarnished currency funds and polluted the outlook " said neil meadows who runs the fixed income and macroeconomic investments at fund of hedge funds manager newfinance capital llp in london mr meadows said he currently makes only small allocations to currency only funds because the factors behind currency moves are so difficult to define and predict that is unlikely to change after recent performance and with a potentially tough outlook "the question is what happens now " he said "do the markets normalize or do the increase in the oil price and the banking crisis and the problems in the u s housing market mean that the world is a very different place now if it is and if the markets are choppy from here that means conditions will be difficult for currency funds " the key problem as risky assets slumped last month was that two big groups of currency traders trend followers and investors in high yield currencies got hit at once exposing how crowded some key trades in foreign exchange had become for instance the popular "carry trade" in which investors borrow a low yielding currency like the japanese yen to invest in assets of a higher yielding currency like the euro or the australian and new zealand dollars unwound and rewound at various times last month taking investors along for a stomach churning ride this occurred after a long stretch in which the carry trade was as safe a bet as any in the currency trading realm "investors often say to us that they like the idea of currencies but that the numbers dont go back far enough to show how currency funds perform in a crisis now we have seen that and its far from a disaster " said torquil wheatley a director at deutsche bank in london where he works on the firms database of currency funds "no one is backing away from the fx market at this point " said mr wheatley using the industry parlance for foreign exchange "people still feel relatively comfortable with the performance of an index like mercers its down in one of the most difficult months for years and you just cant say thats a disaster for the year youre still up on a total returns basis " nonetheless some funds are reporting significant losses deutsche bank doesnt make the names of the funds in its database publicly available but one lost nearly and six lost more than funds with a computer model driven trading style tended to suffer more than those with human traders making discretionary decisions about when to get in and out of trades richard olsen who runs &# million in computer based currency funds at olsen invest in zurich said one of his programs was overwhelmed by volatility and lost wiping out the years gains but he is increasing his models tolerance for volatility and urging investors to stick with his quantitative style "when you have a drawdown people say you shouldnt be in these strategies and some of our investors did pull their funds but the factors driving currencies are too complex for human traders the right approach is quantitative " he said there were some winners from augusts frantic trading too keith presbury who runs a fund at rhicon currency management in london said his returns climbed thanks to opportune bets that the carry trade selloff would reverse toward the end of the month now mr presbury is confident that there is more volatility to come for the currency markets which will throw up more opportunities to make money "a lot of the damage has been done so we may not see the carnage of mid august again but theres still some unwinding to come " he said "we feel fairly positive about the market " mr presbury said that now the trick for investors keen to avoid too many highs and lows from currency funds is to spread their exposure "people look at recent performance and say that you shouldnt be in fx " he said "i think you do want to be in fx but you dont necessarily want to be with a single manager "
