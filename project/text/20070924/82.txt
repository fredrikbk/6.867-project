telecommunications relaxing in the fast lane satellite broadband connections may be the answer for those who want to get away from it all but not really surfing the internet at her second home in monterey county calif once meant hours of frustration for melissa duflock she had to slog through web sites using a slow dial up phone line because high speed connections stopped miles away now thats changed thanks to her new satellite internet connection from wildblue communications inc with the high speed link she can easily surf the web send emails and view photos just as she does at her first home in san diego "its made a huge impact for me " says ms duflock satellite broadband connections like ms duflocks are gaining popularity as consumers increasingly accustomed to always on high speed links at home decide they need fast internet service even when they try to get away from it all with an outdoor dish just like those for satellite television service subscribers receive an internet connection that is faster than dial up though generally slower than most high speed cable and phone based dsl or digital subscriber line connections for years satellite companies have promised fast internet connections capable of serving even the remotest corners of the world initial offerings were sluggish though and satellite based broadband services mainly appealed to businesses that needed a backup connection in case their earthly links were disrupted or to emergency responders who needed to make sure they could communicate even during a disaster but speeds have been gradually increasing while prices for antennae and other hardware have declined new satellites have been launched recently that allow for speeds suitable for large downloads such as video and offer capacity for more subscribers the need is definitely there despite the expanding reach of high speed cable and dsl connections millions of homes still dont have access to those services including some that are in or near major suburban areas meanwhile wi fi technology offers mobile broadband access but its mostly limited to small areas like airports hotels and cafes cellphone companies offer fast internet connections through mobile phones or through "air cards" plugged into laptops but that access is still limited to metro areas for the most part as a result at the beach in the mountains or in other remote areas and even in some areas that arent so remote its satellite or nothing for broadband connections satellite broadband providers including hughes network systems llc of germantown md and wildblue communications in greenwood village colo dont try to compete on price with cable and phone companies when it comes to selling internet service instead they expect their service will appeal to customers who have no other choice says max engel an analyst who covers the satellite and broadband industries for research and consulting firm frost &amp sullivan "satellite is a last resort " says mr engel who is based in austin texas "you use it when you cant get anything else and its vastly better than dial up " mr engel estimates that by the end of this year roughly half a million people will subscribe to satellite high speed connections in the u s the number will double by he says monthly service prices for satellite connections are often double or even triple the monthly fees for high speed internet access sold by some phone and cable companies and generally slightly more expensive than so called g wireless broadband offered by cellphone companies satellite service typically runs at about the same speeds or somewhat faster than g services which offer downloads at about kilobits per second compared with about megabits per second for the fastest land based systems offered in the u s the gear to set up satellite connections costs about &# though some companies offer discounts wildblue offers speeds that range from kilobits per second or about times as fast as dial up for &# a month to megabits per second nearly equal to popular dsl connections sold by phone companies but about one fourth the speed of popular cable connections for &# a month farmers and others in rural locations have long made up the bulk of wildblues subscribers to satellite broadband but david leonard wildblues chief executive says people with second homes now make up as much as of his customer base a high speed connection was crucial to steve onderdonk who not long ago was out of luck if he wanted to send an email when he visited his ranch in central california high speed phone and cable connections stopped dozens of miles away and the ranch doesnt have a land line phone connection so he couldnt even subscribe to a slow dial up internet service now his satellite broadband link from wildblue lets him view photos and videos of his grandchildren when he retreats to the ranch from his pasadena home "its the only way we can spend more than a couple days up there without being worried youre missing all kinds of things people dont want you to " says mr onderdonk "its a lifesaver " for lee sherbeyn the lack of a high speed connection was affecting his business mr sherbeyn raises longhorn cattle in a sparsely populated area of virginia near bealeton about an hour and a half by car from washington d c he couldnt get a high speed connection from cable or phone companies that he needed to send and receive photos of bulls for his cattle business and photos for the commercial real estate business he operates on the side he says he spent hours on a dial up connection waiting for downloads about four years ago he estimates he paid roughly &# for hardware to have a satellite broadband connection from hughes he pays roughly &# a month for the companys fastest connection megabits per second "for the advantage i got over time dont tell them but id pay double for what i got " says mr sherbeyn "everybody in the world wants something right now " the satellite services are also finding customers in people who are so addicted to broadband they want to take it everywhere they go even to mountaintops a handful of companies offer mobile satellite connections that make it possible to receive a high speed broadband connection from virtually anywhere in the u s in the past such hardware was bulky and heavy but the gear has improved significantly in recent years terminals called bgans or broadband global area network terminals are slightly bigger and a bit heavier than a paperback book users attach a cable between the terminal and a laptop to get a high speed internet connection subscribers also can attach a standard phone cord to the terminal to make phone calls satellite companies generally market the service to oil companies or others who operate at sea in a desert or at an otherwise remote location mountain climbers use it for emergencies and the service is popular with news organizations that send reporters to remote locations in iraq and elsewhere while businesses make up the bulk of customers london based inmarsat plc says a small number of individuals who want mobile high speed connections have bought bgans the company began serving u s customers in april high prices prevent most consumers from using mobile satellite connections though hardware prices have fallen dramatically slower bulkier equipment cost &# eight years ago inmarsat says the terminals the company sells now range from &# to &# though inmarsats distribution partners offer significant discounts instead of flat fees for service the company charges by capacity used "there will be a time when youve found that log cabin in the special part of mexico but it has no connectivity at all " says andrew sukawaty inmarsats chief executive describing a hypothetical customer subscribing to mobile satellite broadband is expensive but he says its "a lifestyle choice " ms searcey is a staff reporter in the wall street journals new york bureau she can be
