ceos pay how much is too much robert reichs conversion to super capitalism albeit with a tax bite is heartening it is however a shade simplistic "ceos deserve their pay " editorial page sept the issue for boards has never been the need to incentivize the best managers they can attract thats a given the issue rather is how much is too much this indeed cant be legislated theres only one body that can control compensation and thats the board of directors the experience in the u k has been instructive "say on pay" did not result in curtailing ceos incomes rather it is resulting in shareholders using the opportunity to communicate with boards the need to tie compensation to actual corporate performance rather than rising tides to achieve this result in the u s requires boards that are attuned to sensible performance related metrics and public sensibilities and this in turn requires shareholders having the means to assure themselves that they have boards so attuned ira millstein senior associate dean yale school of management new haven conn mr reich is an unlikely source of praise to well paid ceos but not an unlikely source for promoting the confiscation of private property that was earned through the productive effort he so eloquently praises he goes into great detail describing the value they have created for shareholders but he fails to tell us why they should not be allowed to actually keep what they have earned nor does he tell us why it should be morally justified that some majority no matter the percentage approving of the u s population should be allowed to decide whether this group of individuals or any other group for that matter should actually be allowed to keep what they have earned if they are indeed able to earn their pay perhaps they should also be allowed to keep it unfortunately mr reich is silent in answer to these important moral questions ken harris denver great commentary by mr reich surprisingly enough from a clinton democrat the former secretary of labor explains plainly and clearly the market enticement for boards to seek out highly qualified individuals unfortunately the last sentence put a damper on his otherwise cogently expressed logic a higher marginal tax rate on these sought after individuals would of course curb their incentive to take these positions why bother if the feds are going to take away half your earnings far higher than that actually if you go back to pre reagan tax reform and for those who would reply that even say of a huge amount is enough for anyone whose decision is that to make joel siegel fox island wash i was pleased and somewhat astonished by the tenor of mr reichs piece on ceo pay as a long standing icon of liberalism his deference to market forces was refreshing however in the last sentence of the piece he reverted to his roots taking a sharp left turn by stating that the answer is "a higher marginal tax rate on the super pay of those in super demand " is he not familiar with the practice of "grossing up " in which the employer very often pays the increased income tax on many of these "goodies" thus a higher marginal tax rate would result in even higher pay for these fortunate few go figure stan smith glen carbon ill
