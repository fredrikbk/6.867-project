moveon dems congresss job approval is at in the newest zogby poll and the members keep earning every percentage point the latest show of cynical futility was last weeks senate posturing over iraq democrats know they lack support to change u s policy but keep demanding votes to please their antiwar faction first up was a plan offered by virginia freshman jim webb to require longer home rotations for u s forces that exercise was intended as a way to undermine the war without actually having to take responsibility for doing so it failed when virginia republican john warner who had tantalized the media by contemplating support declined to go along next up was a more honest amendment sponsored by wisconsin democrat russ feingold to cut off funding after june that won only votes but the ayes notably included presidential candidates hillary clinton barack obama and chris dodd to make it a trifecta of defeat democrats next rolled out an amendment to redeploy u s forces within nine months that lost or short of the needed to pass "were not going to be discouraged " declared michigans carl levin "theres no better use of the senates time than to try to change the direction in iraq " hes right in the narrow sense that as long as senators are wasting time on failed iraq votes they have less time to do other harm but this fruitless persistence is notable for showing how much moveon org and the antiwar movement now determine democratic foreign policy the one iraq related vote that did pass last week was a republican resolution condemning moveon org for its new york times ad accusing general david petraeus of betrayal that "sense of the senate" resolution passed with votes but democrats a majority of democrats voting refused to condemn the ad mrs clinton was one of the moveon thats a vote to remember next year after shes won the nomination and is running as a national security hawk
