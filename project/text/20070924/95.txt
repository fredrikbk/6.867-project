uaw sets deadline for today negotiating twist comes as talks with gm appear on track for historic deal the united auto workers set a deadline of a m edt today to conclude a new national contract with general motors corp following weekend negotiations that appeared to be on track to produce a groundbreaking labor deal the talks still could encounter obstacles even though people familiar with the situation indicated that a framework for dealing with the main issue of retiree health care was in place and that bargaining yesterday had shifted to other issues one key issue is the size of a cash bonus gm will give active workers in exchange for ratifying a deal these people said late yesterday uaw international leaders in detroit began calling local leaders at gm plants across the country telling them to prepare to go on strike today at a m if no deal was reached the uaw typically sets strike deadlines as a way of putting pressure on company negotiators to wrap up last details uaw president ron gettelfinger has a history of making th hour proposals to sweeten contract deals the uaw had extended the negotiations past the original sept deadline on an hour by hour basis but hadnt issued a specific strike deadline gm spokesman dan flores said the two sides were still negotiating last night and that the company "will continue focusing our efforts on reaching an agreement as soon as possible " uaw spokesman roger kerson declined to comment the uaw hasnt struck a detroit auto maker in national contract bargaining in more than years though there have been other strikes outside contract bargaining since then industry observers have said they dont expect a strike given the weakened position of both sides the weekends negotiations made significant progress over a groundbreaking deal to shift gms retiree health care obligations to an independent fund gm has pushed hard for the creation of a voluntary employees beneficiary association or veba as a replacement for an open ended guarantee of benefits for uaw retirees such a move would mark a dramatic break for the uaw and the big detroit auto makers instead of relying on the auto makers for retirement benefits the uaw would oversee billions of dollars provided for retirees and it would have to decide to trim benefits if the fund was running low on money in when the last contract was signed gm and its domestic rivals ford motor co and chrysler llc dished out &# each to members or about &# million with the work force contracting at all three companies over the past four years to a total of from the bonus could easily grow to &# this time around without an increase over what was paid out last time another top priority for the uaw bargaining teams will be to secure future products such as new vehicles or new engines for specific plants or work sites uaw plant level officials said uaw local leaders many of whom met with their members yesterday said they have been communicating to bargaining teams that members are most concerned about future work as well as ensuring that the veba doesnt mean a cut in retiree health care for at least several years if not more "i think my members would pass an agreement that got us new work promised no change in retiree health care for at least two contracts and probably some signing bonus " said one uaw gm local leader the leader said many uaw gm locals his included had lost half their work forces in the last decade and wanted an agreement that halted those losses also many of his members would retire in the next few years and needed to know that their retiree health care wouldnt change before they would approve the contract a deal at gm will set the pattern for contracts at ford and chrysler if the contracts win rank and file ratification the detroit auto makers and the uaw will have taken a substantial step toward restructuring a labor relationship that was a relic of the days when detroit and the uaw had a virtual monopoly on automotive production in the u s those days are long gone as non u s auto makers within the past year have captured roughly half the u s market the combination of shrinking detroit three sales and escalating costs for health care and other uaw benefits is a major reason why investors have downgraded the debt of all three to "junk" status it isnt clear how the veba trust at gm would be structured and details of those plans could shift progress on the framework for the proposal came last week after the two sides agreed on appropriate funding levels as well as on setting up certain "triggers" that would protect both the union if health care inflation outstripped projections and gm if its u s auto sales continue to slide according to people familiar with the process gm ford and chrysler officials have said creating veba trusts to take over retiree health care obligations would go a long way toward closing an estimated &# to &# an hour labor cost gap with asian auto makers such as toyota motor corp and honda motor co which have far fewer retirees and offer fewer health care benefits detroits auto makers with retirees and surviving spouses who are provided health care estimate they owe more than &# billion in such benefits to current and future retirees
