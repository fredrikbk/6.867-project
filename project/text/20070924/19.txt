boss talk gucci chief peddles power of the dream how polet went from popsicles to purses when robert polet took the reins of gucci group in following the departure of designer executive team tom ford and domenico de sole many in the fashion industry questioned whether the former head of ice cream and frozen food at unilever was out of his depth the dutch executive unveiled a plan in december to double sales at the gucci brand and stem losses elsewhere notably at the groups french label yves saint laurent now it appears to be paying off gucci groups sales rose in the second quarter of this year to million euros &# billion faster growth than at bigger rival lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton in the process gucci group has powered profit increases at its parent company frances ppr sa which also owns less glamorous discount furniture and mail order clothing businesses as gucci readies for its milan fashion week show wednesday the year old chief executive must walk a tightrope between boosting sales and keeping his brands exclusive a few hours before hosting a cocktail party at the palazzo grassi in venice earlier this month mr polet sat overlooking the grand canal and discussed what it takes to juggle some of the worlds most exclusive brands excerpts wsj whats the difference between selling popsicles and &# handbags mr polet nobody needs another handbag and if you need a bag you can get a cheap bag anywhere for &# so you have to create what i call the "i need to have it" factor when the customer says "i need to have that &# bag and my only worry is that it be in stock i want it now " this is the emotional desire which comes from the strength of the brand the power of the dream i have it as well sometimes i still remember when my father bought an austin westminster it had leather seats and sitting in the car smelling the leather made a tremendous impact on me when i get shoes the first thing i do is smell the leather wsj how does running a luxury label compare with running a mass market consumer brand mr polet in the first two months i realized the similarities of what im doing here are much bigger than the differences what i do every day leading and coaching people ive done for years but the way we organize creativity is completely different wsj when you replaced mr ford gucci demonstrated it could survive without a star designer but now frida giannini has become an authority in her own right how do you strike a balance between the brand and the personality mr polet the brand is always more important than the designer because the brand will stay with us and with our children and childrens children out into infinity gucci brand is the th brand in the world in the interbrand ranking of best brands in it didnt get to that position in just one year with one person doing this or that our creative directors have teams of designers of course they dont do it themselves but they have the end responsibility of saying "this goes in the collection and that not " wsj does the business side have any say in the creative process mr polet the business side is intimately linked to the creative the ceo and the creative director have this particular relationship in actually marrying the creative and the business sides wsj gucci group hasnt made any acquisitions since you arrived do you think it is ready to add another brand mr polet acquisitions could play a logical role in the application of our strategy the primary focus of our investments will be going to asia pacific is it wise to keep looking at where we can enhance the assortment the categories our presence in certain regions by trying to acquire the right target at the right price absolutely and were constantly monitoring that wsj will you meet your target of making every brand profitable by the end of this year mr polet yes we are going to meet our targets and in certain brands actually we are ahead of our targets balenciaga two years ago already attained profitability and boucheron last year reached profitability well ahead of the dates we had set wsj what would be the consequences for brands that dont make the break even cutoff mr polet what we did say in is that youd better make it because otherwise well have to think long and hard about whether it makes sense for a brand to be in gucci group wsj several years ago lvmh gucci group and prada group spent billions to amass brands but recently prada has sold off unprofitable brands such as jil sander and helmut lang to focus on its main label does size no longer matter mr polet i think we have proven its very wise to have a portfolio one example providing a career path between the brands if youre a mono brand youre restricted here we can actually move people around when we recently asked sergio rossi ceo isabelle guichot to head up balenciaga the supply chain director of bottega veneta didier bonnin became the new ceo of sergio rossi wsj is the multibrand strategy a commercial success mr polet let me give you an example second quarter sales at constant currency rates at gucci group as a total grew in japan the gucci brand only grew but other brands in our portfolio grew faster bottega veneta had growth of and boucheron had growth of more than and it is here i think you see the beauty of having a portfolio of brands as a luxury group wsj but if the smaller brands are growing so quickly arent you worried they will cannibalize the gucci brands sales mr polet customers appreciate and acquire the brands for different types of reasons bottega veneta is timeless quality for very sophisticated clients who dont appreciate logos on the outside of their bag gucci customers love it when theres a logo on the bag on the shoe or visible on the ready to wear these are different segments of consumers there is almost no overlap wsj you said you wanted to double guccis sales to billion euros by at what point is a brand so big that its more mass market than luxury mr polet its a differentiation that we never make we have directly owned stores so its not widely available its very concentrated i dont have this fear at all wsj accessible luxury brands like coach have had staggering success in introducing increasingly expensive products how do you defend guccis territory mr polet we never actually think about defending anything the strategy of all of our brands is to make sure that we go up market as much as possible you have more people who aspire to be part of the brand that allows you to sell products at an entry price point by buying for example perfume and sunglasses then shoes or ready to wear then jewelry wsj but doesnt selling perfume at a low price cheapen the brand mr polet i believe in the legitimacy of having price points that allow customers to enter the brand without buying a &# ring or a &# indy handbag a big brand like gucci caters to many many different strata of customers right up there at the highest level is the &# crocodile indy bag but at the entry price a normal canvas indy bag costs &# wsj after years of deepening losses it seems yves saint laurent is finally on an upward trend what steps have you taken to improve it mr polet its one thing to get yves saint laurent to break even but the real opportunity lies in the fact that were going to make it a highly profitable brand we now have five successful families of handbags at yves saint laurent the muse uptown downtown the tribute and the double i wouldnt say these are hit bags but they are continuously successful around the world and in a sustainable way wsj how do you keep tabs on the positioning of your brands mr polet we get real data market surveys from the luxury institute in the u s for example and continue to monitor the health of all of our brands wsj what challenges will you address in your next three year plan mr polet we need to think through how we operate in japan take the weaker japanese yen for example not only did we have to raise prices to protect gross margin of the business in japan but also japanese tourist flows started reducing dramatically in the last two years we are upgrading our image in japan in ginza last year we opened a new flagship that is leading the way for us in store design and you will see as well in the coming weeks and months from a product point of view we will innovate specifically for the japanese market in guccis high end jewelry the majority of sales were in japan theres been a quite dramatic upgrading of the assortment going more to precious stones and gold jewelry away from what used to be an assortment based on silver
