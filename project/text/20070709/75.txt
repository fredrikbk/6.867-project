of indexiq a ryebrook n y investment firm that creates funds that look in many ways like mutual funds says they promise good returns with low volatility but there are clear dangers he notes in part because many investment managers find it hard to make consistent money betting against stocks another danger is that most mutual fund managers and other pros find it hard beating the market over the long haul so because funds are amplified bets made by these same managers they may find it even harder to outperform and while some funds charge skimpy annual expense ratios of less than one percentage point others charge as much as three percentage points jeff fishman who runs jsf financial llc a los angeles based financial advisory firm notes that these funds allow individual investors

appropriate benchmark to measure them paul bracaglia an investment advisory partner at pricewaterhousecoopers says "what you really need to do is look under the hood and see how a fund is really invested " if the fund is in large cap stocks in international stocks and in bonds an investor might compare the returns of the fund to indexes tracking those investments he also suggests comparing the performance of a fund with those of rival target maturity funds with similar maturities and then comparing the composition of each fund to make sure they are the same target date indexes from dow jones are another way to measure performance mr zuckerman is a special writer in the wall street journals new york bureau he can be reached at gregory zuckerman wsj com
