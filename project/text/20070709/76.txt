your money matters a special report essay character counts too often we hire the person with the lowest price or the most charisma then we get hustled like millions of americans my wife and i have "modernized" our finances the past few years online banking lets us pay utility bills with a few clicks of the computer mouse search engines help us find the cheapest prices online for everything from halogen light bulbs to yu gi oh cards and our investment portfolio is chaperoned by portfolio tracking software thats a mathematical tour de force but all this wonderful technology only takes us so far looking at our most satisfying and frustrating purchases the past few years its startling how often our shopping fate comes down to an old fashioned question did we trust the right person take auto repair as a teenager i took pride in changing the oil rotating tires and replacing an alternator but it has been a long time since ive done anything intelligent in terms of fixing my own car in fact i can barely find the hood release lever these days for a few years a service technician at our local dealership took pity on me when my cars tires wore thin he told me how much it would cost to replace them at his shop and then confided that costco offered a better deal when i blanched at the cost of the standard mile servicing he told me which adjustments could wait another year saving me some money it was very reassuring he must have recognized that i was an automotive idiot but instead of exploiting my ignorance and running up the bill he helped me make smarter decisions in return he got my business eventually though he left the dealership his successor was a charming and friendly man he always offered me a nice loaner car and a fresh brewed cup of coffee but my repair bills got steeper explanations grew hazier the nadir came when i lost an automatic door opener and needed a replacement my technician said the device would cost &# plus another &# for programming "no way " i yelled "you can buy a cellphone for less than that you cant tell me that the electronics in that little device are more complicated than a cellphone " he was stone faced that was his price period perhaps i could find something cheaper on the internet he said but he warned me about the hazards of buying nondealer parts i walked out of the dealership and was online within an hour replacement door openers for my car were available on ebay for &# programming instructions were posted free of charge i bought the gadget and had my year old son do the programming just to prove that it really was childs play so now we had a working car door opener for one tenth the dealerships price and i was faced with the task of hunting for a new more trustworthy mechanic theres a lesson in this character counts its a lesson that easily gets lost in the e commerce age but when we go shopping we usually want more than just the best price were looking for advice about a new field or some help in shaping our desires high tech tools can help to some degree but the human touch still matters enormously thats why were so delighted when we get it right and so crestfallen when we feel weve been snookered the online only crowd hates to admit this but a lot of business gets done as if we still lived in a th century european village we meet a stranger chat for a bit and cut a deal without evaluating alternatives or specifying every detail we hope everything will work out well but theres usually some blurriness about whats promised or implied by both sides if misunderstandings arise there isnt much recourse except each others sense of honesty as haphazard as this system is it can work well if were smart about sizing up potential business partners when weve picked out music teachers for our children for example we havent spent a lot of time haggling about prices instead weve chatted at length about how they learned their instruments as a child how fast or slow they move students along and what they regard as a good weeks worth of work what were really looking for is passion and patience if those traits are there were going to have a good experience if they arent no amount of discounting will create a bargain we took the same getting to know you approach when we needed a roof replaced a few years ago and it turned out to be the right call most of our bids came from long established roofers who drove up to our house in shiny new cars they were pricey and had excellent reputations they told us they would come by every day for a few minutes to make sure their crews did a good job the low bid came from a younger guy in a pickup truck with awesome references and a burning desire to show that he could build a top flight roofing company too he would be the foreman on the job spending much of the day on our roof making sure crew members positioned each shingle just right he shared the most detailed assessment of what would be easy or tricky about our roof he clearly cared the most about building his reputation on jobs like this we hired him and got an a plus job of course there have been other times when we acted too fast or were beguiled by someone who really wasnt right at all years ago i needed to sublet a new york apartment dozens of applicants called or showed up after i ran an ad in the local newspaper one couple seemed nice but wanted an extra day to come to a decision another candidate loudly proclaimed that he was ready to sign right away i went with mr loud and regretted it for two years he was noisy and surly once he moved in neighbors complained about his conduct he paid the rent with a weird assortment of money orders that made me wonder just what was going on with his finances and when it came time for him to move out he left the apartment in less than perfect shape my mistake was obvious id been focused on who was decisive about signing a lease not who was likely to be a pleasant tenant occasionally our picks have been so dreadful that they become comical a few years ago we foolishly let a wealthy friend talk us into meeting with her landscaper all we wanted were some ideas about bushes to plant next to our concrete driveway he took notes went away and returned a few weeks later with an enormous artists sketch that involved tearing up our driveway laying a curving path of cobblestones and creating a tiny replica of the versailles gardens the proposed cost &# it was so absurdly out of place that i couldnt even get angry we sheepishly paid him for his sketch and sent him packing as fast as we could we took a pass on his makeover instead weve saucily decorated our driveway with a &# weber grill and a homemade tetherball pole it was all further evidence to me that when were negotiating with people who hide information or try to rush us into costly decisions we feel apprehensive it doesnt matter how charming or good looking they are we worry that were being hustled its far better to deal with people who are good listeners and calm candid explainers they dont try to dominate the conversation instead they give us time to explain our priorities even if we arent very good at articulating them at first they build trust by answering questions we arent shrewd enough to ask they explain the flaws as well as the allure of whatever were considering and they care about how theyre regarded in the community each new encounter is its own adventure but as i get older im taking more time to appreciate the human interactions involved instead of worrying about the last on price or haggling for one more feature im trying harder to find business partners that we can like and trust mr anders is a wall street journal news editor based in palo alto calif he can be reached at george anders wsj
