politics &amp economics china targets bribe takers but what about givers zeal to prosecute those who instigate graft appears to be lacking hong kong chinas hardening stance against graft became clear when the countrys former head of the food and drug watchdog was sentenced to death in may for accepting bribes from drug companies on friday another senior official from the same agency reportedly received a suspended death sentence for similar charges but what is less certain is chinas commitment to addressing the possibly more widespread practice of offering bribes not just the high profile government officials who take them the bribery prosecutions follow a string of food and drug safety lapses in pet food toothpaste and tires china has reacted by closing food manufacturers and pledging to crack down on corruption and shoddy safety standards international concern over the safety of chinese exports has increased with the u s food and drug administration most recently issuing a safety alert for farm raised seafood imported from china that may contain unsafe chemicals and antibiotics the chinese government generally responds to corruption scandals by announcing a crackdown rounding up senior officials and encouraging the state controlled domestic news media to cover their trials beijing stresses that corruption within its own ranks is the greatest threat to the communist party but it is unclear whether the government pursues the bribers with the same zeal as the bribed "as a policy the chinese prosecution they normally dont go after the people who bribe its been very consistent " says fu hualing an associate professor on the faculty of law at the university of hong kong "it doesnt matter if its the lawyers bribing the judges or the companies bribing the officials " dr fu says bribery is a part of chinese society and that the public and the government look at those who bribe with more sympathy than the government officials who accept bribes "if you talk to people on the street they will think that its the government officials who should be prosecuted not the people who bribe " dr fu says despite the high profile trial and sentencing of zheng xiaoyu the former head of chinas state food and drug administration the government hasnt made any public announcement about which companies bribed him or which company officials were involved in the graft but two documents posted on the web site of the law firm that represents mr zheng name some of the chinese pharmaceutical companies that allegedly gave bribes to mr zheng according to defense documents that cite the prosecution one of the chinese companies has a business deal with a texas company to manufacture syringes that are sold in the u s another one of the chinese companies has a deal with a drug company in new jersey to develop drugs for sale in the u s a concern observers say is that corrupt government officials could be allowing unsafe products on the market either in china or overseas the documents dated may and june offer details into mr zhengs legal defense which is being handled by beijing new era law firm chinese government prosecutors identify within the documents most of the eight drug companies that allegedly gave a total of &# in bribes to mr zheng and some of his family members "is he being made to pay for the wrongdoing of many " says robert w pollard director in china for the health care arm of synovate a global market research firm "that would appear to be the case " it isnt clear whether these eight companies will themselves be charged with bribery some of the companies say they havent received any notice from prosecutors the documents are stored on the law firms web site but arent easily accessible to the public a who answered the phone at beijing new era said mr zhengs lawyers werent available for comment and beijing new era law firm declined to answer questions about the documents a person from the first branch of the beijing peoples procuratorate the government office involved in prosecuting mr zhengs case said she didnt know whether the people accused of bribing mr zheng were being charged the government could be pursuing a case against the companies without making their investigation public "high profile cases against officials tend to receive more publicity but authorities also pursue other cases which may go unreported such as cases against those offering bribes to officials " says susan munro a lawyer with omelveny &amp myers llp in shanghai on may the beijing no intermediate peoples court sentenced mr zheng for receiving bribes of cash and gifts during his tenure at the helm of the state food and drug administration the court justified the death sentence by citing the large bribes and damage to the country the companies or people who gave mr zheng the bribes werent identified at the time but on june the st century business herald a national newspaper in china published an article based on documents it said it had found on beijing new eras web site that detailed some of the companies allegedly involved in the bribery the article prompted a columnist for the china youth daily a state run newspaper published nationwide to call for the government to punish not only those who receive bribes but also those who give them chinas central propaganda department which controls the countrys media was unhappy about the st century business herald report a person familiar with the matter said officials with the propaganda department asked sina corp s sina com and sohu com inc s sohu com two of chinas
