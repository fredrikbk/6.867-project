membership of new guantanamo review panel may be challenged washington moving to salvage the offshore trial system for detainees in guantanamo bay the bush administration late last month created a special panel to hear defense department appeals but the panels membership and its draft rules are likely to prompt challenges from defense lawyers further hobbling the system the panel was set up after military judges dismissed charges against the only two prisoners accused of terrorism related war crimes the latest in a series of blows to the administrations military justice system pressure is growing to shut the prison at the u s naval base in cuba meanwhile the supreme court has agreed to consider in the fall whether guantanamo prisoners the vast majority of whom havent been charged with crimes have the right to challenge their detentions the review panel called the court of military commission review is to consider the governments plea to reinstate the charges the government argues that the military judges were mistaken when they ruled that the commissions lacked jurisdiction over the defendants because the government had never properly established that they were "unlawful enemy combatants" that is fighters who unlike soldiers and certain other belligerents had no right under international laws of war to participate in armed conflict a court fight over the review panel could further hamstring the administrations efforts to get trials started before pressure becomes insurmountable to shut guantanamo or to revise the trial rules to more closely resemble those in courts martial or civilian courts according to officials familiar with the matter four of the pentagon appeals judges are holdovers from a review panel appointed in by then defense secretary donald rumsfeld that panel was part of the initial system of military commissions that the supreme court last year ruled illegal two of the four former attorney general griffin bell and former transportation secretary william coleman advised mr rumsfeld in drafting the rules of the system struck down by the high court mr coleman also attended a mock trial the pentagon staged in to help prosecutors sharpen their cases against detainees other members of the panel are rhode island chief justice frank williams pennsylvania state court judge and former republican congressman edward biester and military officers lt cmdr william kuebler a navy lawyer appointed to represent guantanamo defendant omar khadr said "theres a very good chance" he will challenge at least the four civilian judges their involvement in the previous system suggests they have views about "big picture legal issues" that could affect their impartiality he said as advisers in helping to set up the program they now will hear appeals that question the fairness of it he also said the military officers on the court could be influenced by any prejudicial pronouncements from the president and other officials about the guantanamo defendants guilt unlike independent life tenured federal judges military officers are within the chain of command headed by the president david crane a retired army colonel who teaches national security law at syracuse university said that the involvement of messrs bell and coleman in the initial program makes them liable for a defense challenge "if you have individuals who actually created the court and now are members of the court that makes me a little uncomfortable " prof crane said messrs bell and coleman couldnt be reached for comment the reappointments which werent widely known within the executive branch left some administration officials puzzled one official reached yesterday said retaining the holdovers damaged the governments effort to portray the new system of military commissions as a clean break from the prior version which was widely criticized by legal authorities the panels draft rules contain elements rarely seen in traditional courts one permits defendants to submit statements that dont raise legal issues that appears an effort to accommodate some detainees who may wish to denounce their captors deny the courts legitimacy or proclaim their ideological views the rules also authorize the panel to reconsider its rulings if they are contrary to a decision by the president or the defense secretary "the law is the law the law is not what the secretary of defense or the president says it is " cmdr kuebler said the new panel was created under the military commissions act which congress passed last year to bring the system into compliance with the supreme courts opinion last month two military judges dismissed all charges against mr khadr and salim hamdan former driver for osama bin laden finding the military commissions lacked jurisdiction over the defendants the military prosecutor lodged an appeal july as officials scrambled to draft rules and select judges to hear it a pentagon spokesman declined to comment on the courts members or procedures but did say the judges are expected to be sworn in later this week
