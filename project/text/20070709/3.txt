boss talk glaxos garnier is taking the heat defending safety of avandia preoccupies but doesnt consume drug companys ceo jean pierre garnier chief executive of glaxosmithkline plc has been in the hot seat since may when an article in the new england journal of medicine raised concerns about the safety of the diabetes treatment avandia his companys second biggest selling drug in the article cardiologist steven nissen analyzed past clinical trials of avandia an approach known as a meta analysis and concluded that patients taking the drug may be at a higher risk for heart attacks than patients taking other drugs since then avandia prescriptions have fallen sharply and glaxos stock price has plummeted dr garnier is now trying to fight research with research he says glaxo performed its own meta analysis of avandia before dr nissens and also found a risk of heart attack but the risk was very slight and was outweighed by other evidence showing that avandia is as safe for the heart as other diabetes drugs dr garnier says the food and drug administration is now carrying out its own meta analysis and will convene a panel of medical advisers on july to weigh the evidence dr garnier has faced safety crises before in medical experts raised concerns that glaxos paxil and other antidepressants could induce suicidal thinking and behavior in children leading the fda to add strong warnings to the drugs in an interview in glaxos philadelphia office dr garnier discussed such topics as managing the avandia crisis the pricing of hiv drugs serving poor communities and what he wants to accomplish before stepping down as ceo in may excerpts follow wsj has glaxo done everything it could to study avandia and communicate its risks to the public dr garnier were not perfect im sure with hindsight we could have done more but i have to say in the case of avandia you see that we were diligent from the day of the launch to start to study the drug in some depth in clinical studies and then we did the meta analysis a year ahead of dr nissen as soon as we found out that there was at least a question raised by the meta analysis we immediately did the epidemiology study with patients that came out absolutely squeaky clean and supportive of avandia so you look at the totality avandia is by far the most studied diabetic agent on the market today so sure maybe we could do more but frankly the record is very good not only have we studied this drug right left and center but also we have been transparent informed everybody wsj what feedback are you getting from doctors about avandia dr garnier doctors are worried about being sued for putting patients on avandia and things like this but overall they are staying behind avandia very few patients actually are switching off their medication but some have wsj are doctors more concerned about liability risk when putting new patients on the drug dr garnier physicians are naturally gun shy about putting new patients on the reality is and we have the data theyre putting fewer new patients on it weve just run a big survey of physicians and theyre playing back again the two key points "most of my patients have not switched and i have no intention of switching them however as far as putting new patients on avandia im putting far fewer than before and im waiting to see what the fda has to say " wsj does the safety flap take up your entire day dr garnier pretty much this is a very unpleasant event but on the other hand this is not my first one ive been there before my job is to manage the company through the crisis wsj how do you do that dr garnier we have crisis management phone calls every day these things dont get done without a lot of coordination wsj glaxo recently donated million pandemic flu vaccines to the world heath organization whats the story dr garnier its probably the largest vaccine donation ever the company could have sold possibly those million units they glaxo decided to set them aside because frankly those countries are not going to buy any pandemic vaccine some of them have no commitment to health care lets call a cat a cat theyll buy a lot of other things including kalashnikovs before they allocate enough money for health care in their own countries some are committed to better health care but pandemic flu never makes their top list because they have humongous problems they have hiv and they have this and that so putting resources aside for a maybe problem doesnt work out to their top priority wsj how has glaxo changed its hiv drug pricing in the developing world since you started running the company dr garnier i always wanted to have access as part of the dna of the company i dont look at those things as philanthropic undertakings even tykerb we just introduced this breast cancer treatment in the u s its a very expensive product for the average person we provide funding and subsidies for people up to an income level of &# per family its intertwined with the purely commercial pricing i wanted that i never wanted to just close my eyes to the fact that of the population wont be able to afford the drugs because thats the truth of the market for pharmaceuticals comes from of the world wide population im not going to be ceo of a company that just works for rich countries and even within rich countries by the way you have holes in the safety net that are part of the equation wsj what has that meant in hiv dr garnier to me it became very obvious that we had to go much further than to give discounts on drugs we had to make basically a philosophical statement that for the very poor countries of this world we were going to sell our drugs without making a profit completely not for profit and overnight we did this and that allowed the consumption of hiv drugs in africa to increase dramatically exponentially overnight we went from very little to hundreds and hundreds of millions of tablets then we went one step further and said why dont we give licenses to generic companies to make our drugs particularly local companies maybe they can make it even cheaper wsj what are the main things glaxo has done to provide better access to hiv drugs and whats been the effect dr garnier what we sell at this not for profit price corresponds to roughly a million patients being treated mostly in africa we dropped the price helped with access that is we have a number of community support programs because treating people who have hiv is not a simple thing wsj what are you doing opening clinics hiring doctors dr garnier no we dont own the infrastructure but weve supported clinics not just with money with advice sending doctors wsj do you do much licensing for production of your drugs in middle income countries like thailand dr garnier no no no middle income countries should pay a fair price for our drugs they certainly can use some of their resources to pay a fair price which is clearly an intermediate price between the lowest and the highest we try to price according to standard of living wsj youre retiring next year what more do you want to do dr garnier no is deliver the pipeline we have a very exciting high quality deep dense innovative pipeline of late stage drugs so lets make sure we deliver and those drugs pass the last hurdle and get launched  tips from jean pierre garnier on managing through a crisis  fight data with data  communicate to employees daily phone calls are essential  study doctor opinion to catch any changes  put data on company web site so everyone can see  keep working on long term business goals
