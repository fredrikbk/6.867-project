current affairs alternative energy hurt by a windmill shortage while projects in u s stall europes utilities expand their reach the race to build new sources of alternative energy from the wind is running into a formidable obstacle not enough windmills in recent years improved technology has made it possible to build bigger more efficient windmills that combined with surging political support for renewable energy has driven up demand now makers cant keep up mostly because they cant get the parts they need fast enough numerous wind power projects from virginia to california have been stalled due to the shortage but for some renewable energy companies in europe where wind power has been in vogue for almost two decades the logjam is a lucrative opportunity these firms anticipated a shortage of turbines and locked in orders with makers theyre now using their considerable buying power to gobble up smaller utilities in the u s that couldnt otherwise get their hands on turbines that was the case with community energy inc a company in wayne pa after trying for years to kick start wind power projects in the u s the company had built only two small wind farms a third sat idle brent alderfer the founder and chief executive said he had few problems acquiring the necessary permits and funding but when it came to getting windmills he faced a multiyear delay "we were like an airline sitting there and being told we had to wait three years to get our airplanes " he says in late mr alderfer contacted iberdrola sa a madrid based utility that has emerged as one of the worlds leaders in renewable energy six months later iberdrola purchased community energy for &# million two months after that technicians had outfitted the companys stillborn project with gleaming white turbines that started churning out enough clean electricity for about homes "we couldnt have done this on our own not then not in five years time " says mr alderfer modern wind turbines are astonishingly complicated machines containing more than components and requiring special transformers to turn their spinning blades into electricity though commonly called windmills theyre technically wind turbines manufacturers depend on a network of component suppliers that in turn need years to ramp up production thats created a bottleneck for the turbine makers iberdrolas strategic advantage stems in part from a billion euros or &# billion bet it made last year to lock up most of the order book of spanish turbine maker gamesa sa the worlds second largest through iberdrola also holds a equity stake in gamesa in addition to community energy iberdrola snapped up two other small u s developers last year in iowa and virginia both of which lacked the funding and the turbines to get going last month it entered into a deal to buy its first regulated u s utility company energy east corp of portland maine for &# billion in part to take advantage of u s tax credits for wind though still a relatively small force on the u s energy grid wind power is on the rise as oil prices and environmental concerns soar governments from beijing to sacramento are showering the sector with subsidies in an effort to boost production of clean energy and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide europe now plans to produce of its energy from renewable sources by up from about today with wind power playing the leading role in the u s more wind power was installed last year than in any country in the world megawatts or more than the equivalent of two nuclear reactors despite the recent action the u s still lags behind other countries that have spent decades nurturing wind power with subsidies and price supports germany has fewer wind resources breezy wide open spaces than the state of north dakota for instance but has twice as much wind power as the entire u s spain with one seventh the population of the u s has the same amount of wind power overall only about of power in the u s comes from wind the turbine shortage could have a significant impact on how quickly the industry can continue to grow in the near term as well as on what shape it will take in the future just five manufacturers produce more than of the worlds wind turbines a midsize megawatt turbine costs about &# million miguel salis the head of the madrid based eolia a fund that supplies financing and development know how to small wind farm developers says "the biggest restriction right now to wind powers growth everywhere not just in the u s is the lack of turbines " he says that so many developers have "projects under way but cant get them completed often because the turbine makers dont give them the time of day " makers need thousands of specially crafted parts including gearboxes blades and bearings to build a turbine transformers vary depending on each countrys electrical grid and the type of turbine depends on the wind resources available relatively wind poor germany has always used larger turbines while breezier spain and china have based their growth on midsize turbines vestas a s of denmark the worlds biggest turbine maker says the supply problems are crimping its production capacity the company produced about megawatts of turbines in the first quarter down from more than megawatts in the fourth quarter of "we are no stronger than the last delivered component out of the components " ditlev engel vestas chief executive told investors in may turbine makers are trying to make up the difference vestas is hoarding components to keep production steady at the expense of working capital others are buying companies that make components to bring production in house siemens wind ag of germany a unit of siemens ag two years ago bought winergy the leading maker of gearboxes for turbines suzlon energy ltd of india snapped up a series of smaller component companies then last month it paid &# billion to buy rival turbine maker repower systems ag of germany which gave it access to a new set of component suppliers because wind power was basically a cottage industry until recently it was slow to develop a large group of professional manufacturers some turbine manufacturers like siemens wind are offshoots of large engineering groups general electric co bought enrons wind division when the houston company imploded gamesa started life half a century ago designing propeller blades for aircraft and still makes most of its own blades in the u s theres another potential threat to growth erratic government support for wind power even though wind power has made technical strides recently energy firms still rely on subsidies because it costs more to generate electricity with wind turbines than other power plants such as coal natural gas or nuclear wind power requires intensive capital investment in a short period of time and has added costs like upgrading transmission systems according to the international energy agency in paris wind farms cost between four and cents to generate a kilowatt hour coal fired plants cost between and six cents some states now have price supports for wind generated electricity and there is a federal tax credit to encourage new wind park development but there is no federal requirement for utilities to buy green energy as there is in the united kingdom denmark and germany and the tax credit started in depends on a biannual congressional approval an effort to introduce federal support for wind power was shot down this month in the senate the lack of a stable long term regulatory environment has created a wind power roller coaster developers were never sure their projects would make economic sense a few years down the road if the regulatory climate changed foreign turbine manufacturers were reluctant to build factories in the u s vestas scrapped plans for a u s factory three times because of uncertainty this spring it announced it would build a turbine plant in windsor colo today states such as iowa pennsylvania minnesota and oregon have gone out of their way to lure foreign turbine makers suzlon is building a turbine plant in minnesota siemens wind and acciona energia sa of spain both announced plans to open turbine factories in iowa gamesa has three plants operating in pennsylvania in a few years time those new factories could help ease the current bottleneck but in the short term the supply crunch has shaken the economics of wind power european utility firms meanwhile are buying up u s energy firms they say they believe growing consensus on the need to fight climate change will lead to a more stable regulatory framework for renewable energy earlier this year portuguese utility energias de portugal sa or edp paid about &# billion for horizon wind energy of houston acciona energia sa of spain bought ecoenergy llc a unit of the morse group in freeport ill last month it plans to roll out about megawatts of wind power in the midwest over three years and bp alternative energy a division of u k based bp plc snapped up virginia based greenlight energy inc last year for about &# million european companies are estimated to own of all the wind energy in the u s says emerging energy research a wind power study group based in cambridge mass american firms are now hustling to secure their own windmills to keep pace invenergy llc based in chicago signed a &# billion deal with ge in may to get its hands on turbines to supply its ambitious development plan in some ways wind power is a victim of its own success rising fossil fuel prices and bigger and more sophisticated turbines have brought wind power closer than ever to being competitive on price with traditional power sources modern machines are to times the size of the windmills first installed in california in the s bigger machines have exponentially changed the economics of wind power because they take better advantage of the wind and work more hours than the smaller older machines that in turn has sparked a boom in demand for new wind power projects world wide the u s has quadrupled its wind power capacity since china which had only megawatts of wind power installed in now has megawatts and expects to catch up to the u s within three years world wide wind capacity has increased from megawatts in to megawatts at the end of last year according to the global wind energy council a trade group better technology and growing political support for clean energy should have made life easier for community energys mr alderfer when he started his company in there were no commercial wind farms operating east of the mississippi instead as wind power became more attractive his job got tougher after finishing their second wind farm a modest megawatt project in new jersey community energy executives realized that upcoming projects would have to be much larger in order to be economically feasible some would require as many as new turbines "the whole thing moved quickly beyond our ability to finance it " mr alderfer says the u s wind industry was in one of its periodic booms after two years with virtually no new wind power federal tax credits were renewed for and suddenly wind farms were cropping up everywhere oil rich but windswept texas overtook california as the leading wind power state community energy was trying to stay in the race in late the company sought to outfit its latest wind farm at locust ridge pa but couldnt get the machines mr alderfer talked with ge the biggest u s turbine maker but was told he would have to pay deposits against delivery of turbines in or that would mean going back to community energys private holders to ask them to stump up more money which mr alderfer was loath to do locust ridge was put on hold again "what are we going to do with this project " he recalls thinking then he decided to call iberdrola the spanish utility at the time iberdrola didnt yet have a beachhead in the u s and executives thought it was a potential gold mine wind energy in the u s "is like europe was years ago " says xavier viteri the year old head of iberdrolas renewable energy business "theres a lot of room for development there and there is a lot of expertise here "
