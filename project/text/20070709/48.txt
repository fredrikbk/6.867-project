politics &amp economics energy debate splits democrats rift between dingell markey brings partys differences to light washington michigan rep john dingell is one of the most powerful lawmakers in congress used to setting the agenda on the issues he cares about such as watching out for detroits auto makers so when democratic leaders created a special panel to prod more aggressive action on climate change the chairman of the energy and commerce committee dismissed the effort as "about as useful as a fish with feathers " but the man put in charge of the new committee massachusetts democrat edward markey a dingell protege appears to be making something of it he is threatening to best his legislative master on the defining issue in the energy debate moving to the house floor this month raising vehicle fuel economy standards insisting toughened standards are the "big missing piece" of an overhauled u s energy policy mr markey is using his perch as chairman of the "select committee on energy independence and global warming" to prod house colleagues to act this summer to raise them mr dingell would rather put off any discussion until later this year and only then as part of a broader complex package that critics fear is likely to take years to complete "im closer to victory now than i have been in a decade " says mr markey who as chairman of the panel has a mandate to "create a sense of urgency" for action on climate change and energy issues raised fuel economy standards he says span both areas of concern "that issue has to be dealt with " in his tussles with mr dingell mr markey showed last month how his select committee can be used to advantage when he waded into a dispute over a proposal floated by mr dingell to limit state authority to regulate tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases the proposal raised alarms with many lawmakers including speaker nancy pelosi of california mr markey convened a hearing that gave state officials a chance to vent their concern mr dingell later dropped consideration of the proposal though aides said it wasnt because of mr markey creation of mr markeys panel was part of a pointed effort by ms pelosi to put a democratic stamp on issues long ignored by congressional republicans and president bush but the divisions between messrs markey and dingell underscore the difficulties ahead for democrats many of the issues at the heart of the climate and energy debate from coal policy to auto emissions often blur not sharpen party distinctions and it isnt just mr dingell fuzzing things up in the senate democratic presidential candidate barack obama raised the ire of environmentalists by pushing a proposal coveted by coal producers an industry important to his home state of illinois the senate already has approved an increase to miles per gallon for all cars and light trucks above current standards as part of energy legislation approved in june with bipartisan support but the outlook is uncertain in the house largely because of mr dingell mr dingell complains the senate proposal was drafted on the floor of the chamber and not subjected to close scrutiny including committee hearings that would examine its consequences among other things mr dingell worries about the impact of any proposal on jobs even so the chairman of the powerful energy committee says he is willing to consider raising fuel economy standards close to the senate level and while he has long been an ally of american auto makers mr dingell says he has put the industry on notice "that they are going to get a significant increase " but in an interview on c spans newsmaker program broadcast yesterday mr dingell made clear his determination that the issue be put off until he moves "the broader climate change bill" in the fall he talks of an "economy wide" approach to global warming intended to spread the burden well beyond his home state industry that is likely to move much more slowly if at all than the less ambitious energy legislation given the scope of the effort analysts at investment bank friedman billings &amp ramsey suggest the phrase "economy wide" is code for "doomed to take three years " for now at mr dingells insistence a stripped down energy bill without fuel economy provisions is being prepared for house floor action the measure would promote greater conservation with toughened efficiency standards for appliances for example while providing investments aimed at encouraging wider use of alternative fuels at the same time mr markey is working on a separate track to build support for raising fuel economy standards and getting them into the energy bill other leading democrats including the speaker are supportive while mr dingell controls the initial shape of the energy bill at the committee level mr markey could lead an effort to alter it either on the house floor or when a bill goes into a joint house senate conference committee to reconcile differences between the two chambers on the measure messrs markey and dingell have been close in the past and both lawmakers profess "respect" for the other mr markey who turns years old this week was elected in and immediately joined the house energy and commerce committee where mr dingell was already a senior member in his earliest days mr markey glib and freewheeling was an acolyte of the gruff mr dingell who is years old and has served more than five decades in congress the two lawmakers have been allies on telecommunications and health issues among other things but in recent years they have sparred sharply on the issue of fuel economy and tensions between the two were raised to new heights when mr markey took on the assignment of leading the select committee created by speaker pelosi incensed at what he saw as a threat to his jurisdiction mr dingell sought and received say house leadership aides assurances from speaker pelosi that mr markeys panel would have no authority to write legislation "quite frankly i think its an embarrassment to everybody " mr dingell says of the panel "theyre simply running around making speeches thumping the tub and acting important " yet even without the authority to write bills mr markey has used the panel to push legislation this spring after a select committee hearing where retired military officers testified that global warming posed a security threat mr markey successfully inserted language into intelligence and defense authorization bills requiring the u s intelligence community to formally assess the dangers posed by climate change mr markey says the panel underscores the speakers commitment to dealing with climate change and energy issues he plays down his differences with mr dingell saying they have "agreed to disagree" on the issue of fuel economy standards "he represents michigan very well on these issues " mr markey says "i try to represent massachusetts very well "
