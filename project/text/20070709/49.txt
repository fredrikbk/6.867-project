rule of thumb hammered judging home builders by book value can sting as write downs mount a year ago home building companies looked like bargains looks can be deceiving many companies were trading near book value a rough estimation of what they would be worth in liquidation and typically a green light to investors to buy the stocks turns out it was a faulty signal and one that is flashing to hopeful investors again value seeking investors bought into the sector and the builders stocks surged toward the end of last year but the subprime debacle and a rising supply of unsold homes have sent home builder shares plummeting erasing most of their gains so this time around investors may be gun shy about following the old rule of thumb of buying the home builders at book value and selling after the shares have appreciated to at least twice book value the problem is that book value is more of a moving target than a sure sign of a bargain book value is a companys assets minus its liabilities typically for builders their largest asset is land which in some cases amid falling home prices is no longer worth what they paid for it that has forced builders to write down the land on their books meantime the builders are still paying down the debt that they used to buy much of the land at the end of june for instance home builders were trading at times book with some large companies such as beazer homes usa inc and hovnanian enterprises inc going as low a multiple as or of book value according to morgan stanley "nobodys got any visibility into the underlying value of the assets and sure enough were seeing the assets being written down " says robert sellar who oversees about &# billion in north american stocks at aberdeen asset management inc mr sellar and his team of investment analysts gathered in late june in their philadelphia office to decide whether it was time to buy home building stocks they decided against it saying the stocks arent trading at large enough discounts to their book value "theres no point in trying to be clever at the moment " he says some value investors who bet on stocks that they think are cheap are holding on or have been adding to their positions hotchkis &amp wiley capital management llc a los angeles investment firm with &# billion in assets earlier this year bought million lennar corp class a shares that made it the biggest institutional shareholder in the company with a stake according to factset research hotchkis &amp wiley declined to comment another large investor in the builders neuberger berman a new york firm that manages more than mutual funds and about &# billion in assets has reduced its stakes in toll brothers inc and hovnanian but still holds more than and of those companies respectively the moving target moved a bit further two weeks ago when kb home took a charge of &# million while lennar took a charge of about &# million as the companies wrote down the value of their housing developments and land those quarterly charges reduced kbs book value by about after taxes and reduced lennars by says daniel oppenheim a housing analyst at banc of america securities with home prices deteriorating additional book value erosion for builders appears likely mr oppenheim estimates that home builders have already written down about of their book values since the peak of the housing boom in july and are likely to shed an additional of their book values from future land related charges but the timing of such charges can be unclear analysts say some builders have been more aggressive in taking write downs this year while others may put off some charges especially on subdivisions that havent yet opened hoping that the market will stabilize the builders land holdings are notoriously difficult to analyze because the companies disclose little about the exact location of parcels or the year they were acquired "the impairments should end when home prices stop falling and we arent there yet " says john burns a housing consultant in orange county calif john gould a portfolio manager at schafer cullen capital management which has &# billion in assets says the builders are looking like a "timely" investment because he says the rate of decline in their share prices has slowed recently "our only concern " mr gould says is the possibility of additional asset write downs he said he doesnt own any home builder stocks at the moment deutsche bank analyst nishu sood says rising mortgage rates and an economic recession could also force the builders to trade below their book values if the housing downturn deepens and the glut of unsold homes already at levels unseen since the previous housing downturn in the early s swells back then interest rates and unemployment were higher than they are now several builders went bankrupt but some companies that survived carried less debt than today in those days the home building sector traded at about book value "think of how bad the housing market is today " morgan stanley analyst robert stevenson says "you start lobbing in job losses and all of the mortgage issues get exacerbated that could be the catalyst that takes the knees out from under this group " but history also has shown that home builder stocks can rally even before their profits do well before the housing market fully recovered the builders shares began turning around in over the next months they rose and hit nearly two times book value according to citi investment research a couple of factors helped drive that recovery the federal reserve cut interest rates which encouraged home buying during the recession and reignited the builders earnings "i would argue that this time is different " morgans mr stevenson says "currently there is no pent up demand the fed doesnt look like it is cutting interest rates and we havent gone into economic recession yet "
