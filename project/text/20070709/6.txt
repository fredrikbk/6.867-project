canadian and u s health services lets compare the two the commentary by david gratzer "whos really sicko " editorial page june presents an extremely prejudicial view of the publicly funded canadian health system it highlights the unfortunate story of a man from ontario who had difficulty accessing a head mri scan for a malignant brain tumour undoubtedly there are similar anecdotes describing difficulties in accessing care experienced by the million americans who lack health insurance however in making a rational comparison of the canadian and american health systems it is more reasonable to contrast service levels and costs of the systems rather than trading anecdotes canadians pay about of national gdp to insure of citizens in our single payer system compared with more than of gdp to insure of americans the kaiser family foundation reports that the average compound annual growth rate in u s health insurance costs has been over the past five years it is therefore not surprising that polling by kaiser found that of americans were worried or very worried about the amount they would need to pay for health insurance in the future and that were worried or very worried about not being able to afford health care services there is no question that restriction of supply with sub optimal access to services has contributed to the lower cost of health care in canada however a new approach of targeting investments to reduce waiting times combined with transparent reporting of wait times is having a substantial impact on access in the canadian system dr gratzer wrote about prolonged waits for treatment in ontario but did not refer readers to the public web sites that detail ontario waiting times for cancer surgery chemotherapy radiation cataract heart arthroplasty and imaging procedures http www health gov on ca transformation wait times wait mn html and http www cancercare on ca canadians spend about of what americans spend on health care and have longer life expectancy and lower infant mortality rates many americans have access to quality health care all canadians have access to similar care at a considerably lower cost in "sicko " michael moore has apparently exaggerated the performance of the canadian health system there is no doubt that too many patients still stay in our emergency departments waiting for admission to scarce hospital beds however mr moores description of the advantages of the canadian system in the film is more accurate than the jaundiced view of our system proposed by dr gratzer robert s bell m d president and ceo university health network toronto the letter was also signed by carolyn baker r n president and ceo st josephs health centre toronto and catherine zahn m d executive vice president of clinical programs and practice university health network toronto regarding the commentary on michael moores attempted documentary our family has experienced canadian health care first hand having lived in the toronto area three years and returning last summer to the u s i had to wait seven months to schedule an annual physical with our family doctor our young son suffered a hairline fracture in his foot playing soccer no crutches were issued just orders to stay off the foot for a few days and wait for any adverse x ray findings we were not notified until one week after the exam neighbors with hockey wear and tear told stories of scheduling mris at a m due to limited equipment availability i wouldnt trade my employer funded u s health insurance for social funded medicine canadian medicine was indeed paperless but did not offer easy access to basic medical services that weve come to expect in the u s besides the medicine and the winters the canadian living experience and people were great just too much government david l streeter rocklin calif it is easy to refute the claim in "sicko" that the canadian health care system is superior to the u s one it is simple for citizens of either country to cross the border for health care but no americans are eager to get care in the socialized canadian system the traffic seeking health care is all in the other direction thomas cusick suny department of mathematics buffalo n y the introduction of private insurance or private for profit health care for medically necessary services is not the answer to challenges in the canadian health care system in a systematic review of studies published in open medicine in may leading canadian and u s researchers confirmed the canadian system leads to health outcomes as good or better than the u s private system at less than of the cost unwanted side effects of competitive health care include a drain of highly trained professionals from the public system and "cream skimming" of patients by private clinics who choose the healthiest patients leaving the most complex to the increasingly overburdened public system in june the canadian medical association reviewed all the evidence from other jurisdictions and concluded that private insurance for medically necessary physician and hospital services does not improve access to publicly insured services does not lower costs or improve quality of care can increase wait times for those who are not privately insured and could exacerbate human resource shortages in the public system medicare is not only more equitable but more efficient and produces higher quality health care than the alternatives this conclusion is supported by the best national and international evidence including reports from the world health organization and the organization for economic co operation and development so what should canada do about patients who do not receive timely access to essential medical care numerous expert reports including the royal commission on the future of health care in canada have already told us we need to restore and strengthen medicare not decimate it in may the canadian centre for policy alternatives reported that successful initiatives in team based care and improved administration produced dramatic cuts in waiting times for surgery in b c alberta saskatchewan and ontario without any need for competition
