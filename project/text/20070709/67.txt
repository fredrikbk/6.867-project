the samurai sell lexus dealers bow to move swank cars in japan toyota revives ancient hospitality rites but some buyers balk tokyo kengo kubo a sales consultant who sells lexus cars in tokyo has a special way of opening a car door he points with all five fingers to the handle right hand followed by left then he gracefully opens the door with both hands in the same way japanese samurais in the th century would have opened a sliding screen door "the most important thing is to make the motion look beautiful " says mr kubo standing in a gleaming lexus show room with live orchids growing out of trickling waterfalls the screen door technique is part of an unusual tactic under way in japans luxury car wars no car maker toyota behind in the luxury market wants to fight back by plunging deep into the world of ancient japanese hospitality traditions at lexus showrooms sales consultants lean five to degrees forward and assume a warriors "waiting position" when a customer is looking at a car when serving customers coffee or tea employees must kneel on the floor with both feet together and both knees on the ground the coffee cup must never make a noise when it is placed on the table toyota controls nearly of japans passenger car market but it is overshadowed by european brands when it comes to luxury cars japans two market leaders bmw and daimlerchrysler ags mercedes benz together sold nearly four times the number of cars as lexus did in japan last year according to csm worldwide an auto industry consulting firm in when toyota launched lexus in japan it was already the best selling luxury brand in the u s but in japan it had very little name recognition the company wanted a way to set lexus apart from the toyota brand so it decided to offer a flavor of customer service that would be difficult for its european rivals to match "japan has a long and isolated history with lots of unique customs we figured we could bring that to the lexus brand " says takeshi yoshida a managing officer at lexus in early toyota approached several etiquette schools that specialize in teaching the art of beautifying daily behavior including the correct way to bow hold chopsticks and sit on a tatami mat floor the company asked the schools to tweak their techniques so that they applied to selling cars most snubbed toyotas request but the ogasawara ryu reihou institute in tokyo agreed to work with the car maker the institutes teachings have been passed down through the family since the s typical clients are well bred families who want their children to learn good table manners and posture the institute also advises mourners on the correct way to behave at japanese funerals keishosai ogasawara the hereditary master of the school says she saw the toyota job as an opportunity to spread the teachings to a wider audience she and her team of etiquette teachers spent months studying the lexus situation the result was a set of instructions and diagrams the etiquette experts determined that a salesperson should stand about two arms lengths from customers when they are looking at a car and come in closer when closing a deal they decided that a salesperson should bow more deeply to a customer who has purchased a car than a casual window shopper when standing idly lexus employees must place their left hand over their right with fingers together and thumbs interlocked a posture originally designed for samurais to show that they were not about to draw their swords "it might seem too strict but each manner has a good reason behind it " says ms ogasawara who inherited her position a decade ago when her great uncle passed away all lexus employees from repairmen to showroom managers learn these and other rules during a three day training course at the fuji lexus college a fortresslike facility perched on the side of snow covered mount fuji at a recent class students held mirrors up to their faces to practice the "lexus face " a peaceful ogasawara style closed mouth smile said to put customers at ease "the japanese arent so good at smiling so we need to practice this one a lot " said kiyotaka koyama the dignified gray haired director of the college hiroshi mase says he was initially impressed by the service he received during a recent visit to a dealership in yokohama the technology company executive loved being served tea and cake as if he were a celebrity but he says it became overbearing when he went to pick up his new lexus gs hybrid and a sales associate gave him a bouquet and held a formal ceremony to hand over the key a photo of mr mase with his new car and the showrooms staff was framed and presented to him "it was just too much " says mr mase lexus sales in japan have gotten off to a slow start last year toyota sold about lexus vehicles just half of what analysts had projected toyota says it takes a long time to establish a new luxury brand and that it is gradually laying the foundation for long term growth part of the problem is that toyota has never been associated with luxury in japan toyota officials say theyre hoping to invigorate sales by putting an even bigger emphasis on the ogasawara method the company is sending employees for refresher courses and some dealerships are offering flower arranging classes and traditional tea ceremonies in stores marketing materials now tout its more than spotless showrooms which feature marble floors and lounges with leather couches in contrast european car makers have small showrooms in tokyo where real estate is expensive and rely more on house visits to sell their upscale models some lexus employees say learning traditional etiquette was overwhelming at first yuka miyazaki a lexus sales consultant in tokyo says it took time but she eventually became so accustomed to the manners she sometimes cant shake them when she goes out "i was at a coffee shop with friends the other night " says ms miyazaki "and i bowed with both hands crossed at the waitress " ms ogasawara says that in the past year new employees at smaller showrooms have complained that there isnt enough space around tables to kneel on both knees to serve a customer but they dont want to be rude and serve a customer while standing up lexus acknowledges that the ogasawara method has some drawbacks "perceiving customers and realizing when they want to be left alone is something we have to work on " says takeshi kasuga assistant manager in human resources at lexus
