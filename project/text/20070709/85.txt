your money matters a special report kids &amp money when theres a theft on the job my teenager came home from his after school job recently distraught that money was missing from the cash register he had been tending and worried that his boss might think he had stolen it after brooding about it overnight he announced he would demonstrate his honesty by having the money taken out of his next paycheck "no dont " i yelped it turns out we should have had that conversation before he began the job about million high school and college aged kids will hold jobs this summer almost half of them in retailing or the hospitality industry according to the u s bureau of labor statistics most will have access to the cash register or the stock room thousands of kids also open and close businesses many colleges think so highly of the responsibility that they ask about it on application forms and presumably factor it into their decisions that responsibility comes with risks though temple university psychologist laurence steinberg a leading researcher into adolescent behavior says many teens rationalize their low pay and lousy hours by stealing a t shirt or dipping into the till but perils also exist for a teenaged straight arrow stuff happens cash registers come up short inventory shrinks and when it does mr steinberg says the typical teenager is far likelier to make a false confession than is an adult blame that on the developing teenaged brain "kids are hyper sensitive to others views of them " he says caught in an upsetting experience their first impulse is to get it behind them even if it means confessing to something they didnt do but that confession can have lifelong consequences including affecting future college and job decisions most seriously of course is that an employer can file a criminal complaint if that happens a false confession becomes almost impossible to retract "its hard once you have confessed to convince an employer or a court that its not true " says kimberly thomas an assistant clinical professor at the university of michigan law school "the defense is that you were lying " that confession doesnt have to be written and signed either just offering to repay the missing cash or replace the missing t shirt "looks like a confession to me " says ms thomas a youngster who is accused of a crime will go through juvenile court where proceedings generally arent public but a or year old could be headed for adult court state laws vary on the age of adulthood and there the consequences could include jail time and a permanent criminal record sure adults face the same consequences but teens seem especially marked by a record because many college and student loan applications ask about criminal convictions and a "yes" to that question could upset college and career dreams even if the boss hasnt gone to the police he or she still could fire the teenager write a negative reference to future employers or college admissions officers or bad mouth the teen around town temples mr steinberg says for many kids an employer is perhaps the first adult they meet who doesnt have a stake in their development unlike parents teachers and coaches "the store owner doesnt much care kids in these jobs are completely fungible " he says that may make for a good life lesson part of growing up is learning to deal with people who dont really care about you and your feelings but its also a lesson that parents should at least prepare an adolescent to face and in the event of a cash short till help him or her resolve experts say i should have had a talk with my teen before he started that job did he know he was expected to reconcile the cash register tape and the cash on hand had his boss told him what to do if he spotted or even suspected a shoplifter what if he noticed that inventory was missing from the stock room in most cases mr steinberg says parents should give behind the scenes counsel but let their teens handle the problem the obvious exception is illegal activity what if the teen suspected that his boss was selling drugs or molesting an employee that requires the parent go to the authorities if workplace suspicion is turned on a teen mr steinberg advises parents to help the youngster rehearse what to say and heres where the caution about a confession comes in "instead of solving the problem by repaying the money the teen should say i didnt do it can i talk to my parents about this " says the university of michigans ms thomas thats a hard notion for most teens to swallow however the job is an expression of their growing independence and calling in their parents seems to signal retreat back to my son he took my advice and didnt offer to repay the missing money his boss reviewed the videotape from a camera focused on the cash register it showed a couple pulling an old scam distracting my son with questions joshing and chatter and in the hubbub getting him to give them their change twice the boss took no action against my son who shied from cash register duty whenever he could after that it was a tough lesson ms kronholz is a staff reporter in the wall street journals washington bureau she can
