mindful of south korea japan considers seeking u s trade agreement tokyo the free trade pact signed by south korea and the u s in april is worrying japan which fears the deal could leave it on the outside looking in the agreement which is awaiting congressional action would abolish u s tariffs on korean made flat tv screens putting japan at a disadvantage for every flat tv japanese makers export to the u s they unlike their korean competitors would still have to pay a tariff the pact would also exclude cars imported from korea from a tariff that would continue to apply to japanese made vehicles "we cant get left behind korea " says an official at japans ministry of economy trade and industry "japan is worried about this " such thinking underscores how much japan has changed since its trade battles with the u s over autos electronics and farm products that raged for a decade until the mid s it also shows japan realizes that it needs to change to remain competitive with a shrinking work force and growing number of elderly to support japans only hope to maintain its living standards is to make more effective use of its land workers and capital economists say that means gaining the best access possible to export markets freeing up acreage now devoted to the countrys highly inefficient farms and reducing the large sums its consumers currently pay for food a successful conclusion to the world trade organizations global trade talks could help japan achieve some of those goals but after the failure of several efforts to secure a breakthrough in the stalled global talks japan like other countries is pursuing bilateral free trade pacts the agreements typically abolish restrictions such as tariffs and quotas on trade in most goods and services between two countries for japan a deal with the u s would be the biggest possible fta a study by the peterson institute for international economics in washington estimated such an agreement could boost japanese economic output by some lately the idea has gained the attention of japans leaders prime minister shinzo abes main economic policy committee recommended last month that the country "consider" free trade pacts with the u s and the european union a few business groups already favor a u s japan free trade agreement the u s japan business council and the influential nippon keidanren the japan business federation came out over the past year in support of an economic partnership agreement which would include free trade a u s japan free trade deal would link the worlds two biggest economies which together produce a third of global output it could mark a huge opportunity for american farmers by giving japanese consumers access to lower cost food from the u s proponents of a u s japan deal are thinking well into the future for a start the u s free trade agreement with korea might not pass in congress because of concerns about its potential impact on the u s auto industry whats more the bush administrations fast track authority on trade agreements which limits congress to an up or down vote on such deals expired at the end of june in practical terms that means any further bilateral trade deals will likely have to wait until president bushs successor takes over in january that could easily be someone who isnt keen on free trade pacts hillary clinton who wants the democratic nomination has already declared her opposition to the deal with korea japans farm lobby is still its biggest homegrown opponent of trade liberalization but is no longer as powerful as it once was japanese farms average just acres in size minuscule compared with the u s average of acres making them relatively inefficient as a result food tends to be far more costly in japan the cheapest rice in japanese supermarkets typically costs about &# a pound compared with less than a third that in the u s in the past lobbying efforts by japanese industries and farm groups were highly influential but electoral reforms in eroded the influence of lobby groups by making it harder for lawmakers to campaign on single issues as a result these lobbying groups have lost much of their clout according to hirofumi kobayashi a trade policy manager at the central union of agricultural co operatives in tokyo lobbying groups used to be able to deliver a million or so votes in a voting population of some million but can now only manage to even so japan has so far avoided big food producers in the free trade pacts it has reached in recent years with trading partners starting with the city state of singapore it has since signed similar agreements with other countries ranging from mexico to thailand and is expected to sign a trade accord with indonesia in august tokyo recently started negotiating with australia a major exporter of farm products to test whether such a deal was possible the idea has already panicked the japanese farm lobby the ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries released a study late last year estimating that such an agreement would wipe out japans wheat and beet sugar producers and halve domestic dairy and beef production a free trade accord with the u s would have even broader consequences the u s extends as far north and as far south as japan meaning american farmers can produce most of the products that japanese producers can from wheat and milk in the north to pineapples and oranges in the south some advisers to mr abes administration think the challenge would do japans farmers some good by forcing them to change the way they do business one reason japanese farms are currently so tiny is that corporations arent allowed to own farmland something the agricultural union opposes that prohibition makes it hard for large farms with economies of scale to develop and government advisers say the law should be changed the japanese government report suggesting a trade deal with the u s also called for reform of the agriculture sector "without fearing globalization "
