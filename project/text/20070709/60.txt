the evening wrap growing rifts over iraq online edition president bush is facing a growing revolt among republican lawmakers calling for a change in his iraq strategy and the rapidly shifting mood in washington appears to be unnerving government leaders in baghdad the white house today denied news reports that it was debating its options for withdrawing american troops from iraq "thats a story that got way ahead of the facts frankly " spokesman tony snow said "the president has said many times that as conditions require and merit there will be in fact withdrawals and also pulling back from areas of baghdad and so on but the idea were trying to make a political judgment rather than a military judgment about forces in the field is simply not true " with an interim assessment due sunday of the american troop surge into troubled iraqi areas including baghdad and the restive al anbar province and the congress preparing once more to consider legislation mandating timelines for withdrawal a number of senior republican lawmakers have voiced dissatisfaction with the progress of the surge and of the iraqi government in passing reconciliation measures and standing up a military sen pete domenici r n m once a stalwart supporter of the white houses iraq policy publicly broke with the president last week sen lamar alexander r tenn and sen judd gregg r n h were also reported to be agitating for a change joining republican war critics like sen richard lugar of indiana the white house is trying to lower expectations for the interim report which is expected to indicate how the government of iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki is faring in meeting political economic and other benchmarks set forth early this year when mr bush announced the troop buildup mr snow said that the full increase in forces has only recently been completed and that it is too early to draw conclusions about its success "you are not going to expect all the benchmarks to be met at the beginning of something " he said while also indicating that sept when a more comprehensive report from gen david petraeus is expected wouldnt be the "drop dead date" for iraqs meeting all of the benchmarks but the administration is under increasing pressure to produce signs of progress from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle sen susan collins the maine republican said there had been "a steady erosion for the presidents policy" on capitol hill due to the "tremendous loss of life among our troops " top democrats in congress are readying a number of war votes this week an earlier attempt to push through a withdrawal timeline ended with a bush veto the maliki government is watching developments in washington with growing worry foreign minister hoshyar zebari warned that a quick exit by american forces could cause the collapse of iraqs already frail coalition government and provoke all out civil war "we have held discussions with members of congress and explained to them the dangers of a quick pullout " mr zebari said "in our estimations until iraqi forces are ready there is a responsibility on the united states to stand with the iraqi government as the forces are being built " but at the same time baghdad may be taking steps that will make the violence in that country even worse after a weekend in which terror attacks left more than dead the government encouraged iraqi civilians to take up arms to defend themselves a move which could cause even greater danger for u s and iraqi troops patrolling violent divided regions of the country over a dozen people died in attacks in baghdad
