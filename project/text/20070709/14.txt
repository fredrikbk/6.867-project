give the surge a chance this week democrats on capitol hill are expected to present several different bills meant to undermine the war in iraq i fear that it will be difficult for americans to discern the facts as members on the hill including some republicans will revisit past failures and lament unfortunate losses rather than undertake a serious critique of the new counterinsurgency strategy why because for some members of congress there is a growing fear that gen david petraeus just might have a winning strategy in iraq despite four years of failed policy the strategy we have in iraq today is sound both in principle and in practice as my combat tour in iraq confirmed gen petraeus is bringing safety and stability to baghdad and anbar province putting insurgents on the run now its a question of whether house speaker nancy pelosi senate majority leader harry reid and wobbly republicans will give him the time and resources he needs so before the debate reconvenes i thought a brief refutation of the top four iraq falsehoods would be instructive falsehood no the "surge" is already a failure fact the surge is just beginning all of the brigades gen petraeus requested have only been in place since mid june and already there are promising indicators since january sectarian murders are substantially down arms caches are being found at three times the rate of last year and young sunnis and shiites are joining the iraqi security forces in record numbers falsehood no gen petraeus believes the military has done all it can do in iraq fact sen reid often quotes gen petraeus to support his position that the war is "lost " but a fair survey of gen petraeuss remarks confirms that he believes the u s military must set the conditions for political progress the ultimate solution to iraqs problem is political reconciliation which can only come with the improvements in security the surge is designed to achieve falsehood no the u s is playing insurgent "whack a mole" throughout iraq fact gen petraeuss mission is called the baghdad security plan for a reason its limited aim is to pacify iraqs capital and center of gravity thereby shifting the countrys balance of power the strategy is for u s and iraqi forces to clear multiple insurgent safe havens in and around baghdad at once to prevent insurgents from relocating then to maintain security by remaining within the communities and building trust with the locals who were being intimidated by sunni insurgents and shiite militiamen falsehood no u s troops are not fighting an enemy in iraq just policing a "civil war " fact americas enemies are invested in our defeat in iraq al qaeda leaders like osama bin laden and ayman al zawahiri say they want to "expel the americans from iraq" and establish a "caliphate" to "extend the jihad to the secular countries neighboring iraq " these killers are intent on spreading their violent ideology and believe stoking sectarian violence is the best way to achieve their goals al qaeda may only make up of the insurgency in iraq but what they lack in numbers they make up for in lethality gen petraeus has said that " to of suicide bombers are foreign fighters " and by neutralizing them we could stomp out the low level civil war in light of these facts our country faces an important decision listen to david petraeus and the generals in iraq who believe we finally have a winning strategy that will take time to execute or bow to the political demands of republicans and democrats in congress who are more interested in avoiding defeat in their home districts than defeating al qaeda &amp co in iraq gen petraeus promised a candid report in september until then for the same senators who unanimously confirmed him and his counterinsurgency strategy in january to undercut his efforts is extremely irresponsible and exposes how quickly war time leadership can transform into election season pandering mr hegseth a first lieutenant in the army national guard and executive director of vetsforfreedom org served in iraq with the st airborne division from september to july
