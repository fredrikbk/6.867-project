sham a lot in one of the vice presidential debates during the campaign republican dan quayle attempted to fend off the argument that he was too young for the office of vice president by noting that he had served in congress as long as john f kennedy when he had become president this allowed his opponent senator lloyd bentsen to reply "senator i served with jack kennedy i knew jack kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine senator youre no jack kennedy " the riposte has since become famous it is probably the only thing for which bentsen is remembered but when he said "senator youre no jack kennedy " i thought "thats all right jack kennedy wasnt really jack kennedy either at least not the way he is presented to us today " as someone with a vivid memory of kennedys brief and lackluster term as president i have been amused over the following years to watch the myth of the greatness of john f kennedy grow here was a president who initiated no impressive programs was less than notably courageous in coming to the aid of civil rights workers in the south got the nation enmeshed in one of the most unpopular wars in our history vietnam and brought it to the edge of nuclear war in a probably unnecessary war of nerves with nikita khrushchev over the installation of soviet missiles in cuba in short john f kennedy was a president who based on the decisions he made or didnt have the courage to make while in office deserves to go down as one of the resoundingly mediocre figures in american presidential history and so he would have done but for the one brilliant decision he did make to surround himself with a staff of harvard men and cambridge intellectuals who continue to supply him with an unrelenting public relations build up a powerful pr man named ben sonnenberg used to say apropos of his clients that he made large pedestals for small men mr sonnenberg could have learned a thing or two from the kennedy staff men to invent a greater camelot alas one has to sham a lot arthur schlesinger jr john kenneth galbraith richard goodwin and theodore sorensen were among the circle around kennedy a president the british humorist malcolm muggeridge called "the loved one" who have kept pumping away at his already inflated reputation scheslinger who started out in life as an historian and ended up as a courtier worked most assiduously at this project writing thick overly dramatized books on both jack and bobby kennedy books with a very low truth quotient but everyone pitched in all had a stake for the greater they could make john f kennedy seem the more heightened would the drama of their own lives appear the kennedy public relations juggernaut continues to roll recent evidence of it is found in the july august issue of washington monthly its cover story "the speech i wish the winner would give " was written by mr sorenson who is best known for the phrase planted in his bosss inaugural address "ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country " he is only in america the countrys most famous ghostwriter or if you prefer its most noted political ventriloquist the speech mr sorenson would write for the democratic presidential nominee contains neither surprises in the realm of policy nor lilting turns of speech instead it would have the candidate essentially avow that he will do nothing george w bush has done the speech is then the usual canned goods notable only for straining after the kennedyesque tone its final paragraph begins "im told that john f kennedy was fond of quoting archimedes " yet in its very insubstantiality it reminds one of how the kennedy administrations insignificant years in office and the decades long public relations campaign that followed it have skewered and ultimately helped wreck the democratic party john f kennedy &amp co took the party up market making it an ivy league and later a hollywood operation after the kennedy administration the democrats were no longer the party of the little man harry trumans party or the party of the underdog franklin delano roosevelts party but that of the intellectual and cultural sahibs pretending to speak for the little man and the underdogs because it makes them feel virtuous to do so they turn politics into an affair of snobbery where politicians are judged on elegance not substance one recalls how much of an outsider the kennedy people made lyndon baines johnson feel lbj that vulgar texan who attended southwest texas state teachers college because of the regularity with which john f kennedys name is invoked by his skillful pr flacks the democrats keep turning up rather anemic kennedy imitators michael dukakis walter mondale john kerry with only an occasional genuine hustler like bill clinton popping up almost by accident to head their presidential tickets but the criteria for president of the united states arent the same as those set by the deans of admission at harvard or yale brown or duke the happy snobbery of feeling culturally superior and morally virtuous that is at the heart of the kennedy myth shouldnt be what politics is about mr epstein is the author most recently of "alexis de tocqueville democracys guide" eminent lives see related letters "letters to the editor camelot up close what could have been and what really was" wsj july
