viacoms mtv tunes into rating system cable network to use new data on ad viewers for upfront time sales when nielsen media research proposed releasing ratings to measure viewing of tv commercials last year most major cable networks were a little resistant skeptical of the validity of the data as recently as june philippe dauman ceo of viacom owner of cable giant mtv networks suggested the new ratings system wasnt ready to be used in ad negotiations his concern was understandable since nielsen began releasing commercial ratings at the end of may the figures have shown that cable television channels which tend to have longer advertising breaks than broadcast networks lose more viewers during breaks than broadcasters mtv and its sibling music channel vh have seen particularly big defections so it was significant when it emerged in recent days that mtv networks had followed other cable network groups in agreeing to negotiate "upfront" ad sales deals for the coming fall season at least partly based on commercial ratings the move by other networks to use the data made the mtv group realize it would have to acquiesce said a person familiar with the situation as of friday mtv networks had finalized of its upfront deals people familiar with the matter said during the upfront period cable networks sell about half of their ad inventory for the coming season mtv will use traditional program ratings for the fourth quarter of this year the beginning of the season and take commercial ratings into account for deals for the first three quarters of next year the people said news of mtvs decision was reported by mediapost an online media publication overall about half to two thirds of the cable upfront market was done by friday and should be wrapped up this week media buyers said the majority of the cable deals are based on ratings of both programs and commercial breaks as was the case with the broadcast upfront which concluded a couple of weeks ago the industrys widespread acceptance of the data reflects pressures on tv networks to slow the flow of ad dollars from television to the web advertisers like commercial ratings because they want more information on who is watching their commercials particularly at a time when digital video recorders make it easy for households to speed through ads commercial ratings include viewing on dvrs as long as three days after broadcast of a program and the accompanying ads the big question still to be answered is whether commercial ratings are affecting the prices that advertisers are paying for airtime media buyers had predicted the new data would lead to lower ad prices instead several networks including most of the broadcast networks and some cable channels have won price increases executives said cable networks are generally doing better in the upfront than last year when &# billion was committed overall the improvement is due to advertisers shifting money previously allocated for the "scatter" market for ads bought closer to air date into the upfront media buyers and tv executives said but some of the price increases may reflect how commercial ratings are starting to influence the allocation of ad dollars between networks in favor of networks that lose fewer viewers in their ad breaks over time such a reallocation should favor broadcast networks which on average lose about of their viewers during ad breaks compared with for cable networks according to a report by interpublic groups magna global the difference likely reflects the fact that cable networks air longer ad breaks on average than their broadcast competitors within the cable sector networks whose audiences skew older and air more dramas like lifetime television and usa networks are likely to fare better with the new data than some younger skewing networks like mtv in the most recent week of data from nielsen lifetime for instance lost only of its viewers during commercial breaks compared with for mtv lifetime quickly embraced use of commercial ratings and is pleased with the results "instead of sitting there and fighting commercial ratings we went for it " said john matluck senior vice president of advertising and sales the network which has nearly completed its upfront talks said it won price increases in the high single digits to low double digits on higher volume lifetime has struggled with weak ratings in recent years although its new show "army wives" has proved popular mtv networks upfront performance will be difficult to assess one media buyer said because of the mix of data in its deals still certain channels within the mtv group are likely to be under pressure with the new data including the flagship mtv channel whose ad breaks last year were longer than at other major tv networks mtv has time to reformat programs and commercial set ups to lift viewership before ad deals based on commercial ratings kick in at the start of next year it is already doing things like shortening the length of commercial time and working more closely with advertisers in program and commercial content other cable networks are contemplating similar steps
