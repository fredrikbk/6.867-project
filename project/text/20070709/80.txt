your money matters a special report nest egg seven myths about college financial aid we cant afford the tuition and were not poor enough to qualify for financial aid ill have to refinance my house there goes my retirement money these are just a few of the depressing assumptions that come to mind when parents consider how to pay for college and with good reason as tuition continues to rise faster than the rate of inflation this past school year average total tuition and fees at private colleges rose to &# more than the previous year add room and board and that cost climbs to &# often families resort to these assumptions because the system for financing a college education is too complicated to get their arms around education secretary margaret spellings speaking before a house education panel in may said the federal student aid system she oversees "is redundant its byzantine and its broken " consider for instance that there are two different systems of federal student loan distribution and whether you use banks for these loans or borrow directly from the federal government depends entirely on what college you attend then there are the confusing pros and cons associated with the different tax advantaged college savings vehicles roth iras plans and coverdell education savings accounts add to that the varied ways your finances will be considered from the education departments assessment for federal financial aid purposes to some schools use of their own formula to figure out how to parcel out their own aid and now can you even trust your colleges financial aid office anymore a nationwide probe by new york attorney general andrew cuomo has led more than two dozen schools to settle claims of deceptive trade practices involving alleged undisclosed payments to fi nancial aid officers from lenders they recommended to students the unfortunate result of all this is that many families dont even bother trying to find their way through the maze instead they make their assumptions and those assumptions are often wrong here we deconstruct some of the most common myths myth no financial aid comes only in the form of grants and scholarships many families think that "aid" means only money that doesnt have to be paid back and that they wont qualify for based on need but while scholarships and grants certainly are the best form of financial aid aid can also come in the form of federal loans that carry favorable interest rates and that can be available regardless of need the most common student loan is the stafford loan the unsubsidized variety of these loans doesnt require the student to demonstrate need but they are available only to those who have filled out the so called fafsa form the free application for federal student aid which is something many middle and upper income families dont bother to do the interest rate on stafford loans is currently set at a maximum of by comparison the rate on loans from private lenders isnt capped and currently averages around at some of the biggest lenders for a &# loan thats a difference of about &# over the typical year life of a loan federal student loans also carry more flexible repayment terms than loans from private lenders for instance a borrower who is unemployed or facing economic hardship can request a deferment which allows the borrower to postpone repaying the loan for certain loan programs the interest still accrues and the borrower is eventually responsible for paying it for others the government pays the interest during the deferment there are even loan forgiveness programs available for borrowers who take some teaching jobs or who enter public service the federal teacher loan forgiveness program allows certain math science and special education teachers in low income schools to qualify for up to &# toward the repayment of their student loans in addition many states offer loan forgiveness programs for their resident teachers the american federation of teachers maintains a list of state by state offerings at aft org teachers jft loanforgiveness htm certain public service organizations offer their own loan forgiveness programs such as americorps which will grant volunteers with at least one year of service as much as &# toward loan repayments or future tuition one drawback of federal student loans is that there are limits on how much can be borrowed this way but congress recently moved to raise the cap for some students effective this month the annual limits on stafford loans for dependent freshmen and sophomores are &# and &# respectively up from &# and &# juniors and seniors can borrow up to &# a year if student loans arent enough to cover expenses parents of undergraduates are also entitled to federal loans the plus loan has the benefit of not carrying any set borrowing limits though the total cant exceed the cost of attendance minus other forms of aid and the interest rate is set at a maximum of just remember its the parent not the student on the hook for repayment myth no the value of my retirement funds and my home will prevent me from getting need based aid under the federal calculus for distributing aid retirement plans are completely excluded so is the home you live in on top of that the federal government shelters a certain amount of general parent savings for retirement purposes this "asset protection allowance" varies based on age but for a typical parent of a college age child the figure is around &# to &# many private colleges use a separate form to determine how much of their own aid to distribute it also excludes retirement assets but it does ask for the net home equity of the familys primary residence capping it at two to three times annual income myth no i should choose a lender from the list of "preferred" lending companies recommended by my college financial aid office because of the complexity of the whole aid process many people trust their colleges financial aid office to provide them with information on loans and point them to the best deals but the new york attorney generals probe and investigations by members of congress suggest that lenders havent always been recommended by financial aid officers based entirely on students interests so you may want to do at least some shopping for loans on your own lenders compete with one another largely by offering "borrower benefits" that lower the costs of their loans but borrowers should be skeptical of some of these discounts which can be easy to lose if a student misses a payment citigroup inc s citibank offers a discount of one percentage point on the interest rate of a stafford loan but a student who misses a scheduled payment loses the discount and has to make consecutive payments on time in order to regain it nelnet inc offers a reduction on the original principal balance if the first payments are made on time once the discount is lost it cannot be regained some deals are more forgiving northstar education finance inc of st paul minn offers a month by month credit on its student loans that can amount to an annual rate reduction of up to percentage points students lose the credit only if they fall days past due on a payment once the borrower is caught up again on payments the benefit resumes myrichuncle a new york lender cuts one percentage point off the interest rate on its stafford loan from the start of repayment but charges an origination fee totaling of the original principal balance that other lenders might waive because the discounting formulas vary markedly from one company to the next it can be extremely difficult to calculate the best deal mark kantrowitz publisher of finaid org a free guide to financial aid has come up with a calculator on his web site that allows consumers to punch in various criteria to compare discounts from the different companies myth no im doomed ill have two kids in college at the same time the federal assessment of aid eligibility is based on an "expected family contribution" the amount of money that parents are expected to shell out based on their financial picture that expected outlay stays the same no matter how many kids you have in college at the same time so if you have two or more kids attending college your expected contribution is split among them the upshot you are likely to qualify for more aid when you have multiple children in college at once myth no the federal aid process is bound by a strict formula and its virtually impossible to eke any special consideration out of college administrators while its true that everyone applying for federal aid must answer the same questions on the fafsa there may be special circumstances worth alerting the college financial aid office to the higher education act which authorizes federal aid programs gives college aid officers the authority to make adjustments when they feel its warranted if you have a solid case backed up by documentation its definitely worth requesting a "professional judgment review" in a letter addressed to the financial aid officer and supported by documentation for example if your income looks artificially high in the year thats being evaluated explain why perhaps it was due to an atypical bonus and provide previous tax returns to show what its normally like other instances not covered by the fafsa and worth alerting the financial aid office to high medical costs a death private school tuition for kids not yet in college divorce job loss a big decrease in family income amherst college financial aid director joe paul case recalls adjusting one aid package as the students family reeled from the impact of the fathers work related accident which occurred in the students sophomore year the accident left the father out of work for six months by reassessing the familys finances mr case says the school was able to bolster his financial aid through both federal sources and institutional grant money new york based financial aid consultant kalman a chany had one client this year with household income over &# receiving need based aid in part due to high medical costs and an atypical bonus that distorted the clients income stream myth no not to worry our brilliant talented athletic child will get plenty of privately funded scholarships maybe even a free ride some of parents are counting on their children receiving scholarship or grant money according to a survey by mathew greenwald &amp associates inc for investment management firm alliancebernstein lp the firm polled parents last summer as well as more than college financial aid administrators the responses from financial aid officers told a remarkably different story of them believed that parents overestimate the amount of scholarship and grant money their children will receive that is not to say you shouldnt search in fact there are several scholarship search services available free online sites like fastweb fastweb com or the college boards scholarship search service collegeboard com match student profiles to scholarship opportunities myth no the college savings plan offered by my state is bound to be the best for me many peoples search for a plan stops with their own states offering but with all states and washington d c now offering these college savings plans consumers should shop around some states offer their own tax breaks on these plans for state residents so it is smart to take a good look at your own state plan but you should also take a hard look at the fees most experts say you should pay no more than of assets in fees and other expenses high fee plans can easily cancel out any tax breaks that come with investing in your own state plan morningstar inc the chicago based financial information firm rates the following state plans among the best because of their low fees and the performance of their investments the utah educational savings plan the maryland college investment plan and the college savings plan of nebraska and you can invest in any one of these three directly without the help of a broker ms chaker is a staff reporter in the wall street journals washington
