financial planning html here are some thoughts from lawyers accountants and organizing experts on how to be better organized including what documents to keep where to keep them and for how long getting started start by compiling a list of key people to call including relatives physicians and lawyers in case of emergency i carry around such a list in my wallet i started doing this after a family friend was hit by a car on park avenue in new york city many years ago she had no personal identification papers on her fortunately a woman who had witnessed the accident raced to her side and asked her just before she passed out if there was someone who should be contacted our friend gave her the name and phone number of one of her sons who raced to the scene our friend survived and told me that her saga underscores the importance of having a "loved ones" list with you whenever possible consider photocopying all your credit cards and other important items you carry in your wallet if you lose your wallet or its stolen youll know exactly whats missing and how to contact the credit card companies store this list in a safe place at home with other details including the location of any unused gift certificates you have received as well as your point totals for frequent flier or other similar programs make sure to tell your family and advisers where you keep important documents such as your will health care proxy living will insurance policies household inventory deeds to property and important tax records be sure to include the location of your bank safe deposit box and where you have stored the key its not enough just to compile these lists make sure to update them regularly says stephanie winston a professional organizer based in new york city and author of several books on the subject including "getting organized " the book i somehow managed to lose beware of mindless clutter ms winston says she recommends a paper handling system called "traf " which means toss refer act or file while it may feel good to save everything that could backfire if you cant find what you need in a hurry pay attention to security store your information in a safe place all your careful organizing plans can easily backfire if you allow your information to fall into the wrong hands if you use a palm pilot as i do use passwords to protect all the information youve stored there if you store your list on your computer be sure its password protected also be sure to print out copies regularly and give them to a trusted relative or adviser wills and other documents lawyers constantly marvel at how many highly intelligent people dont have a will and at how many people who do have wills havent updated them for decades granted nobody likes thinking about this subject and lawyers say clients often are superstitious those clients fear that if they draw up a will or update it theyre sure to die on the spot but remember when someone dies without a will or without an up to date will that can lead to lengthy family feuds even over seemingly insignificant details another reason many people dont have a will is theyre uncomfortable discussing such delicate subjects with children and other family members get over it failing to have this conversation is an invitation to trouble consider giving the original copy of your will to your lawyer or some other trusted adviser along with the location of key documents make sure to tell your heirs what youve done dont put the only signed copy in your safe deposit box your heirs will need to get the will quickly take the time to make sure you have a well written power of attorney and pick someone you trust completely check with your lawyer to make sure that any power of attorney form you sign does precisely what you want it to do for example if you want the person holding your power of attorney to be able to make gifts of money or other property on your behalf say so in writing while state laws may vary be as precise as possible on this subject and remember that a power of attorney isnt just for the elderly sudden illness or accidents can strike at any age making it important that someone be authorized to manage your finances if you move to another state make sure to get a thorough financial check up from a pro just to make sure you dont need to make important revisions above all act now while youre healthy and be careful whom you select to help you one of the classic mistakes is to wait until you get sick to start thinking about a power of attorney and other tough topics updating your finances buy and hold may be a commonly recommended strategy on wall street but not when organizing your finances with all the swings in financial markets these days its important to update your finances regularly one area many people overlook u s savings bonds they sound simple but they bear close watching for example many investors own savings bonds that stopped paying interest years ago the treasury estimates that as of april savings bonds worth around &# billion had stopped earning interest and were still in the hands of investors to learn about the status of your bonds go to a treasury department web site savingsbonds gov click on the section "individual personal " and then click on "find out if your treasury securities have matured " there youll find tables that will help you figure out whether your bonds are still earning interest or for how long you can expect them to earn interest if you own any bonds that no longer are earning interest be sure to cash them in or exchange them as soon as possible also check to see whether you or other family members own any stock certificates representing shares in companies that have gone bust even though those certificates may be worthless they may help cut your taxes if you dont claim a loss for a worthless security on your original return for the year in which it actually became worthless "you can file a claim for a credit or refund due to the loss " the irs says use form x to "amend" your return for the year in which the security became worthless but keep in mind that you must file it "within seven years from the date your original return for that year had to be filed or two years from the date you paid the tax whichever is later " the irs says heres another idea if you have stock certificates for enron or other well known corporate disasters consider trying to sell them to collectors through an online auction tax records most people should keep their federal income tax returns for at least three years but accountants and lawyers often recommend that clients keep returns for at least six years thats because the irs can go back that far if you didnt report taxable income you should have reported and its more than of the income shown on your return check to see if your state tax department has different rules theres no time limit if you file a return that is false or fraudulent or if you dont bother filing a return at all in that case "an action can generally be brought at any time " the irs says some supporting documents need to be stored for much longer periods for example keep detailed records of how much you paid for your stocks bonds mutual fund shares and other investments you havent yet sold when you sell them you will need those records to establish whats known as your "cost basis " also be sure to keep records of what you paid for your home and the cost of any improvements before throwing away old tax returns check to make sure the social security administration has accurate records of how much youve earned each year if you get a form w from your employer keep copy c until you begin receiving social security benefits the irs advises "this will help protect your benefits in case there is a question about your work record or earnings in a particular year " the irs says in publication also see publication irs gov for more details when you do pitch old returns make sure to shred them carefully so that they dont fall into the wrong hands miscellaneous tips direct deposit whenever possible have your paycheck dividends interest income tax refund and other income deposited directly into your account rather than having checks sent to you in the mail ms winston says a client whom she was helping to get organized found a &# check that hadnt been cashed fortunately the client was able to get paid paper certificates if you still have stock or bond certificates lying around consider turning them over to your stock broker or the transfer agent and having them transformed into electronic digits that way you dont have to worry about losing the certificates filing taxes online filing electronically usually means speedier refunds and greater accuracy irs workers after all dont have to type your information into their systems more than half of all returns filed to the irs each year now are filed electronically three key points update regularly back up your records regularly
