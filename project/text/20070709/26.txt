libby has a chance to clear his name your july editorial "bush and libby" may have missed a significant point had president bush pardoned mr libby something he can still do before leaving office by the way it would have rendered mr libbys appeal of his conviction moot the commutation allows mr libby to continue to pursue his vindication in court given the egregious behavior of the prosecutor patrick fitzgerald and the questionable rulings on evidence and witnesses by the trial judge it seems mr libby may well succeed in his appeal and actually clear his name i could have done without the holier than thou preaching in the presidents announcement but the actual tactic involved here may turn out to be just what is required to correct the injustice done to mr libby tom mcgrath ann arbor mich
