your money matters a special report a little help please for first time home buyers coming up a little short heres one option share the wealth while most people want to own a home young singles and couples often find it impossible to scratch together enough cash to make the purchase more established folks too sometimes discover that the down payment for their dream house is just too big a nut to crack it doesnt have to be that way simple financial strategies exist that allow disadvantaged buyers to split the cost of a house by sharing the wealth "we can do more when we join with other peoples money " says marilyn sullivan a real estate attorney in arroyo grande calif using a form of co ownership known as equity sharing at least two people or entities can own one piece of real estate and the second party often a family member or friend doesnt have to be a resident nor does the second party have to wait until the property is sold in order to benefit from the investment indeed co owners who itemize can use the arrangement to claim deductions on their income tax returns heres how to get by with a little help from a friend basic equity sharing in a traditional equity share arrangement one party occupies the property and pays for all of the expenses while a nonresident investor typically a family member real estate investor or the propertys seller supplies all or a portion of the up front cash mom and dad might agree to bankroll the down payment in return for a proportional share of the homes appreciation when it is sold in some cases the sellers may be willing to take on the investor role if they havent been able to recoup the full value of their house whoever the investor is he or she will want to be named on the title along with the occupant but the investor may not want to be named on the loan being on the loan says andy sirkin a real estate attorney in san francisco may hamper future investments if the investor has other loans since lenders generally consider excessive debt to be risky once the overall financing is taken care of there is the matter of rent and those promised tax benefits in equity sharing the occupant is required by the internal revenue service to pay rent to the investor for the portion of the property that the investor owns the amount depends first on what the property could rent for in the open market say the fair market rental value is &# and the investors ownership stake is that means &# a month is owed to the investor then if the investor pays for expenses such as insurance maintenance association dues and property taxes the rent can just be considered reimbursement for those costs the investor can deduct those expenses from his or her taxable income in an amount equal to and in some cases exceeding the rental income if the deductible expenses which are considered "passive" investment losses add up to more than the rent the excess may be carried over to future years or taken as a deduction against other passive investment gains such as those arising from other rental income or the eventual sale of the property the success of co ownership arrangements hinges on having a well crafted equity sharing agreement which spells out various contingencies the agreement "is critical for managing the tax complexities " says matthew i berger a real estate attorney in santa barbara calif there are potential downsides for investors if the value of the property has declined at the time of the sale the investor must share the loss in addition "they are parking their money and arent seeing any immediate profits " since the rental income is used to fund property expenses says mr berger many equity share or tenancy in common agreements as theyre also called specify that the home has to reach a certain value before it can be sold but the agreements can specify in some cases what both parties responsibilities are if the occupant gets a job transfer at homeequityshare com a web site that matches prospective home buyers with real estate investors individuals making successful connections receive a free equity share agreement custom made agreements prepared by an attorney can cost around &# co occupiers a second kind of strategy is known as a co occupier arrangement in which at least two parties fund a down payment pay subsequent homeownership costs occupy the property together and split the gains or losses from the sale of the home one caveat co occupancy loans are typically shared meaning if one owner skips town the other is liable for the full loan "when you buy something with an unrelated person you are considered to be tenants in common " says alexander laufer a real estate attorney in fairfax va in this way of holding property you can each sell your interest individually and designate who will inherit your interest if you die otherwise your share of the property would pass to the other owner avoid personal loans parents might consider making the down payment themselves thus avoiding the complication of sharing equity but a parent cant give a child more than &# a year without incurring gift tax parents also might think about making the down payment a loan but this is a bad idea for several reasons the interest payments on the loan especially if its from mom or dad wont be tax deductible unless the loan is legally secured by collateral moreover if a mortgage lender is already lined up for the purchase that lender may see the additional loan as increasing the borrowers risk level and so increase its rate and finally the ability to claim deductions and avoid taxes in the event of a property exchange requires being co owners of the property just lending the money says marc j minker an accountant and financial adviser in new york is "squandering a tax deduction "
