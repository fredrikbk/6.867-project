of investors looking to unload annuities they dont need or want and he has seen too many of them do it the wrong way against his advice one client cashed in an annuity in anger when it didnt perform well nine months later the client was shocked to discover he owed taxes on the &# in interest the annuity had earned over almost years "clients sometimes say ill show that insurance company " says mr giffin based in mcmurray pa "its like taking a knife and slicing your own throat " it doesnt have to be that way financial advisers say there are smart ways to get rid of an annuity a contract sold by a life insurance company that guarantees a future lump sum or stream of payments to the investor usually starting at retirement among their suggestions take the time to explore what options you have with the insurer that issued the policy compare bids on the secondary market and make sure you understand such issues as tax consequences there were &# trillion in annuity assets outstanding at the end of according to research from morningstar inc and limra international an association of insurance and financial services companies fixed annuities guarantee that a specific sum of money will be paid each period generally on a monthly basis regardless of fluctuations in the value of the annuity issuers underlying investments variable annuity payments are based on the performance of a chosen investment portfolio therefore payments may fluctuate what drives an annuitant to sell the reasons vary but often center on a shift in financial goals related to a change in life circumstances such as a marriage death or inheritance michael vaughan a managing director at bryn mawr pa based j g wentworth which purchases annuities on the secondary market says the main reason policyholders sell is to meet more pressing needs such as unexpected medical expenses in some cases grandparents may decide they have enough money for themselves and sell an annuity or a portion of one to help pay for their grandchildrens educations annuities can be sold directly back to the insurer or through the secondary market to companies such as j g wentworth peachtree settlement funding settlement capital corp or stone street capital inc policyholders may sell an entire annuity or just part of it still because of complex payment policies as well as surrender charges the fees some insurers charge to cash out many advisers recommend cash strapped investors first tap other sources of money such as a home equity line of credit policyholders should approach annuity sales "very carefully and we would put very carefully in big capital letters " says jack dolan a spokesman for the american council of life insurers a washington based trade group policies may have intricacies such as escalator clauses which provide for payments that increase with inflation or balloon payments which increase at some agreed upon rate he says "all of these issues need to be factored in " he says moshe milevsky a finance professor at york university in toronto says selling an annuity should be a last resort "from a purely financial planning point of view to generate some extra cash let them go to home equity first unfortunately most people dont they look at the home as sacred " determining an annuitys worth can be complicated you must compute its "net present value " which compares the value of a dollar today to the value of that same dollar in the future taking inflation and returns into account you must consider the discount rate or annual effective interest rate that will be used to calculate payments an average deal may have a discount rate of to but the range varies greatly says mr vaughan the size of the payments annuitants collect depends on the amount the annuity will distribute the term of the payout whether or not the annuity includes a death benefit and the issuing insurers financial rating holders already receiving periodic payments from an annuity must consider how much of those payments they need or want to keep an annuitant receiving &# monthly for the next seven years for example may choose to sell just &# of monthly payments for five years and receive a lump sum of &# he would have collected &# on that portion by leaving the annuity intact but by selling he gained the flexibility to use the money for another investment or need when considering the sale of an annuity it is important to contact the issuing insurance company to determine the products cash value an immediate annuity one that begins to make periodic payments as soon as the premium is received may not have any cash value in many cases an insurer wont offer a lump sum once periodic payments have started and a deferred annuity which begins payouts at some point in the future generally at retirement may carry surrender charges mr vaughan says annuities surrender charges vary greatly from the single digits on a percentage basis to as high as though in many cases they decrease over time in response to the emergence of the secondary market and the shifting needs of retirees insurers have begun to offer more flexible annuities in some cases allowing owners to tap their funds for long term health care and other needs so it is important that policyholders understand all of a products nuances before making a move in addition if policyholders were sold annuities that were just plain unsuitable because of their age or portfolio mix they may be able to get out of the purchases altogether by contacting regulators many people dont realize that some insurers are willing to negotiate says mr giffin if a client really needs &# immediately for example an insurer might be willing to pay that out then continue with regular monthly payments he says "we tell people who are in debt up to their butt make phone calls talk politely ask good questions get over being mad and lets see if we can get smart let me try to negotiate a good number for you " he says after determining what the insurer is willing to pay a policyholder may then want to contact a reputable secondary buyer to determine if the policy can be sold in that market and if so what it is worth a policyholder should seek more than one bid the purchase price on the secondary market is based on the policys contract terms and interest rates and can vary widely typically between and of the asset value of the annuity estimates mr vaughan some contracts cant be sold on the secondary market they include annuities purchased with after tax dollars such as those in tax qualified retirement accounts anyone selling an annuity should understand the tax consequences neil elmouchi a financial adviser in westlake village calif says a client once called him about liquidating a variable annuity with a small surrender charge that he had held in an individual retirement account for four or five years because he wanted to pay off some credit card debt "i said do you realize that youre paying off credit with &# for every &# " after taking into account the taxes surrender charge and a ira penalty because the client was younger than it might have cost him at least &# to pay a &# credit card bill "he didnt realize the tax implications " mr elmouchi says annuities also arent tax efficient when it comes to wealth transfer according to mr vaughan because an annuity is considered part of a deceased persons estate as much as could be eaten up by taxes he says in addition any investment gains from the annuity will be taxed at beneficiaries ordinary income tax rates if beneficiaries are at the peak of their earning power that could be as high as mr vaughan says mr giffin however says that if an annuity racks up strong returns taxes wont be an issue "if you put &# in an annuity and when you die its worth &# million "
