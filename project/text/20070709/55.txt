the afternoon report squeezing the pumps online edition nobody is going to be forced to rig up a mast and sail on the roof of their suv for a lack of gas anytime soon but a report today set off another round of worry about dwindling global energy supplies the international energy agency is warning of a possible energy crunch as stockpiles of crude oil and natural gas are being sucked up a robust global expansion the paris based energy watchdog for the worlds most advanced economies forecasts that fuels demand will increase by an average of each year between and up from the agencys earlier prediction of "despite four years of high oil prices this report sees increasing market tightness beyond " the agency warned in the dire sounding update while the report expects that refinery capacity will climb significantly during the next five years leaving the world better able to convert crude oil into refined products like gasoline many of the worlds largest energy producers are seen having little spare capacity to extract crude from the ground the iea expects opecs spare capacity to remain restrained until and to shrink to minimal levels by pumping out only enough extra crude oil to meet the equivalent of about of world demand and the agency forecasts that supply increases from non opec oil producers will start to flag after the agencys outlook assumes that the global economy will expand at roughly a annual rate and it acknowledged that if growth is slower than its forecast the world would have more wiggle room "slower than expected gdp growth may provide a breathing space " the agency said but many of the worlds largest economies have been gathering steam growth is picking up in europe and the u s economy is generally expected to continue to rebound from a lackluster first quarter the booming economies of asian countries such as china and india are stoking energy demand and the iea believes that the thirst for fuel across the middle east will only climb the expected squeeze doesnt seem to be spurring a huge search for alternatives yet the iea believes production of biofuels will more than double from last years mark by but it would still be just million barrels a day a sliver of the million barrels a day in oil demand thats forecast by the warning comes as oil is trading near its peak for the year the front month crude oil futures contract on the new york mercantile exchange settled friday at &# a barrel its highest level since last august and while prices dipped a bit in trading today following the resolution of a kidnapping drama in nigeria the cost of a barrel of oil is still up nearly since the start of this year some critics charge that the ieas report is whipping up anxiety the agency "has put such a fear premium in the market that crude futures remain bought no matter what " olivier jakob of petromatrix told reuters others think that current high prices arent driven so much by nervousness about supply and demand over the medium run as by anxiety about slack refinery use in the u s in the middle of the summer driving season but some believe prices will stay elevated even if those bottlenecks ease "strong demand expectations are keeping sentiment bullish therefore any pullback in energy prices will likely attract a new wave of buyers " michael fitzpatrick of man financial wrote in a note stocks on hold before earnings
