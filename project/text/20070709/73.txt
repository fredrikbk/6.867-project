whatever i want " his weakness is his sweet tooth "i could eat dessert and skip the main meal " he says "my metabolism used to be such that i could get away with that " these days especially since his knee surgeries mr dawson has to watch his weight and says he doesnt indulge as much when he does he makes himself a root beer float he always eats breakfast these days a gatorade nutrition shake with grams of protein he used to skip lunch and just have dinner but in recent years aims to eat a salad or something light for lunch his wife usually makes dinner "im not a meat and potatoes guy " says mr

membership at l a fitness he says he probably spends &# to &# a year on workout clothing basic t shirts and shorts sneakers and gloves for weight lifting he is insured by major league medical which he says covers the majority of his physical therapy costs the effort the physical therapy process is trying both mentally and physically "it tests your patience for sure " says mr dawson he says dropping pounds mostly a loss of muscle after surgery and having to accept lightening his weight load in the gym were mentally challenging and frustrating "but i think the athletic part of me came up " he says "i didnt get discouraged i just looked at it as something i needed to bounce back from " his doctors told him it would take a good year before fully being satisfied with the results and he says after only three months he saw improvement "im at seven months now and want to make sure im completely satisfied before i do the other knee " he says mr dawson is also trying to watch his weight more closely something hes been successful at for most of his post professional ball career "i had a reputation for having really low body fat and when i retired i wanted to keep it low " he says mr dawson retired weighing pounds and said his goal was to maintain a weight in the pound range only once two years ago did he see himself start to slip "i had a inch waist and started to feel a tightness when i buttoned my pants up " he recalls "and i noticed a difference in how i was feeling as well " he immediately started to push himself harder at the gym "i think my body was just going through a different phase something that comes with age " he says "i knew i wasnt always going to have a small waist and be pounds but i didnt want to get to the point where things got out of control " the benefit "i just never lost the drive to continue to take care of myself " says mr dawson "i want to look a certain way and feel a certain way and its hard to keep up the pace as you get older you dont have as much energy as when you were younger but i just have the attitude that im going to do something every day " write to jen murphy at workout wsj com
