u s studies ways to formally end the korean war norths positive signals on disarmament raise regional security hopes washington as the bush administration pushes ahead with north korea disarmament talks u s strategists also are beginning to study possible ways to formally end more than years of cold war hostilities between washington and pyongyang senior u s officials say they are exploring how to implement a peace accord to officially end the korean war they say the u s hopes to start discussions with north korea as soon as year end in february north korea pledged to begin dismantling its nuclear weapons program in exchange for economic aid and eventually diplomatic relations with the u s and its asian allies the agreement followed years of on again off again talks involving north korea south korea the u s japan russia and china now some bush administration officials hope those so called six party talks can evolve into a permanent forum for defusing security threats in northeast asia at a time when both japan and china are bulking up militarily after months of delay signs have emerged in the past few weeks that pyongyang is moving ahead with its disarmament pledge by mid july north korea is expected to have shut down its yongbyon nuclear reactor in return for an aid shipment of tons of fuel oil as part of a gradual process that envisions the country eventually normalizing its relations with the u s japan and south korea the recent signals have raised guarded hopes that progress can finally begin toward a formal peace on the korean peninsula where a truce has prevailed since "its an anachronism were dealing with " says a senior u s official referring to the continued military standoff there "we need to make the place more normal " a broader problem is that the region lacks any formal body to resolve security disputes as a result conflicts over territory or resources could escalate rapidly for the past five decades the u s and its allies have largely sought to ensure regional security through military alliances and u s forces stationed in south korea and japan since the mid s the nations now involved in the six party talks have informally addressed regional security issues through the northeast asia cooperation dialogue the nonofficial body has held annual meetings in which diplomats academics and military officers from the six countries have discussed issues such as chinas mounting military might and north korean economic reform but u s officials say a permanent regional security body could provide a channel for asian nations to resolve disputes and would ensure a continued u s presence in the region u s and asian diplomats foresee a forum along the lines of the association of southeast asian nations or the organization for security and cooperation in europe the member osce for example aims to avert or contain economic conflicts or potential security threats and has been credited with helping manage europes rapid transformation after the fall of the berlin wall bush administration officials stress that pursuing broader regional security aims in northeast asia would be contingent upon north korean leader kim jong ils regime permanently dismantling its nuclear arms programs two weeks ago pyongyang allowed a visit by a diplomatic team from the international atomic energy agency paving the way for the return of weapons monitors this month iaea staffers say north korea is beginning to prepare for the shutdown of yongbyon the plutonium based reactor the u s believes has produced enough fuel for as many as atomic bombs pyongyang tested a nuclear device last fall the second phase of the disarmament process could prove tougher to implement north korea is required to declare any advances it may have secretly made in developing a second nuclear fuel cycle based on uranium and the amount of plutonium it has extracted from the yongbyon reactors spent fuel some u s negotiators fear pyongyangs military could view these steps as the equivalent of providing strategic secrets to the enemy if the disarmament process proceeds the bush administration hopes to start discussing a formal peace treaty with pyongyang by year end says christopher hill the assistant secretary of state leading washingtons talks with north korea a working group headed by russia meanwhile has begun to look into longer term security arrangements in northeast asia the u s has held meetings with both south korea and japan on how to frame a permanent peace on the peninsula u s diplomats say a crucial issue is how to maintain washingtons military alliances with the two nations if the north korean threat which has been the main justification for those alliances disappears lim sungnam south koreas deputy envoy to the six party talks said in an interview that seoul would like to see the peace process take place "sooner rather than later " but that the six countries havent yet discussed precise timing nor has seoul started to focus on details like the future of u s troops in the region mr lim says the key thing is that north korea first fulfill its pledge to denuclearize and not use the complex issues involved in any peace process as an excuse for further delays japan would like to see more stability in the region especially given chinas rise as a regional power though it has its own tensions with north korea tokyo began talks with pyongyang in aimed at establishing diplomatic ties but abandoned them in after evidence emerged that north korea had abducted japanese citizens in the late s and early s pyongyangs test firing of missiles into the sea of japan in july further raised tensions many regional analysts say that merging the interests of south korea and japan will be a crucial step in laying a groundwork for peace with pyongyang in studying a possible approach to formal peace talks u s officials are dusting off models explored by previous u s administrations they range from holding direct talks with north korea to four party discussions including u s north korea south korea and china to todays six party format u s and korean officials said the four party format appears most likely the u s views beijings and seouls participation as central to a lasting peace while beijing backs a peace deal it could seek to distance itself from any direct involvement chinas communist government traditionally has been an ally of north koreas but has grown increasingly fed up with pyongyang it is also eager to be regarded as more in step with the rest of the world participating directly in peace talks could put beijing in the uncomfortable situation of having to side with pyongyang "china wouldnt mind just outsourcing responsibility on this matter " says jin canrong an associate dean at renmin university of china a key issue will be the nearly u s troops still in south korea u s forces were first sent there in after soldiers led by mr kims father kim il sung invaded the south the two sides later signed a u n brokered armistice but not a formal peace treaty as part of any formal peace pact north korea and south korea would need to agree how to dismantle the demilitarized zone that now divides the two countries they would also have to resolve significant territorial disputes both koreas are both publicly committed to reunification but the terms and time frame remain under debate south korean officials say their primary motive is to keep the north "stable " north korean leaders and left leaning south korean politicians have long criticized the u s troops in korea as a tool of american imperialism chinese military planners also would be expected to question the justification for keeping u s forces in korea in the wake of any peace deal even some pentagon planners are skeptical of the need if a formal peace is reached still many diplomats and analysts said they wouldnt write off a continued u s troop presence many u s and asian officials who have met with north koreans say pyongyang views a longer term u s presence as a potential counterweight to chinas growing economic and military might in the region evan ramstad
