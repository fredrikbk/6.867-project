housing market they socked that windfall away in stocks and mutual funds until they needed it to purchase their current home in larchmont last year the fosters see their home as part of their retirement nest egg even though they believe that the property market likely wont rise as quickly as it has in the past "i think of our house as one of our main investments " says ms foster "even if the market doesnt go up like it did i still think its important for our future to own our own home because we can sell it when we retire and move somewhere cheaper " the couple would like to retire in their native california but are also open to less expensive states with his careful savings plan mr foster has visions of retiring as early as but he realizes he might have to continue working a bit longer than he hopes still by hes hoping to change careers or perhaps open his own business for her part ms foster imagines shell go back to work in education and stay put until the classic retirement age of wherever they end up the fosters are convinced they wont receive a penny from the government "we all know the situation is pretty bleak for our generation because the boomer population will deplete social security before we get there " says mr foster "we arent counting on anyone else we just have to take care of ourselves " learning on the job single mother renata davila likes to think of herself as a poster child for what you can accomplish financially if you put your mind to it "im on my own and i managed to buy a house in the bay area and am saving for retirement " she says "if i can do it anyone can " a mother at ms davila worked as a clerk in a grocery story for six years while raising her young daughter she and her husband had trouble making ends meet and constantly worried

kaiser i didnt think at all about retirement " says ms davila who divorced in and now lives with her year old daughter cynthia in an oakland home she purchased in even though kaiser offers a generous benefit package ms davila didnt take advantage of the company sponsored k and other savings plans right away "but then i got a job in the benefits department and i started to educate myself about the importance of saving " she says as part of her job ms davila is in charge of managing the company sponsored retirement plans for the doctors on staff helping the physicians navigate the contribution system she has learned how the plans work and now she takes full advantage of everything kaiser has to offer she socks of her salary into the company k kaiser doesnt match k contributions but it offers two additional savings programs a so called defined contribution plan and a classic pension the former means that kaiser annually contributes of the value of each employees salary if you make more than &# a year into a fidelity investments mutual fund account which employees then manage on their own the pension program allows employees whove been with the company five years or longer to start collecting payments upon retirement the retirement plans are "a big part of why im loyal to my job and plan to stay here until i retire " says ms davila who hopes to move into a new position one area where ms davila hasnt saved is for her daughters college education but because cynthia is a stellar student ms davila hopes shell receive grants and a scholarship to a top notch school ms davila

her house until then shell own it outright "even though i dont make that much money all in all i feel im doing pretty well " says ms davila "some of the doctors at kaiser dont even save as much as i do " starting over eduardo moreno is putting retirement savings on hold for a few years the year old chicago resident is currently a student at depaul university earning a masters degree in new media studies he works full time as a web designer during the day and goes to school at night tuition costs eat up most of mr morenos spending money so he cant afford to save much at the moment contributing just of his salary to his companys unmatched k plan "i am hoping the masters degree will help me make a lot more money in the future and ill not only be able to pay off my student loans but also start seriously saving for retirement " says mr moreno he hopes to land a job in online marketing when he finishes his degree next year before he made the decision to "start over in a new career " mr moreno was setting aside some money for retirement he worked as a project manager at motorola inc in schaumburg ill for five years and contributed to the companys k plan for the last three of those years he put about of his salary into the k which was matched by motorola but he opted not to participate in a stock purchase program "i didnt think that motorola was a good investment at the time and since the stock has suffered im glad i didnt get involved in that " he says while at motorola mr moreno also managed to pay off all of his outstanding credit card debt as well as buy a house in a chicago suburb he later sold that house moving back to the city center and buying a one bedroom condo with his wife but he has sold that property now as well after he and his wife separated last year while mr moreno worries about the future he also wants to enjoy the present "i know there wont be any social security for me and i do worry that i wont have enough money to do the things i want in retirement " says mr moreno "but when you see those billboards with a happy retired couple walking along the beach im torn with wanting to travel and enjoy my life now while im young and saving money to be able to do those things later " born in chile mr moreno moved to the u s at the age of three and grew up in the san francisco bay area he earned a bachelors degree in english from the university of california at santa barbara worked in contract jobs in the computer industry for a few years and then moved to chicago in growing up money was tight he says his parents tried hard to instill in him the importance of saving though he didnt always follow those lessons "my mom always told me not to waste money and not to overspend at first i didnt want to take that advice " says mr moreno "but then after college i ran up quite a bit of credit card debt and i began to see she was right " now that those debts are paid off mr moreno says he plans never to abuse credit cards again in a few years when mr moreno is firmly ensconced in a well paying marketing job he plans not only to sign up for his companys k if one is provided but also to start dabbling in the stock market hed like to open an ira account and take some classes in investing he hopes to buy a house one day as well but isnt sure now is a good time after having lost a bit of money on the sale of his condo earlier this year "i havent thought a lot about what my life will be like in retirement but i know its a lot closer than i think " says mr moreno "i am trying hard to be frugal but i have no illusions about retiring early the way its going now i imagine most of us will have to work past " an early start most year olds are too busy paying off college loans traveling or figuring out what they want to do with their lives to think much about retirement but at that age jocelyn and justin sisco had already started putting money aside for their future mr and ms sisco both now are taking the slow and steady approach to saving mr sisco is a real estate broker and ms sisco worked in sales for five years at kraft foods inc before leaving her job this year after the birth of their first child with just one income the siscos who live in novato calif a suburb of san francisco dont have much money left at the end of the month but they nonetheless manage to set aside &# a month in mr siscos company sponsored k as well as &# a month in a plan for their nine month old son sean whatever money is left after that or when mr sisco makes a larger than expected commission on the sale of a house the couple splits among a vanguard group inc money market fund and a savings account at a bank they dont invest in the stock market or hold ira accounts "as soon as i started working when i was i started thinking about retirement " says mr sisco whose company matches his k contribution dollar for dollar "my colleagues at work told me to start young and i thought that was great advice " ms sisco also started saving at age putting of her salary into krafts k kraft matched her contribution with cents on every dollar but that money had to be invested in the stock of kraft or that of krafts former parent altria group inc when she left kraft in ms sisco was vested in the stock program and retained all of her k savings "i always thought about retirement because my parents told me how important it was to save " says ms sisco "i feel like im pretty ahead of the game having saved anything at all for retirement so im not worried to take a few years off " the couple met while attending san diego state university they graduated in and headed north to the san francisco bay area marrying shortly after in even before they married they started thinking about building a solid financial future together purchasing their first house in fairfield calif in they sold that house two years later for a sizable gain and purchased another home in novato even if the real estate market declines or slows in years to come the siscos arent worried because they plan to stay in their home for many years possibly even until retirement and they hope to buy a rental property as soon as they can afford it "i know a lot about real estate working in the industry and i still think its the best investment you can make over the long term " says mr sisco "if we can one day buy a rental property or two to generate income we might even be able to retire early " meanwhile the couple is trying to instill their saving habits in their peer group since many live paycheck to paycheck have large credit card debt and have nothing saved for retirement says ms sisco "ive been working on my brother to help him understand he needs to buy a property and start saving for retirement " says mr sisco "i feel like im educating my family and friends about how important it is to save " the business of savings business owner jill loofbourrow has always been a saver but she didnt start seriously planning for retirement until years ago thats when she started her construction business patch master drywall "in the beginning it wasnt easy but the company has really taken off and the whole family works in the business now " says ms loofbourrow her husband brad is a plumber by trade but started working for the family business years ago ms loofbourrows two grown sons from her first marriage also work for patch master and her year old may work for the company down the line when she started patch master a company based in oakley calif ms loofbourrow was looking to get back into the work force after taking time off to raise her children when her business started making money ms loofbourrow realized she needed a more structured retirement savings plan she and mr loofbourrow consulted a financial adviser and each opened a roth ira and an sep ira which is a retirement account used by small businesses and people who are self employed they invest in both annually they also work with a broker who helps them invest in the stock market "my plan for the future is something ive thought about for a long time " says ms loofbourrow "the future is always uncertain and you have to be prepared to take care of yourself and your family " the loofbourrows who live in santa cruz calif dont just invest in retirement accounts and the stock market theyre also real estate investors who own five properties most of them in contra costa county in northern california because they can purchase houses and fix them up themselves theyve bought and flipped several homes for a tidy profit in the past couple of years they live in one of their homes their two grown sons live in another and they rent out the others "weve been buying and selling real estate for the last years but of course it really became profitable in the last five years " says ms loofbourrow so much so that the couple is thinking of turning their interest in real estate into a business one day buying and selling homes in need of renovation but they arent ready to make that jump just yet "my older two sons didnt go to college so id really like to provide that opportunity to tristan " ms loofbourrow says of her youngest son she doesnt have a plan for him but has saved money for his education in regular savings accounts and mutual funds "i cant even think about retiring until hes out of college " she says about two thirds of ms loofbourrows retirement savings is tied up in real estate and the rest is in iras and the stock market she would like to retire early and her plans to continue investing in real estate play a large part in that dream when she retires she plans to turn the day to day running of patch master over to her sons to whom she hopes shes imparting good saving habits "i have always been very frugal and i dont believe in credit cards " says ms loofbourrow "i havent made foolish financial choices and ive tried to teach my kids the value of money " in fact she gave her older sons a house but expects them to make the mortgage payment each month despite her good fortune so far ms loofbourrow doesnt have grand plans for her retirement "when i retire i dont need luxury " she says "my husband has dreams about a mansion on the beach but i dont really care where i live i just want to be happy and be around my family " building for the future san francisco couple nick and alice myerhoff arent so much saving for retirement as investing for it over the past years theyve managed to build up a property portfolio valued at nearly &# million and they hope their houses and apartment buildings scattered throughout california will enable them to take a comfortable early retirement "the whole idea is that regardless of what happens our financial future is pretty much set " says the year old mr myerhoff "i know that we dont have to save &# million before we retire because all we have to do is continue to pay our loans and the properties will support us through our old age " mr myerhoff for his part has already gotten out of the corporate world quitting his job as an industrial designer at bicycle company dynacraft bsc inc in american canyon calif in to open his own business now he designs clothing under his own brand girlrider but still spends plenty of time managing their properties and investing in the stock market "originally i planned to retire at but in a way i already am retired at because im working for myself " says mr myerhoff for the decade or so that he was an employee mr myerhoff maxed out the contribution to his k every year and also contributed to a roth ira ms myerhoff has always done the same and continues to contribute to her roth ira now even though her current employer doesnt offer a k they also put money into a plan for their three year old daughter mathilda ms myerhoff works as a sales director at a local internet company but hopes to join her husband in the world of semi retirement in the next few years "i havent picked an age by which i plan to retire im still playing it year by year even month by month " she says "but if things keep going the way they have been with our investment properties i certainly wont have to continue working for someone else for long " the couple met in black rock city nev at the burning man festival in nick had just purchased his first home and was in the market for a second property he found a house he liked in san francisco and made an offer after visiting it for five minutes a few years later the couple who married in bought a third property a four unit apartment building in san franciscos mission district by then the myerhoffs had the property bug ms myerhoff got her mortgage broker and real estate licenses and started earning a commission on each transaction they soon sold the san francisco rental and used the proceeds to buy a triplex in los angeles and a duplex in sacramento they then bought homes in reno nev and a vacation property on lake tahoe as well as their current residence in san francisco theyve since sold a few properties and purchased an unit apartment building in oakland calif "we took some huge risks and it was often stressful but i always saw real estate as the best way to make money " says mr myerhoff he didnt learn about real estate investing from his parents whom he calls "savers not investors " when his mother died when he was he was left with a small inheritance but no idea about how to invest it he consulted a financial planner and learned about mutual funds and the stock market both of which he continues to invest in today "i always felt like money was an obstacle to my parents and i didnt want it to be like that for me " says mr myerhoff "so i opened my mind to different types of investing " adds ms myerhoff "when we met years ago i knew nothing about real estate but ive learned a lot just by doing " she says "now i couldnt imagine not owning property "
