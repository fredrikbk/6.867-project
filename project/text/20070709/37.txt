obamas school uniform in march barack obama declared that his "main opponent in this race isnt other candidates its cynicism " its remarkable though how cynical his candidacy for the democratic presidential nomination has already become the conflict between appearance and reality was distilled to its essence in a speech delivered on thursday before the national education associations annual convention the nea is the countrys largest teachers union and mr obama at least gestured toward merit pay a heresy to the public education bureaucracy but in toto mr obamas policy proposals to the nea were dominated by ritual obeisance to the union and orthodox thinking bill clinton would have attacked this in as old democratic thinking merit pay was a minor item in an overflowing gift basket to the teachers unions and besides was presented as part of a plan for "finally raising salaries across the board " maybe compensation will be bumped up because of merit but it will be bumped up for everyone regardless mr obama called current teacher salaries "morally unacceptable " he believes the problem with american education is that the schools havent been given "the resources and the support" they need he plans to plow "billions of new dollars into the teaching profession " mr obama came out for "programs that allow new teachers to learn from veteran professionals " forget alternative certification instead create new teacher training programs and then have the government "pay off some of those college loans " why teachers but not say engineers mr obama says hell present the specifics of his plan at a later date but its hard to see how his pay for performance idea will work in practice given that he trashed testing as a tool for accountability "we can find new ways to increase pay that are developed with teachers not imposed on them and not based on some arbitrary tests " he noted he also denounced no child left behind whatever its faults an effort to introduce standards into the schools as "one of the emptiest slogans in the history of politics " mr obama is to the left of rep george miller and the house democrats the schools arent troubled because theyre underfunded theyre underperforming yet mr obama waved off any provisions for school choice voicing his commitment to "fixing and improving our schools instead of abandoning them and passing out vouchers " the nea couldnt ask for a better tribune so far mr obama has been shrewd in setting himself off from left wing orthodoxy though perhaps mainly as a matter of style but if he is going to ask voters to consider the presidency an entry level position hell need to do more than dress up liberal commonplaces as bold truth telling see related letter "letters to the editor nea wants to work with the candidates" wsj july
