china respects paulson but will it listen to him somehow a myth seems to have been created that henry paulson has some special sway with the chinese government "second act paulson finds deal making is tougher in washington " page one may does anyone really believe that mr paulson as secretary of the treasury has the same value to china as he did as ceo of goldman sachs china understands that mr paulson has months remaining in an administration that is in free fall with respect to its political ability to control the trade agenda so mr paulson will be treated by the chinese deferentially as an "old friend" while his entreaties are politely deflected jack c fensterstock bethesda md
