weekend journal the home front design by committee amateur decorators post their work on design sites and get brutal assessments eve sinclair was so proud of the decorating job shed done on her los angeles apartment that she decided last month to enter it in a contest sponsored by a home design web site after spending two days cleaning vacuuming and primping the square foot space the year old furniture company manager posted pictures and waited to hear the publics verdict it wasnt great "saggy chic " proclaimed one critic describing ms sinclairs futon and armchair the purple faux bearskin rug shed placed under a modern wood and glass coffee table was called "the stuff of nightmares " while another voter singled out her greenery "for the love of god someone save those poor poor houseplants in the corner " the final insult the apartments design aesthetic was likened to the interior of an islands fine burgers &amp drinks "it was kinda like oh man my house looks like a chain restaurant " says ms sinclair no longer satisfied with feedback from friends and family amateur decorators are increasingly turning to home design web sites and forums where strangers weigh in apartment therapy says it receives about unique visits a day and that pictures of ordinary peoples homes like ms sinclairs are consistently among the most viewed features rate my space part of hgtv com says it has logged more than million page views since it launched in february and now has more than members who have posted photos of their decorating projects but beyond the friendly praise "would love to sleep in this room " and discussions about the merits of bamboo flooring these sites have added a new dimension to the normally genteel realm of home decorating the unvarnished truth unlike interior design professionals for whom tact is a vital part of dealing with clients especially those with bad taste some commenters on these sites cut to the chase "the mauve shower curtain says that the owner decorator is over years old " read one recent post on rate my space "if you are then fine otherwise get a new curtain " lisa gardner opened her san francisco home up to scrutiny on apartment therapy hoping to hear some praise for her ingenuity she furnished the space with items picked up at flea markets and scavenged from sidewalks on trash days while most comments were favorable she felt that some critics were unduly harsh about her clapboard cottage style including one person who took issue with the &# american flag shed hung over the sofa she says the negative comments have discouraged her from posting any more pictures "i would never do that to someone elses home " aware that things can gset pretty heated online site owners and managers say they are working to maintain a level of civility "criticism is fine as long as its not personal " says apartment therapy founder maxwell gillingham ryan who says hes written a code of conduct and requires people to register before being allowed to comment to encourage people to continue to submit house tour slide shows he will disable the comment feature if they request it self policing also keeps the insults down or at least minimizes their sting on rate my space one member who posted pictures of her bedroom last month was told that "the blue and brown thing has been done to death" and that the room had "no style " but other members leapt to her defense in rather harsh tones themselves "dont let her bother you " wrote one "she probably went off her medication again " as with many sites rate my space also uses a comment flagging system that allows users to report abusive posts biting comments are only a small part of the online design scene however people who post photos on curbly a site launched last year are more interested in exchanging tips on do it yourself projects ikeahacker a site that is not affiliated with the swedish furniture chain is populated by users who are interested in customizing the retailers products transforming a daybed into a banquette for instance this week a new homeowner who uses the screen name heathernicole turned to the readers of rate my space with the following message "help pink kitchen " within hours photos of the kitchen had been viewed more than times and had set off an online discussion about color alternatives "i would go with something more earthy sage green " wrote one "everyone wants green now " parried another "maybe go with something out of the ordinary " when the chenille does hit the fan some people appreciate the candor nina cancellieri a part time public school computer aide in seaford n y likes the anonymity of the online forums strangers on the internet arent afraid of hurting your feelings she says "friends are going to tell you it looks nice whether they really believe it or not " ms cancellieri recently posted pictures of her living room and asked for feedback on whether or not to buy an area rug heeding the advice of several commenters she picked up an earth toned geometric print from home improvement retailer lowes then posted pictures of the readjusted room and got confirmation that shed chosen well "a star all the way " wrote one fan even ms sinclair whose one bedroom apartment was compared to a franchise restaurant says shes grateful for the objective if bracing commentary when she and her boyfriend paige moore move to philadelphia in the fall shes planning to post regular updates of her decorating progress in their new loft and is even considering entering the apartment therapy contest again "i guess its kind of a challenge " she says the open forum doesnt work for everyone chris gardner a year old divinity school student in columbus ohio recently logged on to curbly to ask for suggestions for improving his "ugly" square foot townhouse with its stained brown carpet plastic faux wood trim and "awful" brass knobs so far though he says most recommendations havent jibed with his taste for classic midcentury design "it would be nice if there were an online community where we all had the same taste " says mr gardner who still relies on magazines and books lloyd princeton a design industry consultant who charges up to &# a day calls internet based decorating "low level stuff" thats fine for cost conscious people who want to do it themselves "but certain people will always want someone to do it for them " nonetheless these sites continue to grow in four years apartment therapy has expanded from new york to los angeles san francisco and chicago and plans to add a myspace style section in the fall to make it easier for readers to connect and display photos the nearly members of the "interior motives" discussion group on yahoo trade email messages every day with advice ranging from how to tone down a peach bathroom add neutral art work with hints of the paint color to what colors to weave into a grey black and cream french country style dining room one suggestion try soft buttercream yellow virtual communities can also be supportive in other ways ms gardner the san francisco flea market shopper was surprised to see that when her house tour was posted on apartment therapy it included a personal note she hadnt intended to make public in it she explained that she was unemployed and had become obsessed with her home printing out custom labels for drawers sorting her fiances socks by size and color and arranging wooden hangers exactly one inch apart "lisa dear " wrote one poster "you probably do need to put down the label maker for a day or two if only to step back and appreciate what youve done "
