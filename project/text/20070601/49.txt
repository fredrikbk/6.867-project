going downtown a developer bets on detroit by detroit this citys auto industry currently faces a historic meltdown the real estate market is so distressed that many houses here are cheaper than cars a population flight to outlying suburbs a trend that began four decades ago continues rivaling the exodus from hurricane ravaged new orleans so why is an out of towner named john ferchill betting on a &# million plan to turn an old hotel here into a deluxe destination with four star rooms and luxury condominiums since the story book cadillac hotel has stood gutted and abandoned on a downtown block surrounded by dormant storefronts and vacant buildings mr ferchill plans for it to open in the fall of as a room westin the top eight floors will house upscale condo units most of which have already been sold penthouses commanded as much as &# million a year old developer from cleveland who specializes in risky markets mr ferchill has made a fortune restoring historic buildings in troubled cities such as buffalo and pittsburgh but downtown detroit is his most audacious bet yet "ive got a lot on the line here " says mr ferchill whose company has assumed more than &# million in loans and other debt associated with the project "im counting on the city of detroit reviving itself in a manner that nobody expected to happen " last year detroit posted one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation at rampant crime crumbling residential neighborhoods and troubled schools have long plagued the city but mr ferchill thinks the start of a turnaround is already under way as the citys new ballparks casinos and multimillion dollar housing developments have begun to lure more tourists and investors many view the book cadillac as a bellwether for any possible downtown revival especially for the citys long neglected west side "the book cadillac more or less tests the water as to whether or not a significant renewal will take place " says john mogk an expert on detroit history who teaches land use and urban development at wayne state universitys law school brothers j b frank and herbert book opened the property in december the spot the site of the old cadillac hotel which had been named for antoine de la mothe cadillac a french fur trader who founded detroit in at the time detroit was thriving and home to a new booming auto industry the citys richly ornate gilded age architecture had earned it the nickname "paris of the west " with their hotel the books wanted to transform downtowns washington boulevard into a kind of midwestern fifth avenue it was detroits tallest building and the tallest hotel in the world the book opened amid huge fanfare more than guests descended and more had to be turned away large crowds spilled onto washington boulevard when celebrities arrived eleanor roosevelt and the new york yankees among them the hotels lush venetian lounges and ballrooms were main draws places to be seen in and hold important meetings on may lou gehrig suffering from unexplainable weakness and decline in his play pulled yankees manager joe mccarthy aside in the book cadillacs lobby the two headed to mr mccarthys room where mr gehrig told his manager he intended to sit out that afternoons game against the detroit tigers the decision ended mr gehrigs consecutive games played streak at in the sheraton hotel corporation bought the book renaming it the "sheraton cadillac " among its guests presidents truman eisenhower and kennedy sammy davis jr and frank sinatra met at the hotel for the first time there historical preservationists say for two decades business in both the city and the hotel remained robust but even during the s and s changes were taking place that would precipitate decline interstate highways began to cut through downtown neighborhoods obsolete manufacturing plants couldnt be expanded in the citys industrial areas because they backed up against crowded neighborhoods so factories moved to detroits outskirts middle class residents fled the city after violent race riots in the late s and stopped coming downtown to see lawyers doctors and other professionals detroit tried to rescue its scarred downtown in the late s with the construction of four office towers known as the renaissance center but most of the complexs success came from peeling away businesses from the citys west side near the book cadillac the unintended effect many west side buildings were emptied and restaurants and other businesses there declined the book suffered too it changed ownership several times between and when occupancy rates slumped the book cadillac was barely clinging to life in when california gov ronald reagan visited the hotel during the republican national convention by this time a series of ownership changes had restored the hotels name back to the "book " amid plummeting demand the hotel shuttered in the city devised various plans to redevelop the hotel but none stuck a consortium of private investors bought the book but left the hotel idle by the early s demand for commercial space remained weak and millions of square feet downtown sat either vacant or minimally occupied subsequent attempts to draw businesses and residents to the city center never quite took off the city regained control of the book in but determined it was too expensive to save and slated it for demolition when kwame kilpatrick became mayor the following year however he ordered officials to try to find developers for as many abandoned historic buildings as possible despite its fragile state detroit has always been a serious sports town and centrally located visitors have easy access to the motor city via highways and bridges that reach michigan suburbs windsor ontario and parts of ohio eventually investors such as mike ilitch the owner of the tigers who built a new baseball stadium for the team in decided to test the downtown market although devoid of modern amenities the area was attractive because of its location and entertainment potential in recent years detroit has attracted &# million in investments to develop rundown buildings and other properties as host to the super bowl the city beautified its campus martius park which sits in the center of downtown a residential neighborhood on the citys east side covering acres will eventually boast more than new homes plans are also under way for scores of new condominiums on the citys waterfront with investments totaling more than &# million according to a recent brookings institution report about million people visit downtown detroit each year for sports games and other events such as concerts and conventions "if we keep a quarter of those people in the city overnight it really shouldnt be hard to fill this hotel " says chris ferchill mr ferchills son and business associate mr ferchill stumbled into real estate in the late s after a stint with a local phone company he eventually founded the ferchill group in and started working on subsidized housing projects over the years the company shifted to office buildings before devoting most of its time to renovating historic buildings in parachuting into what he calls "second tier" markets mr ferchills strategy is usually the same first he identifies cities that appear to be on the cusp of resurgence often giving extra points to those with new baseball parks which tend to spur growth in the entertainment sector he then pinpoints voids in the upscale housing and hospitality markets targeting historic properties in hopes of rallying various public and private players to help fund their costly rehabilitations he first tackled detroit in by building a hilton garden inn a midpriced room hotel in the downtown business district the hotel one of few in the area boasts a healthy occupancy rate of about he also set his sights on the book cadillac the city though had first tapped another developer historic hospitality investments a subsidiary of kimberly clark corp it had already earned a reputation as a publicly traded company committed to restoring dormant historic structures mr ferchill felt he could do a better job he told city officials to "call me when they fail " in late unable to arrange the necessary financing historic hospitality pulled the plug "there were a number of difficulties with the project that would have made it uneconomically viable in our view " a kimberly clark spokesman says "it just was not coming together " detroit next turned to mr ferchill he committed &# million in equity to the project plus about &# million for start up costs such as market studies and architectural designs he also courted local officials to arrange a complex web of more than public and private investors including meijer inc the midwestern grocery store chain about &# million came from two of detroits pension boards which cover both the citys general retirement system and police and fire funds at first the boards were skeptical mr ferchill had not yet secured all the hotels financing and the pension shepherds were concerned about their risk exposure "we didnt want to be the first one to jump into the project " recalls jeffrey beasley detroits treasurer and a member of both pension boards but mr ferchill obtained letters of commitment from other investors and made the deal more palatable by allowing the pension boards to put up money as loans and secure a small ownership stake in the hotel most important mr ferchill made sure the general retirement board would be a "second tier" investor second in line to get its money back in the event of foreclosure behind only a &# million loan from istar financial inc a real estate financing company one of mr ferchills biggest challenges came when meijer threatened to withdraw its promised &# million after state politicians eliminated a key tax credit it expected to claim days before lawmakers summer recess the ferchill group successfully lobbied legislators and then the governors office for special concessions the result a new law preserving the tax credit for meijer and others keeping the companys investment in the deal in another coup mr ferchill landed millions by placing a conservation easement on the book cadillac which forbids him from building more condos atop the hotels existing structure the move allowed mr ferchill to write off the estimated forgone profits as a charitable gift and pass the tax benefit to other partners attracted by the prospect of receiving a large portion of those tax benefits national city corp the big bank chain agreed to invest more than &# million in the book cadillac some in michigan doubt that new hotels and condos can return the city to greatness "it will never ever be the same as it was in the heyday of motown " says l brooks patterson a native detroiter and chief executive of nearby oakland county a prosperous suburb "detroit didnt fall from grace overnight and there isnt going to be a silver bullet that slays the bad news dragon " but mr ferchill is gambling he can find older empty nesters and young professionals who "want to be in the middle of the action " he says many have yearned to live downtown for some time but couldnt find the right place he says one of them is bob bartlett a year old divorcee who just bought a &# million penthouse sight unseen mr bartletts new three story home once its completed will feature a spacious entryway two bedrooms two and a half bathrooms and a view of the city skyline mr bartlett who is moving from a nearby affluent suburb exults at the opportunity to live just steps away from what he calls the citys "hidden gems" small jazz clubs local bodegas and well regarded restaurants like twingos and mosaic hell be a short distance from the detroit institute of arts detroit symphony orchestra and three professional sports venues "its just so much in the hub of things " says mr bartlett an insurance industry consultant "watch out chicago " shortly after the book cadillac deal another developer approached detroit officials to build a separate condo project on top of the hotels adjacent garage david di rita who says his detroit company has sold about half of the yet to be built units including penthouses for as much as &# said the book cadillac "accelerated the notion that the downtown washington boulevard area could sustain high end residential restaurants and shops " "its no accident that the mayor talked about the detroit tigers and the book cadillac hotel" in his recent state of the city address mr ferchill says "these are the two things" that are going to bring detroit back he says
