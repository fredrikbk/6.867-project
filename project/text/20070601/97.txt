the numbers guy flaws in measuring the worlds poor may hinder solutions our dream is a world free of poverty" is a slogan at the world bank one challenge facing paul wolfowitzs replacement at the banks helm is how to count the worlds poor so that we might know if that dream is approaching reality though it was mostly overlooked amid the controversy over alleged favoritism by mr wolfowitz the bank announced in april that million people are poor world wide a decline of million since by that count the united nations millennium development goal of halving the proportion of people living in poverty in the years ending in appears attainable but to some economists the world banks definition of poverty is flawed arbitrary and tends toward suppressing the numbers sanjay reddy a columbia university economist and longtime critic of the banks counts says "if their dream is a world free of poverty they ought to know how to measure it " the bank defines poverty as living each day on less than the local equivalent of what &# could buy in thats the median of national poverty lines in poor countries incomes or expenditures are measured by individual countries household surveys then converted to dollars in terms of purchasing power each of these steps introduces potential pitfalls national poverty lines are set by local governments and there isnt any standard for defining them "it is silly to use national poverty lines to arrive at a global poverty line " says nanak kakwani an economist and visiting scholar at university of sydney australia internal politics might drive some countries to choose a line that would suppress or inflate poverty counts "the biases probably go both ways " says martin ravallion who has overseen these calculations for the world bank since their inception in of course that doesnt mean they cancel each other out the household surveys are another imperfect instrument different countries use different methods robert wade of the london school of economics cites a study in india that found the number of poor could be halved on paper that is merely by shortening the length of time for which survey respondents were asked to recount their expenditures countries also supply the price data used to convert currencies based on purchasing power china didnt supply this information for the latest round of revisions mr ravallion acknowledges the omission from the worlds most populous country in the region responsible for all of the banks calculated global poverty decline could have a big impact on the overall numbers "getting more accurate estimates of purchasing power parity for china is a high priority " he says "but we cant force the government to participate " the purchasing power estimates known as ppps were developed as broad gauges and incorporate the prices of goods and services such as air travel or computers beyond the reach of the worlds poor the inclusion of services tends to make prices look lower in poor countries because of cheap labor but poor people typically spend most of their money on goods particularly food the bank has been developing a measure specifically examining the relative cost of a basket of poverty goods and will be incorporating the result into updates of the poverty counts as soon as next year each revision of the ppps necessitates a re calculation of poverty counts for each year so trends can suddenly be reversed in the bank said the number of the worlds poor had increased by million since in the bank said the number had declined by as much as million in the previous years a united nations development programme paper last year attempted to address some downsides to the world bank approach by calculating a world poverty line from the cost of meeting basic caloric needs this paper has its own drawbacks for example it used data from just one country bangladesh to estimate food costs but it did show how sensitive the banks numbers are to small changes changing the international poverty line to &# increased the number of poor to billion mr ravallion says the banks line was "deliberately conservative " so that no one could argue the number of poor was smaller there are more philosophical objections some economists argue that poverty should be defined as the inability to live at a level each persons society deems normal lacking a phone in burundi might not be associated with poverty but it is in the u s mr ravallion notes that the bank has been compiling relative poverty statistics for at least a decade "they dont get much attention to my frustration " he says instead the media and the u n give their attention to the the aggregate global poverty numbers one reason might be the power of the round number when the banks initial calculation of a global poverty line yielded a figure just above &# a month a colleague of mr ravallions suggested expressing it as a dollar a day "that was an amazing marketing ploy " he says email me at numbersguy wsj com
