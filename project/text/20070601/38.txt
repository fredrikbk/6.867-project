fitzgerald doubles down i lewis "scooter" libby is due to be sentenced next week and just in time special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald has decided this was a leak case after all last week he filed a brief with the court arguing that mr libby should receive a prison sentence in line with crimes that neither he nor anyone else was ever accused of committing if the court accepts mr fitzgeralds logic the sentence meted out in this fantastic case would at least double to a minimum of months so it goes in a case brought by an unaccountable prosecutor now requesting an unreasonable penalty based on evidence he never introduced at trial this is america throughout mr libbys prosecution mr fitzgerald insisted it made no difference to the case whether cia officer valerie plame wilson was undercover at one pre trial hearing he went so far as to argue it would make no difference to the case "if ms wilson turned out to be a postal driver mistaken for a cia employee " he also objected to defense requests for documents concerning her status insisting this was a perjury trial not a trial about leaking classified information his stonewalling on this point before the trial led the defense to seek an instruction from the judge barring the prosecution from discussing the nature of ms wilsons job at the cia but now that the time for sentencing has come mr fitzgerald has decided that ms wilsons role is relevant after all federal sentencing guidelines permit the court under certain circumstances to take into account the seriousness of the original crime under investigation in a perjury or obstruction case but mr fitzgeralds attempt to introduce the espionage act and the intelligence identities protection act at this stage given the lengths to which he went to exclude any consideration of the underlying non crime during the trial is kafka esque "mr libbys false testimony " mr fitzgerald wrote last week "obscured a confident determination of what in fact occurred particularly where the accounts of the reporters with whom mr libby spoke and their notes did not include any explicit evidence specifically proving that mr libby knew that ms wilson was a covert agent " translation there was no evidence that mr libby broke the laws that mr fitzgerald wants him sentenced under and somehow this is mr libbys own fault theres not even any evidence as mr fitzgerald acknowledges that mr libby was aware that ms wilson was allegedly undercover which is a precondition for violating the iipa mr fitzgeralds filing does purport to answer one long lingering question in this saga exhibit a in mr fitzgeralds filing is a memo from the cia asserting that in october which is to say months before the trial began the cia declassified her employment status and acknowledged that in the agencys view she had been a covert agent during the months prior to her exposure in robert novaks july column about her husband this same cia summary was nearly the only document mr fitzgerald was willing to produce before the trial concerning ms wilsons former job status this lack of supporting detail led judge reggie walton at trial to deny knowing himself whether she was covert that question in itself was a sidelight in this case but mr fitzgeralds cynical handling of it illuminates what is wrong with special prosecutors who investigate and try these cases without adult supervision by the justice department mr fitzgerald makes the case that a severe sentence is justified under the guidelines but a number of recent supreme court decisions including u s v booker in have strongly suggested that a sentence based on evidence not presented to the jury undermines every americans right to a trial by jury that is exactly what mr fitzgerald is attempting he even argues strenuously against the recommendations of the pre sentencing review provided to the court by the probation office the probation offices conclusions are confidential but the clear inference from mr fitzgeralds own filing is that its review recommended a sentence of no more than to months and possibly less citing mitigating factors such as the harm to mr libbys career prospects the likely loss of his law license and the personal cost to him of having been put through this four year ordeal we hope judge walton rejects mr fitzgeralds effort to throw the book at mr libby but the larger travesty here is the failure of president bush to pardon mr libby and put this political sideshow to rest if he is denied bail pending appeal mr libby could be remanded to federal prison as soon as tuesday the white house may hope mr libby wins on appeal but that would only kick a retrial further down the road when the election will become another excuse not to pardon it would be a blot on the bush presidency if mr libby serves a day in prison for a political dispute over iraq that became a criminal investigation largely due to the incompetence of so many in the bush administration from the cia to the justice and state departments to the national security council public officials failed to inform colleagues blamed others and ducked political responsibility mr libby was the one official mr fitzgerald decided to make a case against to vindicate his years spent investigating mr president this buck stops with you
