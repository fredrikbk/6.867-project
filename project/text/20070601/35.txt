face the music looking back at a marley classic s landmark exodus was recorded after an attempt on reggae stars life online edition the world has long been mesmerized by the music on "exodus " the classic album by bob marley &amp the wailers ive long been interested in the circumstances under which the record was made sunday will mark the th anniversary of "exodus " most records last a season at best but for three decades the album many critics consider marleys masterpiece has lingered in the public consciousness and its reputation is growing time magazine once said "exodus" was the "album of the century " the bbc went further declaring that the song "one love " a track off of the album was the anthem of the millennium i recently wrote a biography of marley "before the legend the rise of bob marley" its just been published in paperback and i found that time and again marley associates and fans alike said "exodus" was their favorite  was a big year for music stevie wonder was at the top of the charts with "sir duke " peter tosh released whats arguably his finest album "equal rights " and the clash the talking heads and elvis costello made their album debuts a few weeks ago bobmarley com asked me for a few thoughts to mark the anniversary of "exodus" and i realized i couldnt remember exactly when and where id first heard the album or how id got my hands on it i was years old when "exodus" was released its possible that i bought it when on a trip to jamaica the first real international journey that i had ever taken alone its also possible that my mother brought home a copy from one of her trips to the caribbean although the latter explanation is a little more likely i prefer the former it seems somehow fitting that i encountered an album marley recorded after leaving jamaica when i was returning to the island i was drawn to "exodus " in part by the combination of its variety and its unity its an album of many moods it has songs of resistance and songs of love it has rhythms you can dance to and lyrics that left you pondering their meaning but the eclecticism was reined in the more confrontational songs were on one side of the album and the songs that leaned towards love were on the other concept albums tend to be indulgent but this one had a strong sense of organization even in a year of great music it stood out it had taken marley years to reach the summit of "exodus " he was born in in nine miles jamaica a tiny town with no running water or electricity and spent much of his youth in the kingston ghetto of trench town he tried to break into entertainment as a teenager but the jamaican music business nearly broke him in he moved to wilmington del for a brief period and worked on an auto assembly line to make ends meet in marley and his group the wailers released their first major international album "catch a fire " in the u s but it was "exodus" that made him a global superstar marley recorded "exodus" after an attempt on his life in december he was scheduled to perform a free concert called "smile jamaica" in kingston for the purpose of lifting the spirits of the island and uniting the people at the time jamaica was torn by social discord and street fighting as the two main political parties jockeyed for favor a few days before the planned event a group of armed men entered marleys kingston home they shot marley his wife rita and seriously wounded his manager nobody was ever charged in the shooting some have speculated that the attack was designed to scare marley away from politics if so the strategy backfired marley was wounded in the chest and arm and his wife took a bullet to her scalp but the reggae singer went on with the show anyway marley was known as a great live performer but "smile jamaica" may have been his finest concert ive seen footage of the show and marleys performance before a crowd of thousands is like a national exorcism he sings songs such as "war" and "positive vibration" as if he wants to use them to cleanse the violence and ill will that had plagued jamaica and led to his near assassination he moves and sings with a sense of abandon despite the possibility that the men who shot him might be in the audience and aiming to finish the job more than a few rockers and pop stars suffer from the delusion that the authorities take them seriously and that the work they do is risky in marleys case these things happened to be true at the conclusion of the concert marley displays his wounds to the crowd as if to suggest if it there were any doubt that he had suffered for his art soon afterward he left the caribbean to travel to england to record "exodus " there are many theories about who was actually behind the shooting but marley fans agree on one thing the incident had a major impact on marleys music his themes became more sweeping and his tone became more urgent whats most interesting however is that marley didnt become bitter or more cynical as an artist during his self imposed exile in england "exodus" contains some hard hitting songs about social unrest such as "so much things to say" but it also features some of the sunniest songs he ever recorded including "one love people get ready" and "three little birds " exile self imposed or otherwise can give an artist a fresh perspective during his stay in england jimi hendrix was able to hone his act and build a buzz for his unique musical style and stage presence new york city let john lennon put some distance between himself and beatlemania and establish a reputation as an even more serious minded and politically oriented performer expatriate art is a grand old tradition writers such as f scott fitzgerald and ernest hemingway went to paris to write books while painters such as william h johnson and henry o tanner left the u s and traveled around europe the expat tradition continues today the cartoonist marjane satrapi who emigrated from iran as a young girl and now lives in france co directed "persepolis " an animated movie based on her graphic novels and shared the jury award at the cannes film festival last month i was born in kingston but raised in brockport new york ive written two books about the caribbean "before the legend" and a novel about piracy in the th century called "kingston by starlight " on some level ive sometimes fancied myself an expatriate artist writing about the land i had left theres a romantic aspect to doing what marley did what fitzgerald did and gaining perspective on ones homeland by journeying to a foreign place being born in one country and living in another grants you a sense of freedom to write without compromise about both places but since i first moved from jamaica when i was only a few weeks old other west indians tend to laugh at me when i even begin to suggest im a jamaican expatriate im an american citizen i dont have a jamaican accent and the closest i can come to preparing jamaican cuisine is ordering takeout now that i work in manhattan i may have to settle for calling myself an expatriate from upstate new york which isnt quite as evocative as say hemingway haunting the smoke shrouded cafes of paris in "a moveable feast " but i think i can hardly be blamed for wanting to be an expat from somewhere theres a power in such experiences thats tempting to tap into and distance and time are often cited as important ingredients in transforming life into art so an expat artist runs into a contradiction that can fuel their imagination the farther they get from where they were raised the greater the influence that place may have on their work it may be that in many cases the country an artist comes from exerts a stronger aesthetic pull than the place an artist settles bob marley said this to a jamaican magazine in "well is the people of jamaica really make me what i am is them say go bob i sing the people applaud them people down here is the greatest people in the world is them build i and i " marley sang about africa died in america and may have recorded some of his greatest work in england but he will always be identified with jamaica greatness really begins at home write to christopher john farley
