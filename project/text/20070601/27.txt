d all things digital two of the luckiest guys on the planet steve jobs and bill gates trade memories not barbs in rare joint appearance carlsbad calif among the many barbs that steve jobs and bill gates have traded over the years perhaps none was as cutting as when the apple inc ceo said that microsoft corp had "no taste" in a s documentary embedded in that short remark were the vast differences between the two men and between their companies though they worked closely together in the early days of the personal computer industry they soon diverged mr jobs built his fame as the father of elegant and tasteful consumer products such as the macintosh computer and ipod music player mr gates earned a fortune building software for the general purpose utility pc for businesses and homes functional but arguably unexciting by comparison so it was especially significant that in a rare joint appearance at the wall street journals d all things digital conference here this week mr gates said hed "give a lot to have steves taste the way he does things is just different and i think its magical " in an exchange marked more by respect than rivalry mr jobs acknowledged mr gatess role as a software pioneer and pointed to the deep history the two men have as the catalysts of an industry revolution that brought cheap easy to use computers to the masses still the two companies and their leaders are a study in contrasts microsoft has outdone apple on scale using its windows operating system to forge a dominance in pc software that towers over the single digit market share held by apples mac line of computers but in recent years apple has punched back in an emerging area of digital consumer electronics creating a runaway hit with its ipod player there apple is the giant and microsoft a mere challenger questioned on stage by walt mossberg and kara swisher messrs gates years old and jobs reflected on the future of digital technology as well as the past excerpts ms swisher theres been a lot of mano a mano catfight kind of thing in the blogs and the press but what do you think each other has contributed to the computer and technology industry mr jobs bill built the first software company in the industry before anybody really knew what a software company was and that was huge and the business model they ended up pursuing turned out to be the one that worked really well for the industry a lot of other things you could say but thats the high order bit mr gates first i want to clarify im not fake steve jobs an anonymous blogger who writes a spoof diary what steves done is quite phenomenal if you look back to that apple ii computer the idea that it would be a mass market machine that this could be an incredible empowering phenomenon apple pursued that dream steve gave a speech once where he talked about how we build the products that we want to use ourselves hes really pursued that with incredible taste and elegance and his ability to always come around and figure out where that next bet should be has been phenomenal mr mossberg i dont think most people know that there was actually some microsoft software in that apple ii computer how did that occur mr jobs my partner this guy named steve wozniak brilliant brilliant guy he writes this basic computer programming language that is like the best basic on the planet it does stuff that no other basics ever done its perfect in every way except for one thing which is its just fixed point its not floating point which is better for complex math and were begging woz to make this floating point and he just never does it so you know microsoft had this very popular really good floating point basic so we ended up going to them and saying "help " mr mossberg and how much did apple pay mr gates oh it was &# i flew out to apple i spent two days there getting the cassette the cassette tapes were the main ways that people stored things at the time and you know that was fun i think the most fun is later when we worked together on the mac we had really bet our future on the macintosh being successful mr jobs whats hard to remember now is that microsoft wasnt in the applications business then they took a big bet on the mac because this is how they got into the apps business lotus dominated the apps business on the pc back then ms swisher moving forward after microsoft grew more and more strong what did you think was going to happen to apple after the disasters that occurred after steve left mr gates well apple hung in the balance we continued to do macintosh software excel which steve and i introduced together in new york city went on and did very well but apple just wasnt differentiating itself well enough from the higher volume platform the product line just didnt evolve as fast steve wasnt there as it needed to and we were actually negotiating a deal to invest and make some commitments and things with gil amelio apples ceo in the s i was calling him up on the weekend and next thing i knew steve called me up and said "dont worry about that negotiation with gil amelio you can just talk to me now " and i said "wow " mr jobs gil was a nice guy but he had a saying he said "apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom leaking water and my job is to get the ship pointed in the right direction " mr mossberg in windows was going great guns windows really was an enormous leap steve you said you had decided that it was destructive to have this competition with microsoft now obviously apple was in a lot of trouble and i presume that there was some tactical or strategic reason for that as well as just wanting to be a nice guy right mr jobs apple was in very serious trouble and what was really clear was that if the game was a zero sum game where for apple to win microsoft had to lose then apple was going to lose a lot of peoples heads were in that place at apple and in the customer base because apple had invented a lot of this stuff and microsoft was being successful and apple wasnt and there was jealousy and this and that but it was clear that you didnt have to play that game because apple didnt have to beat microsoft apple had to remember who apple was because theyd forgotten who apple was so i called bill up and we tried to patch things up mr gates and since that time weve had a team thats fairly dedicated to doing the mac applications and thats worked out very well ms swisher do you look at yourselves as rivals now as the landscape has evolved we watch the commercials although i have to confess i like pc guy mr jobs the art of those commercials is not to be mean but its actually for the guys to like each other thanks pc guy is great got a big heart mr gates his mother loves him mr mossberg how often is apple on your radar screen at microsoft in a business sense mr gates well theyre on the radar screen as an opportunity in a few cases like the zune if you go over to that group they think of apple as a competitor they love the fact that apples created a gigantic market and theyre going to try and come in and contribute something to that mr jobs and we love them because theyre all customers the big secret about apple of course is that apple views itself as a software company we dont have a belief that the mac is going to take over of the pc market you know were really happy when our market share goes up a point and we love that and we work real hard at it but apples fundamentally a software company and theres not a lot of us left and microsofts one of them mr mossberg there is a certain school of thought that this is all migrating to the internet and youll need a fairly light piece of hardware that wont have to have all that investment all the kinds of stuff you guys have done throughout your careers so as much as people might think of you as rivals one way to think of you is the two guys mr jobs were both dinosaurs mr mossberg no seriously in five years is the personal computer still going to be the linchpin of all this stuff mr gates the mainstream is always under attack the thing that people dont realize is that youre going to have rich local functionality its a question of using that local richness together with the richness thats elsewhere mr mossberg what would you each imagine that you would carry as your principal device in five years mr gates i dont think youll have one device i think youll have a full screen device that you can carry around and youll do dramatically more reading off of that i believe in the tablet form factor i think youll have voice i think youll have ink youll have some way of having a hardware keyboard and some settings for that youll have your living room which is your foot experience and thats connected up to the internet and there youll have gaming and entertainment and theres a lot of experimentation in terms of what content looks like in that world and then in your den youll have something a lot like you have at your desk at work you know the view is that every horizontal and vertical surface will have a projector so you can put information on it your desk can be a surface where you can sit and manipulate things mr jobs the pc has proved to be very resilient because as bill said earlier i mean the death of the personal computer has been predicted every few years this general purpose device is going to continue to be with us and morph with us whether its a tablet or a notebook or a big curved desktop you have at your house so i think thatll be something that most people have at least in this society in others maybe not but certainly in this one but then theres an explosion thats starting to happen in what you call post pc devices you can call the ipod one of them and i think that category of devices is going to continue to be very innovative and were going to see lots of them mr mossberg so what are the core functions of the device formerly known as the cellphone the pocket device mr gates how quickly all these things that have been somewhat specialized the navigation device the digital wallet the phone the camera the video camera come together its hard to chart out but eventually youll be able to pick something that has the capability to do every one of those things mr mossberg five years from now whats going to be on that pocket device mr jobs i dont know and the reason i dont know is because i wouldnt have thought that there would have been maps on it five years ago but something comes along gets really popular people love it get used to it you want it on there people are inventing things constantly and i think the art of it is balancing whats on there and whats not on there clearly most things you carry with you are communications devices you want to do some entertainment with them as well but theyre primarily communications devices and thats what theyre going to be question from the audience bill even your harshest critic would have to admit that your philanthropy work is planet shaking incredible and could be if you make it a second act so amazing that it would dwarf what youve actually done at microsoft if you had to choose a legacy what would it be and steve do you look at bill and think gee that guy is so lucky he had a company so rich with talent that he didnt have to personally come in every day and save it and i wish i had the opportunity mr gates the most important work i got a chance to be involved in no matter what i do is the personal computer thats what i grew up with in my teens my s my s i even knew not to get married until later because i was so obsessed with it thats my lifes work and its lucky for me that some of the skills and resources that i was able to develop through those experiences can be applied to the benefit of the people who havent had technology including medicine working for them so its an incredible blessing to have two things like that but if you look inside my brain its filled with software and the magic of software and the belief in software and thats not going to change mr jobs i think the worlds a better place because bill realized that his goal isnt to be the richest guy in the cemetery thats a good thing and so hes doing a lot of good with the money that he made im sure bill was like me in this way i mean i grew up fairly middle class lower middle class and i never really cared much about money and apple was so successful early on in life that i was very lucky that i didnt have to care about money then and so ive been able to focus on work and then later on my family and i sort of look at us as two of the luckiest guys on the planet because we found what we loved to do and we were at the right place at the right time and weve gotten to go to work every day with super bright people for years and do what we love doing i dont think about legacy much i just think about being able to get up every day and go in and hang around these great people and hopefully create something that other people will love as much as we do and if we can do that thats great question from the audience you approached the same opportunity so very differently what did you learn about running your own business that you wished you had thought of sooner or thought of first by watching the other guy mr gates id give a lot to have steves taste in terms of intuitive taste both for people and products we sat in mac product reviews where there were questions about software choices how things would be done that i viewed as an engineering question thats just how my mind works and id see steve make the decision based on a sense of people and product that is even hard for me to explain the way he does things is just different and i think its magical mr jobs because woz and i started the company based on doing the whole banana we werent so good at partnering with people and you know actually the funny thing is microsofts one of the few companies we were able to partner with that actually worked for both companies and we werent so good at that where bill and microsoft were really good at it because they didnt make the whole thing in the early days and they learned how to partner with people really well and i think if apple could have had a little more of that in its dna it would have served it extremely well and i dont think apple learned that until a few decades later ms swisher whats the greatest misunderstanding in your relationship and about each other mr jobs weve kept our marriage secret for over a decade now laughter and applause mr gates its been fun to work together i actually kind of miss some of the people who arent around anymore you know people come and go in this industry its nice when somebody sticks around and they have some context of all the things that have worked and not worked mr jobs when bill and i first met each other and worked together in the early days generally we were both the youngest guys in the room right im about six months older than he is but roughly the same age and now when were working at our respective companies im the oldest guy in the room most of the time i think of most things in life as either a bob dylan or a beatles song but theres that one line in that one beatles song "you and i have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead " and thats clearly true here
