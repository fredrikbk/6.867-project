there has been reams of writing on the mildness of the downturn in housing jobs this year but we are equally surprised at how restrained nonresidential construction employment has been is it possible that some workers are switching from housing to commercial projects but are still being counted within the residential categories leisure payrolls jumped by as amusement parks and restaurants added a combined presumably a weather boost the seesaw pattern in payroll readings so far this year reflects the swings in the weather more than anything else in our view while the underlying fundamentals seem unusually steady stephen stanley rbs greenwich capital todays report was a strong one more jobs more hours per job more earnings per hour these data confirm our view that last months relatively slow payroll increase of was a weather related aberration payrolls are up million in the past twelve months while civilian employment adjusted for the payroll concept is up million the u s labor market has been in excellent shape and we expect it to remain that way for the foreseeable future first trust advisors nonfarm payrolls rose more than expected with unemployment at a low and wage
