weekend journal bookmarks dinner with dad by cameron stracher random house pages &# dinner with the family isnt that one of those things that got left behind with the s a family sitting down together at the dinner table was once a reliable scene in wholesome movies and eisenhower era sitcoms where dad knew best and mom kept the house going and bub and sis had problems but nothing that couldnt be fixed in minutes and nobody had to check into rehab but over time somewhere between woodstock and "saturday night fever" family dinner became a casualty of cultural fashion part of a rejection of all that was tame suburban and supposedly false a few short years later life came to be lived in ways that made it hard for families to eat together even if they wanted to everyone was too busy commuting meant leaving the house before the kids were out of bed and coming home so late that often they were back in it who had time for food shopping and cooking a few parents dirty little secret time preferred a restaurant adult conversation and good wine to macaroni and cheese in the company of sulky kids with wayward table manners but something was lost in this social evolution as cameron stracher came to realize in a series of small epiphanies most of them occurring on his way in and out of new york city where he worked he lived in westport conn and earned a good living but his long hours had made him a stranger in his own home "absence does not make the heart grow fonder " he discovered "to the contrary it hardens the heart makes it shrivel and crack until there is nothing left but a small efficient pump " so he vowed to do better "dinner with dad" is a delightful account of what happened when mr stracher made it his goal to get home in time for dinner five times a week over the course of months and to make dinner half the time he learns how to prepare things that his son daughter and vegetarian wife will eat how to shop how to turn dinner into something more than a pit stop where everyone refuels before getting back out on the fast track the book the genesis of which was an essay published in these pages is a mix of anecdote social commentary and reflection mr stracher does not shrink from the tradeoffs that his commitment requires among other things he gives up income to improve his schedule and he endures sleepless nights wondering where the money will come from and family interaction does not always yield cozy "ozzie and harriet" moments "as i toss and turn " he writes "i wonder whether having children makes us impatient immature impulsive and unwise " in short there are good days and bad days good dinners and bad dinners after an afternoon of shuttling the kids from event to event and finally arriving home mr strachers daughter asks "daddy what are we having for dinner " he notes "i have traveled from the father who was never home for dinner to the father without whom dinner is unimaginable in my daughters mind i am not only present for dinner i am an essential ingredient " the payoff for mr stracher is undeniable the reader will feel the same way about his instructive book
