boeing and airbus compete to destroy what they built how to recycle a jetliner is topic of trash talk snipping off the wings chateauroux france airbus and boeing have competed to build jetliners for nearly years now theyre jockeying to destroy them more efficiently one morning at an airfield here a giant industrial maw chomped through a passenger plane like scissors through tinfoil a car shredder then turned the remains into gravel size bits "its heartbreaking but necessary " said charles kofyan who runs the operation for frances bartin recycling group bartin which belongs to a trade group formed by boeing co runs one of the most environmentally friendly centers for eliminating unwanted jets mr kofyan says that thanks to new dismantling techniques bartin can reclaim nearly of an old airliner airbus officials scoff at the claim "were doubtful this is what bartin can achieve " said olivier malavallon manager of environmental affairs at airbus according to mr malavallon only of a plane can be recycled using currently available technology airbus hopes to be able to recycle of a jetliner by mr malavallon is leading a team of engineers that has dismantled an airbus a jetliner at another french airfield and is carefully studying the results their tools include ion blasting mass spectrometers that take chemical fingerprints of the planes various materials and a razor sharp water jet used to sever its wings boeings undertaking "isnt playing in the same ballpark " mr malavallon boasted as he walked through a hangar filled with jetliner entrails at the tarbes airport in southwest france behind the latest trash talk between airbus and boeing is a growing challenge eliminating the worlds aging airline fleet as it reaches retirement some passenger jets are expected to end their flying careers over the next years so finding ways to recycle them in an environmentally and financially efficient way is critically important until recently many grounded planes simply rotted alongside runways as so called "resting wrecks " lots more sat parked in the mojave desert with unplugged hoses dripping corrosive fluids and batteries leaching acid stripped of everything of any value most were eventually sold as scrap then two years ago a retired boeing that had been demolished improperly turned up illegally dumped by unknown culprits in an empty lot in scotland billy glover boeings director of environmental performance strategy made the plane his rallying cry for cleaner recycling policies "it became a way to get peoples attention across the industry " he said the result was that in april of last year boeing the bartin outfit and a handful of others involved in jetliner reprocessing created a trade group called the aircraft fleet recycling association or afra it now includes companies and can recycle more than planes per year at facilities near tucson ariz and in chateauroux the first step in demolishing a plane removing and reselling reusable parts is a profitable business mr kofyan of bartin explained as he unlocked a storage room at chateauroux airport inside components of a retired air kazakhstan airbus a that mr kofyans company had bought for &# million sat neatly stacked and labeled "this is our ali babas cave " said gregoire lebigot who handles online sales of plane parts before the a was ripped apart its engines were sold in an online auction for &# million one shock absorber for more than &# and the cockpit windshield for about &# mr lebigot said together about pieces of the plane including galley ovens windows and an internal mechanism called a screw jack sold for nearly &# million stripped of its parts the a carcass was then rolled outside to a fenced off lot and hoisted onto cement blocks so its valuable landing gear could be amputated nearby lay the twisted remains of an air france boeing two severed cockpits gouged from other aircraft sat like skulls on a museum shelf when the a was ready for final demolition a crane operator approached and extended his vehicles hydraulic arm maneuvering powerful pincers the driver chewed the planes rear section off with a screech of ripping metal he then snipped the dead planes wing as if carving a turkey mr kofyan who was overseeing the destruction process explained that the lots concrete paving is specially lined so that nasty liquids like hydraulic fluid dont seep through after shattered plane parts are dumped in the car shredder the macerated remains are sorted and recycled for use in cars bicycles and cans he said mr kofyan shrugs off airbus officials doubts insisting that bartin recycles as much as of a plane "we do it and we can show it " he said going further than that however would be too expensive to make sense he added airbuss plans to come up with an even more efficient recycling process date back several years to when managers of the european plane maker began to worry that the european union would tighten its environmental requirements for demolishing and disposing of planes airbus officials say they didnt want to be caught off guard so airbus assembled a team of experts including specialists from its parent company european aeronautic defence &amp space co and the waste management unit of french energy conglomerate suez sa early last year they made tarbes airfield near the catholic shrine of our lady of lourdes in southwestern france their base and started work on an old airbus a that had spent years flying in brazil japan and saudi arabia the team painted the old plane with the projects name pamela for process for advanced management of end of life of aircraft first technicians removed the tail fin and sucked out fluids that gravity couldnt empty to clip the wings engineers decided not to use a chain saw or searing plasma torch which consume a lot of energy and produce noxious gases said bruno costes airbuss director of environmental affairs instead suez engineers used a water jet to chop off the wings and then recycled the water after lopping off the cockpit workers turned to the planes body tethered like mountaineers workers tested different methods of destruction for different sections of the plane suez managers monitored the time it took for each step in one section workers removed galleys toilets plastic interior walls ventilation ducts wiring and insulation blankets then they removed each rivet and bolt "unfortunately the airplane is well fitted so it wont break " mr malavallon joked about the effort required once the a plane was decimated workers separated components such as metal skin structure and fasteners and sorted them by material each was weighed and placed in bins labeled like specimen jars for analysis airbus and suez managers are now crunching all the data they collected from the as demolition they hope the analysis will allow them to figure out the most efficient and profitable way to destroy planes mr malavallon bets that even boeing could end up learning from the airbus experience "if we do a good job boeing will cut and paste what weve done " chuckled mr malavallon "we have no problem with that "
