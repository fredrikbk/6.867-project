weekend journal deconstructing tripadvisor nancy keates on how seasoned travelers decode the ratings on the nations most influential hotel review site simply the best " "very grand " "awesome " "unbelievable " the last one might be the most accurate youd think a reporter who has covered travel for this newspaper for more than a decade wouldnt be fooled by such superlatives but on a trip in january my family discovered that some people who write reviews on tripadvisor com are thrilled to pay &# to spend the night next to an eight lane highway ranked on the web site as the no property in carlsbad calif ahead of the four seasons aviara and the famous la costa spa the west inn &amp suites wasnt only far from the center of the quaint oceanside town it was also next to a working train track with a view of a large power plant for many tripadvisor has become a first stop for travel planning thanks in part to its prominence in google searches some million visitors a month check out what other users have to say about where to stay eat and play around the world in contrast publisher frommers sells million guidebooks a year with more than hotels its sheer breadth of properties makes it more useful than other hotel web sites its wide range of contributors there are nearly million reviews and opinions make it more democratic at a conference in november the chief executive of guidebook publisher lonely planet said the web sites influence is so great that the company considered eliminating hotel reviews altogether tripadvisor is also gobbling up a number of other sites that do things like search for low airfares and list seating charts on airplanes but relying on the wisdom of crowds can be dangerous when chirag chotalia a private equity investor from new york booked a long weekend at the ritz carlton south beach in miami this march he was swayed by two reviews one raved about the "excellent" staff the other called the service "stellar " instead the year old says he found surly unprofessional concierges a long wait at check in and an under staffed pool a spokeswoman says that the "overwhelming majority" of guests are very happy with their stays to avoid such pitfalls it is necessary to deconstruct every review and its author after all a hotel recommended by a once a year vacationer could be a disaster for a business traveler what someone from liverpool england finds luxurious might not appeal to a picky manhattanite roosters crowing at dawn may not seem worth mentioning to some reviewers while others might think harping on things like an "intermittent electrical buzzing in the air unit" see amalfi hotel chicago is a tad excessive in an attempt to decode tripadvisor i interviewed heavy users and spoke to online travel experts the most common and most obvious place to start when determining reliability is to weed out reviews that are way off the mean those that have one star when the rest are positive or five stars when the others are mixed that indicates either an unusual incident or a writer with some interest in the hotel like a rival property or the general managers friend other hints a review might be fake the writer mentions a nearby property as superior has only written about that one hotel and has only visited the site once on the day of the review you can check for other hotels a writer has evaluated by clicking on the reviewers name next study the reviewer as closely as the review in february juan padro a headhunter from north grafton mass was weighing a trip to ladera in soufriere st lucia a resort that elicited mixed opinions on tripadvisor some guests raved about the privacy peace and beauty while others complained it was too much like a campground to justify the average &# a night rate mr padro didnt make up his mind until he read a review entitled "what a rip off " it said "one of the things that must be mentioned is the fact that the moment the sun starts going down the beautiful chorrus sic of frogs starts their singing until the sun rises again it was really hard to fall asleep with all that noise " the reviewer complained that the music and the atmosphere in the bar was "veeeeery relaxed" and left for south beach miami two days into a day stay "the guy was so clearly a meathead " says mr padro who decided correctly it turned out that any resort that would scare off someone like that would be perfect for him excessive effusiveness is a red flag for wayne rutman a private investor from wilmington del who is on the road every month and frequently uses tripadvisor to plan his trips phrases like "dream vacation of a lifetime" and "best place i ever stayed" signal a lack of experience people who find it necessary to say theyre world travelers in the first line are also suspicious like someone who feels the need to impress others at a cocktail party he says often the reviews are dead on fusion suites the bed and breakfast ranked as the no property in amsterdam is an amazing find with enormous rooms located on a tree lined street near the van gogh museum i had never heard of eastgate tower near the united nations in new york when i took a chance again on trip advisor and booked it for a recent family vacation the &# a night suite had two large bedrooms with two beds in each two bathrooms a living room and a full kitchen it was clean and well staffed there was even a bellman who carried bags where a reviewer lives a detail listed right next to the user name can be a telling clue among heavy users in the u s there are ongoing discussions about whether non americans can be trusted "europeans have different standards " says loren medina a school social worker in paramus n j who travels with her husband and children "the rooms are smaller theyre in older buildings with older plumbing they find more things acceptable " mr chotalia the new york investor who was disappointed with his stay at the ritz carlton south beach wonders if such geographic issues played a role the upbeat reviewers "sounded educated and worldly so i thought i could respect their opinions " he says but when he looked again he noticed the first was from manchester england and the second from canada "there are cultural differences between canadians and americans " says a spokesman for the canadian embassy in washington the reviewers hometown can count even within the u s bob mcdevitt whose screen name is capbob doesnt believe anything written by a new yorker the year old salesman from boston says "people from there wouldnt like anything anyway " heres an excerpt from mr mcdevitts tripadvisor write up of the westin rio mar in puerto rico which is now the rio mar beach resort &amp spa a wyndham grand resort "a group of five middle age golfers fishermen general tourists stayed for days in mid march we found the hotel to be excellent " new york banker aylin ural wrote a review of the same hotel a week later "every morning starting at a m we awoke to people walking above us doors slamming constantly toilets flushing incessantly and people from the parking lot shouting this is every morning we are from manhattan so we are used to noise " she says reviews by manhattanites are often the only ones shell believe "we have certain standards " she says many accolades by her brethren "beautiful beaches" and "a true paradise" steered her to spend her honeymoon at marriott frenchmans reef in st thomas despite numerous tripadvisor dissenters who hailed from other locales she loved it the reviewers user name matters to michelle hill who lives in lake placid n y and travels with her husband and kids several times a year a recent report by someone called "crzycncun" was believable she decided because it meant that person had a lot of experience in cancun in the review crzycncun mentioned that she had a teenager that was an added bonus for ms hill since finding somewhere kids that age can be happy is difficult she says ms hill always clicks on a user name to check what other properties that person has written about she considers herself "very particular" a westin hotels kind of person as opposed to a best western gal review writers who stay in chains she would avoid wouldnt understand what shes looking for she says the jackpot finding someone who has reviewed a property where shes also stayed so she knows if theyre in sync in general tripadvisor is more helpful for smaller more obscure properties that arent fully covered by other sources it can be time consuming and less effective for well known hotels because they have so many reviews that are often so widely disparate making it hard to get a sense of the property orlando fla based consultant mark feinberg discovered that when he was planning a trip for this month to new york to celebrate his daughters th birthday finding himself stuck on the web site for hours trying to decide between the four seasons and the ritz carlton he finally went with his cousins advice and chose the four seasons because he was so confused by what he read on tripadvisor the four seasons reviews ranged from "wow what a place" to "nightmare after nightmare " according to the latter "there was still feces flecking the toilet when we checked in and a hair on the nice white sheets the front desk staff were gruff and unhelpful failing to even answer basic questions about museums and theatre tickets " comments on the ritz carlton central park also ran the gamut from "missed it by very much" to "perfect stay " the four seasons hotels director of marketing brian honan says the chain takes feedback "really seriously " and that the hotel has no record of any such complaints over the dates the guest stayed at the hotel a ritz carlton spokeswoman says it views comments from guests as a chance to "continue to improve " when certain key words "hurricane" or "construction" pop up trip advisor is at its best it is one of the few places to find indications that a recent event has affected the hotels quality mr feinberg learned that lesson the hard way when he stayed at the renaissance resort at the world golf village in saint augustine fla a few months after a hurricane reviews he read in golfing magazines had raved about the place but he smelled mildew and mold everywhere when he looked on tripadvisor afterwards he saw people had mentioned the problem renaissance general manager mark schwantner says the resort did experience a problem after the hurricane knocked out power for a few days since then the resort has spent over &# million adding new dehumidification units and resealing the building it now monitors interior humidity levels to make sure they dont exceed when tripadvisor started in the site was a search engine that hooked into travel information already on the web from newspapers magazines online guidebooks chat rooms message boards and personal home pages as traffic grew people started adding their own reviews which soon became the most read pages on the site "when we first thought of pushing the user reviews we were actually a little nervous about whether the site would just turn into a gripe site " says tripadvisor co founder and chief executive officer stephen kaufer instead most of the reviews were overwhelmingly positive that gave the company the idea to earn money by "contextual commerce links " allowing consumers to make a reservation through links to booking sites hotel booking sites started to see the value in that in iac interactivecorp bought tripadvisor for an estimated &# million and wrapped it into its expedia group it later spun off the expedia group including tripadvisor into a separate company revenue from the person company comes from travel related advertising and the fees tripadvisor gets from online booking sites when users click to make a reservation it often isnt enough just to have a lot of traffic on a web site says scott kessler an equity analyst with standard &amp poors since tripadvisor has such high quality traffic people who use it have a great interest in making a purchase since they are considering a trip it makes financial sense to take that traffic and try to turn it into revenue says mr kessler as a result tripadvisor has shifted from solely a forum like site to more of a transaction based model in august the company changed its format so that instead of going directly to hotel reviews the home pages default became similar to what youd find on airline booking web sites consumers enter dates of travel and destination and are presented with a list of properties they can book online thats a different list from the top hotels as ranked by tripadvisor users to get to that page users have to type the name of the city followed by the word "hotels" in the main search bar sometimes the drive to monetize can be at odds with the drive to be consumer friendly tripadvisor doesnt give a hotels web address unless that hotel pays it to do so encouraging visitors to use online booking sites including expedia orbitz hotels com and others and discouraging them from leaving the trip advisor site "if all we did was look out for consumers wed provide a link that would take you to a hotels web site " says mr kaufer "it does absolutely conflict with our interest in making money " he says tripadvisor looks out for consumers in many other ways and that there are paid links to hotel sites the companys revenue is still small at &# million in compared with sites like expedia and travelocity however with profit margins estimated above and a growth rate thought to be over a year the site offers potential at a time when hotels and airlines are trying to take back online bookings and get consumers to go directly to their sites says aaron kessler an analyst at piper jaffray companies as the web site has evolved so have the users it is possible to see how other reviewers rate a review a feature called "helpful votes " people can also pick a few hotels off a destinations top rankings and then go into the tripadvisor forums where locals tend to respond thats where the sites addicts often congregate as well over members have posted to the forums since the site started them three years ago the company says of those have posted more than a thousand times the most active member posted times taking the time to open photos posted by reviewers helps users get a sense of the writer one noteworthy example a picture of a pair of dirty socks used to illustrate a lapse in housekeeping frequent tripadvisor visitors also use the subrankings including "romance " "families" and "singles" and the information listed to the right of reviews that give the writers age purpose of their trip and reasons for selecting the hotel a new feature on the site lets users email a reviewer directly to get more information though the west inn is still rated the top hotel in carlsbad since my familys stay there reviewers have remarked about the hotels downsides including its location why didnt that happen earlier kim akers the hotels general manager says people did mention its proximity to the highway and that i didnt go far back enough into the reviews but that in most cases they all said it didnt diminish the experience because the hotel has triple paned windows music piped in outside by the pool and a shuttle to take guests to downtown carlsbad then again there are some things people just wont tell you tara yelman a divorce attorney from san diego found the four seasons hualalai on the big island hawaii through trip advisor and asked for a room as quiet as possible after reading some complaints about thin walls the room she stayed in an oceanfront with the best full ocean view on the property separated from most of the other rooms at the hotel is now so precious to her she wont ever give away the room number especially not on tripadvisor
