from teletubbies creator high tech high cost tv stratford upon avon england when he decided to write his second childrens tv show producer andy davenport worried about topping his past work his only other show "teletubbies" became a global phenomenon when it was introduced years ago "what the hell do you follow it with " says mr davenport his answer "in the night garden " a show that looks simple yet is so technically difficult to produce that his crew often questioned if it was over the top mr davenport a year old former puppeteer is using hollywood techniques including a camera held level by gyroscopes high definition videotape and electronic laden costumes and instead of shooting each episode one by one all shots were filmed in blocks like a movie the schedule and mr davenports demands strained the resources of ragdoll productions uk ltd the small production company near here in shakespeare country that hired him to create "in the night garden " says lee phillips the shows visual effects supervisor at &# million for episodes "in the night garden " is is the most expensive childrens show the british broadcasting corp has co financed the bbcs commercial arm bbc worldwide and its childrens channel cbeebies joined ragdoll to finance the show by contrast episodes of teletubbies cost &# million in that show actors looked through holes in the costumes mouths and directions were yelled at them through a megaphone mr davenport the co creator wrote all episodes "in the night garden" is set in a magical garden representing a dream world each minute show starts with an actual child getting into bed and the dream world takes off the show which stars such characters as igglepiggle upsy daisy and the tomliboos is designed to help with one of the most difficult parenting tasks putting children to sleep the premiere of "in the night garden" was in march and while ratings arent measured for audiences aged five and under the bbc says about homes are tuning in weekdays to the show a big number recently when the bbc took the common tv step of putting the show on hiatus for a few weeks so producers could churn out more episodes it was hit with a barrage of complaints from parents the show returns to air june a line of toys will be released in the united kingdom on july executives from ragdoll productions are planning to go to new york in a few weeks to talk to u s networks about buying the show jocelyn stevenson a childrens television producer in london says its tough to sell childrens shows overseas particularly in the u s where there are a lot of local shows to compete with but the chances of "in the night garden" being bought by a u s network are high because of the reputation of "teletubbies " she says "and it has that educational aspect which goes down well in the u s " she says mostly shot in a private wood in central england "in the night garden" makes extensive use of what the industry calls "blue screens " or plain backdrops used in such movie franchises as "star wars" and "spider man " enabling producers to add computer generated graphics to scenes with real actors in postproduction shot over months in and "in the night garden" had a full time crew of people including prop designers from the johnny depp film "charlie and the chocolate factory " filming outside the crew strung a camera on a cable to fly over the set an arborist was hired to reinforce trees supporting the cable many episodes end with the whole cast dancing in the forest from finger size puppets to foot high balloons floating through the trees the second scene took four days to set up and has separate real and computer generated shots melded together "thats the money shot " mr phillips says in one second scene a boy walks over a bridge and waves to makka pakka a creature pushing a bicycle below although it looks simple the actors were performing on sets about yards apart in a forest using thumbnail size video screens mounted an inch in front of their eyes to coordinate their movements high definition movie cameras were set at identical angles to the sun to ensure the shadows lined up the scenes were shot simultaneously and spliced together in editing "we believed it would improve the performances by making them see each other" on the video screens says director dirk campbell the two sets were necessary because makka pakka is played by a male actor in a costume that makes him appear seven feet tall off camera but he is meant to look just two feet tall in the show so performs on his own set which is a copy of the main set but twice its size the actors had a hard time with the tiny video screens because they show a mirror image one actor in particular a tombliboo wasnt sure which way to move to solve the problem the director encouraged her to stumble around like a baby learning to walk about people auditioned for the six main roles a stunt man professional dancer and a circus acrobat were selected for their stamina wearing heavy costumes they could only spend minutes in the suits before their sweat would interfere with the electronics as with "teletubbies " the actors are forbidden from revealing their names in public to hide the fact from young viewers that the characters arent real ragdoll says mr davenport who worked in a trailer next to the set listened through a speaker on his desk to the director and actors as the crew became more proficient at filming on multiple sets he says he began to write more intricate scenes mr davenport and mr phillips the visual effects head argued over some of mr davenports more involved requests though mr davenport generally won for example when a gazebo was called for mr phillips wanted to make it out of computer graphics which he said he could do in days but mr davenport wanted the real thing with a rotating roof and got it his nondigital gazebo took four months to build
