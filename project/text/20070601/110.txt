weekend journal review film knocked up delivers rare mix of raunch warmth torrents of laugh lines costner is banal killer in amateurish mr brooks no conclusion has ever been more foregone "knocked up" will be a huge hit the hero is a slob the story is about what the title says its about and the movie goes about telling it in a style that is casually profane sexually explicit often coarse and occasionally crude should the film be seen then as just another sign of civilizations decline not for a moment judd apatows high density high intensity comedy of bad and good manners is a cause for celebration the laugh lines are smart and they come faster than you can process them for anyone concerned about the state of mainstream films this is also an occasion for some wonderment at mr apatows gift for mating the crowd pleasing raunchiness with a generous spirit genuine sweetness uncommon delicacy zestful social criticism and a moral dimension that provides substance and meaning without ever getting in the way the premise is almost as simple as it seems the slob hooks up at a bar with a gorgeous blonde whos there to celebrate a big promotion a few weeks after their drunken encounter which is much more plausible than it sounds shes pregnant and hes dumbfounded but the complications begin with a pair of beautifully nuanced performances seth rogen is ben katherine heigl is allison and they proceed from the characters essential selves allison may be behind her facade of professional accomplishment one more child about to have a child but having her child is a given she never considers abortion as an option the birth scene is both stirring and shocking ben may be behind his slob exterior a hapless boor and a quintessential slacker he and his goony buddies are trying in their cyberspace cadet fashion to put together a soft core web site but hes also tender gentle and vulnerable an overgrown under socialized boy with a touching potential for commitment and growth two years ago judd apatow directed "the year old virgin " a similarly raunchy and improbably affecting comedy that he co wrote with steve carell that film starred mr carell in the title role of andy a shy guy working in an electronics store while one of andys co workers cal was played by seth rogen who helped inspire the idea for this film far from lithe and given to bleak expressions mr rogen is an unlikely candidate for the post of matinee idol but then so was dustin hoffman in "the graduate " and katherine heigl follows in the footsteps of great beauties like michelle pfeiffer or most recently keri russell who break out of the beauty trap with comedic smarts and fierce passion "knocked up" abounds with fine performances judd apatows skill as a writer is matched by his direction of actors of the several cast members previously seen in "the year old virgin" and or mr apatows late lamented tv series "freaks and geeks " the most prominent are the filmmakers wife leslie mann and paul rudd they play allisons sister debbie and her husband pete whose married life is a no fun house mirror version of what ben and allisons alliance might be indeed its a tacitly grim as well as hilarious picture of a couple struggling to make their marriage work just as ben and his achievement free buds are a sharply comic reflection of american adolescence as a lifelong career yet the movies big heart isnt in criticizing the way people live "knocked up" has a more hopeful outlook on life and on bens and allisons prospects of all things its a paean to family values mr brooks mr brooks" manages to be deeply loathsome no small feat for a film thats shallowly amateurish kevin costner stars if you can apply that term to self besmirchment in the jekyll and hyde role of earl brooks a businessman who is also a serial killer william hurt plays a gloomy guy called marshall hes supposed to be earls alter ego or maybe his id whatever marshall is he and earl have near interminable discussions that fill the time between earls killings dane cook performs a notable act of levitation by rising if only sporadically above the role of a photographer turned blackmailer but demi moore as a police detective is right down there at kevin costners level raising questions about why presumably solvent actors would sign up for such squalid work the film was directed by bruce a evans who wrote the script with raynold gideon writing in this case meant piling on banal ideas then expressing them in turgid dialogue at least the writing got the acting it deserved paprika for an alternate set of exciting alter egos see satoshi kons "paprika " a brilliant anime feature in japanese with english subtitles the binary star is by day a demure japanese research psychotherapist dr atsuko chiba and by night a fearless young warrior code named "paprika " who can dive into patients dangerous dreams by using a device called a dc mini in pre psychological terms the sexy dream diver is simply a hot version of the cool scientist or more simply still the spice of life terrorists have stolen four prototypes of the device so the movie gives voice to a japanese theme that goes all the way back to "godzilla " a monster spawned by the atom bomb the loss of control over scientific creations at the same time satoshi kon whose previous film was the remarkable "tokyo godfathers " uses the complex plot as a pretext for joyous psychedelia images tumble and flow as if truly in a dream from subconscious minds stuffed like junk shops with toys dolls circus animals parade floats pop artifacts and surreal movie scenes that suggest next year at marienbad the abundance is almost mad and madly enjoyable dvd tip when diehard kevin costner fans wax nostalgic about his great roles they usually go back to "bull durham " a great movie against which theres nothing to be said or "field of dreams" and "dances with wolves " two movies against which theres plenty to say though ill refrain from saying it here as recently as however he directed and starred in a perfectly lovely western called "open range " the title is ironic in when the action takes place cowboys like mr costners charley driving free range herds across public lands find themselves hunted down by ranchers with private holdings the cast includes robert duvall and annette bening james muro did the expansive cinematography
