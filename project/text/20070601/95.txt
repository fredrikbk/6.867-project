the evening wrap on the rebound online edition surging gasoline prices and a still lousy housing market have prompted much hand wringing about the economy but after a hard slog in the first three months of the year it may be poised to break out the economy grew at a annual rate in the first quarter an anemic pace by any reckoning but some new data suggest that the expansion may be shaking off its bout of seasonal affective disorder in the second quarter perhaps most critically employers added new jobs to nonfarm payrolls during may a vast improvement from the meager gain seen a month earlier to be sure the number of jobs created this month wasnt particularly huge and the trend in hiring could still be headed downward because of the unraveling of the housing market but some economists see the pace of job creation as just robust enough to keep consumers spending an argument that seemed to be supported by a separate report from the commerce department that revealed that consumer spending increased by during april when hiring was much weaker than it was last month whats more consumers may be shrugging off the sizable surge in gas prices consumer sentiment brightened in may the university of michigan found even as gasoline prices soared "strong labor markets are surely a factor here " said abiel reinhart of j p morgan chase one of the major weak spots in the employment report was the drop in manufacturing jobs but that sectors fortunes could also be prepared to turn around the institute for supply management said that its factory index improved to a reading of its best reading in a year and the second month in a row in which it has improved manufacturers spent much of the last year or so trying to get inventories in better balance with demand and stephen stanley of rbs greenwich capital said just as factories started to get near the sweet spot new orders picked back up a combination that he says has "all the makings of a perfect scenario for a noticeable pickup in factory activity " if thats the case it could also foreshadow a noticeable pickup in the economy at large during the first quarter growth was restrained by the ballooning international deficit and a slowdown in business spending but if factories are humming it could be a hint that businesses are less reluctant to spoon money into growing their operations and the ism report showed export orders ascended to their loftiest perch since december a sign that trade could be less of a hurdle moving forward morgan stanley economists wrote that while it was not mentioned explicitly by the ism report they suspect the "sharp turnaround in motor vehicle assemblies during the past few months is an important contributor to the recent upside in orders and production " but if the autos sector as a whole is helping to light a fire under the manufacturing realm the various auto makers themselves are still experiencing mixed fortunes both general motors and toyota motor bounced back from an abysmal april to notch strong sales gm said that its light vehicle sales jumped while toyota posted a jump in sales and climbed over ford motor whose sales skidded to claim second place in the u s sales rankings gm reported that even with gasoline prices at nosebleed levels it saw strong demand for its full size pickups toyota which is celebrated for its fuel friendly sedans and experienced strong demand for its prius hybrid also posted strong sales of full size trucks but gm reduced its outlook for industry wide sales blaming high gas prices and the weak housing market

forced to battle a new foe thats worryingly close to home an army of hairy caterpillars that is moving through the countrys forests the so called processional caterpillars named for the way that they march one after the other across whatever soil they happen to be terrorizing are covered in long toxic hairs that have provoked all kinds of woe for the allergic europes recent mild weather has provided ideal conditions for the bugs to breed and millions of them are now wandering the countryside traps and pesticide air raids have done nothing to slow the caterpillars down so now belgian officials are ordered troops into the woods to burn them out starting next week troops will be equipped with huge blowtorches and sent to the forest to wage a tree by tree war against the scourge "they will go through the forests and burn the little animals off the trees " said a spokeswoman for the belgian military "there have not been enough people to do this and i think we can make the
