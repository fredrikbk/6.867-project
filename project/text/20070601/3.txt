america must confront the threatening nations it was with great interest that i read john r boltons may editorial page commentary "pyongyangs perfidy " which was a confirmation of his prediction made in the early spring when he stated that the agreements made by the six party negotiations team would never be honored by north korea when president bush was asked about mr boltons prediction his response was that mr bolton was dead wrong but unfortunately time has proven that the president was dead wrong i personally understand and support mr boltons actions particularly when he was u s ambassador to the u n as i was his first principal when he was admitted as a scholarship student to the independent mcdonogh school north of baltimore it quickly became apparent that this youngster was highly intelligent with a quick mind and keen foresightedness mr bolton has never been satisfied with the status quo but is always searching for a more efficient and realistic method of solving a problem you can always depend on him to "tell it like it is" and then be willing to defend his position accordingly the john bolton you witness today is a mirror image of the john whom i knew as a student i respectfully suggest that his skeptics rise above their own irresponsible selfish personal interests and those of their political parties and take a more definitive and aggressive position in this global conflict not only in iraq but also with the other threatening nations of the world such as iran and north korea otherwise the iraq war will resemble a "brush fire" in comparison with what could happen if a "volcanic explosion" should ever materialize from these other threatening nations softness and appeasement in todays troubled world is definitely a sign of defensive weakness that will eventually lead to defeat can america wake up before its too late quinton d thompson towson md
