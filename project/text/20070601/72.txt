reward can be far richer with foreign banks offering such things as a test drives in a ferrari and wine tastings to beef up business since april some foreign banks in china have been allowed for the first time to do business in local currency with individual customers removing an important hurdle for lenders in the worlds fourth biggest economy the change part of chinas commitments when it joined the world trade organization more than five years ago has prompted a scramble by big banks such as citigroup hsbc holdings standard chartered and bank of east asia but foreign banks claim only a tiny share of total deposits and dont have the scale to compete on basic retail services with the stodgy state owned banks that have tens of thousands of branches across the country instead theyre hoping to tap demand for more lucrative services from the swelling ranks of chinas well off like investment advice and special accounts for education that presents a marketing challenge though persuading prospective customers to walk into a foreign bank branch isnt as simple as buying more television ads billboards and full page spreads in the sunday paper though foreign banks are indeed doing those things banks have to figure out a way to more narrowly target wealthier chinese this is where the high end freebies come in citigroups citibank has arranged test drives in ferraris or land rovers for prospective clients standard chartered has offered wine tastings and luxury goods promotions hsbc has held seminars with economists flown up from hong kong while the banks do these things in other countries too executives say they rely on them more in china "we need to generate long term brand equity you need loyalty to sustain a price premium " says tom doctoroff north asia chief executive of wpp groups ad agency jwt which represents hsbc for all the gains that chinese companies have made in manufacturing and technology marketing is one area where western companies often still hold the edge but for foreign companies managing their reputations can be a delicate exercise starbucks learned that earlier this year when the coffee giant opened an outlet in the beijings forbidden city six years ago the opposition was fierce initially but later died down then in january bloggers suddenly began calling for starbucks to be evicted from that location thousands of chinese took up the cause

lilian chen an executive with a foreign pharmaceuticals company in shanghai often receives mail from standard chartered and abn amro holdings promoting their private banking services followed by sales calls "they keep coming and explaining things to you thats unique " says ms chen who is considering opening an account with a foreign bank more traditional advertising also still plays a significant role for foreign banks focus media holding which has some video monitors that play ads in high end office buildings and luxury apartment complexes across china says it has seen a sharp increase in ads from banks now that restrictions have been lifted in the first quarter this year spending on bank advertising was already one third last years total figure the company says but the ads often have a different flavor than in other countries because banks are still somewhat limited in the services they offer they dont pitch a new mortgage rate or special credit card the way they would in other markets says sheila wong standard chartereds head of corporate affairs in china instead the banks are more focused on just getting their names out and trying to crystallize certain images in the minds of consumers hsbc for example is now running a television ad that shows a kite soaring above crowds of people and over the major financial centers of the world foreign banks are also using strategically placed cash machines to try to raise their profile placing them in airports or highly visible shopping centers "in fact theres a very low number of atms that belong to foreign banks " says michael ip president for greater china and southeast asia of branding consultancy landor associates "but because of the way theyre managed and branded you just notice them a lot more " ellen zhu

commercials total viewership of the ads for "the office" in the three days after it was broadcast was compared to the total viewing level for the live program itself the test was conducted during the week ended may but the new data has some significant shortcomings both networks and advertisers say while it tries to gauge how many people are watching commercials it doesnt show the number who are fast forwarding through the ads using digital video recorders marketers dont want to be charged for people who dont actually watch the commercials "its probably fair to say that the broad majority of people who use dvrs skip some of the ads " said pat mcdonough nielsens senior vice president of planning policy and analysis about of u s households now have dvrs nielsen said yesterday in these households of broadcast programs are watched after they air live "the commercial ratings confirms what we have known for awhile that there is a lot of channel shifting going on in cable and there are
