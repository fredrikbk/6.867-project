weekend journal taste houses of worship religious compromise van turkey our story starts with a small sandstone th century armenian church on an uninhabited rock less than yards wide in a remote turkish lake that changes colors like moods and sometimes bubbles like soda if you had seen the ruins of it as i did in you might cry its roof was gone its bas reliefs chiseled by master carvers a millennium ago of adam and eve of saints and kings were wearing away in the wind it was an empty husk that had not heard a mass in more than years in march after years of painstaking restoration turkey reopened the church as a museum among the ambassadors and visitors at the opening ceremonies i roamed the grounds the building is now magnificent its roof is restored and its reliefs cleaned the church of the holy cross is one of the holiest sites for armenian christians who once made up one third of the population around van they were driven out by the ottomans in when some were suspected of supporting russia backed terrorist attacks during world war i the ottomans were allied with germany and austria fighting russia britain and france while most turkish historians concede there was a massacre of armenians while pointing out that armenians slaughtered turks from to and that most armenians were relocated not slain they hesitate to call it genocide the armenians do not hesitate and sometimes compare it to the holocaust the armenian diaspora has emerged as a real political force in western europe complicating turkeys plans to join the european union the re opening of the church was a peace offering by the akp turkeys islam oriented ruling party but all did not run smoothly at first after spending millions on the structure the turkish government refused to restore the stone cross on the steeple turkish journalists were quick to criticize ultimately common sense prevailed "i cannot say we will have the stone cross back there tomorrow but i do not see any problem in that " culture minister attilla koc said he wanted time for an "academic council" to consider the issue mr kocs answer might not sound "revolutionary" to our ears but turkish news columnist yusuf kanli declared it so many christian churches have been waiting for decades for permission to restore their churches at their own expense at the opening of the church of the holy cross i met george kumar bishop of turkeys some remaining roman catholics he said that five churches in istanbul alone are still awaiting approval to be repaired "i wish they would let us restore all of the churches " he said softly but he doesnt want to push "we will wait and pray " nor did armenian christians who attended the opening ceremonies complain they told me that they were there for history and for peace of course the turks would buy a lot of goodwill by lifting restrictions on repairing churches many turkish politicians even members of the akp see it this way but egemen bagis the prime ministers foreign policy adviser and a member of parliament says that "turkey is a democracy not a sultanate " rebuilding churches here is like building mosques in america and europe controversial among ordinary citizens still the blind machinery of the law lets mosques go up in boston chicago and the rural plains of virginia italy and spain have seen some of the worlds largest mosques change their skylines mr bagis stresses religious tolerance "in my neighborhood in istanbul there are christians muslims and jews living side by side my children have christian and jewish friends " he is right that is the way forward so far everyone has acted with admirable restraint the armenian patriarch who spoke at the opening ceremonies asked only if a mass could be celebrated in the church once a year the culture minister may let a cross grace the roof some people have visited the church since its re opening earlier this spring turkeys critics focus on its ottoman past and more recently its islam oriented ruling party they miss the spirit of compromise that prevails in the republic it is this spirit that unites turkey with the west and separates it from its middle east neighbors a difference made manifest by a small church in van mr miniter is the washington editor of pajamasmedia com and a fellow at the hudson institute see related letter "letters to the editor fear represses discussion of armenian genocide" wsj june
