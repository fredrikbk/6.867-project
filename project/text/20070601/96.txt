day sign up for the e mail here the tide may be turning for rupert murdochs bid to make dow jones and the wall street journal a part of his news corp empire maybe the bancroft family which controls of dow joness voting shares issued a statement last night saying its representatives will meet with news corp to discuss mr murdochs &# billion bid an offer made a month ago almost immediately after that offer was made a representative of the family said enough members to compose a majority of voting shares opposed the deal and some bancrofts as well as other key shareholders strenuously opposed it in public but in yesterdays statement michael b elefante a family representative on the board said that "after a detailed review of the business of dow jones and the evolving competitive environment in which it operates the family has reached consensus that the mission of dow jones may be better accomplished in combination or collaboration with another organization which may include news corp " to that end it will meet with mr murdoch to determine whether he can "ensure the level of commitment to editorial independence integrity and journalistic freedom that is the hallmark of dow jones " mr elefante said adding that the family is receptive "to other options that might achieve the same overarching objectives " by stating such intentions the family "hopes to convey to potentially interested parties that they are willing to consider offers besides mr murdochs " the journal says though no other bidders have publicly emerged in the past several weeks as the dozens of family members digested and discussed the possibilities some have become convinced that "the status quo" isnt a viable option for dow jones the journal reports media industry upheaval since the bid was made has contributed to such concerns including the intended merger of thomson and reuters group which could increase competitive pressure on dow jones newswires people close to the board tell the journal that "some members of the family were confused about the implications of the statement not quite realizing that they were effectively saying they were willing to explore a sale " but as they were discussing whether to rephrase or even withdraw it the online journal posted a draft copy effectively ending the debate people close to the family tell the new york times that some of the deals initial opponents including christopher bancroft are among those now considering a sale and that mr bancrofts vocal opposition may have been a negotiating tactic people close to the family also tell the times the family wants any bidder to offer more money than mr murdochs initial bid of &# a share which was well above the stock price at the time and to promise to install an independent overseer to guarantee the journals editorial independence and integrity complicating consideration of any deal is what variety describes as the "stir inside the journal and in journalism circles" over mr murdochs past practices of allegedly mixing his publications and broadcast outlets editorial message with his other business interests especially when the two intertwine in china it is widely believed

ordered the secret service to keep confidential all logs of visitor entries and exit declaring them to be presidential records that are exempt from the freedom of information act using the same argument it mustered against some congressional requests for testimony from senior white house officials the administration says the records are being kept secret to assure president bush and mr cheney can get the kind of candid advice required by their duties a private group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington is seeking to make the records public in two separate cases justice department filings in the cases show the white house was focusing on the issue in the months before election day the ap reports "discussions moved into high gear when the jack abramoff lobbying scandal prompted news organizations and private groups to demand that the administration turn over secret service records of visitors to the white house complex and the vice presidents residence " the ap says the freedom of information act requires federal agencies to provide public access to their records with exceptions that include national security and privacy concerns but congress isnt covered by the foia law and neither are many presidential records behind the scenes debate over the status of nominally non classified secret service records date back at least to the
