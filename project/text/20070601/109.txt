financial products and services including checking accounts mortgages and trusts "this is a rare opportunity " he said mr thompson said he plans to boost the edwards brokers productivity partly by shifting more client cash from money market funds into its own insured bank accounts where customers often get low rates but wachovia can reinvest the funds more profitably the deal is the biggest for a retail brokerage since ubs ag paid &# billion for painewebber group inc in after the deals likely close in the fourth quarter wachovia will have brokerage client assets of about &# trillion compared

meanwhile citigroup yesterday disputed wachovias suggestion that it would be overtaken by the deal saying it has added about brokers this quarter with two small acquisitions and wachovia is likely to suffer attrition by the time the edwards deal closes in all citigroup says it has brokers a few hundred more than wachovias claimed total david carroll president of wachovias capital management group

west financial corp an oakland calif savings and loan devoted to adjustable rate mortgages mr thompson swore off deals in the wake of golden west but has signaled in recent months he was ready to do
