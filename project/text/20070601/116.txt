weekend journal taste school daze new york this week ill be in a pew at the madison avenue presbyterian church as my daughter karen plays the guitar with four classmates at her schools middle and upper division spring concert funny it seems like only yesterday that i was in the balcony of the brick church on park avenue watching karen strum the gibson during a "rudolph the red nosed reindeer" sing a long at her schools winter concert actually yesterday i was at a midtown concert hall listening to my flute playing son tootle through a jazz inflected medley from "west side story" during his schools upper division spring concert this time around karen an eighth grader at nightingale bamford a private girls school here wants to play a song by the beatles or the beach boys the music teacher wants her to choose a song that however inexpertly played will be immediately recognizable to the audience i want it to be a short song the shorter the better still fresh in my mind you see is that winter concert billed as a minute affair it went way into overtime featuring as it did string trios and orchestras choruses and guitar ensembles and a gospel choir to say nothing of the cello viola and violin stylings of the sixth grade a group of students armed with handbells a pseudo instrument beloved of talent challenged miss america contestants rang out largo from the winter portion of vivaldis "the four seasons " all around me fellow parents were tapping their feet with impatience or tapping their blackberries and murmuring into cellphones younger siblings of the performers meanwhile played video games and futilely asked when it would be over i waited waited for my daughter to perform hers as always was one of the last numbers she as always was obscured by three taller classmates when finally i was beating my way to the exit i heard one shell shocked mother hiss to her daughter "if you ever play the handbells we are out of here " as "pride and prejudice"s mr bennett said by way of ending his daughter marys wretched turn at the pianoforte "you have delighted us long enough " i dont wish to sound like an indifferent or uninvolved parent my resume includes a two year stint as class parent and many contributions to bake sales but what with my childrens various concerts the speech contest and the academic bowl famous womens day parents in action meetings and parents visiting morning the class cocktail party come to think of it i could use a drink the book fair and the fourth grade dance concert the fifth grade poetry recitation the sixth grade musical the seventh grade gilbert &amp sullivan production and the eighth grade shakespeare play the middle school talent show the daisy ceremony and the rose ceremony dont ask im at school more now than when i was in school as a fellow nightingale bamford parent recently growled "i didnt know that nightingale meant i had to be here every night " when my children were in pre school even kindergarten and first grade i was still in the first glorious blush of motherhood thus when parents were invited to witness movement class with miss elizabeth or singing class with miss nancy i was there in the front row so what if my son matthew couldnt skip to his lou so what if karens singing had only one thing to recommend it near inaudibility the kids were thrilled to be in the spotlight and thrilled that their parents were there to watch them bathe in its glow but you can lose your virginity only once ok maybe three times there came a day when i could barely stand to look at the listings in the school calendar talk about performance anxiety one could argue that kids arent the only ones performing the school events we attend are as much as anything public displays of parental involvement we go therefore we are for so called helicopter mothers and fathers who constantly hover "such events are a landing pad " notes arlene kagle a manhattan psychologist other parents "go to these events to recall their own fifth grade glory or to bask in their kids moment " says janet chan editor of parenting magazine and when the glow fades not thinking the administration would embrace my idea of nothing but one man shows i began considering the strategies adopted by other parents these include dividing up the chores so that mommy goes to the winter concert daddy goes to the spring concert or they both show up but only for juniors particular song the problem with that last ploy necessitating queries like "so honey are the grades going to perform in chronological order this year " is that it really does show your hand my children suspicious of dear old mommy ever since they caught me years ago furtively squirting iron drops into their apple juice stoutly claim ignorance or offer deliberate misinformation further karen will ask questions to test my attentiveness and attendance to wit "what did you think about the way the fifth graders made their entrance " i like to believe that administrators feel parents pain mindful that last years awards ceremony ran almost as long as a wagner opera the head of one school clipped her remarks to little more than "welcome" and cut the chorales two song contribution "and now the music teacher isnt speaking to me " she said ruefully "this is very sensitive turf " noted joan lonergan the head of the castilleja school a private girls academy in palo alto calif "we are trying to make the performances we have more significant and less frequent i think parents appreciate that " parents who view themselves as a captive audience may appreciate the perspective furnished by ms lonergan in her first years at castilleja she calculates that she saw productions of "a midsummer nights dream " there was an interpretation based on "gilligans island" and a version inspired by "the jetsons " "there were many years i really enjoyed it " ms lonergan said gamely "but im really delighted the girls have expanded their repertoire " when my children go off to college ill undoubtedly be overcome by nostalgia i know that depending on the season ill be longing to hear the guitar ensembles version of "santa baby" or "hes got the whole world in his hands " i may even crack open the dvd of the sixth grade production of "the wizard of oz" circa im not quite there yet ms kaufman writes about culture and the arts for the journal
