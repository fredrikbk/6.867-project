the afternoon report hirings higher ground online edition federal reserve policy makers have been puzzling over the "apparent tension" between weak growth and strong employment data and the newest jobs figures ensure that policy makers will soon be taking up the subject once again employers added jobs to nonfarm payrolls during may better by far than the meager increase of jobs logged during april and ahead of the average monthly gain of seen so far this year to be certain many of the sectors that were responsible for the economys anemic growth in the first quarter remained sticky spots in the jobs report manufacturers and retailers continued to cut workers loose and construction hiring flattened out as builders continued to tighten up their production schedules in the face of a housing glut many economists expect construction employment will keep weakening this year that means that the services sector is carrying the job market as business and professional services employment increased by jobs and hiring in education and health services surged by even with that unevenness economists thought that the data as a whole was fairly encouraging "reports of the job machines demise have been premature " said joshua shapiro of mfr inc but hiring is by no means surging and many economists think that the trend is all southward as the housing market keeps unraveling and corporate earnings growth gears down others wonder whether workers are falling behind to such an extent that it would take a bite of consumer spending which is the very lifes blood of growth "wages are again falling behind inflation so workers will not be able to sustain consumption growth without going deeper into debt " worries dean baker the co director of the center for economic and policy research in washington but others seem more optimistic the commerce department said in a separate report today that consumer spending increased by and many economists said that sets the table for a strong rebound in economic growth for the second quarter "the consumer continues to face stiff headwinds from sharply higher gasoline prices and downward pressure on housing prices and this may lead to brief setbacks " said brian bethune of global insight "but right now the expansion has good legs and we expect moderate growth " there could be other reasons to think that the economy is beginning to turn the corner the institute for supply management said this morning that its index of manufacturing business for may strengthened to the highest reading in a year a welcome report for the downtrodden sector stephen stanley chief economist at rbs greenwich capital thinks the manufacturing sector is an "obvious" candidate for a hiring recovery and that employment will gain speed as the year wears on should that come to pass it could present a challenge for the inflation wary federal reserve as things stand its steady as she goes for the central bank average hourly earnings increased only during may in what economists said was evidence that the labor market wasnt doing much to aggravate inflation and the commerce department said core inflation edged back to year over year during april which is at the top edge of but also within policy makers comfort zone thus the fed is unlikely to shift the federal funds rate from its current at its meeting in june but if the stronger signals from todays numbers are borne out it could "present the fed with a more difficult inflation outlook " in the words of mr stanley jobs report gives stocks a lift the dow jones
