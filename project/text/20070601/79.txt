politics &amp economics bush alters climate dynamics policy change may spur china india to greater environmental roles washington president bush removed a major impediment to joint efforts against global warming with his call for economic powers to reduce their greenhouse gas output the policy shift also increases the likelihood of new international regulatory limits on businesses and consumers the white house vision of a system that relies on flexibility to reach long term goals still would leave considerable room for participants to jockey over rules and interpret results nonetheless yesterdays announcement effectively removes the u s as the last doubter among big developed nations on the need for cooperative reductions the presidents proposal aims to draw in emerging giants such as china and india which were exempted from making emissions cuts under the landmark kyoto protocol while giving the u s more influence over the framework mr bush had rejected the kyoto accord and distanced the u s from efforts to negotiate a follow on agreement after its expiration with climate change rising to the top of the international agenda he articulated a markedly different stance yesterday "the united states takes this issue seriously " mr bush said in a speech here on international development mr bushs change of course comes amid growing criticism at home and abroad that the u s the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases isnt doing enough to address climate change and its accompanying risks an increasing number of republicans and business leaders have joined democrats to call for more action on the issue especially since democrats took control of congress in the elections international criticism was expected to reach a crescendo at next weeks annual meeting of the group of eight leading nations in germany even after yesterdays announcement critics chastised the president over the proposals lack of detail and its slow timetable for action under the plan the u s would convene a series of meetings starting this fall among the countries that emit the most greenhouse gases the ultimate aim would be to set a global emissions reduction goal by the end of participants would work to achieve the long term goal "by establishing their own ambitious midterm national targets and programs based on national circumstances " the white house said even german chancellor angela merkel whose government has battled the u s in recent days over its resistance to her proposal for stringent new emissions limits offered muted praise for the presidents move "this is common ground on which one can act " she told reporters bush administration officials yesterday said they still arent embracing the idea of a single global mandatory emissions cap by opening the door to long term reduction goals the u s appeared to make the eventual adoption of hard targets more likely the united nations is overseeing efforts to hammer out a post kyoto agreement and the administration said "we expect the new framework proposed by the president to complement ongoing u n activity " a dual track approach could also increase the u s s leverage in drafting an emissions reduction deal by trimming the number of countries involved to from more than any agreement produced by u s sponsored talks would likely resemble a patchwork of national and regional mandatory caps that mr bush is thought to favor china which is expected to surpass the u s as the top emitter of greenhouses gases this year said it plans to release a long awaited strategic plan on the issue next week that is expected to include voluntary measures to reduce emissions among the possibilities are stepping up recycling and planting millions of trees to increase forestry coverage beijing has said it doesnt need caps but can limit emissions growth by setting targets to increase energy efficiency targets it has missed despite some progress chinese officials say the blame for global warming lies with developed nations and complain that it is unfair to restrain chinas economic development with mandatory cuts in emissions because it is a relatively poor nation a major source of emissions are the thousands of coal burning power plants that produce the electricity underpinning chinas growth into an export powerhouse mr bushs announcement doesnt so much represent a revolutionary change in his approach but an evolution of thought when he was running for president in he spoke favorably of placing limits on some forms of industrial carbon emissions he rejected that approach after taking office instead the administration set a domestic goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions as measured against the size of the economy so emissions could continue to increase as long as the economy expanded faster and became more energy efficient a combination of factors appeared to draw mr bush back to the idea of imposing absolute emissions limits european allies have been strong advocates of curbs democrats took over congress in the elections and along with a concerned public added to the pressure then the u s supreme court rejected the administrations position that the environmental protection agency lacked the authority to regulate greenhouse gases as a pollutant that led mr bush to take a series of executive actions aimed at reducing emissions congressional democrats who for years have accused the white house of inaction on global warming werent impressed with mr bushs initiative rep ed markey of massachusetts chairman of a special house committee on climate change described yesterdays announcement as "re warming " senate majority leader harry reid of nevada said "we hope todays announcement is the beginning of a reversal of the administrations untenable and unwise position on global warming and not a public relations stunt to defuse criticism going into the g discussions in germany " some environmentalists also criticized the plan calling it a halfhearted effort designed to run out the clock a senior white house official rejected such charges he said mr bush announced the new approach "because were ready now we have a sense of whats feasible and not feasible " but he conceded that pulling off such a complex negotiation in the months left in mr bushs term "will be herculean " analysts in the emerging market for greenhouse gas emissions credits meanwhile said the move shows the u s has finally bought into the idea of global limits which are needed to generate demand for so called carbon credits guy turner director of new carbon finance a london research firm said mr bushs announcement could set the stage for a global deal based on regional and national caps with interconnected trading "the u s is the key that unlocks india and china which refuse to do anything until the u s does something it starts to break the deadlock " rebecca blumenstein and shai oster in beijing contributed to this article
