justice for lebanon russia and china refused to endorse wednesdays security council vote to establish an international tribunal for the february assassination of rafik hariri lebanons former prime minister the tribunal they argued was an illegitimate form of outside interference in the countrys domestic affairs as for syrias role in mr hariris murder the very reason the tribunal was needed in the first place thats a form of meddling our friends in moscow and beijing apparently prefer not to notice the good news is that these two veto wielding powers abstained from the vote which means the tribunal will be established by international fiat by june if the lebanese parliament fails to do it before then in beirut this brought dancing in the streets mr hariris son saad called the resolution a "victory the world has given to oppressed lebanon and a victory for an oppressed lebanon in the world " by contrast syria denounced the u n vote as a "degradation of lebanons sovereignty " which considering the source is almost amusing iranian proxy hezbollah was equally dismayed it has spent the last six months attempting to block the tribunal by calling mass demonstrations and trying to bring down the democratic government of prime minister fuad siniora for hezbollah especially the resolution marks a major political defeat and therefore a strategic victory for anyone who cares about lebanons future as a sovereign democracy nobody should be under any illusions that the road forward for the tribunal will be easy the syrians have consistently tried to derail the u n investigation leading to the tribunal syrian foreign minister walid al moallem who recently met with condoleezza rice in egypt was secretly taped threatening rafik hariri just weeks before his death he then lied about it to u n investigator detlev mehlis a useful reminder of the value of trying to negotiate anything with the regime of bashar assad damascus almost certainly had a hand in the assassinations of anti syrian lebanese politicians gibran tueni in and pierre gemayal in more recently the pan arab newspaper al hayat has reported that the leadership of fatah al islam an al qaeda affiliated group in lebanon consists entirely of syrian officers the lebanese army has been fighting a pitched battle with the group for the past two weeks in the palestinian refugee camp of nahr al bared this despite the fact that the new yorkers seymour hersh reported that the lebanese government with the connivance of saudi arabia and the bush administration was actually behind the group see michael youngs dispatch nearby as in iraq the syrian game in lebanon is to foment chaos and then offer itself as the solution the gambit has plainly impressed at least some people wang guangya the chinese ambassador to the u n argued that the tribunal would "add to the uncertainties embodied in the already turbulent political and security situation in lebanon " comments like that will surely embolden the syrians to sow more chaos in lebanon to show that the price of justice in the service of a fallen leader will be prohibitively high but whatever happens next passage of the resolution has shown the syrians and their lebanese friends that they cannot assassinate political enemies without paying a price of their own as u s ambassador zalmay khalilzad put it wednesday to the security council "there can be no peace without justice " weve heard that slogan before in the case of lebanon at least it happens to be true
