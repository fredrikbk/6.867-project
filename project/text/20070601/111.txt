weekend journal review television a long way from degradation in the summer of in a remote village in pakistan year old mukhtaran mai endured gang rape an "honor" punishment sanctioned by her villages tribal council a retribution by no means unusual in her society this one the subject of the remarkable showtime documentary "shame " airing wednesday to p m edt was meted out in punishment for crimes allegedly committed by her brother this victims response to degradation failed to follow the usual path like many women so dishonored mukhtaran mai tried to commit suicide by drinking acid an exercise that not only failed to kill her but filled her instead with a life giving fury early in the film she is shown heavily veiled but as the narrative proceeds as she succeeds in finding a measure of justice and becomes along the way world renowned for her struggle that veil is removed to reveal a woman of delicate beauty and one by no means abashed by lack of experience as she moves among the powerful and influential this rich and surprising work directed by mohammed ali naqvi tracks mukhtaran mais single minded effort to assure that what happened to her would not be forgotten that it be forgotten and covered over is as the film amply documents precisely the dearest wish not only of the rapists and their supportive community but also of her family still perhaps no participants in this drama were as loath to see news of the affair travel around the world than the government of pakistan though it had once the story spread in the media acknowledged the crime and paid mukhtaran mai reparations the chronicle of her endurance and improbable triumph would have been story enough but this modest film with its scarcely legible subtitles is also a captivating study in political embarrassment even as she prepared to go abroad to address her first conference on "honor" punishments mukhtaran mai discovered herself under house arrest the government busied itself with denials that this was the case president musharraf himself allows on camera that yes there was at first some hesitation about this trip that might have sullied pakistans reputation in one of the most memorable of the films scenes a female government minister rattles on to the press about how this house arrest business was all a huge misunderstanding and that there was absolutely nothing to the story even as this authority speaks and a wonderfully imposing sight she is mukhtaran mai can be heard telling the journalists how guards had kept her from leaving her apartment for days the government representative hastily declares the press conference over all too late that resolute voice contradicting her can still be heard its owner has come a very long way from degradation and tribal councils the second in a series of films described as "personal documentaries" arrives on hbo sunday p m to midnight edt an effort undertaken apparently to satisfy such hunger as viewers might have to learn about the life and philosophy of adrian grenier star of "entourage " the sort of exploration that might once have been reserved for a life and career somewhat more advanced mr greniers "a shot in the dark" is unsurprisingly limited to that central theme of our times relationships the film is presented as mr greniers search for reconnection with his father john who lit off from new york city to his home turf in ohio after the boys birth mr greniers mother karesse a chronic free spirit whose own lifes philosophy comes as she explains from the teachings of the s and s had made it plain she had no intention of marrying the father baby or no baby she had her reasons we suspect as we come to see more of john a decidedly vague if soulful sort this is one of the very few things clear about mr greniers picture of his relatives about his mother the central figure in his life who raised him lovingly we learn only that she was as she proudly notes the product of a matriarchy by way of illustration were shown a photograph of a couple of darkly clad women staring balefully into the camera but who these women are where they came from is anybodys guess none of this is altogether surprising since it is by this point clear that the films interest in facts is minimal about attitudes and relationships we can learn plenty mainly from karesse who was she notes part of the generation that had absorbed life lessons from spiritual masters like timothy leary mr grenier appears to be having a good time throughout just as he has had he says all his life even without a father on hand this is not hard to believe there is at least one endearing aspect in this meanderingly self absorbed work and that is mr greniers obvious inability to pretend that reconnection with his father is a matter of profound emotional concern to him he doesnt even try when it comes to the kind of hard eyed evaluation that could determine whether a film is in fact worth a place on its schedule neither apparently does hbo a few weeks before the grenier film the network aired alan berliners personal documentary "wide awake" which can be seen again june midnight to a m appropriately enough on the subject of mr berliners lifelong insomnia it is a film infinitely more incisive and intelligent than the one devoted to mr greniers search though it can be said at least that mr grenier is less obsessed than mr berliner at keeping himself in the cameras eye a focus not altogether wise given his overall built for whining look and depressing demeanor documentary or not there are times when its just the better part of valor to keep your pajama top on once in a while even so mr berliners "wide awake" covers considerable intriguing ground with a briskness sufficient to offset the sad sack spirit central to this saga and its haunting question namely why has the filmmaker had to live most of his life deprived of a decent nights sleep and why have all of his efforts to find relief failed mr berliners catalog of doomed efforts can be charming not least when it comes to the finer points of sheep counting or if one chooses lion counting along the way here we get a compelling family picture thanks to mr berliners sharp tongued mother his only slightly more indulgent sister his supremely tired and pregnant wife all of whom have obviously heard more than they care to about his sleep related problems for as long as they can remember its a film with the makings of a terrific family sitcom though not the kind that will ever make it to a network schedule
