weekend journal tastings the rising fortunes of rose we see if it tastes as good as it looks setting standards we arrived home the other day to find our daughter zoe a talented photographer taking pictures of some wine bottles that we had taken out of shipping crates earlier this surprised us many years ago our daughters got tired of mommy and daddy endlessly discussing wine and have done their best to ignore our passion ever since were sure that out of spite they are going to grow up to be beer drinkers what possessed zoe the wines were roses and lined up on the table they were as pretty as the colors of the sunrise from light pink to blazing orange as it happens the sun is rising on rose weve been saying since that americans finally seemed ready to put aside their unpleasant memories of mateus lancers and sweet white zinfandel and give well made dry rose a chance we said two years ago that the floodgates of rose were beginning to open well whooooosh theyre wide open now good wine stores throughout the u s now prominently display a wealth of roses from all over the world especially as the weather warms france is the classic home of dry rose of course many people recall their first good rose from tavel or provence with special affection spain has been producing some outstanding roses in the past few years at bargain prices and weve found that american wineries have come a long way with them over just the past few years so with so many roses on shelves now we decided it was time for a world wide taste off just how well is the rose picture developing we bought roses from the and vintages from around the world from argentina to switzerland some were made with classic rose grapes like grenache while others were more surprising one wine from australia for instance was made partly from dolcetto which is best known for making a delightful red wine in italy we bought our sample from stores in five states and easily could have bought more quite a change from just a few years ago in we had trouble finding enough roses for a broad blind tasting merchants said there was little demand for them rose is created by leaving the juice in contact with the dark skins of the grape for a brief time some roses can be quite light in color while others can be almost red what makes a rose work in the long run is ripe fruit with plenty of balancing acids while we generally prefer dry roses they can certainly succeed with some sweetness if the acidity is good enough to us successful roses have the best qualities of red and white wines a bit of the steely intensity and freshness of a white with some of the depth and weight of a red these wines should be long on charm with the kind of lively clean finish that calls out for food and another sip because we find well made rose such a delight we looked forward to this tasting in which we included a broad geographic sweep in each flight with great anticipation and man were we in for a letdown its clear that because rose is the trend of the moment wineries all over the world are rushing out pinks without a great deal of thought or care the majority of wines we tasted were simply ok they lacked intense fruit and a vision of what makes a rose unique they were often sweet and sometimes incredibly oaky some tasted lab made far too many simply tasted to use one of those awful wine geek words blah to be sure there were some excellent roses spain once again showed well with bodegas muga a longtime favorite thats always a good deal at about &# and we were once again charmed by toad hollow from california half of our favorites came from france including our best of tasting chateau de segries a tavel made from grenache cinsault clairette and syrah the winery made about cases were imported and distributed to states we fear that americans who are now willing to dip their tongues back into rose may once again be turned off if they taste undistinguished wines so wed urge caution studying our favorites we did find some clues that might help you shift the odds in your favor first stick with or even when those roses start arriving soon from the southern hemisphere second france really does continue to set the standard and is a good default choice third interestingly all three of our u s favorites were made from pinot noir and wed remember that when choosing an american pink fourth it turned out that five of our eight favorites had been among our favorites in the past an usually high number in a tasting to us this is an indication that its a good idea to stick with wineries that have been doing this with some distinction for a while wineries for whom blush wines are a passion not a passing fancy or cash cow fifth while a third of our sample cost less than &# none of our favorites did although price alone is no guarantee we tasted the vintage of the popular domaines ott "chateau de selle" cotes de provence which costs around &# in two flights and it was dull in both finally the most important piece of advice wed give is this if you taste a rose that isnt affirmatively charming and doesnt aggressively make the case to your palate that blush wines deserve a place in your life dont give up on them try another there are many good ones out there and during the summer a good rose wine really is a very special accompaniment to light meals and sunny days you can contact us at
