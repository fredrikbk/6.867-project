politics &amp economics white house expects summer of veto fights budget chief says four bills on spending unlikely to get past bush without changes washington as congress returns from its memorial day recess the white house faces a long summer of veto fights as it tries to rein in democratic backed spending and force what could be a larger budget deal in the fall white house budget director rob portman suggested that four spending bills expected to be approved by the house appropriations committee next week could be vetoed unless substantial changes are made in a related effort to keep spending in check mr portman told federal agencies to keep tabs on and report to him on "earmarks" special interest spending provisions added to bills being drafted by congress he also didnt rule out a veto of child health insurance legislation if new tax provisions are included to pay for additional spending on the popular program mr portman a former ohio republican congressman is well respected by democrats but finds himself playing hardball against his former colleagues this is for two reasons first the budget gap is so big more that &# billion between congresss demands and mr bushs requests second the administration admits it is still learning how to cope with democrats on capitol hill after six years of having fellow republicans largely in charge last weeks agreement between the white house and congress on an iraq war spending bill came only after mr bush vetoed one version and negotiations with democrats were elevated to the highest level by using vetoes to slow democratic bills this summer the administration may be trying to recreate this template for resolving differences in the fall "im not saying this will be easy it never is " mr portman said "we will have our battles and we will work them through " the directors comments came at a press briefing where he predicted the federal government will end this fiscal year with a smaller deficit "closer to &# billion" than the &# billion estimate he gave in february but revenue growth is slowing after two years of double digit increases and he said this is a reminder of the need to also contain spending growth "theres no magic to it " mr portman said "keep your expenses down and let your economy continue to grow so you have higher revenues every year " as part of the iraq war funding compromise the white house agreed to accept nearly &# billion more in spending than it had initially requested for the remainder of this fiscal year about &# billion fell into the category of nonsecurity domestic spending but this concession has done little so far to lessen the appetite in congress for more in having agreed to a budget blueprint the new democratic majority next week turns to enacting the annual appropriations bills needed to fund government operations for the new fiscal year that begins oct but congress has set the top line target for discretionary spending at more than &# billion about &# billion above mr bushs requests the first four house bills covering homeland security veterans health care natural resources and the environment and energy and water projects all reflect this the smallest increase is &# billion above mr bushs budget the biggest for veterans and military construction projects adds &# billion "id rather not " mr portman said when asked if he would recommend that mr bush veto a veterans bill in the middle of a war but he argued that the extra &# billion added in the iraq package last week for veterans health care should strengthen the administrations hand "our current position is all the stronger because there is additional money " he said on the war itself the administration has asked for &# billion in additional spending to help finance operations in iraq and afghanistan after oct mr portman said adjustments will be made to that request before lawmakers turn to it in september but he refused to say if more money will be needed since the initial request didnt include funding for the higher troop levels this spring and summer "i would venture to say nobody knows " mr portman said
