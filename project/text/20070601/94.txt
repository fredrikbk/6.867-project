the daily fix epic performance by lebron james puts cavs on brink of nba finals online edition it all seems so long ago the pass the foul not called the identical losing scores last night the cleveland cavaliers beat the detroit pistons in a double overtime thriller that gave them a series lead in the nbas eastern conference finals and nobody but nobody had any reservations about the performance of the cavs lebron james points including an amazing of his teams final "if you missed this one last night you did yourself an epic disservice " writes chris sheridan on espn com "go find someone who tivod or videotaped it fast forward to midpoint of the fourth quarter then sit back and prepare to be awestruck this performance was one thatll be talked about for ages a testament to greatness thatll rank right up there with reggie millers points in seconds michael jordans point coming out party in the boston garden or his flu game in utah magic johnsons point outburst while playing center in game of the finals " the akron beacon journals brian windhorst moonlighting for espn com explains how that point explosion didnt come out of nowhere looking at key games in mr jamess development as a player "so many gyms layers of challenges and moments of failure led james to the mindset he took into the fourth quarter " mr windhorst writes adding that "perhaps there has never been a basketball player more watched poked and analyzed by the age of than james his talent and ability to carry his various teams has provided so many opportunities for smashing success or crushing failure he has taken all of them in his own personal stride he almost never admits to making a mistake he usually downplays the significance of losses by saying hes not disappointed and he never seems to give himself an ultimatum yet theres no doubt he is learning and growing from each momentous experience " in detroit the free press duo of drew sharp and mitch albom can only gawk in amazement "my eyes have now seen " mr sharp writes "i am officially a witness the pistons find themselves in a similar situation as last year against cleveland but the problem is that theres nothing similar about this cleveland the king is ready to assume the throne " "in the end it was a night that begged a simple question who would stand up to win the thing " mr albom writes "you knew it would be one man but one against five normally thats a no brainer but lebron james is not normal and at he is likely on his way to an nba finals to prove it " no billy donovan is not jumping from the florida gators sidelines to kentucky hes heading for orlando orlando mr donovan will be introduced today as the new coach of the orlando magic recipient of a five year &# million deal while the fix is on the subject of coaches the memphis grizzlies hired phoenix suns assistant mark iavaroni and the indiana pacers tapped former boston celtics and philadelphia ers coach jim obrien in the ocala star banner dwight collins passes up the usual rain of fire and brimstone on a departing college coach "it would be incredibly selfish for anyone not to wish him the best of luck as he continues his coaching career with the orlando magic " he writes "florida fans thank this man for the star studded recruiting hauls the two national championships and for helping make the oconnell center a true house of horrors for visitors for keeping the gators along the front of the national sporting landscape donovan at kentucky that would have hurt seeing him work his magic at a rival sec east school would have forced donovan to assume the villains role and would have tarnished his exit from gainesville forever " in the miami herald israel gutierrez says the nba will be scarifying for mr donovan writing that the jump "comes with a feeling of inevitable failure the only hope being that the gigantic bags of money thrown at the coach somehow soften the blow it would seem unfair to make that deduction before the ink on his new contract is even dry donovan after all is a two time national champion who reached three ncaa title games in seven years which none of the previous coaches who attempted the switch can claim unfortunately for billy the kid its not unfair at all because its true " "the american men are gone from the french open disappeared in the torturous red dust after just the first round " writes sally jenkins in the washington post "its no great mystery why the current crop of yanks couldnt survive at roland garros the answer is that if you want to win on clay youve got to live on it " thats the start of an interesting examination of not just a surface but also a tournament mr jenkins calls the french open "at once the most romantic and beautiful tennis tournament in world and also the most ugly and revealing its also the noisiest what with all the screams of exertion and the schlsssssss of the sneakers in the brick dust and the players flopping on the ground in exhaustion or euphoria theres no peacocking or strutting on those courts its all the players can do to stand at the side of the court cramming bananas in their mouths on changeovers afraid to sit down for fear of cramping up it makes them press and work harder than theyve ever worked and pull from deep inside themselves " alex rodriguez just cant seem to stay out of trouble and the fix isnt even going to mention joslyn noel morse on wednesday night with the new york yankees up with two outs in the ninth a rod was on second when jorge posada popped a ball up passing behind toronto blue jays rookie third baseman howie clark a rod yelled something he claimed it was "hah " but the blue jays said it was "mine " mr clark thought he was being called off by his shortstop he backed off the ball fell in and the controversy was on had a rod broken baseballs unwritten code of conduct the associated presss ronald blum gathers opinions from those who say the play was legit barry bonds ozzie guillen tommy lasorda and those who say it was bush league eric wedge omar vizquel richie sexson in the new york times john branch writes that "the only certainty is that the play further blurred the line between what is fair or foul in the unwritten code of baseball and solidified rodriguezs reputation as a player willing to test boundaries " thats the beginning of an interesting exploration of whats allowable and what isnt and why the fixers take were not ballplayers so in matters of "the code" all we can do is look at the reaction of actual ballplayers all of the blue jays seemed to be livid and the yankees offered at best tepid defenses of their teammate couple that with a rods history of cheap plays the oft mocked slap play on bostons bronson arroyo and an elbow thrown on bostons dustin pedroia a couple of weeks back and the fix finds a rod guilty but guilty of a misdemeanor to be addressed by a rods opponents after that hard slide bostons mr pedroia said that "i know now when hes coming in my arm slot gets dropped to the floor " the blue jays visit yankee stadium on july the forecast sunny with a chance of a wayward fastball looking back at draft day david roth realized he loves his fantasy baseball team a little too much "in basements that smell like pizza and dudes in conference rooms on the company clock or in notional java applet powered online draft rooms we fantasy baseball gms build the teams over which we will obsess for the next six months " he writes on slate "and i have no problem with that the strange part i have come to realize is that the baseball team i care about the most this summer will be my fantasy squad " tip of the fix cap to reader john falck found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at
