bancrofts open door to a sale of dow jones controlling family says it will meet murdoch shares soar after hours dow jones &amp co s year history as an independent media company could be nearing an end the bancroft family which controls of the companys voting power said in a statement late yesterday that it would meet with rupert murdochs news corp to discuss its &# billion bid for dow jones publisher of the wall street journal the family also said it would consider other bidders and options for the company in a statement after a meeting of dow joness board michael b elefante a dow jones director and representative of the bancroft family told directors "after a detailed review of the business of dow jones and the evolving competitive environment in which it operates the family has reached consensus that the mission of dow jones may be better accomplished in combination or collaboration with another organization which may include news corp " the move coming a month after mr murdochs offer was publicly disclosed opens the door to him as well as other possible suitors though the bancrofts maintained the option not to sell their new willingness to entertain a deal makes one far more likely indeed investors pushed dow jones stock up in after hours trading suggesting they believe a deal is imminent possibly at a price higher than the &# a share offer from news corp dow jones stock which had risen cents to &# in p m trading on the new york stock exchange later surged &# a share to &# the bancroft family will meet news corp and mr murdoch its chairman and ceo "to determine whether in the context of the current or any modified news corp proposal it will be possible to ensure the level of commitment to editorial independence integrity and journalistic freedom that is the hallmark of dow jones " according to mr elefante he said the family also was receptive "to other options that might achieve the same overarching objectives " a representative of the companys board will be present at those discussions that paves the way for dow jones directors to play a more active role in shaping the future of the company and to determine which bidder if any the company would sell to yesterday dow jones said its board which previously has not taken a position on news corp s bid "has determined to consider strategic alternatives available to the company including the news corp proposal " a news corp spokesman said "were grateful to the bancroft family for agreeing to our suggestion of a meeting and we look forward to it " with a majority of voting shares opposing a deal the bancrofts had been at a standoff with mr murdoch since his offer became public a month ago family members also had rejected mr murdochs offer to discuss the bid which represented a premium to dow joness stock price before the offer became public but over the past several weeks the roughly three dozen adult members of the bancroft family have been in frequent contact to discuss possible alternatives some family members have become convinced that "the status quo" is no longer an option for dow jones according to people familiar with their thinking the question of whether dow jones whose market capitalization has jumped to more than &# billion since mr murdochs bid has enough scale to compete globally is fueled by recent upheaval in the news and financial information industries including the migration of news online and a broad decline in advertising and circulation in the newspaper industry besides the journal dow joness properties include dow jones newswires online news site marketwatch barrons and factiva an aggregator of news and information a particular concern is the planned &# billion merger of reuters group plc and thomson corp which surfaced just days after mr murdochs offer for dow jones became public that deal is expected to add competitive pressure on dow jones newswires dow jones executives have pressed the difficulties of remaining independent in discussions with members of the bancroft family according to people familiar with the matter by publicly declaring their willingness to do a deal the family hopes to convey to potentially interested parties that they are willing to consider offers besides mr murdochs no other bidders have surfaced publicly since the news corp bid was revealed some investment bankers say potential bidders were getting signals that the bancrofts wouldnt sell the company to any party or that they wouldnt entertain bids less than the hefty &# a share that mr murdoch has offered the family said in its statement that it wanted to protect the editorial independence of the journal and the strength of dow joness other divisions the family also said it isnt committing to a negotiation with mr murdoch still some members of the family were confused about the implications of the statement not quite realizing that they were effectively saying they were willing to explore a sale according to people close to the board as they were discussing the meaning of the statement at the board meeting there was some debate about having it rephrased or even withdrawn but just then the wall street journal posted a draft of the statement online that ended the discussion these people said mr murdoch has repeatedly tried to assuage concerns including some expressed by members of the family that he would curb the journals editorial independence in a may letter to the bancroft family mr murdoch said that he was "first and foremost a newspaper man" and doesnt "apologize for the fact that i have always had strong opinions and strong ideas about newspapers but i have also always respected the independence and integrity of the news organizations with which i am associated " mr murdoch also said he would provide added resources for dow jones and was committed to beefing up the journals european and asian operations and its washington bureau he indicated that he hoped the dow jones brand would help him promote a new fox news business channel he offered to establish "an independent autonomous editorial board" and appoint a member of the bancroft family to the news corp board mr murdoch has shown a willingness to hold onto money losing operations if they give him prestige or help him leverage his other businesses at the same time he has defended himself against critics who have said his media operations have pulled punches in china to help him gain government support for his businesses there in an interview wednesday at the "d all things digital conference" in carlsbad calif news corp president peter chernin said the "notion that we would somehow want to buy the journal to change it is counterintuitive " he added "we want to pay a premium because we believe it the journal is the premier source of news and information in this specific aspect of this society and we believe the value of that is immeasurable " the conference is sponsored by the wall street journal in his statement yesterday mr elefante said "there can be no assurance that the dialogue with news corporation or any other party will result in the negotiation or the desire of family members to pursue the negotiation and execution of any agreement " the statement said the bancrofts also stressed that the family members control the strings still the companys board now is likely to play a greater role generally a board is obligated to at least listen to an incoming offer but with the bancrofts in control the position of dow joness board until yesterday had been that it would take no action on the offer given the familys opposition after news corp s bid became public dow jones issued a statement saying it had been informed that votes representing of the voting power of the company had rejected the bid news corp has said its offer would be cash or cash and stock if the dow jones board decides to sell the company for cash instead of pursuing a strategic combination it may enter what is called "revlon mode" after a famous court decision which would essentially require the company if the bancrofts decide to sell to take the highest bid on the table but if an offer for dow jones is partly stock a company has more leeway delaware courts regard such deals as "strategic combinations" that may bring other matters into consideration that gives the board latitude to extract concessions for instance on the companys ongoing editorial independence some specialists say the dow jones board is not required legally to recommend the highest offer if its controlling shareholders oppose the idea "the law cant force the board to do something that is beyond their power " said lawrence hamermesh a professor of business and law at widener law school in wilmington del as a result he said any study by the dow jones board of the companys options would have to take into consideration that the range of options is limited by the familys preferences but common shareholders likely will exert pressure on the company to push for the highest possible offer "is a great strategic alternative at &# acceptable of course it is " said brian c rogers chairman and chief investment officer at t rowe price dow joness largest outside shareholder on wednesday "there are ways you can come up with a great plan b and there are some lousy ways " the premium offered by mr murdoch has served to fend off other publicly listed suitors which may have a hard time explaining the price to shareholders general electric co and pearson plc publisher of the financial times are considered possibilities previously ge chairman jeffrey immelt has said he wasnt interested while pearson has declined to comment privately held firms such as hearst corp and advance publications inc may be more willing to take the plunge though neither has expressed interest both companies declined to comment additionally some family members have discussed selling a minority stake in the company to an investor who might use that stake as part of a larger takeover in the future said people familiar with the matter there also is the possibility that the family and an outside party could team up to make an offer for the entire company with the family rolling over its stake and therefore reducing the final buyout price for a buyer with whom it felt more comfortable dow jones was founded by charles henry dow edward davis jones and charles milford bergstresser in and produced daily handwritten news bulletins called "flimsies" delivered by messenger to subscribers in the wall street area the bancroft family is descended from jessie waldron the wife of clarence barron who bought dow jones for &# in largely with his wifes money the couple passed their shares on to jessie waldrons two daughters eventually the shares were transferred to a set of trusts
