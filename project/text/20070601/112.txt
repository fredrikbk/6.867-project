weekend journal review theater coward in beantown present laughter huntington theatre company boston university theatre  huntington ave boston &# &# closes june no mans land american repertory theatre loeb drama center  brattle st cambridge mass &# &# closes june boston noel coward never wrote a funnier play than "present laughter " so why does everybody do "private lives" instead because "present laughter" requires a cast of an extremely fancy set and an actor of the highest possible candlepower to play the showy star part that coward wrote for himself only three other men have played garry essendine the authors alter ego on broadway frank langella george c scott and clifton webb now victor garber is trying his hand at the role in a new production directed by nicholas martin for the huntington theatre company and variety says it "could have a future commercial life depending on the availability of its star " that means broadway where few straight plays however great can hope to be revived without the added luster of a hollywood name mr garber an old broadway hand who spent the past five years playing opposite jennifer garner on abcs "alias " definitely fills the bill but can he also fill the size shoes of his predecessors im not so sure nor am i convinced that this generally fine production is altogether ready for prime time the best thing about any production of "present laughter" is of course the play itself a three act farce that purports to show us the backstage life of an aging but still glamorous matinee idol garry essendine resembles coward in every way but one which is that he usually prefers girls otherwise he is as coward acknowledged in later life a self portrait of the artist as monstre sacre and part of what makes "present laughter" so funny is that it is in the authors words "a potent mixture of self exposure and self celebration " rarely has a writer skewered himself so effectively as coward does here flanking essendine with a sharp tongued secretary sarah hudnut and a disillusioned ex wife lisa banes who are quick to stick pins into his swollen ego "everybody worships me its nauseating " "theres hell to pay if they dont " how to play this gaudy peacock mr garber has opted for impersonation and though i wish hed had the nerve to try something more individual he does a plausible job of suggesting cowards silky smooth voice kenneth tynan once described him as "cooing like a baritone dove" and clipped delivery alas mr garber looks more like an exasperated uncle than a matinee idol and for all the wit and precision of his performance he isnt quite sexy enough to be the garry essendine of anyones dreams it helps that mr garber is supported by some very fine actors ms banes for one couldnt be better and that alexander dodge the designer has let himself go conjuring up an art deco apartment worthy of mgm at its glitziest i especially liked the le corbusier chaise longue on which essendine throws several spectacular pouts as for the staging its brisk and broad a bit too blatant in spots but generally effective mr martin has however made one dreadful mistake which was to cast brooks ashmanskas as roland maule the painfully high minded novice playwright who falls for essendine and to either instruct or permit him to play maule as a simpering effeminate twit according to cowards stage directions maule is "an earnest young man with glasses" who is "obviously petrified with nerves but endeavoring to hide it by assuming an air of gruff defiance " thats what makes it incongruously funny when this sober sided youth develops a cow eyed crush on garry hes the last person in the world youd expect to succumb to his charm to be sure mr ashmanskas gets cheap laughs by camping it up to the hilt but theyre all at the expense of the play his performance is like a stink bomb rolled on stage and detonated midway through the first act if mr martin rethinks this show killing blunder and does some additional tinkering here and there i expect hell have a pretty fair shot at bringing "present laughter" to broadway id like to see that happen five years have gone by since a noel coward play last graced the great white way and this production for all its largely fixable flaws is more than solid enough to satisfy anyone longing for an evening of nonstop merriment cambridge mass across the river from boston the american repertory theatre is presenting the latest in a long and impressive series of harold pinter revivals directed by david wheeler "no mans land" has been seen twice on broadway first with john gielgud and ralph richardson and later with christopher plummer and jason robards and it is the highest possible tribute to max wright and paul benedict that their eloquent acting doesnt make you long to step into the wayback machine and set the controls for or mr pinter is a famously difficult playwright but in a production as strong as this one you dont worry about whether you understand what hes up to you just go along for the ride and ask questions later "no mans land" is definitely about two old writers one of whom is far more successful than the other beyond that nobody but mr pinter knows for sure whats going on and hes not telling is hirst mr benedict receding into the thick fog of senility is he the prisoner of the sexually ambiguous young toughs henry david clarke and lewis d wheeler who claim to be taking care of him and who is spooner mr wright the genteel poet tramp who comes home with hirst one night and awakes the next morning to find himself a prisoner as well mr pinter tells us only so much though he leaves us in no doubt that spooner and hirst are trapped in a land "which never moves which never changes which never grows older but which remains forever icy and silent " is that "land" the cold country of old age with death just beyond the horizon answer comes there none and it doesnt matter in the least mr pinter is a dramatic poet not a purveyor of well made plays whose mysteries solve themselves mr wheelers actors are content to give vibrant voice to his unsettlingly elliptical dialogue and leave the rest to us thats all it takes to cast the dark spell that is "no mans land " go and be haunted mr teachout the journals drama critic blogs about theater and the other arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout
