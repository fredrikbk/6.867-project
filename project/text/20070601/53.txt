latin lesson washington say what you will about george w bushs plans for immigration reform you cant accuse him of failing to understand what it is that inspires such emotion in this debate sitting among the optimistic yellows of the oval office the president is quick to zero in on what has caused so many in his party to reject his efforts "i think people worry that this round of immigration will create two americas " he says simply or in his further explanation "e pluribus duum " with that impromptu bit of engineered latin i get an answer to one big question i have at this wednesday morning interview mr bush has been pilloried by his own followers in recent weeks charged with everything from granting amnesty to million illegal immigrants to failing to secure the borders he stands accused of throwing over his most loyal supporters to join with ted kennedy and liberals to ruin america can it really be that this president who has previously identified so well with the everyman in his party is completely off the reservation on this issue the answer is no although mr bush is aware hell have to work hard to prove it in our minutes together he hardly comes across as blind to the fears and anger of his critics "i think that some of the signals that people have seen are very disturbing to very patriotic americans such as people flying mexican flags during immigration rallies " or "people here illegally straining the social services of different communities " or american towns wondering whether "the basic culture of their community is going to be affected negatively by people from basically a foreign land " he says yet he also points out that "this isnt the first time our country has had to wrestle with waves of immigration" noting italians irish jews hes enthusiastic in his belief that america still has the "great capacity" to continue to "assimilate" more cultures which makes the nation stronger most notably hes passionate that immigration is fundamentally a conservative cause embodying core republican values and the issue is vital to his partys political future "part of the reason why i think its important for me to be out speaking about it is it might cause people to say well wait a minute the president supports it let me find out why " explaining to conservatives why immigration reform is something they can and should believe in is his challenge in the coming weeks and mr bushs success or failure will help determine the fate of the massive immigration bill now wending its way through the senate some outraged republicans argue that giving million illegal immigrants any path to citizenship is "amnesty " others are opposed to a guest worker provision which they claim would allow temporary workers to steal u s jobs all have vowed that any republican legislator who signs up for this will face primary challenges and campaign fund cutoffs thats given many house republicans the jitters at least would be needed to pass a law president bush spends much of the conversation explaining why in theory those numbers shouldnt be impossible why conservatives of every stripe should see the value of immigration reform on the economic side mr bush points out that this is "a free market question absolutely " studies have shown that immigrants add some &# billion annually in net economic output meanwhile our unemployment rate is about we created an estimated new jobs in may the president notes that "most of the immigrants coming are doing jobs americans arent doing " "our economy thrives based on capital investment kind of an entrepreneurship good fiscal policy but also willing workers who do jobs that oftentimes americans simply do not want to do " what about security hawks who worry about waves of future illegals or terrorists the president says his increased border enforcement is showing "good progress in stopping people from coming " but he notes that just as important are programs that discourage people from coming here illegally that includes free trade such as nafta which creates "good jobs on the other side of the border " as well as a u s temporary guest program that allows workers to come legally for short periods of time and who are trackable mr bush even has a few words for cultural conservatives who have perhaps been most resistant to and most emotional over immigration reform he talks of a belief in opportunity which has defined conservatives for generations "america is a country whose soul is constantly renewed by people pursuing what has been labeled the american dream its an amazing country where people can come with nothing except for god given talent and a deep desire to improve their familys lives and succeed " he notes his time in texas and how many latinos he saw arrive whose offspring "rose to positions of prominence and became significant contributors to our society " he also gets rolling on his hallmark theme the compassion of americans a quality he believes should inspire them to look beyond the political fight to the harsher human realities of this mess "a system that has encouraged the evolution of an underground network that treats people like a commodity to be in many cases to be exploited is not right and its not american " he sits forward even gets a little well emotional "we are a country of law and we ought to uphold the law but the system in place now has created a whole group of people who are evasive of the law and therefore people suffer good decent people suffer whether they be people paying coyotes a large sum of money relative to their income in order to be stuffed in the bottom of an wheeler or guides that they pay that then drop them off in the deserts and wish them all the best or document forgers or innkeepers that exploit these poor people who are mostly looking just for a chance to feed their families " i point out that many americans recognize the economic and security benefits of immigration reform who are compassionate and believe in opportunity and yet who simply cant get their heads around a program that rewards law breakers "i dont like law breakers either but the problem is were addressing policy from essentially and before that failed to address the issue " he notes that "part of the reason why laws have been broken is because the federal government didnt do its job didnt enforce the border " which leads to a final pragmatic point millions of illegals are here like it or not even assuming a fence does its job what to do with those present its impossible to send them home yet doing nothing means they stay underground dont assimilate will the republican party which has long boasted itself the creator of practical solutions to real problems abdicate that responsibility here "in politics its easy to be against something and they leave the solution dangling out there " says mr bush "but the question really is the million people who have broken the law and what are you going to do with them and my answer to them is here is a solution " while talk of principles energizes the president he isnt averse to getting down to the nitty gritty politics the u s today is home to million hispanics and even if the country were to stop immigration cold that minoritys share of the electorate is still on track to increase its a whole lot of new voters who wont be afraid to punish politicians that are hostile to their hopes and dreams of getting ahead in this world "if youre viewed as anti in other words if people think that a party is against somebody or some group of people youll pay a political price for it " the president says "if youre viewed as anti civil rights in the past the party paid a price " he adds putting in a nutshell republicans continued lack of traction among black voters "if youre viewed as anti immigrant no matter how innocent our people may be or well meaning our people may be if you get labeled as a result of not being thoughtful and considerate and pragmatic not dealing with the problem it could cause serious long term political consequences " this is something on which the president can claim personal knowledge he was elected in with of the hispanic vote by as a result of his latino outreach efforts hed increased that share by percentage points had he not id be sitting well ok maybe i wouldnt across from john kerry the republican blow up over immigration reform after conversely took a toll only of hispanics voted for republicans last november down eight percentage points from the midterm many anti immigration gop candidates were defeated so i put the question to mr bush more bluntly can the gop win any elections in the future without real hispanic support mr bush is careful here perhaps mindful of offending his white republican base but still gets to the same place "look i won without of the hispanic vote but i got a significant hispanic vote and the hispanic vote is its cubans it is puerto ricans its mexican americans it is central americans i mean it will be a significant vote and i think it will let me just say it will be more likely the republicans will win if viewed as sympathetic to immigration with a plan that upholds the rule of law and enforces the border " he also admits that having this debate in the middle of a presidential election season hasnt exactly been helpful "first of all the general media loves combat political combat and immigration provides a convenient forum for combat theres a lot of emotions a lot of people express themselves in very strong ways that lend itself to good political theater so no doubt the campaign is going to provide an interesting opportunity for people to express themselves or exploit emotional issues whether it be immigration or the war " he pauses and then mischievously adds "im sorry we havent been able to throw social security in the mix too because ive got some strong views on that as well " when i ask if mr bush thinks any of the current gop candidates are proving to be leaders on immigration he again flips the issue around while still managing to sneak in one candidates name "i would rather refer you to those in the senate that are doing a standup job of course that would be jon kyl and lindsey graham and mel martinez i hate to name them because ill leave somebody out john mccain has been very strong in the senate ted kennedy " he goes on to praise mr kennedy noting that an "untold" story is just how many democrats are against this bill and that mr kennedys leadership will thus be necessary to get a bill through the senate he also hits hard again on those politicians who he believes are distorting this debate "this word amnesty is often used to create confusion and doubt and anger the definition of amnesty ought to be that you are allowed to become a citizen without paying any price whatsoever i strongly oppose that and most of the authors of this comprehensive bill oppose that " he says he adds that "if youre going to try to unwind immigration the immigration bill its not right for the country im not questioning anybodys patriotism of course but i feel strongly that if one were to kill this bill that there will be a consequence from voters coming down the road and more importantly a consequence for the country " as our time draws down i ask mr bush what he really thinks the chances are of this controversial bill becoming law given all those who would like to unwind it "im optimistic " he says with a smile thats another thing like him or not you could never accuse this president of failing to be write to kim wsj com
