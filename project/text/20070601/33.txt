etfs suffer as specialists wither away elite traders provide seed money for funds seeking alternatives the rapid disappearance of stock exchange trading floor "specialists" is starting to hurt the booming exchange traded fund business specialists are the elite traders who for many years have helped maintain orderly trading amid the chaos of the floor now they are a vanishing breed as electronic trading gains acceptance the new york stock exchange has seen its specialists decline more than since last year that is bad news for etfs which resemble mutual funds but trade on an exchange like a stock specialists have a unique role in bringing etfs to market unlike regular stocks which raise money through initial public offerings etfs historically have relied on specialists to provide "seed capital" to launch within the etf industry the lack of specialist seed funding is becoming one of the most talked about problems "it used to be if you have a good idea for an etf youd have specialists competing for your products " says morgan stanley etf analyst paul mazzilli "now youre begging for them" to help with seeding he says clashes with specialists related to this are starting to cause snafus for etf companies late last year macromarkets llc a firm co founded by robert shiller the famed yale economist and author of the book "irrational exuberance " ran into problems launching some new products among those was coordinating with specialists to help trade the new securities "weve had our challenges " and that was one says bob tull a managing director at macromarkets one irony is that as specialists abandon their old jobs some are going into the etf business instead competing directly with their old clients in january three senior partners working with macromarkets to launch its products quit bear stearns cos units like bear hunter structured products llc to launch their own etf business their start up m ventures llc plans to release its own etf line "the specialist business is being decimated thats why we got out of it " says dan mccabe current head of m and former chief executive of bear hunter as recently as two years ago etf providers say specialists could offer &# million of seed money to fund a new etf the seed capital is used to create a pile of shares typically to so that the etf can begin trading on the first day once an etf is trading it is the job of specialists and others to create or conversely redeem new shares as necessary now however new etfs frequently are launching with as little as &# million and the minimum number of shares required by exchanges for etfs to begin trading this can be risky a small launch can make it hard for new etfs to quickly attract the assets they will need to stay afloat the reason since new etfs dont have a historical performance record for would be investors to look at money managers and financial advisers like to see sizable upfront assets injected into the fund as a gauge of market confidence in new products etfs are at least partly a victim of their own success many specialists say a turning point came earlier this year when specialists realized that more than funds could end up being launched in about double last years launches the filings suggested etf sponsors were looking for more than &# billion in seed money from the handful of etf specialist firms that meant firms which are already struggling as electronic trading has squeezed profits from trades would have to spread their limited resources more thinly "when i was bringing products a few years ago id take them to five or six specialists and tell them what can you do for me " says jim ross of state street global advisors now it is etf firms "being interviewed by the specialists " he says "the landscape of the industry has changed dramatically in the past year" agrees stephen sachs of rydex investments four years ago the firm launched its rydex s&amp p equal weight fund with over &# million but last year nine rydex s&amp p equal weight etfs for niche markets like energy and technology launched with less than &# million apiece etf behemoth barclays plcs barclays global investors has been able to maintain stable seeding in the past few years but it has also been approaching capital providers besides specialists working with upstairs trading desks at big brokerages to seed new ishares etfs etf firms say this could become a popular alternative in coming months since there are no rules requiring etf firms to use specialists for seeding however this could be challenging for smaller firms for instance that may lack strong relationships with big brokerages mr shillers macromarkets had teamed with claymore securities inc as a marketing agent for its products and in november the claymore macroshares oil up and down tradeable shares were launched technically a variation on etfs they are considered exchange traded trusts they are designed to track the price movements of crude oil trouble hit almost immediately between christmas and new years the macroshares products received a big trading order that their specialists struggled to execute many traders at their specialist firm bear hunter were on vacation and traders were unable to execute the order while keeping prices in the etf stable at the time the products didnt have other market participants authorized to create and redeem shares the incident spurred further pricing problems in ensuing weeks the products eventually traded at more than discounts and premiums to net asset value some of the biggest recorded in the etf industry to date most etfs should rarely if ever trade at a discount or premium the combination of slow holiday trading complicated and thinly traded new products and staff turnover at the specialist firm created the "perfect storm" of bad luck says mr tull of macromarkets mr mccabe of m who left bear hunter in january says that "any implication that our leaving had anything to do" with those pricing problems "is false " instead it was the products complicated structure that made it tough to trade when a big order came in he says
