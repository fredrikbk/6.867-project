dealing with sarbox when we all of us the press companies lobbyists congress talk about the level of burden that accounting firms have been placing on corporations these past five years we tend to debate sarbanes oxley the result is that people line up on either side the companies say that its excessive and congress says that its not many of our elected politicians say that people have gotten used to it that it brought with it a needed level of discipline and that the costs should diminish over time then they point to a somewhat flawed and arguably self serving study conducted by the big four accounting firms that purports to prove the cost in year two was only about of what it was in year one notwithstanding the findings of this study most companies are paying much more to the big four today as a result shareholders earn less than they would otherwise companies contemplating an ipo reportedly give serious consideration to exchanges on other continents notably in london or hong kong employees exhausted by the amount of time and energy they devote to compliance oriented chores that corporations have piled on top of their existing job descriptions have become both discouraged and risk averse and all of the above taken together would appear to have rendered us less competitive as an economy my own company svb financial group which trades on the nasdaq is likely indicative in we paid over &# million to the big four including what is left of arthur andersen for an average of about &# per employee this is more than five times as much as we paid them only three years ago it turns out however that only a diminishing portion of this increase is due to sarbox more and more of it is due to the significantly increased amount of time that audits are taking and the much larger number of people that they involve trying to tease out exactly why they are taking longer and why more people are involved is difficult when i ask i get a host of different but related answers the auditors are operating with droves of often newly hired and therefore inexperienced people they appear to have lost any sense of the time honored accounting concept of "materiality " they appear to have very little decision making power decisions which increasingly need to be sent to superiors in far away locations take much longer than just a few years ago nobody appears to want to exercise judgment either with respect to the applicability of a given financial accounting standards board fasb pronouncement or to its application rules are applied whether the original framers were targeting the situation at hand or not and testing takes forever in situations where just a few years ago just a few tests might have sufficed today several times as many may be required finally everybody seems to be operating from a position of fear of rejection or remonstrance when i ask about the causes of that i am told the following neither companies nor auditors can really understand all of the primary accounting pronouncements coming out of the fasb the number of which has gone from in to today many of them are pages or more in length with accompanying interpretations that may be times as long as the pronouncement itself the public company accounting oversight board pcaob discourages the auditors from either offering advice or exercising judgment instead auditors apply rules whether they were meant to apply or not and in the most draconian manner possible out of fear of reprisal from above the sec is contributing to the fear factor as well and in many of the same ways as the pcaob as a result almost of all publicly traded companies announced restatements in finally market factors namely supply and demand have added to the turmoil there are nowhere near enough accountants available to staff these greatly expanded audits which has helped to drive up their price significantly we seem to have created a self reinforcing system which is difficult to adjust every aspect of it appears to reinforce the workings of the whole and no one appears to be either able or willing to help us break out of it there is a lot of finger pointing but very little leadership and as a result very little relief is this really the system that we want for our economy is it really serving the shareholders of our publicly traded companies in a way that justifies the cost are we really helping to make america a better place to live and work or are we punishing the many for the crimes of the few because in the end its just plain easier mr wilcox is president and ceo svb financial group
