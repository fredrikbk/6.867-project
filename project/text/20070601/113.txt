weekend journal sports by the numbers canadas comeback as the ottawa senators struggle to come back from a deficit against the anaheim ducks in the stanley cup finals they might do well to remember the words of the late canadian prime minister pierre trudeau "canada " he joked "is a country whose main exports are hockey players and cold fronts " but during his two administrations which ran from to canada seemed to keep most of its good hockey players at home with canadian teams taking nine stanley cups in years eight of them going to mr trudeaus hometown team the montreal canadiens overall canadian teams led by the canadiens the toronto maple leafs and the edmonton oilers hoisted lord stanleys trophy times in the years separating the beginning of the nhl stanley cup era in and the last victory for a canadian team once again the canadiens in and for all the dominance of canadian teams from the s through the s including a streak of eight consecutive cups from perhaps the most impressive run came between and when the edmonton oilers the calgary flames and the canadiens kept the cup in canada for seven straight seasons why has it been years since the last canadian stanley cup win one easy place to point the finger is at salaries most of the canadian franchises are in small markets and the disparity between the canadian and american dollars had made it increasingly difficult for teams like the oilers to keep stars in the mold of wayne gretzky and mark messier when they become eligible for free agency or to lure other players to replace them perhaps the notable example of this was the eric lindros fiasco the quebec nordiques drafted him first overall in but he was so opposed to playing for this small market franchise that he returned to junior hockey quebec was ultimately forced to trade him to the philadelphia flyers ironically the nordiques subsequently moved to colorado and the players acquired in the lindros deal later helped the avalanche win two stanley cup titles the other trend was the collapse of the soviet bloc and the influx of east european players for reasons ranging from economic factors to the intense rivalry that stemmed from the hard fought games the canadian national team played against several eastern european opponents in the canada cup series now known as the world cup of hockey canadian teams didnt add eastern european stars to their rosters as quickly as american franchises did for example between and five winners of the hart trophy given to the leagues most valuable player were born outside north america but none played for a canadian team even if the senators dont take the cup this year canadian teams seem to be on the upswing in the and playoffs canadian teams played in series winning only two of them and never progressing past the second round compare that to the and playoffs each of which saw a canadian team make it to the finals canadian franchises now embrace eastern european players nine of the players on the senators roster were born outside of canada and whatever its other effects the leagues stringent salary cap lets smaller market teams compete now discussions are taking place about the nashville predators actually heading north to a canadian city such as hamilton ontario kitchner waterloo ontario or winnipeg manitoba while another canadian dynasty might not be on the horizon dont be surprised if the most famous trophy in sports soon resides north of the border
