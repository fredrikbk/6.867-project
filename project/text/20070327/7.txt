boss talk netflix vs naysayers ceo hastings keeps growth strong plans for future after death of dvds in the decade since netflix inc began renting dvds online ceo reed hastings has faced down a murderers row of rivals wal mart stores inc amazon com inc and blockbuster inc have all piled into the market with services that mail dvds to consumers whove ordered them over the web but wal mart threw in the towel in after two years while amazon has so far limited its service to the united kingdom and germany meanwhile blockbusters chief executive john antioco last week abruptly resigned from the company after a long battle with shareholder carl icahn who wants the company to be more aggressive on the internet through it all mr hastings a year old silicon valley veteran has defied naysayers by keeping growth strong the los gatos calif company finished last year with million subscribers up from its revenue also grew to nearly &# billion in its most recent fiscal year today netflix rents out million dvds a day mr hastings who was appointed to microsoft corp s board of directors yesterday recently discussed the companys future excerpts wsj why does netflix face a lot of questions from analysts about the sustainability of its business even though youre showing strong growth hastings thats easy were sure that were going to be buying cars in years whereas renting dvds through the mail in years for sure thats not going to exist thats what creates the overhang theres a known obsolescence now we can argue about whether thats years or years away some people probably think its five i think theyre wrong its probably more like wsj so its a question of when not if dvd rentals will go away hastings thats exactly right if one thinks of netflix as a dvd rental business one is right to be scared if one thinks of netflix as an online movie service with multiple different delivery models then ones a lot less scared were only now starting to deliver the proof points behind that second vision wsj youve started letting some of your subscribers watch movies from your web site how seriously are you pushing into internet delivery of movies hastings were taking it pretty aggressively were investing about &# million into it this year we feel that thats the appropriate size investment given the size of the market if you overinvest in a market of course a lot of the money is wasted if you underinvest then someone else can get ahead of you well be up to films by the end of the year open to all of our subscribers wsj five thousand movies is still a lot less than the you offer netflix subscribers on dvd hastings remember when dvd launched in and then we launched in we only had a thousand titles it grew as the ecosystem grew wsj blockbuster was once dismissive of netflix but now theyre taking you very seriously did their initial attitude affect the way you view potential threats to netflix hastings absolutely we have to recognize that now there are tens and maybe hundreds of start ups who think that theyre going to eat netflixs lunch the challenge for a management team is to figure out which are real threats and which arent during the internet bubble blockbuster was very disciplined their primary competitor hollywood video bought a video sales company for &# million reel com and then plunged another &# million of losses into it and ultimately cratered hollywoods balance sheet on a business selling vhs online its conventional to say "only the paranoid survive" but thats not true the paranoid die because the paranoid take all threats as serious and get very distracted wsj what are some examples of how you were choosy in reacting to potential threats to netflix hastings there are markets that arent going to get very big and then there are markets that are going to get big but theyre not directly in our path in the first camp we have small companies like movielink a well run company but not an attractive model for consumers sort of a &# download to watch a movie we correctly guessed when it launched four years ago that this was not a threat and didnt react to it the other case i brought up is markets that are going to be very large markets but were just not the natural leader advertising supported online video whether thats at cbs com or youtube great market kind of next door to us but we dont do advertising supported video we do subscription so it would be a huge competence expansion for us and its not a threat to movies wsj in november blockbuster launched their total access service which gives their online renters the option of returning dvds in stores they now have more than two million online subscribers how do you see your rivalry with them playing out hastings were forecasting around two million this year in net additions of subscribers theyre forecasting around two million net additions the amazing thing is that thats four million net additions total that the market is growing that fast while were competing hard and that can be challenging its absolutely having the effect of growing the market faster than either one of us could have grown it on our own wsj what is netflix doing to get its movies from its internet service onto television sets hastings our view is we should get to every internet connected screen over the next two years as we also grow the title selection that includes cellphones laptops where of course we are today and television at this point we havent made any further announcements on that wsj is netflix developing its own device for connecting to televisions hastings weve prototyped lots of things but we havent made any decisions or announcements about what were going to do in the long term wsj apple inc s new appletv device for getting movies from the internet to televisions primarily works with video purchased through their itunes store are you worried netflix will get squeezed out of the picture if apple and others make hardware that works only with their internet services hastings obviously cable and satellite have been very large closed systems as is the apple system as are games on the other hand pcs have been very open theres a whole continuum were big believers in the power of the open internet to get to the television our view is its certain that from the television consumers will be able to browse online video from millions of web sites because the demand is there wsj how important is renting hd dvd and blu ray movies the two new high definition disc formats for netflix hastings tragically small we have all the titles on hd dvd and blu ray theyre running neck and neck but the total volume is less than of our volume consumers want high def but the perception of a format war is freezing consumers out until that perception stops very few consumers will try the new high def discs wsj do you think theres still a strong mutual mistrust between the technology and entertainment industries hastings its certainly less now than five years ago but so far technology silicon valley technology has only hurt the content companies as opposed to consumer electronics technology like dvd players and televisions which have hugely grown the market the copy protection systems for high definition dvd and blu ray formats have been cracked and theyve been cracked on pcs not movie players from traditional electronics companies the problem is the pc is an open platform people can say things like "well the consumer gets what the consumer wants " but thats kind of trite because really that leads to complete freedom and no payment wsj but the openness of pcs and the web is what allows netflix to have a business hastings you were asking what about the tension between the two industries and thats why the tension exists i dont say its bad its unavoidable its fashionable to say the record companies are awful but theyre no better or worse than any other company theyre trying to grow and make money and there are going to be less artists that get signed to their deals now because they have less revenue fortunately that hasnt happened in the movie business now to have it grow its not extorting consumers its giving consumers such a good experience that they feel good about paying thats whats hard in online video making the consumer happy and making the studio happy  movies with leadership lessons recommended by reed hastings the endurance constant adaptation overcomes truly impossible odds on shackletons climactic expedition to antarctica little miss sunshine forget the " steps " sometimes its all about the journey and the determination to see it through to the end the usual suspects verbal kint cleverly uses an unassuming and downplayed persona to mask his real genius sam walton practiced this for years henry v "we few we happy few we band of brothers " kenneth branagh powerfully demonstrates how a leaders words these written by shakespeare can inspire legions
