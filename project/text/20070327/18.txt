friction with retailers the company also has shuttered two collection stores in dallas and paris but plans to open one in beijing this year at his peak mr klein was one of the biggest names in american fashion a master of branding he is credited with creating a market for designer jeans but the business began losing money and momentum phillips van heusen set out to strengthen its operations and expand its distribution while keeping what mr chirico calls "the essence of the brand " mr murry was the most senior executive to stay mr klein who stepped down as designer in continued to serve as a creative consultant until last year since taking over the top job at pvh mr chirico has made clear that continuing to expand the brands reach is foremost "it didnt make sense to cut expenses and not invest in the brand " he said calvin klein recently hired an executive vice president of licensing a new post to help oversee the expansion in licensing
