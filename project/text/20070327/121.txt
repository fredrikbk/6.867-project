washington harvest congress is preparing to rewrite farm policy this year which means the farm lobby will try to tap taxpayers for another &# billion or so per year to subsidize agribusiness some things in politics cant be changed but is it asking too much for congress at least to cut off subsidies to the richest americans many of whom dont even farm for a living thats the question at the heart of a debate over a bush administration proposal that would reduce the eligibility cap for farm subsidies to an annual adjusted gross income or agi of &# averaged over three years the current cap is &# million in agi which means that subsidies now go to many americans whose income is among the top of all taxpayers so the administration proposal would eliminate subsidies to the rich while keeping them for the merely affluent this modest reform is part of a larger farm package that would cost taxpayers &# billion over five years the agi fix would save about &# billion over a decade that may not be much in a &# trillion annual federal budget but you have to start somewhere and why not in washington d c where at least of these very rich farmers reside to help plan its reform proposals the bush agriculture department received irs tax data for tax year no names just income data in washington d c "farmers" filed an irs "schedule f" for taxpayers who actively participate in their farms and of them reported agi of more than &# if youve been to the district of columbia lately youve probably noticed it isnt overrun with corn fields the d c almost certainly do something else as their main occupation and wed like to know how many of them also cadge farm payments on the side who are these mystery farmers anyway nationwide there were nearly schedule f filers who earned more than &# in and of those received farm payments more than of filers in maryland returns of schedule f filers from california and nevada and no fewer than of filers in rustic new jersey also had at least &# in income also in another americans who had farm income but dont actively participate in their farms filed irs form instead of schedule f about of those reported agi of more than &# and some of those received federal farm payments all in all some "farmers" who reported agi of more than &# in received more than &# million in federal farm subsidies or about of all farm program payments that year quite the sweet deal with all the political and media chatter about "inequality" these days youd think this welfare for the rich would cause a stir but this is washington where corporate welfare is a bipartisan industry the lower agi subsidy cap has turned out to be the most controversial bush farm proposal and is running into stiff opposition on capitol hill "im not sure that congress is going to go along with that whole concept of the &# agi at least im not supportive of it " declared missouri republican jo ann emerson at a recent hearing arkansas democrat blanche lincoln who runs the subsidy subcommittee in the senate also opposes reducing farm welfare for the rich the national cotton council has been especially vocal with chairman john pucheu declaring that "means testing continues to be bad policy " he added that "the administrations proposal greatly expands the intent of congress which imposed a &# million agi means test in the current farm bill aimed primarily at eligibility of those with substantial non farm income " so &# isnt substantial well maybe it isnt by his industrys standards according to the usda over the period from " payments to cotton producers averaged a little over of the value of the cotton sold in those years " howd you like to be in a business where each year the government cut you a check for half of your annual revenue by the way one gentleman farmer whos doing the right thing is iowa senator chuck grassley according the des moines register mr grassley reported net income of &# from his acre family farm in and received about &# in farm subsidies that year but at least hes supporting the subsidy means test farm state politicians keep telling us that subsidies are needed to help the poor family farmer but as always in washington government power turns out to help the powerful where are the democratic class warriors when we need them
