suppliers which tended to put long term business interests before concerns about the share price but such traditional arrangements have unwound in the past few years now activist funds that have bought shares in japanese corporations are pressuring managements to raise dividends and buy back shares with some of the mounds of cash on the companies books some funds are also seeking to change
