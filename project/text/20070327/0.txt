a cultural conversation with lucinda williams this singer songwriter puts it all together two of her past three studio albums won grammy awards and the third a nomination in the worlds of singing songwriters of indie rock country music and americana her first name will suffice for discussing her though music critics havent quite come up with a standard adjective for making facile comparisons to her yet some equivalent of "dylanesque " lucinda williams is by now a touchstone for describing lesser known edgy direct confessional singer songwriters and an acknowledged model for many aspiring performers themselves shes been out singing and strumming alone or with bands in saloons and concert halls coffeehouses blues dives and rock palaces for more than years now shes been recording since though four of her eight studio albums have been produced in the past nine years and shes still capable of feeling new at all this "it sounds funny to say it " she admitted in a recent phone interview "but im kind of a late bloomer it took me a long time to accept what i did to say to myself wow im a songwriter i can actually do this and i am fairly new to the idea of writing recording touring and then going back into the studio again ive never been very disciplined i still dont exactly write on demand but ive been writing like crazy its like the cork came out of the bottle " shes come up with more than two dozen new songs in the three years since her last studio recording thirteen of them appear on "west " her surprising recently released cd on lost highway records which like each of her albums has a sound and mood of its own direct nearly conversational lyrics meet smooth finished pop and rock sounds a merger that may well make this her most accessible and broadly appealing record yet "ive always straddled this road between the two " she says of those often separate realms of pop and jagged confessional song making "id never quite known how to put the two together but ive always been living in both unbeknownst maybe to a lot of people ive never considered myself a folk singer really or even in the whole americana thing though i certainly did start there but even when i was being a singer songwriter in the s playing in places like anderson ferry in houston i was performing songs by jimi hendrix cream and jefferson airplane and also by hank williams and robert johnson " the southern raised ms williams whos resided in most regions of the u s at one time or another and is now living near los angeles credits her l a based co producer hal willner a veteran who has worked with artists as diverse as marianne faithful and bill frisell lou reed and elvis costello for providing a route to this musical fusion they began with cleanly recorded demos of the songs shed recorded then mr willner built up the polished tracks around them employing a balanced combination of roots rock musicians shes played with before and artists he brought in such as jazz friendly guitarist frisell and a string section the songs on "west" reflect a drama charged period in ms williamss life tracking a particularly florid relationship break up some hard rocking frisky sexual taunting of the man in question "come on" and touchingly her response to her mothers death as the record proceeds right in line with the synthesizing sonics theres a coming to terms with those losses and then a new tone sets in related to ms williamss happy engagement to record executive tom overby hopeful something closer to contented one thing the new record is not by design is a return to the complex narrative storytelling and imagery loaded language of s "car wheels on a gravel road " her most celebrated record until now recently reissued in extended form "west is the album that ive always wanted to make " ms williams says "this is the one that i was trying to get to after car wheels but i think i had to go through the essence and world without tears to get to it " the latter record in particular not universally understood had sometimes toyed with words as minimalist sounds and she agrees helped pave the way for the relative simplicity of the language on "west " ms williamss moving on from tone to tone even when the previous ones been much praised in a recording world that notoriously likes to have artists stick to tightly defined knitting is perhaps just another aspect of the gutsiness revealed in her celebrated willingness as she puts it herself to "dig down deep open yourself up not be afraid and just jump in" as a songwriter she does not promise the younger performers who see her as a role model that those choices are easy or that being able to make them necessarily comes quickly "its not always comfortable for me but i have to do it i have no choice im an artist i write for myself first and foremost its self expression but somehow ive made it work now where i can make a living out of it it may have taken me a few years to grow into that but i just see it as a natural maturation as a woman at im certainly wiser and cooler and hipper than i was at " mr mazor writes about country and pop music for the journal
