fed has trouble getting across nuanced message economic outlook faces greater risks but rates arent likely to change washington when the federal reserve last week altered its post meeting policy statement to soften the suggestion that it might raise interest rates wall street was confused was the fed signaling that a rate increase was less likely because the outlook for the economy had darkened or was it simply reflecting the reality that interest rates are on hold for now the answer to both questions is yes the fed is seeing increased risks to its forecast that the nations economy will grow moderately this year those risks include the surprisingly weak level of business investment and the hard to predict outcome of the current troubles at the riskier end of the mortgage market the fed changed its statement last week to get the flexibility to cut interest rates in coming months if those risks grow but it is unlikely to use that flexibility anytime soon because the risks arent big enough and inflation remains uncomfortably high "housekeeping" played a part as well for several months some officials saw the feds previous policy statement which had indicated rates could rise but not fall as increasingly inconsistent with their own expectations of unchanged rates for the foreseeable future the new statement reflects a fed on hold it contains no explicit reference to the direction of rates but reiterates enough inflation concern to indicate lower rates arent on the table communicating the nuances of this stance will be a challenge for the fed better communication with the public has been an important goal for chairman ben bernanke who testifies to congress tomorrow on the outlook for the economy mr bernanke feels the feds words should mean what they say and not be shaded to manage market expectations as was sometimes the case under his predecessor alan greenspan however in the wake of last weeks meeting interpretations of the feds policy statement varied widely in the immediate aftermath investors assumed the fed intended to signal that rate cuts were more likely and drove down bond yields the following day markets reconsidered and concluded that the fed still had an inclination to raise rates and bond yields shot up again "the feds changes in its statement have caused confusion and it will take some time before the meaning is further clarified " christopher rupkey economist at bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj said in a weekend report the fed last raised its target for short term interest rates in june to from last august through january the fed had said after each policy meeting that "some inflation risks remain " and the "extent and timing of any additional firming" of interest rates would depend on economic developments it maintained that bias toward raising interest rates primarily because the "core" inflation rate which excludes food and energy prices was well above the ceiling with which most fed officials are comfortable and the nations economy was operating close to full capacity but the fed expected inflation to edge down and economic growth which averaged close to at an annual rate from early through early to slow as housing construction declined and consumer spending slackened a bit for the most part that forecast has come true growth through the current quarter is estimated to have averaged since last spring core inflation did drop late last year though it recently ticked higher in recent months that prompted some fed officials to question the old statements implication that rate increases were on the table at the feds december meeting one official argued for a "neutral" statement that suggested rates could either rise or fall minutes to the meeting show in january officials "discussed whether" the stated bias "was the best way to represent their views " according to minutes to that meeting since then economic developments have added to the impetus for change fed officials had expected that as the housing market slumped stronger business investment would pick up much of the slack but business investment has been surprisingly weak capital goods shipments excluding aircraft and defense products have fallen in four of the five months through january february data will be released tomorrow while officials still believe demand for housing has stabilized they acknowledge the recent turmoil in the subprime mortgage market adds an unpredictable element to the outlook for the housing sector these factors however havent led the fed to significantly lower its growth forecast in late february mr bernanke told congress "there is really no material change in our expectations " yesterday federal reserve bank of chicago president michael moskow told an audience in beijing that "we are expecting the recent softness in capital spending to be temporary " though "we are monitoring developments in investment closely " mr moskow said rising delinquencies on subprime home loans "could become an issue for the macro outlook if these troubles spilled over to the availability of credit in markets more generally we dont see this happening yet however " he added "there is a risk that inflation will stay stubbornly high "
