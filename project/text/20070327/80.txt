pfizer heart drug draws mixed reviews cholesterol improves but therapy cant slow the clogging of arteries new orleans a pfizer inc experimental heart drug failed to slow clogging of the arteries despite improving cholesterol levels according to the first major publication of data since pfizer pulled the plug on the compound pfizer of new york scrapped development of torcetrapib in december because it was associated with an increased risk of death in a large patient trial pfizer previously viewed torcetrapib as a potential blockbuster and its failure left a big void in pfizers late stage development pipeline doctors eagerly awaited the release of new torcetrapib data yesterday for its potential to shed light on whether pfizer and other drug makers would continue development of similar compounds known as cholesteryl ester transfer protein or cetp inhibitors the main question is the problem limited to torcetrapib or is the whole category faulty the picture isnt clear but some experts say the new torcetrapib data suggest cetp inhibitors might be a valid approach to heart care if that thesis holds up it would be good news for pfizer merck &amp co and roche holding ag which are developing other cetp inhibitors it is possible something unique to torcetrapib such as its tendency to raise blood pressure contributed to its failure rather than a class effect other experimental cetp inhibitors havent been associated with elevated blood pressure in studies so far "you dont want to abandon a class where the first drug you studied had unique toxicities " said steven nissen head of cardiovascular medicine at the cleveland clinic and lead author of one of the torcetrapib studies "we just dont know if well see that in the other compounds " however further development of cetp inhibitors could be prolonged dr nissen suggested that other compounds in the class should first undergo studies using imaging techniques followed by trials to test whether the drugs reduce deaths heart attacks and other events that could delay the introduction of a cetp to the market for several years for torcetrapib imaging and outcomes trials were being conducted concurrently "todays data certainly will raise significant doubts about these agents and will slow their development as well " said a g edwards analyst joseph tooley results of the torcetrapib studies were presented at the annual meeting of the american college of cardiology in new orleans the results also were published online by the new england journal of medicine doctors and analysts say theyll get a better idea of why torcetrapib failed when pfizer releases results of the patient study that was halted in december due to the increased death rate that will show what caused the higher death rate in the torcetrapib arm pfizer still is analyzing the results of the aborted trial pfizers other experimental cetp compounds remain in development steve ryder a senior vice president said but pfizers priority is to analyze as much data about torcetrapib as possible to learn what implications it may hold for all cetp inhibitors he said torcetrapib was viewed as promising because it could substantially boost levels of good cholesterol or hdl doctors believe raising hdl can further reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke beyond what can be accomplished by existing drugs known as statins which include pfizers lipitor statins primarily reduce levels of bad cholesterol or ldl pfizers hope was that a combination of torcetrapib and lipitor could vastly improve heart care before it halted development pfizer had planned to submit torcetrapib for u s regulatory approval by the end of the study led by dr nissen used an imaging technique intravascular ultrasound to measure the effect of torcetrapib on atherosclerosis or plaque buildup in the arteries which can lead to heart attack and stroke nearly patients with coronary disease were assigned to receive either a combination of torcetrapib and lipitor or lipitor alone taken daily for two years the pfizer funded study found that the torcetrapib lipitor combination raised good cholesterol by compared with those on lipitor alone while reducing bad cholesterol by despite this improvement there was no significant difference in progression of coronary atherosclerosis between the two groups researchers concluded a separate study found that torcetrapib combined with lipitor failed to slow progression of atherosclerosis in the carotid artery compared with lipitor alone in this study however a secondary measure in the trial showed torcetrapib worsened artery thickening compared with lipitor alone merck whitehouse station n j reiterated yesterday that no adverse effect on blood pressure was seen in early studies of its cetp inhibitor mk merck is pursuing another way to raise hdl a combination of extended release niacin and a compound designed to minimize a skin related side effect of niacin that has limited niacins use abbott laboratories abbott park ill sells a prescription version of niacin and is also working on a version designed to reduce the side effect roche said yesterday that it continues to investigate its cetp inhibitor r and expects to submit it for regulatory approval after in a separate development in new orleans merck and schering plough corp said they agreed to develop a new cholesterol lowering medication that combines their drug zetia with a generic form of pfizers lipitor in a single pill pfizer isnt a party to the agreement merck and schering plough wouldnt begin selling the combination product until lipitors patents expire in the u s and internationally
