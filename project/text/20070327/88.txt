politics &amp economics securities suits on trial supreme court outcomes could further limit class actions in the perpetual battle between securities firms and the shareholder lawyers who sue them wall street lately has been racking up some high profile court victories now the supreme court is slated to hear two cases this week that could further crimp plaintiffs lawyers the first case to be argued today concerns whether private plaintiffs using antitrust laws can sue investment banks accused of artificially inflating the prices of newly issued stock tomorrow the justices will consider how strongly plaintiffs must lay out allegations of wrongdoing to proceed with a lawsuit accusing executives of misleading investors over their companys prospects meanwhile yesterday the court agreed to hear a case concerning whether third parties are liable for securities fraud committed by others the outcome could affect the liability of bankers lawyers and accountants doing business with a company that engages in accounting fraud "depending on how these supreme court cases turn out the securities plaintiffs bar may have a much harder time bringing successful suits in the future " says andrew gold a corporate law professor at depaul university in both cases slated for this week the securities and exchange commission has sided with business the hearings come at a time when the plaintiffs securities bar has suffered a series of setbacks two recent federal appeals court decisions in securities fraud cases involving enron corp and the pricing of initial public offerings could make it more difficult for plaintiffs to pursue class action lawsuits against wall street firms the indictment of milberg weiss &amp bershad llp last year on charges of funneling kickbacks to plaintiffs has left one of the nations leading class action firms operating under a cloud a prominent group of business leaders backed by treasury secretary henry paulson has urged congress to pass laws to rein in securities litigation already securities related class action cases were down significantly in a trend some experts attribute to the sarbanes oxley corporate oversight legislation for its part the supreme court in recent years hasnt been kind to the plaintiffs securities bar in the court established the "loss causation" rule which holds that for shareholders to recover for securities fraud their losses must actually be caused by fraudulent conduct last year the court ruled that holders of securities cant bring securities fraud class actions in state court still the plaintiffs securities bar hasnt exactly folded its tent last year investors finalized five billion dollar plus class action settlements with companies sued for securities fraud investors have filed numerous lawsuits against companies regarding stock options backdating and two recent rulings in the delaware court of chancery bode well for those cases today the court hears credit suisse first boston v billing wall streets plea to be exempt from antitrust laws that could expose the nations biggest investment banks to gargantuan damages a shareholder class action alleges that at the height of the dot com boom major investment banks including credit suisse group goldman sachs group inc and merrill lynch &amp co as well as institutional investors conspired to inflate aftermarket stock prices for companies such as amazon com inc ebay inc and priceline com inc the suit alleges that under "tie in" arrangements ipo purchasers were required to buy additional shares at higher set prices on the aftermarket thereby driving up share prices artificially many wall street business practices are exempt from antitrust suits because congress placed the industry under the oversight of a specialized regulator the sec but in the second u s circuit court of appeals in new york ruled that congress hadnt specifically immunized wall streets tie in practices from antitrust laws and that the shareholder suit could proceed the sec has agreed with the industry it regulates saying the laws that place wall street under the commissions jurisdiction also immunize it from private party antitrust suits in a june op ed article in the wall street journal sec commissioner paul atkins warned that if the second circuit opinion stands "it could devastate americas process of capital formation wreak unprecedented havoc on the underwriting business and accelerate the marginalization of our capital markets " traditionally when congress hasnt specifically exempted an industry from antitrust law the supreme court has disfavored implying such immunity even if the industry is regulated by a specialized agency unless antitrust enforcement would be "repugnant" to such regulation the court has allowed parallel liability to stand the dispute here is in part over whether the threat of shareholder antitrust suits would so upend the capital markets as to frustrate the purpose of sec regulation tomorrow the justices consider how far congress wanted to go in reining in suits through the private securities litigation and reform act that law required plaintiffs to state in their complaint "facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant" acted with intent to deceive but it didnt define the terms and federal appeals courts have interpreted them differently plaintiffs sued fiber optic maker tellabs inc alleging that company executives had fraudulently boosted share prices with overly optimistic public statements the chicago based seventh circuit let the suit proceed on the basis of whether "a reasonable person could infer" that the company intended to commit fraud but tellabs wants the court to reverse arguing for a stricter pleading standard recently the sec weighed in on the case tellabs inc v makor issues &amp rights ltd urging the high court to hold shareholders to a stricter standard fred isquith a plaintiffs lawyers says if the standard proposed by the sec is adopted "the vast number of cases good cases will never be permitted to get past the initial stages " earlier this month the fifth circuit in new orleans ruled that enron corp shareholders couldnt proceed with a class action securities fraud lawsuit against banks and securities firms for their alleged role in the accounting fraud that led to enrons collapse the decision suggests that the role of banks in structuring deals and advising companies doesnt rise to the level of securities law violations the enron ruling follows a similar ruling last year in the st louis based eighth circuit though the ninth circuit in san francisco has taken a different view yesterday the supreme court agreed to review the eighth circuit decision in december the second circuit ruled investors couldnt proceed with a securities fraud lawsuit against banks alleging fraud in their pricing of initial public offerings the second circuit ruling adopted a fairly rigorous standard for what is required to establish a class in a securities fraud case because the second circuit is a hotbed of securities litigation the decision could make it more difficult for investors to bring fraud cases against investment banks whichever way the trend goes defense lawyers expect their adversaries to persist "the smart money isnt counting them out " says boris feldman a securities lawyer at wilson sonsini goodrich &amp rosati llp "because when the plaintiffs bar runs into new roadblocks theyre very creative at finding a path around them " nathan koppel contributed to this article
