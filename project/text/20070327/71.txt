not paying organ donors denies a lifeline to millions of patients in regard to sally satels "doing well by doing good " editorial page march donors of organs and tissues whether dead or alive are the only participants in the lifesaving transplantation procedures who do not get paid who cannot get paid it makes no difference whether that donor is a cadaver an altruist or a relative that is why we are so very short of transplantable tissues and organs "tissues" are generally nonviable such as tendon ligament bone blood cornea blood vessels and skin and can be harvested leisurely from cadaveric donors "organs" are living and include heart lungs liver kidneys pancreas small intestine colon and bone marrow they may come from a live donor or harvested from a dead donor immediately after death the members of the "harvest team " the nurses and technicians the surgical team the anesthesiologists and the internists who will manage the rejection reaction all get paid neither they nor the hospitals consider transplant surgery among their obligatory charitable activities a society that recycles paper and glass should do as well for its members cadaveric donors might be "partsed out " like an automobile and the donors family compensated by price list or auction yes it sounds callous but anything is better than the current situation in which thousands of persons are needlessly sacrificed each year because the unmotivated potential donors are instead giving up their valuable organs and tissues to worms and anaerobic microbacteria those responsible for the current untenable situation including physicians legislators insurance companies moralists and ethicists might militate for paying donors if they or someone they loved needed a transplant and was near the bottom of the list seth l haber m d clinical professor of pathology stanford university school of medicine palo alto calif sally satels recommendations for incentives to be offered for organ donation omit an obvious first step in that direction when i have thought about the possibility of donating an organ i have been troubled by the answer to this question what if one of my family members ever needed for example a kidney if i have already donated a kidney then even if there is a match it will not be possible for me to be a donor for that loved one it seems to me that the willingness of people to consider donating to a stranger will increase if in return for making such a donation any member of a donors family will be given a preference in the event that person needs an organ of course a procedure would have to be carefully defined to give effect to that idea james haines topeka kan bravo to sally satel those readers old enough to remember the television show "beat the clock" are best positioned to appreciate the absurdity of the current regime of organ donation on that show contestants were required to perform a simple task such as dribble a basketball across the room the kicker was that they were not permitted to use their hands so it is in the world of transplant organs the national organ transplant act makes it a federal crime to take or to offer valuable consideration for a transplant organ as a result the organs that could restore the ill to health are instead fed to worms lloyd cohen j d ph d professor of law george mason university school of law arlington va
