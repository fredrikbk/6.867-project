backed designer tommy hilfiger then he lost it today hes rebuilding his empire in the high end retailing boom sweeping the country he left years ago india in the s amid a sharp downturn in his fortunes one of the few assets mr murjani held onto was the rights to sell tommy hilfiger products in india even though imported jeans were effectively banned in the country then he did nothing with it for a decade but indias economic boom and the expansion of its companies overseas have created a new class of consumers who have money and care about global brands to tap that market mr murjani with local partners in opened indias first tommy hilfiger store though its jeans cost &# about as much as two months salary for most indians it was a hit mr murjani has since opened nine more stand alone tommy hilfiger stores and sells tommy products in hundreds of other shops this year he plans to open another stores as he expands the brands he sells in india to include gucci jimmy choo calvin klein and britains trendy french connection these are just some of the many higher end global brands catching on here in mumbai versace sells &# t shirts new malls stock swarovski crystals and in one case a rolls royce dealership one of bollywoods biggest stars shahrukh khan is "brand ambassador" for tag heuer watches which cost thousands of dollars he gives them away on the indian version of "who wants to be a millionaire " the rise of upmarket international brands here parallels indias emergence as an economic force world wide for decades after india gained independence from britain the countrys economy was geared more toward socialism than capitalism and indians stuck to their traditional unique dress and culture foreign brands typically were limited to the lobbies of the nations few five star hotels "ive always wanted to come to india but the market wasnt there the consumers werent there india didnt really have a brand culture " says the year old mr murjani who left india when he was all that changed with economic reforms in the early s followed by the emergence of indias high technology and services sector indias software companies hit it big preparing computer systems world wide for the switch to the new millennium its outsourcing companies are prospering with business from overseas young workers many of them making more money than their parents and getting raises of or more a year seek the same internationally recognized designer products they can purchase on work trips and vacations abroad they watch mtv they read fashion magazines they see top bollywood stars switching to western designer dresses many of indias biggest female stars arrived at an awards ceremony last month in gowns rather than saris these consumers also arent reluctant to use plastic credit card spending in india has risen by a year for the past five years "aspirationally things changed dramatically " mr murjani says "what we were seeing was huge growth in terms of assets in terms of their incomes and in terms of their spending power through credit " rami desai a year old research analyst for a think tank in mumbai likes to carry designer bags and wear shoes that cost more than her monthly salary a taste she acquired while studying in london her recent purchases include a pair of gucci shoes with four inch heels and the latest louis vuitton handbag shes already spotted her next purchase in a magazine its a burberry bag that she can pick up in mumbai "i havent seen the bag in person yet " she says though much of the cost is covered by her parents she says such items are a necessity if she wants to stand out "a rupee &# bag is not that difficult for the upper middle class to buy " she says "so everyone and their dogs started carrying them " indias overall retail market is already the eighth largest in the world says mckinsey &amp co while it has around &# billion a year in sales according to new delhi based images f&amp r research the vast majority of sales still come from the millions of tiny mom and pop shops that sell indian made products sales from chains of branded stores still account for less than of the total but analysts foresee vigorous growth especially from high end retail designer brands and other high end brand names have taken off even as other foreign retailers remain largely closed out the government has prevented companies like wal mart stores inc from directly investing here worried that they could hurt the mom and pop stores wal mart recently firmed up plans to enter india through a joint venture but it will only be allowed in as a wholesaler its indian partner will own the stores that was the case for single brand stores too for years forcing the murjani family and others to find local partners recently though regulations have relaxed to make it easier for these retailers last august french luxury goods brand louis vuitton which has operated here since and is part of lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton sa became one of the first brands to own a majority stake in its indian distributor vuittons sales in india grew last year the murjanis say that in the future they will own all the stores they open for mr murjani the arrival of foreign designer labels in india is a fitting coda to the familys history over the past six decades when pakistan split from india in the family fled its ancestral home in what is now pakistan his father b k murjani left mohan in india and went to hong kong to start his own business he was one of the first to export clothes from china to the u s in the s at one point sending million pieces a year to the u s company s s kresge which later became kmart says mohan murjani mohan murjani attended babson college in massachusetts and then entered the family business with a view to expansion his big idea was to make and market jeans fitted for women and branded with a socialites name gloria vanderbilt they sold for &# a pair when the average cost of a pair of levis was less than &# the jeans brought in as much as &# million in sales in some years during the s mr murjani became a minor celebrity in his new home in new york occasionally singing karaoke with andy warhol he says in the early s mr murjani decided to create a jeans brand for men he helped launch tommy hilfiger with a giant billboard in times square and bought the rights to hilfiger sales world wide but then mr murjani over invested in a coca cola line of clothes and in a new chain of high tech clothing stores called "fizzazz" that fizzled the stock market crash of left mr murjani with warehouses full of unsold inventory and struggling to pay his suppliers and lenders "we had stretched ourselves and then the market went bad " he says as he dealt with &# million in debt he sold his palatial family home in london and the rights to most of the gloria vanderbilt brand he also sold the rights to the tommy hilfiger brand to mr hilfiger and a group of investors for an undisclosed amount in one of the only things he kept was the rights to sell the hilfiger brand in india twelve years later he sent his son vijay to scope out the indian retail market the elder mr murjani says he moved back to india this year to help out though he and his wife are shuttling between mumbai london and new york it took the younger mr murjani three years of planning research and battling with the indian bureaucracy before he could open the first store with limited people with experience in high end retail in india he brought in specialists from abroad and from other industries like hotels and airlines the government made the cost of doing business steep it slaps a tariff on most garment imports when the first hilfiger store opened in it carried the most expensive jeans in india at more than &# a pair vijay murjani says the square foot store format the murjanis chose was unheard of at the time the largest brand stores that existed at the time were half that size "people thought we were crazy " says vijay murjani "they were like what are you going to fill them with " the answer says his father the same products atmosphere and prices consumers would find in a tommy hilfiger store in new york or chicago if the products are too expensive the stores too small or shabby or the selection outdated then high end indian shoppers will just wait until they go abroad he says "indian consumers with all the media that is available to them the internet magazines television they know exactly what the latest products are in the world they are totally up to speed " mr murjani says hilfiger dressing rooms in indian stores have heavy doors and massive framed mirrors just like the stores in the u s the shopping bags and paper used for receipts are identical for the new french connection store in mumbai the murjanis have imported the jeans shelves indoor billboards and even the mannequins to get the same edgy look that makes the chain popular in europe they have made some adjustments with some hilfiger branches attracting more than customers a day the signature teak wood floors were getting ground down "we are switching to stone now " says vijay while the murjanis wont disclose details they say their tommy hilfiger business is profitable mr murjani says that the governments tariff on foreign clothes shrinks profit margins since the clothes are sold at close to the same prices as in london new york or singapore he wouldnt be specific on revenues but says that sales at some tommy hilfiger stores in india more than doubled last year the hilfiger stores cater to the likes of sudipt sankar ghosh a year old who buys tommy hilfiger regularly because he likes the shops and thinks the quality of the clothing is better than indian made he exports indian made clothing to other retail stores in the u s hilfiger clothes are made in countries including turkey china and the u s with a small percentage made in india "im a guy who is brand conscious " he said stepping out of a suburban new delhi hilfiger outlet one recent sunday in a pale blue polo shirt with the red white and blue tommy hilfiger logo "i dont care about the price " he added as his girlfriend looked on "i can afford it " one of the murjani familys next projects is to bring tommy hilfiger calvin klein and french connection to the new store acre "select citywalk " a &# million shopping complex under construction in south delhi recently the complex was filled with hundreds of workers and donkeys scrambling to finish by a may deadline construction workers were mixing concrete by hand in the future french connection store and there was a big puddle in tommy hilfigers space when finished there will be a gourmet grocery store an italian restaurant a pub and one of indias first starbucks says the complexs general manager shilpa malik its food court will feel like a hotel lobby with solid furniture "none of those plastic chairs " she says and spots to eat outside to
