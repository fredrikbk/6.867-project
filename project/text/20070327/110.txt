the evening wrap patriot protection online edition lawmakers who are up in arms over the misuse of personal information in terrorism investigations are pressing to change the patriot act but today the governments top investigator urged congress not to alter the law because of the missteps of his agency federal bureau of investigation director robert mueller was at pains to convince a skeptical senate judiciary committee that his agency knows where the boundaries are when it comes to digging through the personal information of americans and foreigners in its pursuit of terror suspects investigators were granted far reaching authority to sweep telephone email and financial records without the explicit consent of a judge under the patriot act but a recent report by the justice departments own watchdog glenn a fine found investigators had engaged in widespread abuse of their authority to gather information using so called national security letters democrats say mr fines report showed what critics had feared that the government was using the counterterrorism tools it was granted after the sept attacks to run roughshod over the privacy rights of ordinary citizens judiciary committee chairman patrick leahy said lawmakers were inclined to take another look at the expansive powers that had been given to the fbi "last year the administration sought new powers in the patriot act to appoint u s attorneys without senate confirmation and to more freely use national security letters " the vermont democrat said "the administration got these powers and they have badly bungled both " but the fbi director submitted that the problem wasnt with the law but rather with the way that investigators had put it into effect "the statute did not cause the errors " mr mueller told the committee "the fbis implementation did " he said that he was working to tighten up his oversight of the letters obviating any need to revise the patriot act "what i did not do and should have done is put in a compliance program to be sure those procedures were followed " he stated lawmakers appeared to be growing weary of hearing about problems with the fbi however citing an article in the washington post this morning that said fbi agents repeatedly provided inaccurate data when applying for surveillance warrants from the foreign intelligence surveillance court sen arlen specter moaned that there seems to be "another headline virtually on a daily basis the question arises as to whether any director can handle this job and whether the bureau itself can handle the job " mr mueller said the warrant applications are complex with thousands of facts but that seemed to fan mr specters ire "thats your job you asked for these powers we gave you them " he said lennar earnings and more housing woe just a few days after home builder kb home turned in a sharp decline in earnings lennar joined its competitor by reporting a swoon in net income for its fiscal first quarter as market conditions for construction firms continued to atrophy worse lennar said that theres no relief on the horizon the builder went so far as to yank its previous earnings guidance for the year and say that it doesnt feel comfortable making any new projections the arrival of springtime generally prods new buyers into the housing market but "the typically stronger spring selling

drew matus says consumers arent particularly concerned over their own circumstances but that reading all that scary stuff in the newspaper about subprime mortgages has left them worried about how the

shareholder approval things not to do in new delhi compile a list of the worlds most dangerous activities and near the top youll likely find smoking cigarettes and driving around new delhi now two judges in indias capital city have barred smoking behind the wheel in what is apparently the first ban of its type anywhere in the world smoking bans in restaurants and bars have become common enough in western cities especially in the u s as state and local governments show more and more interest in cracking down on public tobacco consumption but indias tobacco market is one of the hottest in the world and the ban there seems to be motivated more by fear that a driver distracted by firing up another marlboro might merrily plow through the citys already dangerous intersections rather than by concern that any of his passengers might eventually expire of exposure to second hand smoke underlining that primary concern is the fact that chattering away on a cellphone while driving has also been banned "anything that distracts the attention of driver is dangerous the human mind cannot do two things simultaneously " cheered the owner of one of the worlds most thankless jobs new delhi traffic
