business technology it managers make a power play new software thin clients help to tame energy guzzling computers electricity consumption hadnt been a big issue for information technology managers in the past few decades the move to personal computers in the s initially cut power consumption from the big iron mainframes of yore and technology budgets focused on getting and managing more computing power but information technology managers are now discovering what big data center operators have found in recent years electricity is a significant portion of their tech spending and growing quickly power costs for computers are rising not just because of energy prices but because the machines are tackling more power hungry tasks such as handling video if a large business did nothing for the next five years it would need to spend as much as &# million to run a typical cabinet full of server computers over the three year life of the machines compared with &# now according to an estimate from the uptime institute a think tank in santa fe n m and unlike companies such as google inc and yahoo inc which can afford to build new data centers in places such as washington state where power is cheap most businesses are stuck paying the growing bill from the local power company now it managers are experimenting with new ways to cut power use while also helping the environment companies are taking advantage of software programs such as surveyor from verdiem corp which enables it managers to automatically turn off desktops when they arent in use other firms are turning to "thin client" computers which are barebones machines that connect directly to servers and use far less power than desktops and many are also using new features including enhanced "sleep" features in software and products from pc manufacturers and companies such as microsoft corp that also save on energy city university of new york for example in began outfitting its fleet of pcs with surveyor which acts like a night watchman to automatically turn computers off when they are idling in the dark the software contrasts with familiar "screen savers " which shut down monitors to save screen life but can actually use more electricity using the software has so far cut more than from the universitys computer power bills or about &# a year university officials estimate quad graphics inc in sussex wis has also outfitted its pcs with surveyor after a pilot study of the software last year showed it would shave to off the cost of the companys computer power bills say officials of the commercial printer this equates to as much as &# annually in lower power costs thats a real boon the officials add since their business has been squeezed by fierce pricing pressure "every dollar saved has a direct impact to the bottom line " says mike fegley quad graphicss manager of energy and corporate facilities some companies are turning to barebones pc terminals known as thin clients to cut electricity costs the verizon wireless call center in chandler ariz for example last year swapped out most of its pcs with sun microsystems inc thin clients that helped slash its power usage at the call center by a third say verizon officials afterward an official of the local power utility "joked whether we were leaving the building " says carl eberling vice president for information technology at verizon wireless a basking ridge n j carrier owned by verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc power savings previously werent a big part of the thin client sales pitch in the past the barebones machines were attractive because they helped cut costs of buying and managing back room servers not because they used less power but officials of sun santa clara calif say that customers in the u s and europe are now citing the need to save on power as a major reason for replacing their fleets of pcs with thin clients suns thin clients typically consume less than half of the electricity a pc does says david douglas suns vice president of eco responsibility pcs usually consume to watts of electricity at any one time sun officials say other computer manufacturers are also paying heed to the power problem in client pitches hewlett packard co officials say they play up how they embarked on a streamlining plan in to lower the companys own it power costs by to over three years this is being done largely by consolidating its number of servers and data centers "we describe to corporate enterprises what we are doing" and then say "here is what we think we can do for you " says mark hurd chief executive of the palo alto calif company other pc giants are incorporating energy saving features in their product designs chip giant intel corp in august unveiled a series of dual core intel xeon microprocessors for servers that the company said offered "nearly three times better performance per watt" over previous intel xeon chips rival advanced micro devices inc contends its line of server chips is even more energy efficient meanwhile via technologies inc an intel clone maker in taiwan says some of its chips for pcs can cut power consumption on a desktop by as much as microsoft meanwhile has included an enhanced "sleep" feature in its new windows vista operating system that is aimed at helping companies and individual users cut their power bills past windows versions had a standby mode that wouldnt allow the computer to power down nearly as much older windows versions also took four steps to activate standby versus one to put vista to sleep pcs draw as much as watts of power even when they arent in use compared with as little as three or four in sleep mode the vista design has garnered support from one unlikely corner environmentalists who have long scolded the computer industry for being wasteful "the bottom line is we need to make sure computers go to sleep when people are sleeping " says noah horowitz a senior scientist at the natural resources defense council which gave microsoft input on vista
