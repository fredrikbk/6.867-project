regulators may hold sway over endesa as e on raises bid the takeover battle for spanish electricity giant endesa sa is escalating as rivals float ever higher offers but regulators politicians and lawyers not shareholders are likely to hold the keys to the winning bid for a big chunk of europes energy market german utility e on ag yesterday raised its tender offer for endesa to euros a share or billion euros &# billion up from its offer of euros a share in early february the move marks the third time it has raised the ante since launching a billion euro bid just more than a year ago in an effort to extend its geographical reach into southern europe and south america e ons revised bid was a response to the growing threat by italian utility enel spa and spanish conglomerate acciona sa the italian spanish tandem immediately released a statement yesterday saying the companies would announce a joint bid of at least euros a share if e ons tender offer fails valuing endesa at billion euros in recent weeks the companies have been building up large minority stakes in endesa and said friday that they had teamed up to work on a potential counterbid what is unclear is whether enel and acciona can even launch a formal takeover offer in accordance with spanish takeover rules spains stock market watchdog said friday that enel and acciona couldnt launch a bid for at least six months it reaffirmed that decision after midnight in spain that gives e on another chance to convince endesa shareholders to accept its revised offer even though nearly of shareholders are likely to oppose its bid because no bid from enel and acciona could come before this autumn yet just as the countrys market watchdog has been under the spotlight spains entire regulatory landscape could be called into question the spanish government is reviewing its takeover laws and could approve a whole new set of statutes as early as this week it is unclear what effect that could have on the outcome shares in endesa rose to euros in madrid on the latest developments as confused investors seemed to agree on one thing the battle is far from over "i dont think the last word has been spoken and there probably will be lots more surprising developments " said theo kitz a utilities analyst at the private bank merck finck &amp co in munich germany the battle for endesa started in september with a hostile billion euro bid by spains gas natural sdg sa since then it has followed a path of twists and turns the latest happened last month when just as it seemed e on was headed for victory italys enel joined the fray announcing it had snapped up nearly of endesas shares and secured options on another together enels new holdings and accionas stake could make it all but impossible for e on to secure majority control through its all cash tender offer which has been extended to april in europe and april in new york still e ons chances improved late yesterday when spanish savings bank caja madrid said it would sell its stake to the german company a heavy dose of politics has accompanied the tortuous takeover battle since the start spains government has tried several times to hamper e ons attempted takeover of spains largest utility it rewrote laws and slapped onerous conditions on the german power giant last year as it searched for a "spanish solution " yet with its new euros a share bid e ons offer which was recommended by endesas board yesterday is the only formal takeover bid standing for the spanish electricity company endesa declined to comment on the prospect of a joint enel acciona offer regulators and analysts say the recent efforts of enel and acciona smack of further political interference a charge denied by both the spanish and italian governments according to the terms of the joint offer for endesa unveiled yesterday madrid based acciona would control endesas proposed holding company even though it is much smaller than enel and likely would hold a smaller equity stake in endesa than its italian partner the disparity highlights the risks enel which is owned by the italian government is willing to take to enter europes longest running takeover battle as it tries to use its financial war chest of some billion euros the regulatory problems around enel and acciona are partly the result of possible lawsuits that e on has threatened to launch the german company has publicly accused the two companies of breaching spanish tender offer rules and of making misleading disclosures of their takeover plans to u s securities regulators dusseldorf based e on already has filed a lawsuit against acciona in a new york court as europes biggest utility by revenue e on has more money at its disposal than enel to expand on the continent but e on also risks overpaying for endesa after many of its shareholders lobbied management in recent months to keep the takeover bid below euros a share german bank westlb cautioned yesterday that even an offer of euros a share might not be enough to win the support of acciona and help the german company secure a stake in addition to enel and accionas combined stake of a spanish state holding company owns of endesa
