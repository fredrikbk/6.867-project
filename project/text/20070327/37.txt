exploring hugo wolfs canon with a top guide wolfiade the songs of hugo wolf featuring baritone wolfgang holzmair carnegie hall tonight march and april new york hugo wolf is the composer everyone who loves the german art song knows of but few know in depth a wolf group in a mixed program a half dozen items say signals sophisticated artistic intent but in their secret hearts even quite serious aficionados may quail a little at the prospect of a full evening no one disputes wolfs mercurial mastery of mood and descriptive detail but where please are the tunes the same question has often been asked about stephen sondheim "wolf is for connoisseurs and a hell of a lot of those connoisseurs are in new york " says the austrian baritone wolfgang holzmair grand master of german song "the melody in wolf comes from the melody of the words " an observation also applicable to mr sondheim bearing in mind that in mr sondheims case the words are his own "but of the people who come to my recitals to percent already know that the rest are curious and eager to explore its rare to find a public as knowledgeable as in new york except maybe in london at the wigmore hall " four years ago at weill hall the seat jewel box upstairs at carnegie hall mr holzmair proved his point with a wolf program that sang all evening turns out that was the teaser now its time for total immersion three wolf recitals again at weill plus a series of master classes all under the umbrella title "wolfiade " offstage as well as on theres an innate theatricality about mr holzmair and a touch of the schoolmaster in build hes a long drink of water tall long limbed and lean his piercing eyes and foxy features under a shock of dark hair arrange themselves easily into a thousand sharply defined expressions which shift constantly yet read as clearly as the caricatures of daumier a likeness reinforced by his angular body language and the free play of his tapered fingers for his recital four years ago mr holzmair selected wolfs settings of verse by eduard moerike a romantic ironist of the deepest dye these make up the most popular corner of the wolf repertoire his poet for the opening concert of the wolfiade is goethe supreme among germanys men of letters march a rare complete performance of the collection "italienisches liederbuch" italian songbook follows on march the finale on april consists of the still less familiar "spanisches liederbuch" spanish songbook also complete hermine haselboeck an austrian mezzo soprano whose piquant wit and delicate emotional shadings complement mr holzmairs own shares the stage for all three programs the rising american soprano susanna phillips joins them in the "spanisches liederbuch " the pianist is russell ryan as in mr holzmair is appearing under the aegis of the austrian cultural forum which not only organizes what may well be the most challenging vocal series in town but also presents its entire calendar of events free of charge usually however concerts take place at east nd st the sliver of prime manhattan real estate acf calls home a creation of the architect raimund abraham the acf building opened in to loud huzzahs from the architecture

multimedia commissions he has considered the inexhaustible song cycles of franz schubert fair game as well likewise the scintillating johann hoven whose forgotten songs a full evenings worth make up the program for june repeated june just now though the spotlight is on wolf pronounced "volf " to rhyme with "golf" the pun works in german too as the school aged cub hugo a lone wolf indeed well knew few encouraged him as he went forward many discouraged him and he made many enemies irascible chronically bitter miserably unhappy he wanted nothing more than to learn to "howl" his word in his own voice given his allegiance to mozart schubert and schumann it wasnt easy he idolized wagner too but knew better than to imitate him wagnerian drama takes up to six hours to run its course quadruple for the "ring" cycle wolfs songs clock in at under one minute to eight minutes with a median duration of about minutes and seconds yet in the intricacy of his harmonies and his sensitivity to language wolf was wagners true disciple equally he was an heir of schubert a sociable fellow whose life and career nevertheless foreshadowed wolfs in some striking ways like schubert wolf dreamed of glory in opera but found immortality in song schubert of course left a great legacy in purely instrumental music as well from piano sonatas and chamber music to symphonies forms in which wolf produced little and less that has lasted both died of syphilis schubert at the pitifully young age of wolf at at least schubert was spared the dementia that descended on wolf around rendering his last six years a living hell inevitably some listeners try to view wolfs art through the keyhole of his biography mr holzmair does not recommend it "maybe you hear his personal story here and there " he says "in the songs of mignon and the harp player the famous characters in goethes wilhelm meister novels theres something ill call a seelenqual landschaft a landscape of spiritual anguish i cant imagine that this music could flow from someone who wasnt predisposed to feel such pain " fortunately a great deal of wolf is more cheerful animated humorous even sexy qualities mr holzmair brings out with ease his skills as a miniaturist aside he also keeps an eye on the big picture not hesitating to rearrange wolfs great italian and spanish anthologies to improve pacing and bring out stories "to sing the italian songbook straight through is boring " mr holzmair says "you need to hear the singers quarrel and make up to see how they fall in love to experience love with them and to see how love itself becomes something to fight about or a joke " the "spanish songbook" presents an even greater structural problem "as published it opens with a block of sacred songs shot through with catholic mysticism that is very hard to decipher the songs are exquisite but theyre not what an audience is ready to hear when they walk in off the street " so mr holzmair has devised a triptych framing the sacred group with extended sequences of secular songs before and after for the master classes in the theater at acf with six young artists from the leading new york conservatories the juilliard school mannes college and the manhattan school of music mr holzmair will turn his attention to the two other principal chapters of the wolf catalog settings of joseph von eichendorff principally in the nature of character sketches and again settings of moerike the material with which in a sense the entire project began after two days of intensive coaching mr holzmairs charges will present themselves in recital at afc on april "this way our wolfiade adds up to a comprehensive survey of the wolf canon " mr holzmair says "and it makes me happy to be passing on some of what ive learned to a new generation who want to carry the tradition forward " mr gurewitsch writes for the journal on culture and philanthropy
