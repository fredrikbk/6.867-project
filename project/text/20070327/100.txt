small bsuiness enterprise a way to fight big rivals play up style and service when samsung went searching for a u s retail partner to showcase one of its two specially made inch &# plasma tvs it didnt tap any of the big national names like best buy co or circuit city stores inc instead it picked a family business with a single suburban chicago store abt electronics same with danish sound snob bang &amp olufsen which last week began installing its latest store design concept at abt seeking customer feedback before taking the layout national "basically abt is an anomaly " says robert schaffner a samsung electronics co district sales manager who deals with abt "there is no other store like it in the country " in the cutthroat world of rock bottom priced electronics and appliances abt takes a different approach positioning itself as the "bellagio" of retail a nod to the lavish las vegas resort it displays many wares in walled off boutiques within abts larger confines which include an atrium featuring a gallon aquarium a fountain and sculptures in doing so it has managed to survive and even upstage ubiquitous rival titans using a tactic that can help small players in many categories instead of trying to beat rivals on cost it is angling to outclass and out service them as such abt which says it has sales of over &# million has become a testing ground for many manufacturers seeking early feedback on new products and marketing tactics abts trump card is layout part of its square foot showroom in glenview ill is carved up into unusual store within store pods to lure image conscious brands such as sub zero apple and viking which dont want all their goods lumped together with lower end vacuums and dishwashers abt runs the sub stores but the manufacturers help design them and often pay some of the construction and marketing costs this concept is the only reason bang &amp olufsen a s which sells its high end sound systems and video equipment in the u s almost entirely through sleek company owned stores finally decided to sell its equipment in abt "our products need space and air and they are a piece of art in the living room " says zean nielsen vice president of bang &amp olufsen north america "when out hanging next to &# screens they can get lost " abts strategy expands on a broader retail trend that has taken root in recent years as stores offer one stop shopping for consumers looking to outfit their homes although the housing market has slowed in recent months remodeling spending has been robust for several years hitting &# billion in up from a year earlier according to harvards joint center for housing studies in california a retailer with locations called pacific sales kitchen and bath centers inc takes an approach similar to abts offering everything from home entertainment to kitchen appliances and plumbing fixtures under one roof drimmers in brooklyn n y and the karls appliance stores inc chain in new jersey follow a similar strategy these stores along with home improvement giant home depot inc s expo design centers have also responded to manufacturers clamoring for better display of their products by adopting a "vignette" concept in which several of a companys products are staged in mini kitchen or living situations however abt takes it a step further than most offering a vast collection of larger walled off spaces with custom lighting and flooring that allow a manufacturer to display a wider range of items than the usual vignettes suppliers say the store within store concept on this scale is unusual for the appliance and electronics category for instance abt and sub zero freezer co spent about &# million creating a square foot section for the upscale refrigerator freezer company which also owns wolf brand stoves according to mike abt the company president representatives from sub zeros madison wisc headquarters helped oversee the project known as the "living kitchen " "our model is like the bellagio " says year old mr abt who runs the store with three brothers and his father "we have to stand out and be special or we wont get the fancy lines " its reputation precedes it last year abt sold items online to every state some of its total sales come from the web for its part sub zero marketing executives say the abt retail model allows them to better control the environment in which the companys products are displayed "having all our products scattered around a store isnt helpful " says michele bedard sub zeros vice president of marketing "if you are looking at a wolf range the warming drawer wouldnt necessarily be next to it or a consumer wouldnt necessarily walk by the sub zero wine refrigerator " a more lavish display environment also entices suppliers to test their newest creations first at abt which gives the retailer buzz and clout with consumers in coming months mr abt says panasonic will be adding its new inch plasma tv to his store he says he tried and failed to sell an in sink dishwasher called the briva by kitchenaid and had little luck hawking a whirlpool polara refrigerated oven range which can keep a roast cool until time to cook it for dinner such feedback can be invaluable to suppliers "thats a phenomenal asset to a manufacturer because you can get broad opinion work out the kinks before going to national distribution " says debra joester of the joester loria group a new york licensing and branding company that works with companies such as pepsico inc and entenmanns "there arent many retail emporiums that do this " another inducement service abt first opened in in chicagos logan square as abt radio under the leadership of mr abts grandparents the store expanded into heaters and appliances and kept growing through the s when it moved to the northern suburbs following the migration of chicago residents it changed locations several times getting bigger with each new building until the abt family finally bought the acres of land the store currently sits on to comfortably house its warehouse and offices too says mike abt "we got the biggest piece of land we could possibly find " now abt is ideally situated within easy reach of chicagos more monied north shore and western suburbs the large amount of space that abt commands also lets it be a little bit of everything to everybody in addition to its tucked away high end brands the companys main floor also carries a wide range of lower end and middle tier items abt employs sales staff who are paid salaries of around &# and up in hourly wages and bonus plus health care and access to an on premises gym they are typically barred from taking the money doled out by manufacturers to entice sales staff into hawking their brands over others instead companies pay such marketing inducements directly to abt which disperses it as it sees fit helping to "level the playing field " says mr schaffner of samsung meantime the retailer installs and services every item it sells employing a fleet of trucks custom kitchen and home theatre installation crews and a person customer service department on call to fix customer electronics glitches that is a plus with both consumers and manufacturers in an age of ever more complicated machines and gadgets the company sells to every state but only installs items and sends its service reps to customers in a two hour radius of the store including parts of indiana wisconsin and michigan with other out of state sales abt contracts with third party delivery services and will help customers arrange service via manufacturers local reps this summer abt is opening a &# million design center yards from its main store which will have additional home items such as bathroom fixtures lights and marble countertops closets in addition to a coffee sandwich and dessert store "the lure is completeness " says george rosenbaum ceo of leo j shapiro &amp associates a chicago based consumer research firm "its not going to be a wasted trip " such an array allows them to offer what mr rosenbaum dubs "no regret pricing " he says "it may not be the lowest but you can be pretty confident that youre not seriously overpaying for things " meantime less than of revenue is spent on advertising instead word of mouth referrals are the main marketing currency says mr abt "people never let you forget if their oven isnt working today "
