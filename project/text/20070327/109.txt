the case for smokeless tobacco if you want to quit smoking consider chewing to date smokers have had little guidance on how to give up cigarettes but public health officials in growing numbers are suggesting that a pinch of smokeless tobacco between the lip and gum can provide a smoker with nicotine the addictive agent in tobacco while posing a substantially reduced health risk compared with smoking and they say that if smokers are going to make the switch they should use smokeless products that are low in nitrosamines the carcinogens in smokeless tobacco but users have no way of knowing which products are low in nitrosamines because that information isnt included on labels scientific studies increasingly are distinguishing one product from another a presentation last month at the annual scientific conference of the society for research on nicotine and tobacco corroborates other recent research showing that the level of carcinogens in smokeless tobacco varies widely from brand to brand consider two brands copenhagen and revel from the same maker ust inc a gram of copenhagen one of the nations most popular brands has micrograms of nitrosamines compared with microgram in revel a relatively new brand packaged in individual pouches according to the srnt presentation given by university of minnesotas dorothy hatsukami who has no financial ties to the tobacco industry the carcinogenic level of smokeless tobacco is drawing scientific attention in part because sales of this product are growing unlike sales of cigarettes a larger reason is the debate over its use as a cigarette cessation aid low nitrosamine smokeless tobacco poses or less of the health risks of cigarettes according to various studies including a national cancer institute funded article some health officials worry that promoting snuff as a cigarette cessation aid would induce nonsmokers to take up smokeless tobacco which can be as addictive as cigarettes and smokeless tobacco isnt without risks findings from a federally funded study of over smokers published last month in the journal tobacco control showed that smokers who switched to smokeless tobacco had an higher mortality rate over years than smokers who quit tobacco altogether the study didnt compare switchers with people who kept smoking but the researchers say the differences would be significant "theres no question that switching to spit tobacco and quitting tobacco altogether are both far less lethal than continuing to smoke " says michael thun vice president of epidemiology for the american cancer society and an author of the tobacco control article the tobacco industry cautious about making any health claims for its smokeless products generally doesnt comment on scientific reports about them in sweden where use of smokeless tobacco is popular and low nitrosamine brands predominate studies have found little or no elevated risk of mouth cancer among various brands available in the u s one general conclusion is that lower levels of nitrosamines are found in smokeless tobacco packaged in pouches a pioneer of these pouches which resemble tiny tea bags is swedish match ab of sweden in dr hatsukamis study a gram of swedish matchs general snus had two micrograms of nitrosamines she found lower amounts in new pouched products from the nations largest cigarette makers a gram of taboka brand from altria groups philip morris contained micrograms while reynolds americans camel snus contained micrograms not only do pouches contain lower levels of nitrosamines but users may consume fewer overall grams because of the limited amount of tobacco in each pouch usually a gram or less low nitrosamine products arent necessarily low in nicotine so users may get an adequate fix the tobacco product with the lowest level of nitrosamines microgram per gram appears to be star scientific inc s ariva a lozenge that dissolves in the mouth final note smokeless tobacco products cost less than nicotine replacement therapies such as gum but the gums and patches remain the safest alternative to cigarettes public health officials say email healthjournal wsj com see related letters "letters to the editor where theres no smoke products theres fired up opposition" wsj july
