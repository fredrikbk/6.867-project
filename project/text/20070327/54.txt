intel may expand technology in new china plant beijing intel corp s chief executive officer said the company might expand the technology it is using in its planned &# billion chip manufacturing factory in china if the u s government allows it underscoring the technology giants ambitions in the worlds fourth biggest economy the plant which ceo paul otellini formally announced in beijing yesterday is a boon for chinas efforts to develop its technology industry the first time a semiconductor company of anywhere near intels size and technological strength has built a chip making factory in china but the plant which is slated to begin production in in the city of dalian wont initially make intels core product the microprocessors that are the brains in personal computers instead it will make chip sets which connect microprocessors to other parts of the pc and intel is expected to use manufacturing technology a generation or two behind the state of the art in dalian mr otellini said however that the factorys technological level could change if the u s government eases restrictions on the export of advanced technology goods like chip equipment "we would likely look to put into production the most advanced technology that is available under a licensing policy from the u s government at the time " the intel ceo told reporters after yesterdays announcement at a ceremony that included chinese officials as well as the u s ambassador to china mr otellini suggested the plant might eventually make intels main product "right now we are planning the plant for chip set needs " he said but "as this factory comes online in and beyond it will have multiple years of useful life and the opportunity to do other products in there is really wide open so well watch that as the market and the various government regulations evolve " the dalian plant will be a wafer fabrication facility or "fab " which puts microscopic circuits on silicon discs it will be intels first fab in a developing country intel already has factories in two chinese cities that do the less sophisticated work of packaging and testing chips the new plant will bring the companys total investment in china to close to &# billion mr otellini said analysts say an important reason to build a fab in china is to help intels image in the country which mr otellini said is now the second biggest market in the world for technology products after the u s and which could soon become the biggest the intel ceo and several chinese officials at the ceremony emphasized the new plants contribution to economic development in chinas northeast an industrial region that has struggled to retool its economy mr otellini said another main reason for building in china is to be closer to the rest of the computer supply chain intels ceo said chinas lower labor costs werent a central factor in intels decision but he said intel does expect to "try out some new technologies and new techniques in manufacturing" to reduce costs "our objective is to have this be the lowest cost wafer fab in our network " he said mr otellini said intels choice of china for the plant reflects in part the advantages of building such facilities in places that offer better financial incentives than the u s does mr otellini cited testimony he gave before a u s government panel two years ago estimating that because the u s offers less favorable tax breaks and incentives it costs &# billion more to build a fab in the u s than elsewhere he noted that of the past three plants intel has built or announced two have been outside the u s one in israel and the dalian plant while the third was an expansion at an existing facility in the u s
