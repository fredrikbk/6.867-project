the middle seat taking airline complaints to the government why it makes sense to contact the dot getting a response the department of transportation fields thousands of complaints about airlines each year but officials can do little to mandate good service or compensation for travel nightmares that doesnt mean filing complaints to the dot is a waste of time to the contrary it can pay off some airlines admit they do pay more attention to consumer complaints if travelers send them to the dot which categorizes and tallies complaints and publishes monthly rankings of airline performance the dot says it sometimes uses complaint data in enforcement actions against airlines and in rule making decisions a history of lots of complaints can work against an airline the agency also points out trends with airlines hoping to pressure change "were more than just a statistics capturing office " said a senior transportation official "airlines are very sensitive to the complaints the department receives " southwest airlines co for one says it does special reporting on complaints forwarded from the dot and a special report on dot complaints goes out to company executives "we pay huge attention to that " says jim ruppel vice president of customer relations government agencies generally dont post public scorecards on companies the federal communications commission doesnt list complaints against cellular phone companies for example only the totaled number of complaints received they outnumber airline complaints to but the airline industry is unique the dots reporting on airline performance is a holdover from the days before when carriers were regulated by the government the civil aeronautics board started publishing airline complaint data in and the dot took it over in when the cab went out of operation the dot has about people in its aviation consumer protection division who handle airline complaints the largest volume comes by email airconsumer dot gov but dot also accepts letters to its washington headquarters and calls to a voicemail where complaints can be recorded copies of every complaint are sent by dot to the airline involved so involving dot may be helpful to consumers frustrated by unresponsive airlines particularly hard to reach foreign carriers dot officials decide if the complaint falls into a category requiring government investigation lost baggage liability late refunds denied boarding on oversold flights and civil rights which include disability and discrimination issues airlines found to have violated federal rules can be fined by the dot most complaints deal with flight issues cancellations delays and missed connections last year flight issues totaled of the complaints filed with dot on the largest u s airlines baggage issues were a close second followed by customer service and reservation ticketing issues only a small percentage of travelers complain to dot last year the dot recorded fewer than one complaint for every passengers airlines say thats a sign that the vast majority of customers are satisfied though several also acknowledged that they get four or five times as many complaints directly that the dot never sees the monthly dot tallies available at http airconsumer ost dot gov reports index htm do give consumers a valuable scorecard on which airlines are doing well in customer service and which are suffering problems complaints about ual corp s united airlines nearly doubled in over when the airline ran into labor problems that disrupted schedules huge travel problems in philadelphia at the christmas travel season pushed the rate of complaints about us airways group inc up to five times its december level last year united and us airways ranked worst in complaints based up complaints filed per passenger southwest had the lowest complaint rate for the year the reality of the airline industry is that airlines frequently have to deal with bad weather and congestion both on the ground and in the sky the worse the weather or congestion gets the more complaints are filed dot says under pressure airlines disappoint passengers more frequently bags are lost lines grow long phone banks have interminable waits employees become surlier passengers get stranded customer service in the airline business often is measured by how well companies perform under pressure indeed complaints at the dot peaked in and when the airline industry was suffering service breakdowns and congestion woes not all that dissimilar to the travel problems of this winter complaints hit their high water mark in at then fell to a low of in when travel had declined considerable leaving fewer planes and fewer passengers since then as travel has rebounded so have complaints wichita state university professor dean headley who compiles an annual airline quality ranking thinks the numbers are still depressed from where they might be because people have grown accustomed to service problems "airlines promise less and deliver less " he said "not much is left to complain about unless its an extreme case " the dot thinks the decline is more a reflection of congestion easing for several years now with airports and skies getting more crowded complaints will rise officials said
