groups consider funding bird flu vaccine stockpile jakarta indonesia several organizations including the bill &amp melinda gates foundation are considering funding a stockpile of bird flu vaccine as one possible way to ensure access for people in developing countries most at risk of dying from the disease the idea of creating a global vaccine stockpile has come to the fore at a meeting that the world health organization has called here the meeting aims to bridge an impasse that emerged earlier this year after indonesias government decided to withhold sharing its samples of the avian flu virus indonesias health minister complained that sharing those samples helps foreign companies to develop vaccines that ordinary indonesians would likely never be able to afford or have access to lack of access to those samples is hampering international research on the indonesian strain of the virus and slowing the search for ways to defeat a potentially devastating illness before it mutates into a form that could easily spread among humans indonesia is among the countries hardest hit by bird flu which in most if not all cases is contracted through contact with infected birds the disease has so far killed of the people infected in indonesia since according to who who is reaching out to the gates foundation which is "extremely supportive of the general idea " says kanwarjit singh a senior program officer with the seattle based foundation funding bird flu vaccines doesnt fall under the foundations primary goals which include fighting scourges that already kill millions including aids and malaria but funding avian influenza vaccines could be a possibility because "it meets the criterion of being a vaccine solution which affects countries where the burden of disease is greatest " dr singh says he adds however that there are no specific proposals on the table yet who is also approaching the geneva based gavi alliance a nonprofit group that operates with funding from various governments and the gates foundation and that has already allocated nearly &# billion toward the purchase of various vaccines gavis board members will formally consider a proposal from who in may that lays out various options but doesnt yet specify how much money would be needed the u s has been weighing whether to contribute funding or perhaps part of its own stockpile to developing countries a u s health official said "all nations have a responsibility to share data and virus samples " u s secretary of health and human services mike leavitt said in an email that offered &# million to who to help make sure poor countries have access to vaccines a continuing standoff with indonesia could prevent newer vaccines from being developed that are more effective at hitting the most recent strains of the virus it isnt clear how large a stockpile would need to be or how much it would cost marie paule kieny director of the initiative for vaccine research at who says that vaccine makers would likely consider offering tiered pricing for poorer countries as they do with medications for aids and other diseases at the opening of this weeks meeting david heymann whos assistant director general for communicable diseases suggested that vaccine makers could agree to set aside a percentage of vaccine production for use in developing countries with guaranteed purchase from who glaxosmithkline plc and sanofi aventis sa produce versions of a bird flu vaccine that appear to be somewhat effective the u s government purchased enough of sanofis vaccine for several million people glaxosmithkline said "tiered pricing is our default mechanism for vaccines and developing world availability" and said there wouldnt be a reason to depart from that in the case of bird flu sanofi said it is "willing to contribute wherever feasible to any initiative that could help developing countries get access to a vaccine "
