review &amp outlook editorial democracy in hong kong donald tsang was re elected to hong kongs highest post sunday in a vote rigged by beijing however the real winner was hong kong democracy thanks to his challenger alan leong by standing as a candidate mr leong reignited the democratic cause and demonstrated to chinas rulers that public debate doesnt necessarily lead to instability mr tsang was re elected to a second and final term by members of hong kongs election committee a group of people either appointed by beijing or elected by a voter pool of about hong kongers thats a far cry from universal suffrage for a territory of almost seven million people even so mr leong garnered enough nominations to stand becoming the first challenger to do so a candidate must be nominated by at least members of the election committee who must publicly declare their vote since most members are beijing sympathizers or have significant business interests in the mainland it was always unlikely that a challenger would pass that mark mr leong won during the campaign he called repeatedly for universal suffrage given the communist partys paranoia about loosening its grip on power thats unlikely to happen soon what could emerge is a form of "managed suffrage " where beijing picks a clutch of candidates and then allows hong kongers to choose among them most hong kong democrats oppose this idea the outcome however could be the same once beijing starts allowing more democratic participation and hong kongers get a taste of it the movement will be hard to stop it remains to be seen how far mr tsang will push for universal suffrage now that hes safely back in office without a democratic mandate his predecessor tung chee hwa hung close to beijing and did little to protect basic hong kong freedoms mr tsang has been better on that score but he certainly hasnt proved himself a strong advocate for democracy meanwhile beijings attitude seems to be hardening the head of chinas parliament wu bangguo told the ta kung pao newspaper earlier this month that "some things cannot be challenged the center has authority over the political system it is not the authority of the special administrative region hong kong " cheng siwei a vice chairman of the national peoples congress standing committee told the south china morning post that hong kong should "stop messing around" with politics the scmp reported that hong kongs representative to that body tsang hin chi said he "totally agreed" with those remarks what chinas communist elites and hong kongs china sympathizers miss is that democratic reform in hong kong and china is the only way to defuse rising tensions in both places in hong kong where the electorate is highly sophisticated farcical elections will eventually lead to protest in china land seizures party corruption and human rights violations are stirring social resentments that sometimes erupt into public demonstrations allowing citizens to throw out the bums would go a long way toward alleviating those tensions while we wouldnt agree with much of mr leongs policy platform which leans toward government intervention in the economy he deserves credit for bringing democracy back into the public debate in hong kong its the crucial question for the territorys future and for chinas
