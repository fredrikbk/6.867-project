companies tolerate ads to get free software conventional wisdom said firms would resist bargain consumers have long made businesses are warming to the proposition that they should take a dose of advertising with their software to cut costs consumers have been doing it for years using free online software services like yahoo inc s email site or mapquest inc s maps and in exchange putting up with the ads that run alongside conventional wisdom had it that corporate users werent willing to see ads in their online software but "free" is beginning to prove a powerful draw for some technology managers who have decided to run business tasks like word processing and network management on free web based services that come with ads one such manager is jon chorney a systems administrator at the wilmington del accounting firm of master sidlow &amp associates mr chorney last year needed a new way to monitor his small firms computers to keep clients sensitive financial information from leaking out the problem much of the conventional software programs that would run on in house computers was costly and geared more toward large companies with big technology staffs like many small businesses master sidlow doesnt have a big budget for tech purchases the firm spent about &# last year but that fluctuates from year to year last summer mr chorney read about a service from spiceworks inc a start up in austin texas that he could use free of charge to keep track of the software and hardware on his network the catch spiceworks would show him ads while he was using it no problem mr chorney decided he now uses spiceworks several times a day to track network activity including employees downloads of illicit software and when printers signal they have run out of toner he says he has saved the &# to &# he would have had to pay for equivalent packaged software plus any running costs to maintain and support it "heres a lot of information very easily presented and it didnt cost me anything " he says for now mostly smaller businesses are experimenting with the free services jim rodriguez chief executive officer of a small health care group in san francisco recently began using a free online software service from san francisco based practice fusion inc to process insurance claims from doctors he hopes to eventually replace a pc based system that required his employees to input details by hand from paper claims forms practice fusion plans to begin showing health care related ads to its users soon through a deal with google inc "i think the ads will be helpful especially if theyre specific to the industry " mr rodriguez says the market for ad supported software is still small but it has drawn some big guns google and microsoft corp each offer free and paid versions of their online software services respectively called google apps and office live which businesses can use for tasks like making web pages using email and managing calendars google and microsoft offer free versions of their services that show ads to users googles ads appear only in the email service while microsofts ads appear alongside other online services users of both companies paid versions dont see ads at all and get extra features like more storage and ramped up support google says its apps service has more than organizations on its free and paid versions microsoft says more than organizations are using office live business users say the ads have sometimes proved useful wes henrikson a technical administrator who uses the free spiceworks at the mesa ariz law firm of udall shumway &amp lyons recently clicked on an ad for antivirus software from panda software international and says panda is now on his shortlist of programs to replace his current antivirus software mr chorney the accounting firm tech administrator says he clicked on an ad in spiceworks that would let employees make web based voice calls "if it piques my curiosity and accrues to the benefit of spiceworks id rather go through this program than through something like google " he says "its the only way i can really pay them back " on the other hand people who use free online software at larger companies often say theyre willing to pay to turn off the ads sean kearney a time warner cable inc human resources director in denver uses a free online word processing service from thinkfree inc to avoid carrying his laptop everywhere thinkfree makes money by skimming the text of documents posted in a public area of the site and showing small text ads that it guesses are relevant based on the documents "theyre not big obtrusive ads like a clown doing a back flip or anything " mr kearney says still when he told his it department about thinkfrees approach people there worried about the privacy implications of a service that scans users documents though they also saw the appeal of the service to alleviate their fears mr kearney plans to sign up for a premium version being introduced in april that will let users turn off the ads and it will offer extra features like the ability to save data on local pcs not just online adventnet inc a pleasanton calif start up that offers free online business services at zoho com plans a similar approach by the end of the second quarter it will offer one free ad supported version currently the free version has no ads and another ramped up paid version says ceo sridhar vembu the difference between mr chorney of the small accounting firm and mr kearney of time warner cable is an important one for the companies that sell such services "its been a question for everybody including google " says dave girouard general manager for googles enterprise business "is there a market for ad supported software and if so who will use it and who wont " aner ravon co founder of a tel aviv technology start up called syncho ltd recently discovered that free doesnt always mean easy when it comes to software his employees are scattered from india to the czech republic and syncho cant afford costly software from microsoft for synchronizing calendars and collaborating on projects so mr ravon signed up early this month for the free version of google apps "it wasnt free of challenges " he says first he didnt understand how to set up synchos computer network to use google apps so he sent an email to googles help desk it took a few days for him to receive an automated email back which didnt help he wrote again asking for help from a real person three days later he finally got a reply from someone who gave him detailed instructions the google apps product manager rajen sheth says that "google constantly seeks to improve the user experience for all our products " including the sign up process mr ravon had trouble with "we also continue to scale the support to meet the needs of all our customers " he says mr ravon says he now has google apps up and running aside from the start up problems he deems the service "awesome "
