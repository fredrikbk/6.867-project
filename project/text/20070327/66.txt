little sweaty fist "this is very easy to understand " said russian president vladimir putin last year explaining his idea of an energy policy "just think back to childhood when you go into the street with a sweet in your hand and another kid says give it to me and you clutch your little sweaty fist tight around it and say what do i get then " so why when it comes to the iranian nuclear file has mr putin finally opened his little sweaty fist signing on with no apparent compensations to additional u n sanctions on the islamic republic while calling a halt to russias construction of the nuclear reactor at bushehr thats the &# question to which nobody seems to have anything better than a partial answer nearly from day one of his presidency mr putin has been irans best friend at the u n and not so coincidentally the leading supplier of its advanced conventional weapons in the kremlin tore up the so called chernomyrdin agreement a secret protocol negotiated by then vice president al gore in which russia pledged to stop selling arms to iran within five years in deputy foreign minister vyacheslav trubnikov went out of his way to state that "russia does not accept president george w bushs view that iran is part of an axis of evil " since then russia has openly supplied iran with sophisticated surface to air missiles there are reliable reports that russia has also assisted iran covertly with its ballistic missile technology the bushehr deal itself valued at &# billion was intended as just the first of five planned reactors worth &# billion russian diplomats have diluted to near insignificance the sanctions imposed so far by the u n in january russian security council secretary igor ivanov paid a call on irans supreme leader ali khamenei it seems the meeting went well "the islamic republic " said the ayatollah "welcomes all out promotion of relations with russia believing the capacity for expansion between the two sides is higher than expected " and then on march iranian european and u s sources reported that russia had informed iran that it would not supply the reactor with the uranium it needs to function unless iran complied with u n resolutions calling on it to suspend its enrichment program and citing a payment dispute the russians also began pulling some of their personnel from the site while officially claiming it was a routine staff rotation at the security council u s diplomatic sources confirmed that russia had been remarkably cooperative in negotiating saturdays unanimous resolution on iran going so far as to blunt an attempt by some of the nonpermanent members to insert language calling for a nuclear free middle east code for disarming israel what gives past experience suggests the answer may yet turn out to be not much at all at the g summit in evian france mr putin reportedly assured other leaders that russia would not supply the iranians with nuclear fuel unless they agreed to snap u n inspections of their nuclear facilities a later "clarification" from russias atomic energy minister indicated that russia would provide the fuel no matter what iran chose to do about the inspections similarly vitaly churkin russias ambassador to the u n has recently insisted that "there has been no russian ultimatum to iran of any kind " while adding that the deal with the iranians "was on track " put simply the easily resolved payment dispute may be all the "fire" there is here and not smoke to cover a sweeping change in russian policy for their part u s diplomats are sticking to their story that the russian iranian split is real as do the iranians who in the last week have publicly accused russia of being an "unreliable partner" practicing "double standard stances " the words are carefully chosen as victor yasmann of radio free europe writes "russia cares about its commercial supplier and in preserving its political reputation within the islamic world " thats especially the case now that russias once failing military exporters are doing a thriving business selling bottom of the shelf weapons to syria libya venezuela yemen algeria and other bottom of the shelf states if russia is seen to succumb to international pressure on iran other dubious regimes may be less inclined to attach themselves to it as clients yet another reading of events suggests the mixed signals coming from russia reflect policy schizophrenia within the kremlin itself "there is clearly an active pro iranian lobby in moscow " says pavel felgenhauer defense correspondent for novaya gazeta he adds however that moscows change of policy is "the result of an assessment that a nuclear iran is a major danger to russia and its national interests " among other indicators mr felgenhauer points to russias naval buildup in the oil and gas rich caspian sea the russian leadership may also have started to notice that it is increasingly in bad odor with a west that at some level it longs to be considered a part of "there is a compact pro western group who think that cooperation with the major industrial states primarily the united states could benefit russia much more than murky dealings with questionable partners like china iran iraq or libya " writes former russian diplomat victor mizin in a perceptive analysis in the middle east review of international affairs finally there is the "little sweaty fist" hypothesis critics of the putin government were dismayed last year when the bush administration agreed to russian membership in the world trade organization apparently for nothing in return the bushehr volte face may be the delayed and disguised payoff alternatively russia may expect that its sudden pliancy on the iranian file may yield dividends on the things it cares about most particularly in what it considers its rightful sphere of influence in a recent los angeles times op ed that may have also served as a trial balloon the nixon centers dimitri simes proposes two prospective giveaways the breakaway georgian "republics" of abkhazia and south ossetia which mr putin has long regarded as rightfully russian and the looming question of kosovos independence to which russia is vehemently opposed in the meantime the kremlin preserves all its options a reminder as glen howard of the jamestown foundation observes of an old kgb maxim first create a problem and then offer to be part of the solution on that score at least mr putin is nothing if not true to type
