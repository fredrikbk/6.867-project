rutgers played top ranked duke and lost by points perhaps one of the most humiliating defeats stringer had suffered in three decades three days ago when duke star lindsey harding missed two free throws with a tenth of a second left the scarlet knights had a victory over a team that had lost just once in tries all season the biggest upset in either tournament mens or womens this march " arizona states loss on the doorstep of the final four devastated the players "if you have been paying attention you know the great thing about womens basketball is the players dont posture whine or moan to officials during the game " dan bickley writes in the arizona republic "bad thing is they do a lot of crying afterward and the scene in asus locker room was positively heartbreaking " tonight
