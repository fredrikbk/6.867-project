goldmans green streak is questioned as two investors seek focus on profit donation of tract to chilean preserve is called wasteful goldman sachs group inc has developed a reputation for being wall streets most environmentally friendly investment bank two gadfly shareholders plan to put that reputation in the spotlight at the securities firms annual meeting today by complaining that one of its grand environmental good deeds donating land for a nature preserve in chile is a waste of money whether that one was a waste or not goldmans green gestures are driven by a love of greenbacks goldman bought horizon wind energy an alternative energy company two years ago for less than &# billion now after the company spent a few hundred million dollars developing new wind farms goldman is expected to sell it for as much as &# billion according to sparkspread com a web site that tracks energy deals goldman also made money helping to structure the proposed &# billion buyout of the utility company txu corp in a way that lowered its future greenhouse gas emissions goldman also is a player in the buying and selling of permits to emit carbon dioxide in a trading market designed to create incentives to reduce pollution and global warming the value of its minority stake in climate exchange plc which operates a u s marketplace for voluntary carbon emissions trading has roughly tripled on londons aim stock market since goldman invested in september there are "huge profit opportunities" in environmental business endeavors says andrew king an associate professor of business administration at dartmouth colleges tuck school of business wall street firms routinely get pressured to stop funding business activities that harm the environment last month the advocacy group rainforest action network demonstrated outside several merrill lynch &amp co offices to protest the firms involvement in raising &# billion for txu for a planned group of new coal fired power plants in texas much of the plan was later scotched merrill says the protestors concerns would have been better addressed to texas state officials who had the authority to veto the deal separately the firm says it has taken steps including purchasing credits to offset its carbon emissions not everything goldman does is environmentally savvy either the firm makes billions as an owner and a banker in an industry often targeted by green lobbyists power generation plants goldman owns full or partial stakes in plants around the u s that emit millions of tons of gases thought to cause global warming some burn coal one of the worst polluting fuels the plants bring in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue goldman also trades some of their electricity output on its commodities desk "the reality right now is the economy runs on fossil fuels so it would be hard to find a major financial institution that wouldnt have some investment in the energy sector " says glenn prickett senior vice president for business and government relations at conservation international an environmental organization in arlington va goldman spokesman lucas van praag adds "electricity is an essential part of life " goldmans green push started during the tenure of henry paulson jr chairman and chief executive of the company before his departure last june to become treasury secretary the firm has burnished its environmental credentials in big and small ways it uses a private car service with hybrid vehicles for its new york city employees it has invested at least &# billion in alternative energy in it was the lead investor in an equity financing effort for sunedison llc a company based in baltimore md that sells solar energy to institutions the firm also has expanded into stock research that looks for investment opportunities in areas like alternative energy in addition to tracking companies environmental records the purchase of acres of sub antarctic land on chiles southern tip an area known as tierra del fuego was one of goldmans most high profile green moves the firm ended up with the title on the land as part of a package of defaulted mortgages it bought in rather than allowing the land to be logged goldman donated it to the wildlife conservation society goldman took a &# million tax deduction for the donation says someone familiar with the matter goldman wont say what it paid for the land the donation has become the hobbyhorse of steve milloy who runs a money management company called the free enterprise action fund with &# million under management mr milloy uses the often small stakes he owns in companies to push his agenda he owns a web site called junkscience com that disputes the rationale behind global warming mr milloy argues that the donation was a questionable use of shareholder money he says goldman could have generated &# million a year by logging the land while fulfilling its commitment to the environment by replanting trees along the way goldman executives contend replanting would be environmentally harmful by replacing some of south americas oldest trees with rapid growth pine mr milloy has asked shareholders to vote to force the firm to review whether its green projects will benefit the environment over the long term goldmans board has recommended shareholders vote down his request and a similar one from the national legal and policy center a government and corporate watchdog group that also has a small stake in goldman the center believes charitable donations like the chile grant squander corporate assets "from a social and a business perspective our environmental policy makes sense " says mr van praag the goldman spokesman
