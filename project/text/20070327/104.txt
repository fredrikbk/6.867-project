strategy including plans to reopen its web site sell or franchise most of its overseas stores and open a proprietary publishing operation while most analysts say the turnaround plan is a step in the right direction others say the environment for booksellers is so competitive that a change in strategy may not be enough to boost shares borders fell tuesday to close at &# on the new york stock

overall borders aims to restore a to operating margin by from in book deal borders has been the subject of deal rumors ever since activist investor william ackman who runs hedge fund pershing square capital management disclosed an stake in the company last fall sending shares up nearly nancy hoch of jpmorgan chase notes that mr ackmans move "could be an indication that an ownership or asset change is on the horizon" for borders david magee of suntrust robinson humphrey says "a deal might make sense as evidenced by turnaround opportunities and high debt levels " mr ackman also disclosed an stake in shares of competitor barnes &amp noble goldman sachs analyst matthew fassler doesnt see a buyout on the horizon but he thinks a merger could be feasible "particularly as borders has decided to shed non core businesses " he says though such a deal would face serious antitrust hurdles borders hasnt commented on deal or takeover speculation logging on borders plans to reopen its own branded web site early in and build its own e commerce business rather than continue partnering with amazon com in a deal reached in borders agreed to give up revenue from book sales done through amazon except for a commission aside from the benefit of added revenue borders will be able to drive traffic by allowing members of the bookstores loyalty program to use their discounts online something that competitor barnes &amp noble already takes advantage of goldmans mr fassler thinks reclaiming the online business from amazon "makes good sense " analyst donald trott of jefferies &amp co thinks borderss new management "understands the importance of having its own online presence " recognizing that avid book buyers make purchases in stores and online and must be courted in both places and credit suisses gary balter estimates that site "should be dilutive in but we could expect breakeven in and upside from there " the bear case bad read the climate for booksellers continues to get more challenging and that hurts the likelihood of a successful turnaround says suntrusts mr magee referring to such problems as sluggish reading trends inroads made by used booksellers and increased competition the retail book business hasnt shown any growth in recent years as other leisure activities besides reading increasingly eat up peoples free time as a result booksellers have resorted to intense price competition to attract buyers says mr trott of jefferies &amp co deutsche bank points out that in december year over year sales at domestic bookstores were up about where as in december of last year they had fallen and had been negative for seven months running "longer term we see an ultra competitive landscape offering razor thin margins on books and music " writes

business "we continue on the sidelines " he says jp morgans ms hoch writes that wall street may have already priced in a successful turnaround to borderss shares "we think the stock could tread water here for some time " says ms hoch slow gains analysts warn borders isnt a short term turnaround story credit suisses mr balter has "low" expectations for the near term given heavy investments such as its web site weak industry trends and price wars "the next to months will probably be a "wait and see" period " writes suntrusts mr magee as investors watch to see if the new strategy shows results "frankly management has put a lot on its plate " with investments near term and payoff longer term " writes deutsches mr weiner jp morgans ms hoch says with near term performance so much in question
