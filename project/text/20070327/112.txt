business day sign up for the e mail here secretary of state condoleezza rice today pledged a new round of shuttle diplomacy in the middle east of the kind once anathema to the bush administration after days of meeting in egypt jordan jerusalem and the west bank and after canceling a news conference last night to give israeli and palestinian leaders more time to haggle ms rice today said that president mahmoud abbas and prime minister ehud olmert would hold biweekly meetings unable to make headway on more substantial issues at a time when hamas still leads the palestinians coalition government the two leaders will discuss day to day management of border crossings the prevention of arms smuggling and the movement of palestinians from the occupied territories into israel where they can work she said they will also "discuss the development of a political horizon consistent with the establishment of a palestinian state in accordance with the road map " ms rice added though the moribund "road map" plan was all about political timetables that now seem rooted in a different middle east and ms rice said she "will meet with the prime minister and the president periodically sometimes separately sometimes together in whatever form will be most effective to accelerate progress " that undertaking marks a clear break with the diplomatic philosophy president bush expressed when he first came to office and revoked the peace proposals of president clinton mr bush had vowed not to push either side too hard for peace and suggested there was no sense in talking unless the violence had already stopped in pursuing the "road map" with european russian and united nations support mr bush remained disinclined to press then israeli prime minister ariel sharon and in many ways left palestinian cooperation up to the late yasser arafat and then prime minister abbas with messrs sharon and arafat now gone from the scene with mr olmert politically weakened by last summers conflict in lebanon and with the u s hand in the region significantly weaker as the war in iraq rages on the bush administration is now showing a greater willingness to talk the white house has shown a similar readiness to reverse opposition to talks with north korea and a conditional offer of talks with iran remains on the table even as tehrans standoff with the international community heats up ms rice expressed faith in mr abbass sincerity and said that while the lack of repentance from hamas makes "the work of peace more complex " there is a "path that we can and should pursue now " the olmert abbas talks will build confidence she said and "the american role will include helping them to overcome obstacles develop new ideas and rally international support for their efforts " most prominent among that potential international support is the revival of a saudi arabian initiative first made in king abdullah then suggested that arab countries offer to recognize israel in exchange for an israeli withdrawal to its borders but among other obstacles the right of palestinians to return to ancestral homes within israel was included and this has long been a nonstarter for israel still as the washington post reports arab foreign ministers meeting ahead of a summit in riyadh have agreed to relaunch the abdullah initiative and saudi foreign minister saud al faisal speaking to reporters expressed hope it would become "a basis and a major reference point for peace in the middle east " the first new guilty plea at guantanamo david hicks the year old former australian kangaroo skinner captured by u s forces in afghanistan and long detained at guantanamo bay pleaded guilty late last night to one count of supporting a terrorist organisation the plea came at a specially convened hearing of a military commission after his sole remaining defense attorney two were disqualified earlier in the day apparently reached a deal with the prosecution the sydney morning herald reports after the material support for terrorism charge was split in two mr hicks pleaded guilty to a charge that "detailed hickss links to terrorist organizations and his activities in afghanistan where he met osama bin laden and completed al qaeda training courses " the morning herald says he pleaded not guilty to the second charge of entering afghanistan with the specific intention of providing support to terrorism and fighting against the u s and its allies his plea prompted speculation that he could soon return to australia where his detention has been a politically touchy issue for prime minister john howard a close ally of president bush "australian democrats and greens today condemned the ejection of hickss lawyers saying it was further evidence of the the judicial process being rigged" and a "kangaroo court" that makes its own rules the morning herald reports mr hickss plea "was the first under a new military commission law passed by congress in the fall after the supreme court struck down the bush administrations first system for trying inmates at guantanamo " the new york times notes and it "is sure to be seen by administration supporters as an affirmation of its efforts to detain and try terrorism suspects here although the governments detention policies still face significant legal and political challenges " a gonzales aide pleads the fifth justice department lawyer monica goodling a white house liaison for attorney general alberto gonzales currently on a leave of absence said yesterday that she would invoke her fifth amendment right to refuse testimony before the congressional investigation of the firings of eight u s attorneys "emails released last week by the department of justice show ms goodling was a central figure in long running internal discussions about the dismissals " the wall street journal notes meanwhile a new usa today gallup poll indicates americans "overwhelmingly support" the congressional investigation and "say president bush and his aides should answer questions about it without invoking executive privilege " usa today reports "respondents said by nearly to that congress should issue subpoenas to force white house officials to testify " and on a broader investigative front rep henry a waxman democratic chairman of the oversight and government reform committee told the republican national committee and the bush cheney campaign "to retain copies of all e mails sent or received by white house officials using e mail accounts under their control raising the political stakes in the congressional inquiry into u s attorneys firings " the washington post reports mr waxman "said his broadly written request was based on evidence that white house officials particularly aides to top political adviser karl rove have used their politically related e mail accounts to hide the conduct of official business regarding the prosecutor firings and other matters being investigated by congress " letting china handle logistics long the factory floor of many a manufacturing industry in japan the u s and europe china is also increasingly becoming a logistics center for retailers and consumer goods companies in the developed world the financial times reports "goods are sorted labeled and even placed in displays for direct shipment to individual stores before leaving chinese ports " the ft says "shipping lines logistics companies and warehouse operators say costs spur customers to move the sorting process away from consuming countries continuing the outsourcing trend to lower wage economies that began with manufacturing going to china " using a playstation to fight disease its a video game consol no its a supercomputer no its sort of both since sonys playstation went on sale in

university research project the times of london reports "the folding home scheme is an example of distributed computing whereby thousands of idle computer processors are harnessed via the internet to build simulations that otherwise would take much longer to calculate " the times notes the stanford project is aimed at unraveling how proteins fold themselves in the human body work that could unveil the origins of cancer alzheimers parkinsons and other diseases until the playstation joined the fight only odd pcs were involved generating about teraflops of computing power the times says the top supercomputers have about teraflops once the pss joined the effort the times says "that figure soared to about teraflops and now the games consoles account for per cent of the total computing power of the stanford project " also of note washington post unwilling to do the white houses heavy lifting on iraq senate republicans are prepared to step aside to allow language requiring troop withdrawals
