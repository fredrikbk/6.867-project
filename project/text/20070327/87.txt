politics &amp economics msrp case seems to split justices rule barring manufacturers from dictating prices to retailers is challenged washington hearing arguments in a case about retail prices the supreme courts justices seemed divided over whether to overturn a year old antitrust ruling intended to promote competition in yesterdays case leegin creative leather products of industry calif challenged the ruling which prohibits manufacturers from requiring retailers to sell their products for a set minimum price a texas federal district court cited the precedent in tossing out the "resale price maintenance" policy leegin had imposed on kays kloset a dallas area boutique kays kloset owned by psks inc brought the suit so it could sell leegins brighton line of womens accessories at a discount leegins attorney theodore olson argued in briefs that discount prices "degrade" the brighton brand and yesterday he said forcing retailers to charge higher prices could benefit consumers by helping ensure the stores would have enough money to provide attractive services to shoppers justice antonin scalia agreed if the set prices give "the consumer a choice of more service at a somewhat higher price that would enhance consumer welfare so long as there are competitive products at a lower price " he said later he said overturning the precedent could solve the "free rider problem " when "customers shop at the place that has the big showroom" to learn about a product but then buy it at a lower price from somebody else who has not incurred that expense " the precedent known as dr miles for the manufacturer that sought to fix retail prices of its patent medicines helped shape the th century marketplace it gave rise to the "manufacturers suggested retail price " or msrp and circulars declaring that a retailers price was too low to advertise because manufacturers remained free to restrict retailers from advertising their products below a particular minimum in the internet era the rule may have helped fuel occasional price wars among online retailers that often benefit consumers the bush administration along with the national association of manufacturers and other business groups backed leegin but states represented by new york and the consumer federation of america urged the court to retain dr miles "price competition is the central nervous system of the economy " new york solicitor general barbara underwood told the court and the only certain result of letting manufacturers set minimum retail prices would be to increase costs to the consumer any such change in the structure of the marketplace should be made by congress not the court she said justice david souter agreed suggesting that "there may be a massive reorientation in the retail economy if dr miles goes " if so he said "why should we be the people to make a guess as opposed to the congress " the dr miles rule stems from the sherman antitrust act which prohibits "every contract combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce " on appeal to the supreme court the leegin case became a vehicle for free marketeers seeking to roll back the rigid rules that traditionally have marked antitrust law in recent years the court has grown sympathetic to arguments that unless a particular activity almost always inhibits competition strict rules should be discarded in favor of a case by case analysis of how a challenged practice affects competition although the case provides a blanket rule there have been ways around it from to congress allowed states to authorize vertical price controls in an effort to stop big retailers from crushing smaller competitors and while dr miles prohibits contracts between manufacturer and seller to fix minimum prices the sherman act doesnt cover unilateral conduct so manufacturers are free not to deal with retailers that dont comply with their announced pricing policies conservative economic theory notably the so called law and economics movement centered at the university of chicago argues that while price "floors" set by manufacturers may lessen "intrabrand" competition among stores they can foster "interbrand" competition by heightening differences among different makes of similar products
