changing the formula seeking perfect prices ceo tears up the rules parkers washkewicz weighs market power of parts cleveland in early shortly after donald washkewicz took over as chief executive of parker hannifin corp he came to an unnerving conclusion the big industrial parts makers pricing scheme was crazy for as long as anyone at the year old company could recall parker used the same simple formula to determine prices of its parts from heat resistant seals for jet engines to steel valves that hoist buckets on cherry pickers company managers would calculate how much it cost to make and deliver each product and add a flat percentage on top usually aiming for about many managers liked the method because it was straightforward and gave them broad authority to negotiate deals but mr washkewicz thought that parker which had revenues of &# billion last year had stuck itself in a profit margin rut no matter how much a product improved the company often ended up charging the same premium it would for a more standard item and if the company found a way to make a product less expensively it ultimately cut the products price as well "i was actually losing sleep " recalls mr washkewicz a year old cleveland native who started with the company when he was and rose through its ranks as an engineer while touring the companys facilities in mr washkewicz had an epiphany parker had to stop thinking like a widget maker and start thinking like a retailer determining prices by what a customer is willing to pay rather than what a product costs to make such "strategic" pricing schemes are used by many different industries airlines know they can get away charging more for a seat to florida in january than in august sports teams raise ticket prices if theyre playing a well known opponent why shouldnt parker do the same mr washkewicz reasoned today the company says its new pricing approach boosted operating income by &# million since that helped parkers net income soar to &# million last year from &# million in now the companys return on invested capital has risen from in to in putting it on the verge of moving into the top of mr washkewiczs list comparing parker with "peer" industrial companies from the end of to present parkers shares have risen nearly to about &# compared to a gain in the s&amp p for the past several years many u s manufacturers have struggled to raise prices amid the growth of global competition and cost cutting drives among customers while this erosion of pricing power is often cited as a factor that has helped tame inflation it put a strain on u s manufacturing which contributes to the nations gross domestic product now a growing number of manufacturers are trying to fight back by scrutinizing every assumption underlying their pricing strategies some companies like intel corp have used strategic pricing schemes for well over a decade but much of industrial america of u s manufacturers according to thomas nagle a pricing consultant at the monitor group still relies on oldfangled "cost plus" types of pricing methods such as the one parker used changing parkers pricing was a complex undertaking the company has tens of thousands of different types of products often custom engineered the company estimates half of its offerings are specifically made for a single customer and unlike retailers or airlines a manufacturer generally cant see its rivals prices discussing pricing with competitors is illegal while published list prices from other manufacturers mean little in industrial markets where most deals are negotiated and pricing changes were certain to alienate some customers in october mr washkewicz unveiled his big plan which involved creating a new senior position for pricing and bringing in a host of outside consultants many managers throughout the companys divisions immediately balked there was so much pushback the ceo eventually assembled a list of the most commonly given reasons why the new pricing scheme would fail if a manager came up with an argument not already on the list then mr washkewicz agreed to hear it out otherwise he told them get on board "youre messing with a companys dna when you change how you do prices " says richard braun parkers vice president of corporate strategic pricing the position created that october it didnt help that parker like many manufacturers has a conservative culture that treasures continuity founded in as a maker of hydraulic brakes for trucks the company had a descendant of the founder as its chairman as recently as today parker is a leading producer of industrial parts used in aerospace transportation and manufacturing it makes components used in everything from the space shuttle to a mechanism that helped tilt a faux steamship for the movie "titanic " like many parker executives mr washkewicz is a lifer he attended cleveland state university before landing his first job as an engineer at parker where his first task was to manually replace faulty parker hoses that had been installed in about trucks that involved spending six months in a grimy truck terminal climbing under the hoods of still hot engines "i kept thinking to myself i didnt go to college to do this crap " he says he stuck with it and was soon promoted to management ranks mr washkewicz had just been made president and chief operating officer in early when he set out to visit all of parkers facilities around the globe he saw people boosting productivity landing new accounts and making shrewd acquisitions even in the face of a deepening manufacturing recession yet the company never seemed to improve one key measure the return on invested capital on his list comparing parker with "peer" industrial companies the company failed to make the top by that measure mr washkewicz decided the company needed to revamp its whole approach he mandated that every business adopt "lean" manufacturing to streamline production and overhauled the way parker purchased materials from its suppliers the last and most crucial element he targeted was pricing to his surprise mr washkewicz discovered that computer programs for calculating prices adopted in the s were part of the problem "it became a cookbook approach " he says managers typed in myriad costs and the computer spit out a recommended base price which was used as the starting point in negotiations the cookbook approach might make sense for basic commodity products where there is enough competition and little wiggle room but what about the unique products that only parker or a handful of others can offer although he decided to adopt strategic pricing on his own mr washkewicz hired consultants to help each of parkers businesses painstakingly study its full gamut of products and divide them into categories "a" items were the high volume commodities where there was at least one big competitor helping to shape prices other products were divided into "b " "c " and "d" items which fell into increasingly narrow or specialized niches the final and most narrow groups were "specials" and "classics" that only parker produced what mr washkewicz discovered was that about a third of parkers products a huge number fell into niches where there was limited or no competition or where parker offered some other unique value sometimes parker could deliver the product faster sometimes parkers product was just better by the business that makes industrial fittings for example had spent six months reviewing some different items and gathered some data points in total the upshot of the parts mostly metal fittings used in places like oil rigs and power plants were priced too low overnight parker raised their prices anywhere from to with the average increase about the fittings cost anywhere from &# to &# each occasionally the process led to price cuts one type of hydraulic replacement filter for instance used on a wide range of industrial machines saw a price decrease when parker realized that owners of the machines usually preferred to buy new filters from the makers of the machines rather than an outside supplier like parker the price increases were met with immediate protest many distributors complained fearing they would be stuck footing the higher bill parker began running classes in to point out the unique attributes of various products to distributors which in turn helps them justify passing on the higher prices to customers last year parker says one customer a maker of parts for car engines balked at price increases of to on the roughly different items the buyers response was typical it launched "line review " a process in which a customer puts products up for bid to see if some other supplier can provide them for less "they said look were not happy with this we think the market is different than you do " says mr braun the parker pricing boss in the end parker says the customer only switched to alternative suppliers for three of those parts parker says most customers accepted the price increases either because they had to or because they accepted the companys rationale one of those customers is richard pedtke president of the compact vehicle division at ingersoll rand co which uses a wide array of parker hydraulic fittings and other components in its bobcat miniature loaders and excavators mr pedtke says he first objected when one of parkers new hydraulic fan motors cost much more than he expected but when bobcats purchasing people sat down with parkers sales team bobcat learned that the new motor replaced separate parts in the companys existing machines moreover the new design reduced leakage by eliminating hydraulic connections was easier to install at bobcats factories and opened up space inside the machines all of which saves bobcat money each of parkers divisions now has at least one of its own pricing gurus specialists who act as gatekeepers and enforcers of strategic pricing sheila konopka is the guru at the hydraulic valve division in elyria ohio which has four factories and sells &# billion worth of valves in north america "before everyone around here thought they were a pricing manager " she says "if we could make margin for a big order that was great nobody asked why not " when it came to one line of parkers high pressure valves the question was particularly appropriate these valves handle extremely high pressure up to pounds of pressure per square inch with almost no leakage most industrial valves operate at half or less that psi and are prone to varying amounts of leaks the high pressure models are used for things like airplane doors and the mechanisms used to raise and lower the flaps on the decks of aircraft carriers the company found it was able to increase prices for these items about across the board because of their special attributes parkers new approach has also helped it charge more for attributes that are difficult to quantify it sometimes costs more for instance to produce a product in the u s which allows the supplier to deliver it more quickly and be more responsive but how do you attach a price to that "the most common mistake manufacturers made in recent years was listening to experts who told them that they had to differentiate themselves by offering all sorts of service with their products but then didnt charge more " says mr nagle the partner in charge of strategic pricing at the monitor group a consulting firm based in cambridge mass parkers pricing teams now examine these sort of extra services and attempt to attach values to them parker continues finding ways to apply the new approach the company for instance has integrated pricing into its innovation process aiming to pinpoint and develop products that offer the most potential for price premiums "once you start doing this you never stop " says mr washkewicz "its a different way of thinking that filters into everything "
