pursuits sports golf journal what docs can teach golfers in their practices m d s accept imperfection we should too last saturday night while having dinner with my wife it occurred to me that maybe we golfers ought to "practice" our sport in the same way that doctors practice medicine i dont know why this thought came up right then at a nice restaurant but golfers often have momentous realizations at inconvenient times a few years ago for instance it struck me during my daughters ballet recital that the answer to everything was waiting a half beat longer to shift my weight forward on the downswing and i was right my game improved marginally for at least a couple of weeks by "practicing golf" i specifically do not mean practice in the sense of banging balls at the range i mean practicing golf in the sense of approaching the game from a broader long term perspective as a practice working on ones swing would still be part of practicing in this sense but hopefully it would be more fun and less agitating because any short term frustrations would melt into the overall notion of it all just being part of the practice of golf the same would hold true for playing regular rounds for doctors the word "practice" has its downside as per the old joke about nobody wanting a doctor "practicing" on them presumably this is why other professions such as those in the financial industries avoid using the formulation who wants to hire a stockbroker to "practice" on their portfolio but the medical and legal professions have stuck with the usage and it doesnt seem to bother us because realistically we cant expect success even the best doctors sometimes lose patients eventually all of them and competent lawyers lose cases there are too many outside variables in play too much thats not known too much rub of the green to use the golf term for practitioners to do more than the best they can and hope for acceptable results since that is essentially what we golfers do hit and hope co opting the "practice" terminology makes sense although it needs a little golf specific refinement luckily "practice" is a versatile word the dictionary i consulted offered a host of definitions the one that applies most directly to doctors is "the application of science theory or knowledge the actual doing " that sounds reasonably apt for golf except that a lot of us dont have any theory much less expert knowledge about what were doing when we tee it up we just want to cream the ball another potentially relevant definition is "to commit to and act upon a set of values as the basis for life to practice christianity " but this is maybe a bit too far reaching for most of us especially those of us with nongolfer spouses the definition that probably comes closest to what we need for golf is most often applied to yoga mediation and the like "to exercise or acquire discipline in for the sake of self improvement or enjoyment " like golf these are physical activities performed only occasionally but their devotees use of the word "practice" is instructive it emphasizes the disciplines inherent imperfections which is also true of golf but which we too often forget leading to pointless fits of frustration and rage these disciplines have goals performing more advanced poses in yoga or achieving "total consciousness" as bill murray put it in "caddyshack" through meditation but much more than in golf achieving these goals isnt emphasized as much as simply continuing the practice and trying to pull ones mind into the present moment and keep it there the takeaway is that this is a much better way to improve than by obsessing about improving which we golfers tend to do this doesnt mean that in proper golf practice we need to ignore score and treat our rounds as a "practice" rounds score can become the core discipline just as breathing is in meditation and poses are in yoga score achieved through a succession of individual shots becomes the object of your attention but poor scores dont enrage you they simply point to the failure of focus on individual shots all part of the practice leading to self knowledge and skills that can also be useful in the rest of your life still yoga isnt the perfect model for practicing golf we dont play golf in quiet rooms with new age music in the background we play in a messy distracting environment wind rain jerks cursing and have to find the reserves within ourselves to deal thats why im drawn back to the model of a medical practice doctors like golfers have to carry on despite imperfect skills and knowledge in a real world of cranky patients inadequate facilities occasional bad staff and inane insurance policies plus they face risk granted the risk on a surgical table is far more serious than the risk of blowing a match on the th hole by driving into the pond but try telling that to the golfer with the driver in his hands its no coincidence i think that institutions whose members "practice" are steeped in ancient tribal conventions just as golf is medicine has its year old hippocratic oath and law has its bizarre antiquated nomenclature these are necessary because so much uncertainty and imprecision underlies these professions doctors and lawyers might be more apt to run off in hare brained directions that seem to them at the time like a good idea golfs traditions doffing the hat on the th green standards of decorum in clubhouses the aura of gentlemanly behavior help keep our own underlying anxieties in check without them when the putts arent falling we might run amok like soccer hooligans plus of course the traditions remind us that golf like any good practice takes place over a long period of time email me at golfjournal wsj com
