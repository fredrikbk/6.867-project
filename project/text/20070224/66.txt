remembrances brian h rowe his engines powered major jets and dominance for aerospace titans the engines developed by brian h rowe power jets from f fighters to boeing widebodies and also drove general electric co s aircraft engine business to dominance in the international jet engine market as president and chief executive of the subsidiary from to mr rowe oversaw ges sallies in the "great engine war" of the early s with pratt &amp whitney over what engines would power americas most modern fighter aircraft but even as mr rowe was fighting that battle to a draw the two firms split the business on f f and f engines ge was stealing a march on its competitors for the civilian jet market mr rowe who died feb at age was "a larger than life figure" who played a "central role in the jet age " says boeing co chief executive jim mcnerney who served as president of ges engine business before leaving the company in former colleagues say his biggest technological accomplishment was the giant ge engine the worlds largest and most powerful jet engine that now powers the long range versions of the boeing that engine whose outer diameter is roughly the same size as the fuselage of a single aisle boeing and pioneered the use of lightweight composite fan blades made it possible to go "undreamed of distances on two engines " says mr mcnerney the most recent version powered the boeing lr that set the record for the longest nonstop commercial flight in when it flew from hong kong to london the long way the flight crossed over the pacific ocean the u s and the atlantic ocean staying aloft for more than and a half hours and covering a distance of nautical miles former ge chairman jack welch was among those who had reservations about the ge "brian had total confidence in it " mr welch said yesterday but "we were scared death of the technology it was the first engine with the composite blade it was going through the bird test and failing " he added referring to a test where air cannons fire dead chickens into the engine to simulate birds being sucked into engines during flight the engine helped boeing outsell airbus in the market for large twin aisle aircraft by a to margin "it was the gutsiest call ive ever seen at ge " says david calhoun a former ge vice chairman and formerly head of the aviation unit "its changing the face of the competition between these two great giants " he adds referring to boeing and airbus mr rowe pushed both boeing and ge to move ahead on the design with two ge engines he "had to convince jack welch it was something he could do and it wasnt too risky he had to convince boeing it was a bet worth making " says mr calhoun now ceo of the market research firm nielsen co when executives met in seattle in to discuss the planned launch of the program each person was asked to make a call on whether the program should go forward recalls ford motor co chief executive alan mulally previously the head of boeings commercial airplanes unit without hesitation mr rowe said "its time for us to take our businesses soaring together this is a leadership responsibility for all of us " mr mulally recalls the programs success was a sweet moment for the engineer whose career began near the dawn of the jet age working on some of the earliest jets at the u k s dehavilland engine co in after joining ge in and working on vertical takeoff and landing technology among other projects he was put in charge of the cf project in originally developed to power the air forces c a cargo plane the cf became the basis for a new family of ge engines that would break pratt &amp whitneys dominance of the commercial jet engine market but initial sales came slowly when a ge representative tried to sell jet engines to northwest airlines in the s according to a later time magazine account the airline president pointed to a chandelier and said "whenever i want a light bulb ill pick ges for jet engines ill stick to pratt &amp whitney " ge was stymied in military markets too as it lost out to pratt &amp whitney on fighter plane engines in the early s then saw its investment in engines for the b crater when the sleek bomber was canceled by the carter administration "when we lost the b we got ourselves together and asked what can we do " mr rowe told the new york times in the answer was to adapt the b engine for fighter aircraft and commercial planes ges very public competition with pratt &amp whitney to provide the next generation of fighter engines is widely credited within the military for creating more reliable and cheaper engines ge succeeded in topping pratt &amp whitney a unit of united technologies corp by entering into the partnership with frances snecma to build the engine that ultimately was chosen to be the only engine to power the second generation boeing s pratt &amp whitney believing that the market for that airplane would only be about deliveries chose not to participate in the competition ultimately the became boeings best selling airliner and ges position in the industry grew every time another engine rolled out of the factory today ge aviation is one of the fairfield conn based conglomerates biggest businesses with &# billion in sales in about of ges &# billion in sales even after he retired mr rowe was a fixture in aviation circles he attended the annual industry trade shows in paris and london where he held court with former customers and employees in ges chalet a few years ago upon meeting a young reporter who was attending his first show mr rowe took him by the elbow and led him to an exhibit hall where a cut away version of the giant ge was on display for the next minutes both mr rowe and the reporter crawled around and under the engine as he explained how each part worked
