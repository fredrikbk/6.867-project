pursuits travel the finicky traveler the mud and i giving diy a try miami on an unseasonably chilly miami afternoon i approach the standard hotel spas "mud lounge " which isnt really a lounge at all but a small outdoor patio facing biscayne bay with two freestanding claw foot tubs some high pressure hoses and three picnic coolers on a table shivering in a bathing suit and robe i peek into the first cooler finding a thick vile looking green substance apparently one of the mud potions im supposed to slather on myself bake in the sun soak in the tub and then rinse off i dont think so not only have i never been into mud as a beauty treatment despite the spas promise that it tightens the pores banishes blotchiness and clears toxins from the body but i just cant imagine applying this goo to myself out in the middle of a public area that while deserted now on a sunny day might be filled with other people lounging around the pool and boating on the bay even harder to imagine a fellow spa goer deciding to join me in the buff the mud lounge is clothing optional the standard is one of a growing number of spas embracing the new do it yourself concept offering treatments that range from self administered mud packs and body polishes to self guided dips into cold plunge pools and hot soaking tubs often in co ed communal areas but for traditional spa aficionados like me the appeal of diy is limited at best i dont want to do it myself i want it done for me when i asked janice worth co founder of the popular anushka day spas in new york and palm beach gardens fla about this diy trend she reinforced my thinking "thats the antithesis of what the spa experience is supposed to be about which is being pampered " while many spas have added features in recent years that require spa goers to navigate at least part of the experience by themselves i usually get into trouble when i have to do anything more complicated than get out of the sauna or steam room before overheating at one hotel spa a couple of years ago i turned on the swiss shower with its multiple fast jets only to end up with little red welts all over my body then nearly drowned in a "deluge pool" that dumped a boatload of water on me from an overhead chute when i pushed the button still in the spirit of trying new things i agreed to test out the standard spa for pursuits the page brochure i downloaded from the web site listed dozens of treatments and baths and promised a "steamy mix of health and hedonism " i booked a "standard special" that included traditional treatments a massage facial manicure and pedicure and planned to arrive early and experience the diy features at the indoor and outdoor hydrotherapy "playground " housed in the former lido hotel and spa the motor court style hotel was restored and opened as the standard in january by hip hotelier andre balazs who also operates the mercer in new york and the chateau marmont in los angeles mr balazs who i interviewed by phone after my visit says that in restoring the hotels original spa he was inspired by "ancient and traditional bathing cultures where heat waters and mud were used for therapeutic effect " by eliminating the need for therapists and cutting down on fancy amenities his aim was also to reduce the cost of the spa experience for locals and many young people the standard charges &# for a day pass to the indoor areas of the spa "the goal is to make the spa an integral part of life like the baths were to the romans or the sauna was to the finns " mr balazs adds "if you come in here we assume you arent dragging in your golden door or mandarin oriental expectations " i admit it that is exactly what i was doing i got a little nervous when i pulled up to the standard which looked like a demolition site the ground in front torn up and rocks and gravel scattered in the driveway part of a city drainage project a harried staffer who was alone at the front desk checked me in and gave me a key for a locker then pointed me to a door which opened onto concrete stairs on the outside of the building i made my way down two flights and opened another door that led to a dark musty smelling corridor with a fitness room and the locker rooms the womens locker room immediately reminded my of my high school gym with nothing but a row of lockers no lotions hair products or anything resembling an amenity there were three showers and a couple toilets stalls and sinks but no attendant mr balazs says the spa which has only been in full operation since last spring is still working out some kinks and will add some additional products in the locker room with an hour before my massage i put on my bathing suit required in all co ed areas except the mud lounge though women can go topless and went back up the outside stairs robe flapping in the cold wind to the main floor mr balazs says adding an inner stair would have added to costs the woman at the desk was on the phone but a fellow guest pointed me back down the elevator to the pool where i walked the length of the property to find the roman waterfall hot tub and falling water column only to learn that they werent in operation that day after seeing what the outdoor mud lounge had to offer i hightailed it back up the elevator to the warm inner "hamam " it was warm and steamy but damp dark and kind of dank on one side of the big central room an attendant was filling one of four steel soaking tubs for a client on the other side a few people were sprawled on a wide two level heated marble slab which i sat on gingerly for a few minutes before padding over to investigate the scrub room the diy idea is to retreat behind a rubber curtain hoist yourself onto a limestone slab apply a scrub potion and shower it off but the room seemed dark and slimy so i crisscrossed the central room again to the "sound shower " a cavernous circular group shower with individual free falling shower fixtures and piped in music lets put it this way while i cant say the place wasnt clean at every part of this journey i was glad i had my flip flops on though i may be overly finicky you cant be too careful studies show that public spa facilities carry risks of waterborne infections i try never to set foot in hotel hot tubs for example for fear of catching more from fellow tubbers than a feeling of camaraderie mr balazs says at the standard tubs are cleaned after every use and the whole facility is scrubbed down in a four hour process from a m daily with just a few minutes before my massage i decided to try the dry sauna while it was spacious i felt discomfited by the presence of two large men on the bench next to me maybe this kind of thing works for a younger hipper crowd conditioned to the idea of communal bathrooms in their co ed college dorms but i just cant get used to sharing my spa experience with strange men and as for showering with them even if we all have our bathing suits on and theres disco music its just not for me fortunately my facial was soothing and my massage was relaxing and the therapists were competent and professional but there was an unfortunate mix up over timing the brochure listed my package as three hours and minutes and because it started at p m i made plans to be picked up at the hotel at p m what i wasnt told when i made the arrangements was that the package includes long breaks between treatments a half hour between the massage and the facial for example during which clients are expected to use the diy areas or hang around the pool mr balazs says the actual time span should have been made clear to me when i booked it when i realized halfway through that i was going to be crunched for time i asked the front desk to accelerate things so i wouldnt miss my manicure and pedicure but was told there was no flexibility and they couldnt reduce the &# cost of the package either &# with a gratuity my very competent manicurist worked fast to do my nails but we had to forgo the full pedicure for a quick polish change when i got home i felt a little rough around the edges so i took out a pumice stone and some foot cream and finished the job the ultimate do it yourself
