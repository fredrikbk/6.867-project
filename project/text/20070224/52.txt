pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state ballpark number q over the years ive noticed that many u s wines list their alcohol content as is there something significant about that particular number fred endrizzi sarasota fla a its not just american wines so many australian wines list the same figure that in a column about them a couple of years ago we wrote "we couldnt help but notice that of the claimed alcohol " u s government regulations allow stated alcohol content for table wines to simply be in the ballpark plus or minus percentage points so our guess is that wineries use as a round figure because the actual alcohol content is around there somewhere storing champagne q if youve chilled champagne in the fridge and decided not to drink it is it possible to store the wine unchilled until you decide to drink it or do you need to keep it stored chilled i have a bottle of veuve clicquot that i bought for new years eve that did not get opened but was chilled for opening cindy j miley herndon va a youd be surprised how often were asked this question especially after the holidays the literal answer is put the wine on its side in a dark undisturbed place with a fairly constant moderate temperature and it will be fine until youre ready to chill it again but the answer we really want to give is this open the bottle tonight and enjoy it champagne always tastes best when its opened for no reason at all when youve finished that bottle get another bubbly and put it in the refrigerator and open it for the same nonreason transporting port q my girlfriend enjoys port as much as i do so i just ordered a bottle of sandeman from a store in chicago but the store recommends waiting to ship it until spring when its warmer this surprises me had it been the middle of summer i could see waiting until the weather cools off a little but i didnt know that cold was harmful to wine your thoughts nick farrah oakland calif a we certainly respect the wine store for showing this kind of care extreme temperatures whether hot or cold can damage wine this is important to keep in mind as more people order wine on the internet to be shipped sometimes across the country remember that your wine could sit in very hot or very cold places for some time its best to avoid delivery altogether during periods of extreme weather even during good weather wed still recommend paying for express delivery to ensure that your wine suffers as little as possible during its trip
