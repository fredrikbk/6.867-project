digging for sin city christians toil in jordan desert prof collins seeks sodom with scriptures as guide and volunteers as muscle tall el hammam site jordan dennis addington a retired california construction worker with a bad back splurged this winter on his first foreign vacation he spent &# to dig himself into a deep hole "its the most fun ive ever had " he said crouching feet down in a pit more than miles from home mr addington and scores of others paid good money to come to jordan and get to the bottom of something seriously bad the worlds most infamous city of sin theyre looking for sodom a place so wicked that according to scripture god obliterated it and sister settlement gomorrah in a cataclysm of "brimstone and fire " its sinfulness is one of the few things jews christians and muslims agree on the hebrew bible the new testament and the quran all slam sodom "this is ground zero for wickedness " says steven collins a new mexico college professor who is leading this archaeological dig for the long vanished and say skeptics fictional city of vice a devout christian he believes the place will one day make "a great tourist destination with a great big sign welcome to sodom perhaps in pink neon " though it would have been destroyed more than years ago sodom has survived through the ages as a symbol of gods wrath and as an inspiration for high and low art including a book by the marquis de sade numerous porn flicks and a german thrash metal band the name entered the latin french and english languages to describe what in parts of the world is an illegal sexual act there is debate among theologians about what the original sodomites did wrong but "whatever it was " says prof collins "they really ticked god off " mr collins is dean of the college of archaeology and biblical history at trinity southwest university a small evangelical academy in albuquerque it embraces the bible "as the basis of all learning " the remains of sodom mr collins posits lie buried here in a huge earthen mound in the jordan valley he identified the site by following clues in the bible and hopes to prove that it really is biblical sodom by excavating and analyzing pottery shards old bones and other remains confirming scripture through science he wrote in one fund raising pitch will help counter "insidious little vermin of gnawing doubt about the credibility of the bible " he explains "christianity is lost in europe because it lost faith in the biblical text post christian america is very very close " mainstream archaeologists scoff at the project many believe the scriptures are useless as treasure maps others say the bible contains strands of historical fact but that proving the existence of sodom is near impossible unless mr collins unearths written evidence highly unlikely because writing barely existed in the area at the time many experts think that if sodom existed at all it is buried under the dead sea or hidden somewhere else prof collins who has a doctorate in biblical studies says he might be wrong and that the outcome will be determined by science not faith carbon dating and other tests he says will be done by secular laboratories but if the site isnt sodom he says "im not going to say the bible isnt true doggonit it means were just in the wrong spot " he says he "could not embrace a faith that is not founded on fact " to raise money for the project which is due to last seven years prof collins passed the hat at scores of american church gatherings donations allow him to hire a few jordanian laborers but most of the work is done by volunteers who pay thousands of dollars to spend seven hours a day moving dirt most are american evangelical christians mr addington a former alcoholic who credits christianity with saving him from ruin came with his pastor from woodland calif and stayed the full five weeks of this years dig which ended in january unearthing sodom to prove the bible correct he says "wont help people who are too far gone but it will help those sitting on the fence to go in the right direction " loretta worthington from ruidoso n m paid more than &# to bring her son and a friends daughter for a two week stint she decided to come after seeing mr collins on a christian broadcasting channel "people dont fear god anymore " she says "maybe if they see what happened to sodom they will say we should watch out " a handful of skeptics also turned up including a pair from australia who said they just like digging a russian belly dancer from the bar in the groups hotel also lent a hand she said shes always been "curious about sodom " the work is often back breaking diggers recuperate each night at a luxury spa hotel on the dead sea "a pampered digger is a good digger " says prof collins the search for sodom and other biblical sites began in earnest in the th century when archaeologists from europe and america began excavating the holy land many were devout christians who hoped to find proof of their faith in recent decades attempts to prove the bible true have met with scorn from most archaeologists "no responsible scholar goes out with a trowel in one hand and a bible in the other " says williams dever a professor emeritus at the university of arizona and an authority on holy land sites mr dever says his work in archaeology and biblical studies caused him to surrender his early belief in the literal truth of the bible mr collins first focused on sodom a decade ago while leading a group of americans on a tour of biblical sites in israel and jordan he concluded that an area at the southern end of the dead sea popular in some christian circles as the site of sodom didnt match geographical clues in scripture he began looking for an alternative eventually settling on jordans tall el hammam at the northern end of the dead sea after years of discussion he got permission to dig from jordans department of antiquities in december work started with a few holes and the printing of t shirts bearing the motto "what happens in sodom stays in sodom" a play on an advertising slogan for las vegas often reviled as the modern sodom and gomorrah this winter about people took part they found remains of an ancient rampart much pottery a few bones some ash and something an excited digger thought was part of the meteor some believers speculate god hurled at sodom to destroy it most of the finds so far date to the first millennium b c not old enough for sodom the diggers disagree on what sodom did wrong mr addington and ms worthington believe its sin was homosexuality this view long dominant in conservative christian theology rests on biblical passages condemning the citys residents for "going after strange flesh" and for lusting after angels muslims including several jordanian experts taking part in the dig agree dan klooster an episcopalian digger from el paso texas described sodoms sin as "living in plenty and neglecting the poor as americans we should find this very worrying " bruno huber is uninterested in theology but is cheering on the diggers anyway the general manager of the moevenpick dead sea resort &amp spa says the sodom seekers have boosted his occupancy rates and could turn the area into a big tourist draw "let them believe this is sodom " the swiss hotelier says
