cross country cafeteria constitutionalism green lake wis for the past few years some judges in wisconsin have been rewriting state law from the bench now its possible that they soon may go even further by rewriting the wisconsin constitution wisconsins capital madison is already doing exactly that appointees to madisons boards and commissions must take an oath of office to uphold the u s and wisconsin constitutions but last month the city council approved a measure allowing them to refuse to swear to uphold a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriage if they disagree with it and where madison leads the wisconsin supreme court is usually not far behind its one thing to disagree with the amendment quite another to rewrite the constitution there is a disconnect between traditional democratic principles and the notion that citizens need not uphold provisions of state and federal constitutions with which they disagree when the consent of the governed is withdrawn which is what the "anti oath" does it fractures the social contract other constitutional provisions whether state or federal become fair game for those who disagree with them dont like guns refuse to uphold the state constitutional amendment giving wisconsinites the right to hunt disagree with free speech ban the first amendment and so on the anti oath law is frightening because citizens and officeholders may now pick and choose what other constitutional provisions they believe ought not be enforced call it cafeteria constitutionalism wisconsin is known as something of a blue state so it would not have been surprising if the gay marriage ban had failed especially in a year when here as in many states democrats swept into office instead of voters approved it wisconsin is actually more of a purple state mixing liberal and conservative positions it has as one of its favorite sons "fighting bob" lafollette who though a republican was known for his pro union and anti corporate philosophy since then the state as a whole has consistently re elected russ feingold and herb kohl to the u s senate gov jim doyle despite having a scandal plagued first term handily won a second term over his republican opponent former republican congressman mark green of green bay to replace him voters elected a democrat but the state has a contrarian streak as well especially outside of its two major cities madison and milwaukee passage of the gay marriage ban amendment is only one example voters also narrowly elected a republican as state attorney general perhaps to keep an eye on gov doyle and though republicans lost control of the state senate they kept control of the state house and the supreme court would be dominated by conservatives today but for gov doyles appointment of a liberal to fill a conservative vacancy several years ago now wisconsin finds itself with an election for the state supreme court its difficult to call already dominated by liberal judicial activists voters in april will elect a replacement for a conservative judge who is retiring choosing between a conservative candidate and a liberal one for the post so the balance of power will either remain the same or increase to the marriage amendment is likely to play a prominent role in this election because a challenge to its constitutionality is expected to reach the high court although issues that affect the business marketplace are probably more critical to the states economic survival businesses want certainty and wisconsin doesnt provide it right now under leftward domination of the court if the liberal candidate wins activists will continue their domination of the court for the next generation according to jim pugh of the wisconsin manufacturers &amp commerce organization more anti market rulings are likely to result the court has already gained national notoriety for allowing the use of "junk science" in its courtrooms doing away with the requirement that a particular manufacturers lead paint be linked to an injury before a consumer can sue and for sitting as a "super legislature " by eliminating caps on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases any product could become the next target of tort lawyers seeking to expand business liability and a rhode island style lead based paint case in which contingent fee attorneys will argue the paint is a public nuisance and seek billions in damages will go to trial sometime this year the contrast between the liberal candidate and the conservative one then could not be more stark both on business liability issues and social ones like gay marriage the conservative annette ziegler a circuit court judge from washington county in southeast wisconsin favors a "modest" role for the courts "the courts duty is not to determine what the law should be or to negate laws to arrive at a desired outcome " thats about all she can say on issues likely to come before the court due to judicial canons of ethics the liberal linda clifford is not a sitting judge but has been a madison liberal active in private practice for years including representation on behalf of the aclu she has support from gov doyle financial and otherwise because she was not a judicial candidate in she was free to speak out then on the gay marriage ban and did so in a letter to the state legislature opining that among other things the gay marriage ban violates the u s constitution and u s supreme court holdings so we probably know how she will rule on that issue and we have a pretty good idea how she will rule in business liability personal injury cases it does not bode well for the business climate in wisconsin but what we dont know yet is whether if ms clifford wins she will swear to uphold the wisconsin constitutions gay marriage ban believing as she says she does that it is unconstitutional its hard to see how she possibly could and if she cant or wont swear to uphold the constitution or at least not all of it if she instead chooses to take an anti oath is she disqualified from serving on the court its something for wisconsin contrarians to ponder ms martin an attorney is senior fellow for legal affairs at the heartland institute
