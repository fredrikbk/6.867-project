pursuits books solving a math conundrum a russian eccentric untangled a century old puzzle and then spurned his prize the poincare conjecture by donal oshea walker pages &# one april afternoon in a reclusive russian mathematician his hair overgrown his beard and nails untrimmed for ages arrived at the massachusetts institute of technology to deliver a talk taking the stage in the standing room only lecture hall wearing a wrinkled suit and sneakers grigory perelman seemed to have scuttled directly to the cambridge mass campus from the cramped apartment that he shared with his mother in st petersburg it was there working in poverty and isolation that "grisha" perelman solved a mathematical conundrum that had thwarted the worlds best mathematicians for a century over the preceding year mr perelman had posted a series of articles about his proof on a web site used by research mathematicians to announce new results but now mits researchers their interest whetted by the articles had turned out in droves to hear firsthand how mr perelman solved the notoriously elusive poincare conjecture named after the french mathematician henri poincare who proposed it in the poincare conjecture which concerns the branch of mathematics known as topology is a claim about the possibility of transforming one sort of surface into another everyday life makes us familiar with two dimensional surfaces such as a balloon or a basketball or the skin of an apple a three dimensional surface by contrast is almost impossible to visualize just as a "two sphere" like a balloon encloses a three dimensional space a "three sphere" must enclose a four dimensional space the poincare conjecture is a guess about these higher dimensional surfaces if a three dimensional surface has a certain property poincare speculated it is essentially a three sphere and what is this property it has to do with loops suppose you draw a loop on the surface of a sphere now picture this loop shrinking there is nothing to stop it from shrinking all the way down to a single point if you draw a loop on a doughnut shaped surface by contrast the hole might get in the way of the shrinkage process what poincare claimed was that any three dimensional surface with this shrinkability property could be massaged into a three sphere if these ideas are hard to imagine and they are they are harder yet to prove as donal oshea writes in "the poincare conjecture " the french mathematician did not make any great effort to try to prove his own theory in the last eight years of his life but many others tried and failed the theory and the mathematical machinery needed for the solution though emerged through the work of several mathematicians over the past century most important among them two americans bill thurston and richard hamilton grigory perelman who turned in june extended this work and was able to overcome the difficulties that had stumped others using methods derived from the field of differential geometry he put together a long series of calculations and logic chains to arrive at a complicated proof his achievement was so significant that last year mr perelman was offered the fields medal the equivalent in mathematics to a nobel prize the award made every four years was scheduled to be presented to mr perelman in madrid by king juan carlos in august but the king and the new member of royalty in mathematics never met mr perelman declined to accept the fields medal it was not the only honor that has failed to stir his interest mr perelman was also singled out by the clay mathematics institute which in had inaugurated a million dollar prize for each of seven "millennium problems " one of which was the poincare conjecture so far mr perelmans million remains uncollected in "the poincare conjecture " mr oshea tells the fascinating story of this mathematical mystery and its solution by the eccentric mr perelman the book starts with a description of the shape of the world and the debates about it over the millennia it surveys the ancient greek discovery that the earth is spherical and the stunningly accurate estimation of its circumference made by eratosthenes of cyrene in the third century b c using a simple comparison of the angle to the sun at two locations in egypt at the same time then mr oshea jumps centuries forward to christopher columbus the arguments for and against columbuss new world voyage raging at the time are couched in terms of the shape of the earth mr oshea notes that columbus frustrated that he didnt reach the east indies proposed that perhaps the world was shaped like a pear rather than a sphere on a pear shaped planet sailing in a northerly route up would lead one to the other side much faster than sailing in a southerly route around the wider part of the pear readers eager to move on to the poincare conjecture might lose patience with such detail regarding columbus but mr oshea is wise to linger for by focusing our attention on a pear he forces us to think about possible shapes and to consider a surface with varying curvature something that becomes important later as he gets to the nitty gritty of mr perelmans arguments mr oshea does a good job of explaining the mathematics involved in solving the conjecture but these sections are slow going patient readers might learn quite a bit but only with effort mr oshea to his credit avoids cliche were spared the usual reference to coffee cups turning into doughnuts as an explanation of how surfaces might stretch without closing holes and he tries to keep things lively illustrating the concept of negative curvature he uses a drawing of a reclining nude which mr oshea tells us was modeled by his wife in his eagerness to make mathematics relevant to the real world mr oshea over stresses the implications of solving the poincare conjecture the books subtitle is "in search of the shape of the universe" for a variety of technical reasons mr osheas discussions aside it turns out that the poincare conjecture has no direct relevance to cosmological geometries a more serious problem is the books paucity of information about its hero inevitably readers will want to know more about grigory perelman the man who managed to solve a problem that had baffled great minds for so long what made him pursue the conjecture how did he solve it why did he reject the fields medal mr oshea doesnt have the answers pinning down the mathematical hermit is no doubt difficult but others have done it in the new yorker magazine in august last year sylvia nasar the author of "a beautiful mind " about the troubled princeton mathematician john nash and david gruber described meeting with mr perelman in st petersburg the article also ignited a controversy by depicting a renowned harvard mathematician shing tung yau as trying to claim credit for solving the poincare conjecture mr yaus lawyer has demanded corrections and an apology neither of which have been forthcoming ms nasar and mr gruber report that mr perelman told them he turned down the fields medal because he didnt want to become "conspicuous " but its not clear that he feels the same about the clay mathematical institute award he ducks their question on the subject i for one am betting that mr perelman takes the million dollars hell do it for his mother mr aczel is the author of "the artist and the mathematician the story of nicolas bourbaki the genius mathematician who never existed " his forthcoming book is "the jesuit and the skull "
