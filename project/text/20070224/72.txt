stock option grant to mr hennessy became public mr kennedy says he called a stanford administrator and asked the university to take a close look "i was worried that there might be a perception on the part of reporters and the public that there could be a conflict of interest " he says mr kennedy a biologist joined no corporate boards during his presidency citing time constraints it is relatively common for presidents at top universities to join corporate boards a chronicle of higher education survey found that about a third of presidents at four year universities served on at least one board

he says the university might have to pay him more were it not for his outside income mr hennessy says his current board posts help the university because they allow him to "see a lot of things we could do better " mr hennessys admirers compare him to frederick terman the legendary former provost who introduced william hewlett to david packard in the s helping kick start what became silicon valley mr terman joined the board of hewlett packard and was a paid consultant for a high tech investment fund according to a recent biography by wesleyan university professor c stewart gillmor with

l weinberg center for corporate governance at the university of delaware questions mr hennessys dual allegiances mr elson says the president should have alerted stanford to the possible investment when he first learned about it "the question is what hat is he wearing investor stanford president " here as in similar cases mr hennessy says that since he isnt actively involved in managing the endowment he cant influence where its money goes "i wouldnt have been in a position" to suggest the university make an investment he says adding that he "actually didnt know anything about the company " the ties between mr hennessy and foundation capital go deeper foundation played a key role in the creation of atheros communications a chip maker that mr hennessy and stanford professor teresa meng co founded in the late s at a party hosted by foundation mr hennessy still dean of the engineering school broached ms mengs idea with foundation partner paul koontz they both recall foundation backed atheros and mr hennessy became chairman a post he holds today when atheros sold shares in a initial public offering foundation made a return of more than times its initial investment says mr koontz

received &# in directors fees last march stanfords endowment invested with foundation for the first time critics say the selection could give the impression that the venture firm won entry because of its relationship with mr hennessy in an email ted meyer foundations chief financial officer says mr hennessy wasnt "actively involved in driving or directing" the endowments decision to invest with his firm but he adds that mr hennessy has "been instrumental in the close relationship that we have with stanford in our investment deal flow " including peribit and atheros mr hennessys role at google has created the closest intersection with his stanford duties in several months before googles public offering the company appointed mr hennessy to its board venture capitalist john doerr one of googles original investors and directors says he made the first overture to mr hennessy and the president declined both men say mr hennessy worried about potential conflicts with his university obligations and the time commitment after six months of courting by mr doerr and googles founders mr hennessy signed on mr doerr says mr hennessy has invested money with mr doerrs firm kleiner perkins mr hennessy says he finally took the job because googles transformative role on the internet made the post "too interesting to pass up " google granted mr hennessy options to buy google stock at &# apiece after the offering as part of an earlier investment in a kleiner perkins fund he received google shares sec filings show with google shares soaring mr hennessy has made gains of &# million from the sale of stock and the exercise of stock options and has given away shares worth about &# he retains stock worth &# million the paper profit from his unexercised options is &# million they cant

technology from stanford where founders larry page and sergey brin started the company and were ph d students as payment stanford received shares in the offering that the school has since sold for &# million stanford continues to receive what it describes as "modest" annual licensing fees from google the initial agreement the terms of which neither side will disclose was struck in before mr hennessy became president in an interview google ceo eric schmidt says the company expects no special treatment from stanford it sought mr hennessy because of his expertise and experience he says mr hennessy says he represents googles interests not stanfords when he sits on the google board stanfords library is one of a handful that has participated in a google project to digitize books so that the public can search the texts major publishing companies and the authors guild a professional organization for writers have sued google saying the company is violating copyright law paul aiken executive director of the authors guild calls mr hennessys personal holdings in google "a great concern" and says "there seems to be both a personal and institutional profit motive here " ms zumwalt the stanford general counsel says stanford "walled off" mr hennessy from any discussions involving the library project she notes that harvard and the university of michigan among others have joined the project so has princeton whose president also sits on googles board in november google pledged &# million to stanford law schools center for internet and society founded by stanford professor lawrence lessig known for his views that copyright laws are often too restrictive the money will help fund a project at the center dedicated to help preserve the publics legal right to "fair use" of copyrighted material it also intends to pursue legal cases relating to the topic aine donovan executive director of the ethics institute at dartmouth college says stanford shouldnt have accepted the google gift because it is too narrowly tailored to benefit googles corporate interests "it might as well be the google center " she says mr lessig says the gift wont affect his scholarship and that his views on copyright dont always agree with googles adding that there was no "quid pro quo " to avoid any perception of conflict the center will avoid litigation if it relates to google he says larry kramer dean of the law school says mr hennessy wasnt involved with the google gift and that the center supports scholars of diverse views for his part mr hennessy says hes "been tremendously lucky" to have so many chances to work in silicon valley he says he accepted the often demanding job of running stanford for one reason "i came to believe it was a way to repay the university "
