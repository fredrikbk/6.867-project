stock exchange the company also had &# billion in debt as of september a deal could be finalized over the next few days this person said though it was possible it could fall apart at a late moment the transaction first reported by cnbc would be the latest massive deal engineered by private equity firms enjoying record profits and a flood of cash from investors seeking ever greater returns the large investment firms have accounted for the majority of the biggest mergers and acquisitions in the last year last year among recent deals blackstone group paid &# billion for equity office properties and

barbarian at the gate for the &# billion buyout of rjr nabisco in is now the industry doyen flush with cash and on a worldwide hunt for prey "i have never seen a time like this when money is so available and so global " henry kravis its co founder said in a recent interview for its part texas pacific group has a less venerable history and a policy of preferring to not be in the limelight its peers seek it recently raised a &# billion fund which puts it in second place in asset size behind blackstones &# billion fund at least for the moment dallas based txu has emerged in recent years as one of the nations dominant utilities by asserting itself aggressively over the deregulated electricity market in texas that state has what is considered the most advanced deregulation plan in the nation having recently lifted most limits on what companies can charge the general public for electricity txu owns both texass largest power generation company and its biggest electricity retailer giving it a powerful grip on one of the nations largest markets its assets include the largest fleet of power plants in texas and interests in a single nuclear plant it also owns a transmission and distribution system and strip coal mines with substantial reserves that powerhouse combination of assets has produced big profits and strong returns for investors in the third quarter of txu earned net income of just more than &# billion on revenue of &# billion the companys stock has made huge gains under chief executive c john wilder with its shares increasing sixfold since he arrived three years ago but txu also has stoked controversy in texas over the rates it charges and an ambitious plan to build new power plants that may require the buyers to make concessions in order to overcome regulatory hurdles additionally the company has been planning to expand by building big coal fired power plants in the state in coming years that project has drawn harsh criticism from environmental interests which accuse txu of adding to its bulk with plants that release substantial amounts of carbon dioxide a heat trapping gas many scientists blame for global warming the company also has drawn criticism for its dealings with customers during its ramp up to a deregulated market txu raised rates repeatedly and now charges some of the highest power rates in the nation critics say it also is quick to disconnect late paying customers while offering perks to those who pay on time those factors have made txu a flashpoint for criticism especially in texas this past week mr wilder faced uncomfortable questioning before a texas senate committee concerning whether his firm had amassed too much "market power " the ability to influence power prices legislators have been considering setting firmer limits on txus might responding to market analyses suggesting that at times it possesses the ability to influence prices on the texas wholesale electricity market steve wolens a former legislator who is one of the authors of the texas deregulation law said he was disappointed by the buyout news one goal of deregulation he said was to "discourage the need for in state utilities to sell to out of state" interests the suitors may plan to address concerns in part by removing txu from public ownership said one person familiar with the matter they also plan to scale back some of txus plans to build new generating plants and consider a rate rollback the person said a person familiar with the proposed deal said the buyers plan to retain current management txu has been in exclusive negotiations with kkr and tpg in recent weeks this person said such exclusivity makes a rival bid more difficult private equity firms have attracted scrutiny from shareholders and government regulators who claim the firms may be extracting too much value from publicly traded firms leaving stockholders and customers in the lurch a buyout plan will have to quell criticism while steering clear of legislators eager to politicize the issues approval of a deal could take months and serve as a critical test for the suitability of private investors plunging ever deeper into highly regulated industries both state and federal officials would have to sign off with state utility regulators finding that the sale was in the public interest any deal appears likely to deliver a windfall to mr wilder who negotiated a lucrative contract when he joined txu in february from neighboring utility entergy corp under the terms of that agreement he could be eligible for a change in control payment the texas market is especially appealing to investors because it is geographically constrained with almost no electrical connections to other states this makes the entire state a sort of captive market unable to import cheaper electricity from outside because prices mostly are set by expensive gas fired generators this gives lower cost generators like txu the ability to reap extraordinary profits from its power generation business
