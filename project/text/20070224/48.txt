pursuits entertainment &amp culture art a museum blurs the lines in battle for photos to cope with spiraling prices the gettys curator coaxes others to shop on his behalf in weston naef helped lead the wealthy j paul getty museum in los angeles on an unprecedented shopping spree under his guidance the museum bought up photographs by the crateful more than in all including several major private collections spending about &# million practically overnight the getty had one of the best photography collections in the world museums around the country are still catching up today even the deep pockets of the getty arent enough for mr naef the museums photography curator to get the works he wants a supercharged art market has bid up typical prices for individual fine art photographs from about &# in to about times that with some works fetching &# million or more many of todays buyers cant be counted on to loan or bequeath their works to museums often these new buyers which include everyone from hedge fund managers to russian and asian investors also keep their collecting secret by buying anonymously to cope the year old mr naef is relying less on the gettys checkbook and instead reinventing how museums woo donors hes forming unusually close relationships with collectors advising them to purchase works he hopes will eventually make their way into the getty as loans or gifts hes departing from typical museum practice by forging close ties to the auction and gallery worlds including placing sothebys and christies officials on a key getty committee to get an insiders edge on the market mr naefs cultivation of retired technology executive michael blasgen shows how the strategy works a delicate exercise in back scratching schmoozing and hope mr blasgen has known mr naef for years and enjoys being able to ask the prestigious figure in the photography world for advice at the photo los angeles photography fair earlier this month mr naef had something specific to discuss with mr blasgen a group of photographs by o winston link an artist mr blasgen says he has long admired after consulting with mr naef he bought five of mr links iconic train photographs priced at &# each mr naef who has built a sizable trove of railroading images for the museum told mr blasgen that the print would complement the gettys collection though he didnt explicitly ask him to promise it as a gift according to both men in the past few years mr blasgen has donated about prints to the getty as well as promised hundreds of works of anonymous photography snapshots mostly from the s valued for their historic charm a category that mr naef suggested he buy in "i led him to the idea that these things could be worth looking at and he became addicted " says mr naef mr blasgen says that while he knows mr naef guides him towards works that mr naef would like for the getty he only buys ones that he genuinely wants for his own collection still he says "certainly it serves the interest of the getty to be so helpful to me because i think if i ever were to give away one or more of these id certainly put the getty up atop my list " for his part mr naef says he knows that theres no guarantee that all the time he invests with the collectors he advises will pay off with significant donations in fact he says hes been on the losing side of that gamble before but he says the strategy is one of the only options remaining to him in a market that the getty is often priced out of that realization hit him in full force at a sale at christies in london of early daguerreotypes mr naef had researched the auction carefully and was sure hed be able to buy every work he wanted for the getty in the sale so much so that hed already planned to include some of them in a major upcoming exhibit but an unfamiliar buyer sheik abdullah saud al thani of qatar showed up as well though mr naef was able to afford some of the first works the sheik then entered the fray in earnest and began bidding up the photographs "off the charts " mr naef says the getty lost out in every single bid for the rest of the sale most painfully a rare masterpiece called "the temple of jupiter olympus " which sheik al thani bought for about &# at the time the most money anyone had ever spent on a photograph at auction "we very badly wanted it " mr naef says since then mr naef has often found its not worth entering the bidding at all as prices have climbed far higher he recently sat out a sale for a work he would have loved to have for the getty but that he knew would be bid up too far out of range edward steichens "the pond moonlight " which sold for &# million the buyer was anonymous "that seems to be the pattern that some of these record prices are being paid by people who are totally unknown to us " mr naef says "at this point to me they are very shadowy figures who come from remote places and have never set foot on our doorstep " to avoid being blindsided at auction mr naef has recruited the photography heads from christies and sothebys for the gettys photography council who can brief him on lots in upcoming sales weeks before the catalog goes out to the public "we get the benefit of privileged access to their knowledge " he says the appointment of the auction house officials is a departure from standard museum practice and some see it as a blurring of the lines between two traditionally separate areas of the art world "i have misgivings about the porosity between the market and museums " says max anderson the director of the indianapolis museum of art representatives of both auction houses say they dont provide any confidential information that they wouldnt share with other top collectors mr naef has also been working to ramp up the gettys photography profile this past fall the getty dramatically expanded its photography exhibition space the getty has recently been involved in two well publicized controversies one focused on its antiquities holdings and another involving the governance of its umbrella organization the getty trust neither has involved the photography department but some high spending collectors even those who dont bid anonymously have kept some distance from museums leon constantiner a retired hollywood producer with an enormous collection of the fashion photography of artists such as helmut newton richard avedon and irving penn says that while hes made some temporary loans to bostons museum of fine arts and the brooklyn art museum he rarely reaches out to museums in part this is because some museums the getty included havent invested much in newly popular categories such as fashion photography mr naef has been exploring new ways to appeal to the collectors he thinks he can reach next spring the getty will open a state of the art storage facility for color photographs mr naef is considering allowing private collectors most of whom lack adequately climate controlled facilities to store their works there on long term loan the gamble is that a fraction of those collectors might gratefully bequeath the prints to the museum mr naef says hes in conversations with two significant collectors about giving them space in the new storage facility the technique has worked for the getty before the museum secured a gift of william eggleston photographs in by first accepting them as loans from film producer caldecot chubb "we secured it by sticking our necks out and saying well house it for you " mr naef says
