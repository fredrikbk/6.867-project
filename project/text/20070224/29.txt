hot topic considering a passengers bill of rights recent winter storms that forced passengers to spend hours in grounded planes some with overflowing toilets and little food and water prompted calls in congress to enact a passengers "bill of rights " sen barbara boxer d calif has unveiled a bill that would give passengers the option to leave a plane after waiting on the runway for more than three hours unless it is about to be cleared for takeoff or ground conditions are unsafe a separate house bill would require airlines to disclose chronically delayed flights and to make an effort to return checked bags within hours congressional hearings are slated for this spring aviation consultants say any effort by congress to regulate such matters could backfire and that decisions should be left to those in the cockpit and flight control tower indeed some say regulation is part of the current problem the air transport association which represents u s carriers called on the federal aviation administration this past week to change regulations that discourage planes from returning to their gates airlines dont want pilots to return because once a plane gets out of line for takeoff it must start over at the end of the line duty time limits also discourage pilots from getting out of line because they may be ineligible to fly once they return to the gate while they receive lots of publicity lengthy runway delays are rare since some departing flights out of million have sat on the runway for five hours or more according to the bureau of transportation statistics but those numbers dont include planes that may be delayed upon arrival at their destination or if they are diverted congress considered a passengers bill of rights in but instead let airlines enforce a voluntary set of service standards which went into effect in a government report last year found weak enforcement of those guidelines the recent meltdown at jetblue airways corp has reignited the debate jetblue chief executive david neeleman apologized profusely after a new york ice storm overwhelmed the airlines flight operations canceling some flights and forcing some passengers to sit on runways for more than hours the low cost carrier which has staked its reputation on customer service will spend &# million on refunds and &# million on vouchers jetblues problems came on the heels of two storms in december that canceled and diverted hundreds of flights in dallas and denver jetblue rolled out its own customer bill of rights this past week which promises vouchers to passengers delayed by events that the airline could have avoided and capped ground waits at five hours amr corp s american airlines has set a four hour cap for grounded planes horror stories have created publicity nightmares for an industry that has only recently begun to recover from losses incurred by the sept attacks and high oil prices after the terror attacks airlines slashed flight schedules and laid off employees to match the drop in customers but as passenger volume has returned to and exceeded pre sept levels airlines flight schedules and payrolls havent kept up leaving airlines with fewer employees and flights to handle more passengers consequently customer service has decreased last year on time performance fell to its lowest level since when air travel demand hit a high performance improved when traffic declined following the sept attacks but has fallen in each of the last five years last year of domestic flights were on time compared with in and airlines lost more bags per passengers last year than in any other year in the last decade the airline industry opposes a congressionally mandated passengers bill of rights and says rigid standards could create unintended consequences including a higher rate of canceled flights rather than risk penalties for long delays for example airlines might be more willing to cancel flights further complicating travel schedules the air transport association wants to let airlines set their own standards and has proposed a meeting among carriers airports and federal regulators to draft procedures for weather emergencies the european commission implemented a series of ostensibly stringent rules two years ago that force airlines to compensate travelers for long delays or cancellations but the airlines are exempt from delays that result from security weather or mechanical problems that has let airlines deny most claims leaving consumers with little recourse beyond an expensive lawsuit brussels has promised to toughen up the directive later this year nick timiraos points of view "look were sorry were humiliated this isnt like us " david neeleman jetblue founder and ceo "are members of congress going to be
