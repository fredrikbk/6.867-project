fine wines no longer just tempt collectors investors sniff around some prime vintages drink your losses wine is trying to mature as an investment amid booming interest in alternative investments ranging from art to collectible coins wine focused investment products are starting to appear their goal cash in on soaring interest among consumers and collectors not to mention prices that are barreling ahead for fancy vintages one of the latest entrants the london based fine wine fund launched in august is structured almost like a hedge fund the highflying lightly regulated investment pools catering to wealthy investors it charges a annual management fee and keeps of the profit as a performance fee that fund follows in the footsteps of the u k based wine investment fund where the first lot of wines it bought in when the fund launched are now up about the funds strategy is to buy and warehouse cases of classic wine then sell them five years later for a profit funds like these are targeted at people with money to burn both have minimum investments of roughly &# to &# meanwhile the longstanding futures market for french bordeaux where investors can buy the most sought after wines before they are even in the bottle is bubbling with excitement futures prices have hit record levels for many of the most investment worthy wines such as chateaux mouton rothschild lafite rothschild le pin margaux and petrus futures are available online from wine merchants across the u s though prices for the same wine generally vary from shop to shop there is also a relatively new index of investment grade wine prices the liv ex or the london international vintage exchange last year the index which rose joined the list of indexes that financial information giant bloomberg lp uses to track more traditional assets such as stocks bonds and commodities the liv ex mainly tracks top bordeaux at the same time more traditional services including wine cellar operators are increasingly catering to investors not just collectors marc lazar of cellar advisors and cellar private wine storage in st louis says he has clients "who have several hundred cases stored with us bought purely on speculation " services like his have begun to spread beyond their traditional base in big cities like new york and in californias napa valley region and are expanding into dallas portland ore seattle denver and chicago investing in wine however can be sobering one big obstacle wine isnt a transparent market so prices for the identical bottle can vary wildly from one dealer to the next "there are huge inefficiencies" in pricing says steve bachmann of vinfolio inc a collector service company in san francisco a bottle of chateau ausone a highly regarded vintage sells for as little as &# and as much as &# according to wine searcher com a site that offers wine price comparisons prices vary as well in the futures market futures prices for the highly rated chateau pavie range from a low of &# a bottle at sams wines &amp spirits in chicago to &# at zachys wine in scarsdale n y then there is the counterfeiting big prices make it worthwhile for criminals to fabricate fake labels for pricey classics slap them on bottles of grog and sell them for top dollar last year a boston chemical engineer with a collection of classic wines discovered that wines supposedly once owned by thomas jefferson in the late s were forgeries with wine investing says mr lazar of cellar advisors "you have to be prepared to literally drink your losses " still there are techniques that let investors dabble in the grape without getting stomped only a tiny fraction of the worlds wine is investment worthy at sothebys of the wine auctioned is bordeaux other investment grade wines include sauternes burgundies some rhone wines from france some piedmont and so called super tuscans from italy and a limited number of "california cult" cabernet sauvignons that are so hard to obtain they sell for between &# and &# a bottle in the secondary market investors tend to focus on wines that carry a rating of or higher from respected experts such as robert parker and steven tanzer some are blue chip performers chiefly because of pedigrees that can stretch back a century or more among them chateaux latour petrus margaux mouton rothschild lafite rothschild le pin ausone and haut brion in bordeaux yquem and rieussec in sauternes and domaines romanee conti leroy roumier and others in burgundy many wine lovers end up thinking like investors almost by accident hans denbaas a retired investment banker in stamford conn says "at some point you realize you own more wine than you will ever drink if you want to preserve your liver " it is a natural next step to "start looking at the market prices" with thoughts of selling a few off mr denbaas owns some chateau haut brion a widely lauded wine he bought it years ago for less than &# a bottle today cases trade for as much as &# to &# suddenly he says youre an investor "you start to ask yourself gee whiz am i really going to pop the cork on a &# bottle " much of the recent investment euphoria was spurred by the bordeauxs which have received so much acclaim as one of the best vintages ever that prices have hit record levels for wine that is still in the barrel and a year or more from delivery bottles of chateau margaux one of the biggest names in bordeaux currently sell for about &# in the wine futures market by contrast in and also exemplary vintages bottles of margaux were released from the winery at roughly half that price several investment grade wines exist beyond the premier names mostly in bordeaux these "super second" wines include names such as chateaux lynch bages palmer leoville poyferre and others the best values the pros say are in the super seconds that have high ratings in the barrel but are still priced at less than &# a bottle californias limited number of standouts include screaming eagle harlan estates colgin and dalla valle the risk "california does not have as long a track record as bordeaux " says david sokolin of d sokolin co a wine merchant in bridgehampton ny in california the trick is finding highly regarded wines before they are discovered this can be tough although a few sites such as vinfolio com report on and rate new wines before the ratings from the big name pros come out peter morrell of new york wine merchant morrell &amp co says vintages lost in the shadows of the great years can be winners as well that ausone earned a point rating from wine rating expert mr parker yet the rated can be had for about &# a bottle "it wont appreciate to the level of the " mr morrell predicts "but it will double in price "
