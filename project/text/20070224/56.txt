pursuits leisure &amp arts lost in translation from page to stage the grapes of wrath disappoints as a new opera st paul minn "the grapes of wrath " the opera by composer ricky ian gordon and librettist michael korie that had its world premiere by the minnesota opera at the ordway center for the performing arts on feb runs close to four hours including two intermissions that shouldnt necessarily be a problem "carmen" is no shorter and john steinbecks novel the operas source is pages however in "carmen" and the steinbeck novel the cumulative power of the storytelling adds up to tragedy the opera which is an episodic string of ballads and set pieces does not in steinbecks iconic tale the joads an oklahoma family evicted from their dust bowl farm journey to what they think is the promised land of california only to discover that life is even worse there work is scarce wages are low and the thousands of "okies" are feared and hated by the locals the family dwindles and starves the novels epic scale is built of dozens of vignettes recounting their travails leaving the farm the death of grandpa crossing the desert the hooverville shantytown a strike in the peach orchard the murder of the strike leader and finally the flood that sweeps everything away woe is piled upon woe the familys name recalls the biblical job for a reason and the final scene in which young rosasharn rose of sharon whose baby was just stillborn nurses a starving man at her breast is a last desperate gasp of humanity from people who have nothing many of steinbecks episodes are included in the opera and its tone shifts back and forth from optimism however unfounded to disappointment by the time we get to act iii the pattern has become predictable a large chorus enacts the context of the familys story its members are okies strikers bank officers foreclosing on land agricultural tycoons and shyster car salesmen mr kories text written in dialect helps keep the focus on the joads centering the action on ma who carries the familys history and is determined to keep them all together her spirit and ultimately that of her daughter rosasharn prevails even as the men despair and fall away but mr gordons music which suggests the influences of aaron copland and gershwins "porgy and bess" and is almost relentlessly tuneful and edgeless is too lightweight for tragedy the composer has two modes ballad like songs of hope or lament for the principal characters and the ensemble pieces many of them snappier in tempo within these genres most of the individual songs remain set pieces and they are not different enough from one another to increase the emotional temperature of the opera over its considerable length some even seem peripheral for example the opera expands the character of noah the "slow" eldest son turning him into something more like the mentally retarded lennie from "of mice and men" and having him commit suicide instead of merely wandering off as he does in the novel in order to be one less mouth to feed it is an unnecessary piece of sentimentality and the songs of the episode noahs "i can be a help" and mas "simple child" while appealing on their own seem like padding with main characters and five additional singers who play multiple featured roles the composer had a tough job creating a musical profile for each he was most successful with ma and fortunate in mezzo deanne meek who brought strength and integrity to the role other standout performers included robert orth as feisty uncle john albeit in a somewhat softened version of steinbecks embittered character and kelly kaduce whose bright soprano gave panache to the dreamy rosasharn brian leerhubers warm baritone couldnt do much with the one dimensional portrait of tom joad and roger honeywell sounded scrappy as jim casy the lapsed preacher turned strike organizer two featured ensemble members anna jablonski and kelly markgraf made strong impressions ms jablonski as mae who celebrates the generosity of truck drivers and mr markgraf as the ragged man who warns the california bound okies about whats in store for them grant gershon ably led the large orchestra which included occasional folky touches of guitar and harmonica with a raised catwalk an overloaded old truck and rear projections that evoked classic depression photographs set designer allen moyer video designer wendall k harrington and lighting designer robert wierzel evoked the period and allowed for quick scene transitions costume designer karin kopischkes clothes were also carefully period though the joad men seemed oddly clean even late in the story director eric simonson made the sprawling evening as tight as possible and choreographer doug varone contributed a lively square dance and a "burial" sequence for rosasharns baby that looked like something from alvin ailey the opera is scheduled for the utah opera in may and for pittsburgh and houston in later seasons with perhaps some work with the blue pencil along the way houston the same weekend "the grapes of wrath" had its debut the houston grand opera finished its run of rossinis "la cenerentola " houston is now led by anthony freud who conceived the production while he was still running the welsh national opera as a co production for wales houston barcelona and geneva the productions creative team was drawn from the leadership of el comediants the barcelona theater troupe and it was a delight working with a minimalist set director joan font and designer joan guillen played cleverly with geometric shapes and candy colors in the props wigs and costumes cinderella was surrounded and protected by half a dozen actors dressed as mice with hilariously pointy face masks and long tails some directors play up the dark side of the opera here even though it appears at the end that the poor girls rescue was just a dream it was all fun the wonderful mezzo joyce didonato was lively and vocally idiomatic in the title role as her prince lawrence brownlee showed enormous promise in the punishing realm of the rossini tenor with impressive high notes and flexibility while patrick carfizzi was splendid as cinderellas hilariously self important stepfather don magnifico edoardo muller provided the serviceable conducting ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
