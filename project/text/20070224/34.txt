managers of exchange traded funds we will not be mocked john c bogle "value strategies " editorial page feb founded the vanguard group and invented the index fund saving investors countless dollars that would otherwise have been lost to high fees or sub par performance however my views diverge with mr bogles on the topic of exchange traded funds etfs he accuses the etf industry of producing gimmicky funds with narrow sector focus high intermediation costs and excessive turnover the very transgressions mr bogle accuses the etf industry of are also present in the index mutual fund world one need look no further than the cancer innovations &amp healthcare index fund offered by one sponsor to find an example of narrow sector focus also index funds that short popular market benchmarks exemplify a gimmicky strategy that was born in the index mutual fund world i think most would agree that many of the intermediation costs mr bogle lists are equally applicable to index funds as they are to etfs when comparing all in costs etfs have the advantage from my perspective their lower expense ratios especially vanguards etfs tend to outweigh trading commissions and other costs which can be quite low at discount brokerages mark armbruster c f a chief investment officer alesco advisors llc pittsford n y john bogle acknowledges that the first index mutual fund which he created was mocked and considered "flawed" when he introduced it years ago im certain he would invoke the truism that "we mock what we dont understand " well mr bogle is mocking me now "can you believe that we now have a healthshares emerging cancer etf " so i must be on to something mr bogle was derided by the status quo when he came up with a better idea of course now he is the status quo i would like to provide my rationale for health shares when mr bogle created the first vanguard index the gdp of the united states was about &# trillion in todays dollars today gdp is nearly &# trillion and health care alone is a &# trillion industry empirically we can look back at fund investing over the past years and realize that it would have been impossible to participate in all areas of the economy through the creation of a single portfolio in fact sector funds proliferated through the s and s and health care as an industry is growing at a far faster rate than the economy did over the past years it would be impossible to build one portfolio that could properly capture all the growth in this massive industry secondly health care is undergoing a massive increase in demand driven by the aging of million baby boomers now to years old and health care is undergoing a rapid improvement in technology because of the mapping of the genome and the transition from pharmacology to customized medicine much of which is being done by biotech companies owning the pharmaceutical companies does not expose the investor to the new innovations but trying to choose a portfolio of companies that will succeed is very difficult we have grouped companies by therapeutic area cancer metabolic disease cardiology and by function diagnostics enabling technologies recognizing that some companies will succeed at the expense of others but with soaring demand a portfolio of all the participants in a therapeutic area has a good chance of success i would like to add that pfizer recently reorganized its research and development activities into the same therapeutic "verticals" as are represented by our exchange traded funds jeffrey l feldman founder healthshares new york contrary to mr bogles belief the first index fund was created by barclays global investors bgi for institutional investors in as the worlds largest index manager and the global leader in etfs we have enabled investors to access our institutional indexing strength in their portfolios weve responded to what investors and their financial advisers want today better tax efficiency flexibility in trading increased transparency and access to hard to reach markets that help them diversify their portfolios etfs have attracted significant assets because they appeal to many different types of investors the vast majority of etf owners are buy and hold investors on the other hand about of the etf trading volume is done by institutional investors such as mutual funds and hedge funds for short term exposure or to hedge risks importantly this trading happens outside the fund at the stock exchanges thus long term etf investors dont subsidize the costs of active traders in etfs lee kranefuss ceo of ishares at barclays global investors san francisco see related letter "letters to the editor index funds lets not rewrite history" march
