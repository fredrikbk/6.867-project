pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece sherlock holmes still lives despite modern rivals hes the worlds favorite detective anatomy of a classic whenever i dip back into one of the sherlock holmes stories its like being reacquainted with an old friend whom id quite forgotten was so dependable and so charming the holmes stories should be standard bedside fare for every invalid because within minutes they transport you back into arthur conan doyles congenial victorian world of escapism and intrigue but what is truly remarkable about holmes is that despite countless rivals from miss marple to mma ramotswe and despite holmess almost robotic lack of emotion he remains far and away the worlds most popular detective the holmes stories have been translated into languages and still sell by the thousands with one anthology currently ranking in amazons range in fact he is every bit as popular as he was in when he first stormed onto the literary stage in a throwaway collection of christmas stories how much this novellas success must have irked the young conan doyle who was forever strapped for cash he had sold the copyright of "a study in scarlet" for only gbp conan doyle just was a bored doctor working in the south of england in between patients he dreamt up his highly eccentric hero who was based on his old mentor at edinburgh universitys medical school dr joseph bell it was bells parlor trick to be able to diagnose a patient just by appraising him from a distance and holmes was to share this quirk the first holmes book had the working title "a tangled skein " and its two protagonists were to have been dr ormond sacker a retired army surgeon and mr sherrinford holmes conan doyle had borrowed the name holmes from oliver wendell holmes sr the popular poet and father of the great jurist this word novella was rejected by cornhill magazine as well as by the publishers warne and arrowsmith before it eventually found a billet in "beetons christmas annual" and first published on dec by now the title of conan doyles first story had been changed to the much more evocative "a study in scarlet " and its stars were dr john h watson and sherlock holmes how conan doyle hit on the name "sherlock" was due to a game of cricket he commented later "i made runs at cricket against a bowler by the name of sherlock and i always had a kindly feeling for the name " all the foundations of holmess character are laid down in this first story from his bachelor pad at b baker street to his meticulous examination of crime scenes the red army was so impressed by holmess techniques that it included some of his stories in its training manuals there is also one of holmess catchphrases "the plot thickens" as well as the usual assortment of bumbling police officers ever eager to snatch all the glory as holmes remains discreetly in the background within months the public was clamoring for more and conan doyle always desperate for more cash to feed his growing brood was delighted to supply them apart from the four holmes novellas the stories were all about words tightly written and just perfect for britains burgeoning magazine market but what was unique about the holmes stories and what makes them the cornerstone of todays colossal crime fiction market is that they were the first to present a string of unrelated facts from which like a puzzle the reader could seemingly deduce the outcome over the next six years conan doyle was to flesh holmes out giving him among other things a cocaine habit and a brother mycroft but it didnt take long for conan doyle to become heartily sick of holmes who though he paid the bills never had enough literary gravitas for his creator conan doyle later wrote "i have had such an overdose of holmes that i feel towards him as i do towards pate de foie gras of which i once ate too much so that the name of it gives me a sickly feeling to this day " so it was that in after just short stories and two novellas that holmes was killed off in "the final problem " plunging to his death with prof moriarty at the reichenbach falls conan doyle cannot have conceived the huge outbreak of national mourning that erupted after holmess death grown men were wearing black armbands women wore veils and even the royal family bemoaned the loss of britains finest detective it must have been with a heavy heart that conan doyle reprised holmes in with "the hound of the baskervilles" though it did help earn him a knighthood its true that conan doyle became ever more sloppy and cavalier with the details and these have proved a fertile hunting ground for the hundreds of holmes societies that have sprung up world wide since his death in theres one hilarious gaffe in "the adventure of the speckled band" where the star billing is given to "a swamp adder the deadliest snake in india " the fact that no such snake exists prompted one aficionado to draw up a two page table of the most likely suspects these enthusiasts constantly debate the reasons for holmess unending popularity putting it down to everything from the characters gentlemanly ways to the works idealized portrait of victorian england for myself im quite happy to go with the fact that the holmes stories are great yarns well told more than that though the indomitable holmes with his lair his genius and his eccentricities is the very benchmark of our modern day
