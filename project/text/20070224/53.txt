pursuits home growth plays biotech goes to the garden genetically modified ornamental plants are in the works the challenge now avoiding the frankenflowers label petunias that survive frost impatiens that shrug off drought disease free geraniums they sound like dream plants for gardeners but they also present a major challenge for the gardening industry thats because these "miracle" flowers now in the works thanks to a new alliance between a german plant company and a california start up are the product of genetic engineering ornamental plants that have had their dna juggled could spark the same backlash created by genetically altered food crops such as corn and soybeans the broader debate over genetic engineering touches on science politics and deeply held beliefs and the last thing the horticulture business needs is accusations that it is selling "frankenflowers " sales by the u s garden industry have been flat to down the past few years despite all those new houses with unlandscaped lawns some in the business blame young homeowners lack of time but others believe some would be gardeners give up too soon when their first attempts fail genetically engineered plants that are easier to grow could keep those novices in the game i was lucky when i began gardening eight years ago because blessed by good soil and adequate rain i had few plant failures but genetically enhanced plants could make a difference provided they are shown to have no detrimental side effects for friends who have been turned off to gardening for life by one bad season so far about the only genetically engineered ornamental plants on the market are carnations that have been injected with a petunia gene to give them purplish blue hues not seen in nature but these are sold only as cut flowers several obstacles have made it tough to genetically enhance flowers and shrubs chief among them is the high cost of the technology and the requirement to license the patents behind the genetic techniques since the ornamental plant business is a fraction of the size of the agricultural one these costs cant be spread over enough seeds or young plants to make the proposition viable one promising start up that tried to create new flower varieties with genetic engineering novaflora of philadelphia gave up a few years ago "the biggest roadblock we ran into was the barriers to intellectual property " says michael dobres novafloras chief executive now it has turned to a technique called mutagenesis in which it scrambles the genes that naturally occur in plants to create new varieties the new german u s alliance hopes to overcome the roadblocks by linking selecta klemm which sells starter plants to wholesale growers in the u s and elsewhere with mendel biotechnology of california which holds the rights to key genetic engineering techniques mendel shares patents and technology with monsanto a giant in the world of genetically engineered crop plants selecta began preliminary work with mendel more than four years ago says christian klemm selectas chief financial officer on jan the two companies launched ornamental bioscience which mr klemm runs from its stuttgart germany headquarters he says the joint venture has three advantages over earlier ones one is its access to key patents and technology through mendel and monsanto the second is its work with florigene the australian company that developed the purplish blue carnation third is its strategy it aims to produce clear functional benefits for commercial growers and consumers such as tougher more reliable plants not just novel flower colors or shapes ornamental bioscience aims to switch on existing genes that are dormant such as those that could make plants more resistant to cold or drought rather than deploy the more controversial techniques used in genetically engineered food crops the company has turned on certain genes in petunias and poinsettias and is growing the plants in greenhouses to determine if the transformed plants are in fact more tolerant of frost cold air or drought "we have no reason to believe it doesnt work " mr klemm says of course gardeners farmers and scientists have been manipulating the genes in plants for hundreds of years by crossbreeding varieties for desirable traits usually by transferring pollen from one plant to another in some ways what ornamental bioscience is doing is a continuation of that trend still ornamental bioscience faces a long road to get such plants on the market it must obtain regulatory approvals and then persuade plant growers and consumers that the new varieties are worth to more mr klemm estimates these hurdles have turned off other big players in the garden world including ball seed the largest u s company in the business "there are just better ways we could spend our research dollars " says a ball spokeswoman then there are the groups opposed to genetic engineering it seems to me their concerns may be misplaced here since most people dont eat flowers food safety isnt an issue and since ornamental plants are raised in much smaller quantities than corn or soybeans often inside greenhouses its much less likely that they would "escape" into the wild but theres one legitimate worry these new plants could crowd out naturally occurring varieties we need to make sure the plant industry doesnt come up with another kudzu that "miracle" plant that now smothers much of the south "my gut instinct would be that assuming there isnt some highly public campaign against genetic manipulation most people would not be terribly upset about the idea of a frost resistant petunia " says michael fernandez executive director of the pew initiative on food and biotechnology which calls itself a neutral source of information on genetically modified plants and that could turn gardening into a more sure fire pursuit email me at bart ziegler wsj com how its made re engineering the rose here are three examples of scientists efforts to modify the genetic makeup of common flowers unusual colors florigene inserted a gene from a blue petunia to create bluish purple carnations now available as cut flowers the australian company is using a similar technique to create a blue rose hardiness ornamental bioscience of germany aims to make petunias that arent killed by frost poinsettias that are tolerant of cold air and impatiens that can survive drought all by "turning on" genes for traits that are latent in the plants new looks novaflora of philadelphia is devising new roses by scrambling their genes a process called mutagenesis it has created a multipetaled version of the popular knock out rose which is several years from the market
