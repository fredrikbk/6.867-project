pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations a surmountable hill republicans and conservatives have been trying to sink mrs clinton for years but she keeps bob bob bobbing along "oh those clinton haters whats wrong with them " only a democrat could hurt her and a democrat just did hollywood titan david geffen who now supports barack obama this week famously retagged the clintons as an ivy league bonnie and clyde bill is "reckless " hillary relentless "god knows is there anybody more ambitious than hillary " in an interview that seemed like an audience with the new york timess maureen dowd mr geffen said "everybody in politics lies but they do it with such ease its troubling " in this he was knowingly or unknowingly echoing bob kerrey the former nebraska senator who said in of the then president "clintons an unusually good liar unusually good do you realize that " mr kerrey suffered for the remark and was shunned within his party for a while but didnt retract in her column ms dowd labeled the campaign operation "hillary inc " but mr geffen got closer to the heart of it it is the clinton "machine" and it "is going to be very unpleasant and unattractive and effective " hes probably about to find out how true that is mr geffen should be braced for a lot of bad personal box office negative press searching profiles strained relations were probably about to see if the clinton machine can flatten him little doubt it will try john dickerson wrote in slate this week of bill clinton generously sharing his campaign wisdom "your opponent cant talk when he has your fist in his mouth " among some democratic political professionals this kind of talk is considered tough and knowing as opposed to say startlingly belligerent and crude but the outcome of the geffen clinton episode is worthy of watching because it is going to determine whether it is remembered as the moment in the campaign when it became clear you are allowed to criticize hillary or as the moment it became clear you are not howard wolfson mrs clintons spokesman and an emerging dark prince among political operatives he is in the strange way of washington admired by journalists for his ability to mislead them quickly responded with a challenge if mr obama is a good man hell renounce mr geffen and give back the money he contributed in his famous hollywood fund raiser this was widely considered a brilliant move is it now everyone who follows politics even cursorily will have to have an opinion on whether mr obama should apologize which means theyll have to know exactly what mr geffen said which again boiled down is ive known them intimately for almost years and theyre bad people and bringers of trouble its good for mrs clinton that america is going to spend the weekend discussing this its good that mr geffens comments which focused on the area on which she is most touchy and most vulnerable the character issue will be aired over and over again mr wolfson might have been better off with "were sorry to hear it as mrs clinton thinks the world of david " mrs clinton has never gone after a fellow democrat quite the way shes going after mr obama and its an indication of how threatened she is not only by his candidacy but one suspects his freshness he makes her look like yesterday he makes her look like the old slash and burn i doubted he could do her serious damage now i wonder what mrs clinton is trying to establish is this to criticize her to speak of her critically as a human being as a person with a record and a history and a style and attitudes is ipso facto to be dirty and low and destructive to air and raise questions about who she is how she operates and what can be inferred from her past actions is by definition an unjust act but americans have always always looked at and judged the character and personality of their candidates for president and they have been right to do so it mattered that lincoln was honest abe washington had no personal lust for power that fdr was an optimist and a manipulator that adams was a man of rectitude and no small amount of stubbornness these facts these aspects of their nature had policy implications and leadership implications they couldnt be more pertinent they still are at the democratic forum in carson city nev on tuesday abcs george stephanopoulos asked mrs clinton if mr obama should renounce mr geffens remarks she answered "i want to run a positive campaign" and referred to "the politics of personal destruction " every time she gets in a spot she pulls that one out and for good reason it has always worked it works because it confuses people is this the boys beating up the girl are they sticking her pigtails in the ink well is geffen mean if obama is nice shouldnt he make sure everyone is nice its not so much a diversion as a non sequitur mrs clinton is like the little girl who steals the boy next doors candy and hits him on the head with a hammer he runs "mommy she stole my snickers and hit me on the head " she turns to the mother hammer in hand and gestures at the boy "this is the politics of personal destruction " as i say its always worked in the past the question is will it work in the future one senses one thing that is new in the nevada forum mrs clinton had a hard act to follow when she came on after sen chris dodd who spoke with energy and concentration and whose look is striking sort of old american ethnic in a brooks brothers suit hes like a cardinal with his thick white hair and furious eyebrows he hit the crowds erogenous zones on iraq and took a hard shot at mrs clinton "why is it so hard to say youre sorry " mrs clinton came out after him and amid the geffen flap so its not surprising that she was a little off her game she spoke the way she speaks "renew the promise of america give people the services and support they need hardworking families" but the flat voice seemed flatter more grating she seemed diminished by the fact that the event hadnt been built around her didnt star her wasnt arranged by her there were other people there other candidates on the stage and she looked like she was in a contest for a change usually mrs clinton is a tough little tank but on tuesday she seemed less large less formidable if only for a moment less inevitable
