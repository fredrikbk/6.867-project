pursuits books writers block a short story master tales of chekhov by anton chekhov ecco press volumes &# anton chekhov is best known in this country as a dramatist barely a season goes by without a new translation adaptation or interpretation of one of his century old plays appearing on or off broadway even as i write rave reviews are wafting over from london about an exciting new production of "the seagull " yet in the context of chekhovs life the plays were a late footnote to an extraordinarily fecund career as a writer of short stories the most recent reminder of the sheer size of his oeuvre comes in the form of ecco presss "tales of chekhov " a volume edition of stories though even this boxed paperback collection does not do full justice to chekhovs output the true size of that output may never be known for chekhov began by writing for comic weeklies and used a pseudonym for five years but its clear that there are well over stories altogether including some "the duel " "the steppe" virtually of novel length and dozens of longer stories that we would now term novellas this treasure trove includes much anthologized gems that almost any literate person will recognize "the kiss " "gooseberries " "the lady with the toy dog" the last encapsulating the tragedy of a russian madame bovary in half the pages needed by flaubert but these stories just hint at the riches to come such as the masterpieces "ward no " about a provincial doctor tending mental patients who ends up going insane himself and "in the ravine " relating the implacable rise of a family of rapacious peasants at the expense of all decency and morality in these stories and in a huge variety of tales about everyday life in th century russia "the grasshopper " "neighbors " "vanka" the list goes on and on chekhov managed to encompass every social class and every kind of individual from aristocrats and landowners to janitors and peasants from sick old men to innocent children in doing so he furnished a panoramic portrait of his country and its people that in its variety and comprehensiveness surpasses even those of his more famous compatriots tolstoy and dostoevsky chekhov more even than edgar allan poe or maupassant his rivals for the title has come to be regarded as the true father of the modern short story a primacy acknowledged explicitly or through imitation by numerous modern masters of the form ranging from joyce and hemingway through sherwood anderson and flannery oconnor to eudora welty and raymond carver as richard ford writes in his introduction to this collection the russian stories "feel so modern to us are so much of our own time and mind " because they have been so often copied ecco has solicited similarly heartfelt tributes from writers as diverse as nadine gordimer robert stone cynthia ozick and john barth whose comments decorate the back covers of the collections individual volumes all this evokes gratitude to ecco for republishing these paperback volumes to mark the companys th anniversary in publishing here are spanking new book covers beautifully designed cleverly illustrated and packed into a neat presentation box at &# a throw a closer look though provokes misgivings about what we are getting inside this shiny package the first tip off comes in the form of an archaic looking typeface for the text of the stories quite different from the modern typeface of the title and contents pages its plain that were looking at text reproduced from a very old edition a step that presumably saves the publisher the cost of typesetting but even more significant the stories in this edition come to us in the dated and rattling translations done just over a century ago by constance garnett this is not to slight garnett the british woman who almost single handedly introduced th century russian literature to english speaking readers translating virtually every th century russian prose author of note not only tolstoy but also dostoevsky not only turgenev but also goncharov not only ostrovsky but also gogol and herzen and of course chekhov she was part of that remarkable generation of outstanding english translators that began with richard burton and edward fitzgerald and ended with c k scott moncrieff proust and edwin and willa muir kafka they enlarged the tastes and widened the literary horizon of the english speaking world like her compatriots garnett was brilliant at times especially in her translations of the westernized francophone turgenev his lyrical effusions and flowing sentences suited her romantic temperament perfectly her tolstoy was good her gogol and dostoevsky terrible but it hardly mattered when she was pioneering their work in a language as important as english as for chekhov her translations were middling good when it came to his melancholy landscapes but poor when this upper middle class bloomsbury lady was confronted by chekhovs earthy dialogue moreover his precision of language essential in a short story put an intolerable strain on her limited knowledge of russian there are those who will not hear of this such as janet malcolm whose recent book "reading chekhov " drew exclusively on the garnett translations from an earlier ecco press edition ms malcolm clings to the notion that since garnett was writing closer in time to chekhov than most other translators she was closer to his spirit there is something to this but it is painful in to hear characters exclaiming "upon my soul" and "the devil take you" or school principals giving their pupils a "wigging " classic authors dont age with time but translations do which is why we have translations of homer and virgil and dante from every age if not from every generation its undeniably nice to have stories by chekhov in a compact edition and undeniably true that chekhovs glowing humanity and incomparable skill can overcome almost any translation but it would have been infinitely preferable had ecco seized the moment to have the stories retranslated or if the publisher was committed to the garnett translations for intellectual and not financial reasons ecco might have commissioned a contemporary translator at least to revise them and repair the mistakes much as terrence kilmartin did with moncrieffs proust the modern library did exactly this with some of garnetts turgenev translations and those are her best unfortunately "tales of chekhov" is unworthy of eccos innovative past the boxed set is meant to celebrate the companys th year in operation and the project cannot be rescued by richard fords introduction to the first volume only by the token chronologies at the back of volume or by the jazzy covers the collection squanders a golden opportunity to present chekhov in his full glory as a short story writer for english readers in the st century mr scammell recently co founded the center for literary translation at columbia university his biography of arthur koestler will be published by random house next year
