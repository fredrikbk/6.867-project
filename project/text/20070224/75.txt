the weekend interview with donald tsang tsangfroid hong kong remember june that afternoon the citys last colonial governor chris patten blinked back tears as the british flag was lowered from its flagpole at government house at that night red fireworks exploded over victoria harbor while hong kongs good and great sat down to dine in a grand hall chinas jiang zemin arrived later glowing as asias "world city" was returned to its mainland mother after the stroke of midnight a strong peoples liberation army contingent marched over the border soon followed by more a brutish touch a hint of things to come no one knew nearly years later donald tsang the current chief executive knows hes part of a grand juggling act protecting hong kongs cherished freedoms while integrating the place carefully its hard work doing the best that we can hell tell you into the mainlands booming economy nowhere is this more evident than from mr tsangs campaign office from which the chief executive is steering another bid for high office next month tucked on an upper floor of one of hong kongs soaring office towers the entrance to mr tsangs nerve center boasts no campaign photographs of the bow tied impeccably attired cantonese civil servant the walls are bare and not a single policy leaflet graces the shelves granted the office had been opened only two weeks prior to our interview but the sterility of what should be a raucous debate in a democracy only reinforces the reality mr tsang is "running" for "re election" in a rigged campaign where beijing still picks the winner "heres my card " he says entering the windowless conference room where i and my colleague from new york melanie kirkpatrick are seated a tidy little number the specially printed campaign business card "donald tsang candidate" boasts contact details in english and chinese plus a cursive slogan that seems scrawled as an afterthought "ill get the job done " "it will be a collectors item someday " mr tsang jokes settling into his chair the slogan is apt mr tsang has spent nearly years in the civil service preparing to bridge east and west knighted in he no longer uses the "sir" he was appointed by beijing in to serve out the term of the former chief executive tung chee hwa whom beijings party elders encouraged to resign when the hong kong people marched through the streets for full democracy hong kong can do what it likes the thinking goes so long as it doesnt make a fuss chinas leadership has far more pressing problems to worry about rioting peasants in the countryside corruption permeating its ranks a nuclear north korea than the humming affluent dot on its southeastern flank mr tsang a former financial secretary has focused his energies on the economy and thats a good place we agree to start our discussion given that hong kong just rolled up the no slot for the th year running in the heritage foundation wall street journals "index of economic freedom " so how has hong kong influenced maybe even led the mainland down the capitalist road since hands clasped mr tsang thinks for a moment on these "serious and deep" questions "opening up is the answer following the road map charted out by deng xiaoping " mr tsang says "so in the context of hong kong it will be wrong to assume that this little tail is wagging the big dog it is not " but hong kong he explains is the most effective "broker the bridge the gateway for the nation as a whole " surely last year proved his point for the first time the flood of mainland chinese companies selling stock on hong kongs stock exchange pushed volumes above those of new york and london hedge funds poured into the city eager to base themselves in a place with civil law in more ways than one when compared to the mainlands corrupted bench and an english speaking labor force most important hong kong cemented its place as a testing ground for chinas capital account liberalization the mainlands domestic currency the renminbi circulates in a limited way in hong kong shops accept it hong kongers can open savings accounts in it and mainland companies can issue renminbi denominated bonds in the territory "all this is taking place its the only place outside the mainland of china where these activities are allowed " the chief executive emphasizes in a rare moment of emotion "right here " in hong kong today "you see how renminbi on a limited scale can move in the free market environment of hong kong " the chief executive dreams of the day when the floodgates will open up and the cash gushes out of china into hong kongs banks mutual funds and businesses "this will come this will come " he affirms all this adds to up to a vision for hong kong as a nexus for capital not unlike that of london for europe or new york for the americas a city in the south china sea devoted to servicing chinas rising middle classes "we need three financial centers because most of us agree that we have to work eight hours a day " mr tsang quips that plan is already being echoed by chinas rubber stamp legislature the national peoples congress which included hong kong in its five year plan for the first time last year mr tsang recites the text verbatim the leadership he says sees hong kong as "a center for international finance trade and shipping aviation" the chinese language characters for shipping and aviation are conveniently the same mr tsangs eagerness to bet hong kongs future on the mainland is genuine he is undoubtedly a chinese patriot but why should this capitalist city scramble to join the communist partys five year industrial plan other actions too hint that the hong kong government is starting to stray from the free market policies that made it so rich last year mr tsangs administration proposed a new consumption tax started debating a minimum wage and embarked on rhetoric of leveling societal "inequalities " the chief executive himself publicly disavowed the policy of "positive noninterventionism " the term coined by one of hong kongs financial secretaries to describe the territorys famously laissez faire approach an action for which this newspaper and the late economics nobel laureate milton friedman chastised him "you were wrong " mr tsang replied staring me right in the eye "its a slogan " hong kong still has the freest economy by a mile its public sector takes up of total gdp total public spending isnt allowed to exceed of gdp even if the government tried to impose european like safety nets on the public the rise in taxes would never be tolerated the consumption tax proposal was met with a public outcry "we want small government and a big market " mr tsang explains "we facilitate what the market does " and what does facilitate mean exactly "when for instance people believe mary emphasis on my name the mainland should be the next target of action i will lead a delegation into the mainland making sure that any trade barriers could be removed for them i go in there and try to do things for them " why i wonder is the same zeal for sealing business deals not applied to the hong kong peoples wish for universal suffrage in and over a half million of them marched for the full democracy promised to them by the mini constitution called the basic law that mr patton and the british left behind the current setup is far from perfect it includes a twisted system for electing the legislative branch and the chief executive that effectively gives beijing veto power over the latter but regardless of the silent overlord this year a challenger to mr tsang managed to garner enough official nominations to stand for chief executive an event that has given an electric charge to the democracy movement how does it feel to have a challenger "its allowed for in our electoral arrangements " mr tsang answers dryly "and its giving our people a little more fun a little more fireworks but it doesnt mean that even if i were the only candidate running that i would not be providing a manifesto " the chief executive is a list man focused on process he dismisses opposition candidate alan leong as a "single issue man" who "just says universal suffrage universal suffrage universal suffrage " mr tsang seems perplexed by such a stance noting that his city already enjoys freedoms other democracies have such as freedom of assembly freedom of religion and freedom of the press "in hong kong weve got all those things " mr tsang declares "we want democracy for the sake of political participation so as a purist form we should consider it carefully but it must not be achieved at the expense of what they already got " why would universal suffrage threaten freedoms wouldnt a degree of public accountability impel the chief executive to follow the "will of the people" a favorite phrase more closely mr tsang answers immediately beijing "supports democracy as a principal enshrined in the constitution but i think they want to be sure theyre not doing it at the expense of stability and prosperity " read authoritarian regimes are afraid of placing control in the hands of the people they could publicly protest or elect an independently minded chief executive or as mr tsang notes they could declare independence as in the case of taiwan mr tsang has now spent almost a decade working under the chinese flag versus under the union jack how is it different surprisingly interactions with the mother ship are "less than before " he confides "no faxes no telegrams " he may consult closely on political reform with the local representative office of the central government but for now mr tsangs administration operates the territorys economy independently from that of the mainland so theres less reason to call for advice "the style of operation is very different " mr tsang says "we are dealing with people in the same nation but it requires a perquisite of mutual trust and faith but once we have built up a sense of trust between ourselves and the mainland it seems that you can achieve quite a lot a lot more than before " within limits that is as we wait for the elevator next to those empty shelves where election campaign pamphlets might sit the limits of mr tsangs ability to "get the job done" seem clear ms kissel is editorial page editor of the wall street journal asia
