starbucks chairman says trouble may be brewing brand could be compromised schultzs blunt memo warns time to get back to the core starbucks corp built its broad appeal on what chairman howard schultz labeled an "experience " including baristas who know customers orders by heart and an atmosphere that entices patrons to linger for hours that experience has enabled the coffee chain to charge the premium prices that fuel its robust earnings growth but now mr schultz is questioning whether starbucks drive for growth and efficiency has diluted that experience in a blunt feb memo he warned executives that the chain may be commoditizing its brand and making itself more vulnerable to competition from other coffee shops and fast food chains the nearly word memo questioned whether starbucks automatic espresso machines new store designs and elimination of some in store coffee grinding may have compromised the "romance and theatre" of a visit the criticisms pinpoint starbucks biggest challenge mr schultz the companys resident visionary wants starbucks to become one of the worlds most recognized brands with locations around the globe or more than triple its current count of about but to do that starbucks must improve its efficiencies and make other changes that threaten to erode the virtues that made it so successful which in turn could jeopardize its ability to charge premium prices "over the past ten years in order to achieve the growth development and scale necessary to go from less than stores to stores and beyond we have had to make a series of decisions that in retrospect have lead sic to the watering down of the starbucks experience and what some might call the commoditization of our brand " mr schultz wrote in the memo "many of these decisions were probably right at the time and on their own merit would not have created the dilution of the experience but in this case the sum is much greater and unfortunately much more damaging than the individual pieces " starbucks spokeswoman valerie oneil confirmed that mr schultz wrote the memo she said it reflects his "passion" and is "a reminder of how success is not an entitlement " she said the company hadnt yet implemented any changes as a result of mr schultzs memo nevertheless even before mr schultz sent the memo starbucks executives had conceded there was a risk that its expansion would move the company away from its roots "if we just become about products and not about the people side i think the experience changes and changes for the worse " jim alling president of starbucks u s business said in an early february interview "we never want to lose sight of where we came from " the concern comes as starbucks faces intensified competition from mcdonalds corp which has upgraded its coffee and dunkin brands inc s dunkin donuts which sells espresso drinks and is plotting a nationwide expansion in recent years as both those fast food chains have added starbucks like touches starbucks has become more like a fast food chain adding drive through windows hot food and promotions for movies on its lattes mr schultz declined to comment for this article he sent the memo in an email with the subject line "the commoditization of the starbucks experience " it then appeared on the web site starbucksgossip com although not starbucks founder mr schultz is responsible for building the company into the coffee empire it is today he led the chain to blanket the u s with outlets starting in the s and to expand overseas and he also has steered it to growth through music and movie collaborations starbucks steady sales and earnings growth have made the companys shares soar since it went public in starbucks said net income for the quarter ended dec came to &# million or cents a share up from &# million or cents a share a year earlier sales rose to &# billion from &# billion shares of starbucks have fallen about in the past year they fell cents in nasdaq trading yesterday to close at &# after growing up poor in a brooklyn housing project mr schultz left his job as a salesman and moved to seattle to join starbucks in he envisioned expanding the niche brewer of strong coffee beyond the pacific northwest by bringing the romance of italian coffee bars and their espresso to starbucks so it would become an enticing gathering place mr schultz has sometimes bristled at changes that were part and parcel of the massive expansion he orchestrated when an executive suggested starbucks start offering nonfat milk for its espresso drinks mr schultz initially refused out of concern the drinks would taste thin he went along after watching a customer in jogging gear walk out of a starbucks because she couldnt get nonfat milk in her drink last fall starbucks said it would add hot egg and cheese breakfast sandwiches in part to attract customers who went to competitors to eat starbucks executives conceded there was a danger the sandwiches would make customers think of starbucks as a fast food restaurant to prevent that the company included more sophisticated combinations including eggs florentine and tomato parmesan when workers first tried cooking the sandwiches cheese sometimes dripped off them and into the warming oven sending a strong odor of burned cheese through the cafes mr schultz complained when he walked into a starbucks near the companys seattle headquarters and smelled a burning sandwich according to a manager at the store starbucks switched ovens and told workers to clean them regularly more than one quarter of starbucks stores now have drive through windows and starbucks says that over the next two years that will grow to one third of stores at her seattle store shift supervisor tanisha jones says she concocts nicknames for drive through customers based on their cars to make them feel the same warmth employees try to convey inside the stores one customer who drives a mini cooper now orders the "mini cooper special " and ms jones has instructed workers that that means a quadruple grande americano with cream "its almost a hook to keep him from going to another coffee shop " she says in his memo mr schultz wrote that when in recent years the company switched to automatic espresso machines which have been used in some stores for at least five years and currently are in thousands of outlets "we solved a major problem in terms of speed of service and efficiency at the same time we overlooked the fact that we would remove much of the romance and theatre " starbucks used to have all its baristas pull espresso shots by hand that move "became even more damaging" because the new automatic machines "blocked the visual sight line the customer previously had to watch the drink being made and for the intimate experience with the barista " he wrote mr schultz wrote that starbucks switched to "flavor locked packaging" for its coffees that eliminated the task of scooping fresh coffee from bins in stores and grinding it in front of customers "we achieved fresh roasted bagged coffee but at what cost " mr schultz wrote "the loss of aroma perhaps the most powerful non verbal signal we had in our stores " mr schultz also wrote that streamlining the store design process had created "stores that no longer have the soul of the past some people even call our stores sterile cookie cutter " he wrote some starbucks stores no longer have coffee grinders or coffee filters "in fact i am not sure people today even know we are roasting coffee you certainly cant get the message from being in our stores " the memo says "while the current state of affairs for the most part is self induced that has lead sic to competitors of all kinds small and large coffee companies fast food operators and mom and pops to position themselves in a way that creates awareness and loyalty of people who previously have been starbucks customers this must be eradicated " he wrote some customers have noticed brad luyster a year old marketing manager from canal fulton ohio says he used to seek out a starbucks each morning to get a cup of coffee because he likes the atmosphere but he was disappointed when he recently ordered a bacon and egg sandwich at a starbucks in chicago the taste of the sandwich was fine he says it just didnt fit the experience at the end of his memo mr schultz said he took full responsibility for the decisions starbucks has made "we desperately need to look into the mirror and realize its time to get back to the core " he wrote "i have said for years that our success is not an entitlement and now its proving to be a reality " see related letters "letters to the editor no romance please just the coffee and quickly" march
