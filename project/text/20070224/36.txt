mortgage bond pioneer dislikes what he sees as a star wall street trader more than two decades ago lewis ranieri helped create a vast new business selling bonds backed by millions of americans home loan payments today that business has gone through what mr ranieri calls a "staggering" transformation and he doesnt like some of what he sees the rumpled year old says he is worried about the proliferation of risky mortgages and convoluted ways of financing them too many investors dont understand the dangers it isnt that mr ranieri is risk averse the best selling book "liars poker" celebrated his billion dollar trades in these bonds along with his polyester suits and the junk food "feeding frenzies" by him and his trading desk partners at the old salomon brothers where he worked their innovation combining regular mortgages into giant pools of loans that could be divided up and resold as bonds to pension funds and other institutional investors these bonds come with a variety of credit ratings and are repackaged in endless permutations to meet investors varying appetites for risk the problem he says is that in the past few years the business has changed so much that if the u s housing market takes another lurch downward no one will know where all the bodies are buried "i dont know how to understand the ripple effects through the system today " he said during a recent seminar the brooklyn born mr ranieri who today is a fund manager has a long perspective on mortgages and wall street he got his start in the s when he was years old with a job in the salomon brothers mailroom after a spell trading utility bonds he joined salomons embryonic mortgage securities desk in when the idea of mortgages as big money spinners was far fetched within a few years salomon was making immense profits trading mortgages after rising to become a vice chairman at salomon mr ranieri was pushed out in amid a clash of personalities salomon itself was eventually swallowed into what is now citigroup inc mr ranieri later helped rescue savings and loan institutions after interest rate gyrations created huge losses in the s and built up his own mortgage investment firm mr ranieri who today doesnt seem preoccupied with reliving his younger days as a mortgage trading star says he has never read "liars poker " the memoir that made him famous beyond the mortgage market when the book came out in he says "i had left the firm salomon and i was attempting to turn the page " the industry he helped to create is immense and its investors scattered across the globe as of dec there were about &# trillion of u s mortgage securities outstanding easily exceeding the &# trillion of u s treasury securities until the past few years the business was dominated by fannie mae and freddie mac the two government sponsored providers of funding for home loans but they have lost their dominance amid accounting scandals at the same time investors in mortgage backed bonds became lulled by the real estate boom into buying loans that would have been unthinkable a few years ago the housing boom kept loan losses unusually low because borrowers who got into trouble could easily sell their homes for a profit or refinance into a cheaper mortgage many "subprime" borrowers people with weak credit records bought homes with no down payments more than of subprime borrowers last year werent required to produce pay stubs or other proof of their income and assets according to credit suisse group at the same time some lenders have become more reliant on computer models to estimate the value of homes "were not really sure what the guys income is and were not sure what the house is worth " says mr ranieri who now runs his own investment businesses in uniondale n y "so you can understand why some of us become a little nervous " in recent months amid a surge in early defaults lenders have become much more cautious insisting on down payments and doing more diligent checks of a prospective borrowers income those changes are too late to save many loans granted in and during the boom investment banks promoted new instruments that made it easy for more investors to dabble in mortgages chief among these is the collateralized debt obligation or cdo money managers set up cdos which raise money by selling notes and shares to investors the proceeds are used to buy a wide variety of mortgage securities the target market insurers pension funds and other investors that lack the time or expertise to choose individual mortgage securities instead they can buy into a cdo just as a stock market investor gets immediate diversification by buying a mutual fund cdos which are particularly popular with asian and european institutional investors have become huge buyers of the riskier slices of mortgage securities the high yielding portions that suffer some of the first losses if mortgage defaults are higher than initially expected one concern mr ranieri says is that it isnt clear exactly which investors hold lots of the riskiest slices and whether they understand those risks investors in cdos dont get as much information about the collateral backing their investments thousands of homes scattered across america as do traditional specialist buyers of individual mortgage securities he says adding to the complexity cdos also often invest in other cdos putting another layer of opaqueness between investors and their collateral cdos arent bad per se but can bring mortgage exposure to "a much less sophisticated community " mr ranieri says cdo investors rely heavily on ratings from firms like standard &amp poors to guide them but mr ranieri says he believes the rating agencies are struggling to keep up with the rapid changes in mortgage finance "its almost overwhelming " he says officials at s&amp p a mcgraw hill cos unit say they are keeping up with the changes and have more than analysts monitoring cdos mr ranieri isnt predicting armageddon some of the riskier new types of mortgages probably will perform "horribly" in terms of defaults leading to losses for some investors but he says the "vast majority" of mortgages outstanding are based on sounder lending principles and should be fine
