budget boom states set big spending plans as washington preaches austerity washington may currently be focused on fiscal austerity but a major spending spree is shaping up in the states as local legislators abandon a half decade of fiscal conservatism to pursue bigger budgets from new york to montana to california states are proposing budget increases that outpace inflation and far exceed the rise in domestic outlays outside of defense and homeland security that president bush recently proposed in his fiscal federal budget in montana gov brian schweitzer is cutting taxes and boosting spending by over two years including &# million for new "meth prisons" that blend incarceration with intensive drug rehab for those convicted of methamphetamine crimes in vermont gov jim douglas wants to borrow &# million to create "the nations first e state " where free wireless broadband is available to all and in arizona the only dispute between a democratic governor and a republican legislature over a half billion dollar road repair program is whether to borrow the money or pay cash the binge is bipartisan last year the massachusetts legislature approved a &# billion universal health care plan under republican gov mitt romney who is now running for president this year at least ten states most notably republican arnold schwarzeneggers california are weighing similar programs but thats just one of many areas where state governments are seeking to expand services that were long considered distant dreams by advocates universal prekindergarten is being championed by several incoming democratic governors such as new yorks eliot spitzer deval patrick of massachusetts and mike beebe of arkansas democratic leaders in colorado and pennsylvania and several other states want to create funds for state "energy independence " many of these proposals will be topics of conversation at the national governors associations annual meeting which begins in washington today the new state activism is driven in part by the bush administrations budgetary focus on iraq defense and homeland security which leaves states to grapple with domestic concerns on their own higher tax receipts and growth in energy royalties from higher oil and natural gas prices have also left many states flush but even states faced with declining revenue are mulling ways to ramp up spending not with unpopular tax increases but by privatizing valuable public assets in return for big slugs of cash michigan and illinois among others are looking at selling off their lotteries while missouri is considering doing the same with its student loan portfolio the growing popularity of health care programs and higher teacher salaries raises the risk that states giddy from surging revenue may be in danger of expanding beyond their means using short term windfalls to create new long term obligations at a time when tax increases remain unpopular with voters it was just a few years ago that states last found themselves in financial dire straits in the early s many state governments were hit hard by recession and constitutional requirements to balance budgets reluctant to unwind fresh tax rollbacks states were forced not only to cease creating new services but also to cut back on many basics such as road repairs and prisons in the national governors association reported that states collectively were undergoing the worst budget crisis since world war ii even after their economies and revenue streams recovered in the middle part of the decade state governments concentrated on building surpluses and kept spending relatively in check but now many states are returning to their old ways along with spending more several governors are proposing hefty tax cuts as well like many governors arizona democratic gov janet napolitano faced a looming budget shortfall &# billion in her case when she took office in now thanks to strong economic growth surging sales tax revenue and low unemployment the state has &# million in reserves for fiscal year ms napolitano has proposed a &# billion budget that calls for a increase in spending on top of the increase last year the extra money allows ms napolitano to put tens of millions of dollars toward her priorities pay raises for teachers more for state universities and &# million for projects to train and attract high tech workers and businesses "somewhere out there is the next microsoft " ms napolitano said "id just as soon that it be in phoenix or tucson " montanas mr schweitzer who also faced an austere outlook when he first took office is now enjoying a &# billion surplus largely due to higher tax revenues on capital gains and energy production as he sees it states spend nearly all of their money to "educate medicate and incarcerate " his two year &# billion budget boosts spending on all three legislative analysts peg the budget increase at mr schweitzer excludes the rainy day fund and payments towards pension obligations and says the jump is closer to the states prison system will see one of the largest increases mr schweitzer says montana leads the nation in the per capita number of citizens incarcerated because the vast majority of those are for drug related crimes hes proposing a program that would marry the states prison system with its department of health the resulting "meth prisons " as he calls them would combine incarceration with intensive rehab programs which he says would allow for more early releases and over the long term would lower the states cost of maintaining its prisoners its an unusual idea and one he says that the federal government is unlikely to help finance "the feds arent really interested in new and novel things " he says mr schweitzers budget also offers about &# million in tax cuts and a &# million capital construction program "the best part is i dont have one dollar of bonding in my program " mr schweitzer said "were paying cash " another reason states are loosening their purse strings is to compensate for a sustained decline in federal revenue sharing in the past the federal government could often be relied on to help finance big projects such as highways and new state initiatives such as antipoverty programs but the days of expanding federal revenue sharing have been on the wane for years and the bush administration with its focus on war and antiterror spending has shown little interest in supporting these efforts in fact governors and others say they expect cutbacks in federal support "i dont think anyone feels the federal government is going to be a source of revenue increases any time in the near future " says robin prunty a credit analyst who specializes in state finances for bond rating firm standard &amp poors corp in new mexico democratic gov bill richardson who is running for president is proposing a &# billion budget bigger than last years the spending plan not only provides more than &# million in raises for school employees but includes some projects he had originally intended to supplement with federal grants such as the states commuter rail system "we had a commitment from the feds for &# million but we havent seen it yet so im putting it in my own budget " mr richardson says his budget also includes a &# million proposal to expand health care in many states universal health care proposals are potentially the most expensive propositions and none top the gargantuan plan offered by californias mr schwarzenegger his &# billion health care plan would insure an estimated million people by imposing new fees on doctors and hospitals and giving &# billion in tax breaks to individuals who purchase their own health insurance mr schwarzenegger is touting his plan over the objections of many legislators in his own party who argue that the program will cause budgetary havoc if the states economy sours it wouldnt be the first time an ambitious insurance plan created fiscal problems for a state tennessee launched such a plan in but was forced to painfully unwind the program in when it had grown into a &# billion behemoth that accounted for nearly a third of all spending and threatened to throw the state into deficit the biggest contributor to costs insuring middle aged citizens especially those with pre existing medical conditions they were the first of the estimated tennesseans to be tossed out of the program scott pattison executive director of the national association of state budget officers says the tennessee experience is unlikely to be an anomaly while its relatively cheap to insure healthy children "a year old diabetic is a lot more expensive to cover " he says to be sure some states fearing a quick reversal of fiscal fortunes are trying to keep a lid on spending in alaska a state that derives much of its revenue from oil royalties high energy prices are expected to increase general fund revenue to &# billion this year from &# billion in yet freshman republican gov sarah palin vowed to limit budget growth to &# billion up less than from this year she points to a recent legislative report that predicts falling energy prices will result in declining revenue for the state as early as next year and a potential &# billion deficit by fiscal already there are indications that the flush times are ending one early sign by late nearly a third of those states participating in an annual survey by the national conference of state legislatures of them were either experiencing or expecting to see a decline in revenue moreover the group says for the first time in years projected spending increases this year seems likely to outstrip revenue growth with outlays expect to rise and receipts just the obvious solution to flagging revenue is new taxes but while many governors seem disposed to spend more those same politicians remain largely conservative on taxes big increases particularly on broad levies like income and sales taxes are still considered political suicide instead states from arizona and montana to new york florida and new jersey have enacted or are considering tax rollbacks many states are looking at other ways to raise cash in massachusetts and new york messrs patrick and spitzer are toying with the idea of legalizing gambling to raise money in new jersey which already has legalized gambling democratic gov jon s corzine is entertaining a wager of another sort leasing a portion of the states turnpike to a private company in order to raise cash governors in pennsylvania and texas are considering similar proposals the schemes can be a windfall for states in indiana last fall republican gov mitch daniels essentially sold interstate under a year lease that garnered a &# billion cash payment now he is proposing to lease the states lottery in return for a similar windfall as are several other states including illinois texas and new jersey but lease deals have proven controversial critics fret that states wont properly value the assets or will strike deals that somehow hinder future growth chief among the critics is the owner operator independent drivers association a trucker lobby the lease deals being considered involve sections of some of the nations busiest roadways because the deals almost always include provisions that bar states from building new roadways that might compete with the toll routes being sold future gridlock is all but assured the group says in some states theres plenty of cash at least for the moment in arizona ms napolitano finds herself allied with the conservative goldwater institute as she tries to beat back a proposal by the republican dominated legislature to raid the states rainy day fund for a &# million road improvement program like her republican brethren ms napolitano wants to fix the roads but she would rather borrow the money and keep the &# million rainy day account for the economic downturn she assumes is all but inevitable "when i came in we had no rainy day fund " says ms napolitano "i wouldnt wish that on anybody "
