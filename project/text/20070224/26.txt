hot topic the politics of jetblue right on cue politicians are making a fuss about a "passenger bill of rights" and demanding congressional intervention after last weeks jetblue airline debacle the irony is that the marketplace is already moving to address the problem and the government could really help by relaxing some of the rules that incentivize airlines to discomfit passengers in the first place on february an ice storm obstructed travel throughout the northeast at new yorks jfk international jetblues central hub nine aircraft were frozen to the tarmac for more than six hours each some longer the reverberations caused thousands of cancellations and delays throughout the jetblue schedule clearly jetblue would have done better to offload the stranded passengers as the waits grew longer and by its own admission the companys communications and contingency planning were lousy but moving to regulate now through the introduction of a legally binding "passenger bill of rights " would amount to closing the hangar door after the plane has pushed back the market is already punishing jetblue with damage to its image and bottom line in atonement ceo david neeleman has introduced a new retroactive "bill of rights" of his own that will offer refunds and free flights to tardy jetblue fliers depending on the severity of their delays nevertheless congress senses an opportunity to pander barbara boxer d calif recently introduced a bill in the senate to let passengers deplane if they have been held too long before takeoff mike thompson d calif intends to introduce a similar provision next week in the house as well as mandates for minimum standards of comfort and service members are at least holding off on punitive compliance measures but in washington a consensus for some sort of action seems to be building the benefits of any such rules are speculative but higher costs are certain the airlines would face more paperwork bureaucracy and cost and just wait until the trial bar piles on these costs would be passed on to consumers whether they wanted these new "rights" or not two years ago the european union handed down a suite of "transport directives " including one mandating compensation for delays or cancellations so far without a marked improvement in either problem european airlines meanwhile note that they have been saddled with billions in extra outlays in the case of discount airlines the minimum compensation for delays is often many times larger than the price of the original ticket such regulation is both expensive and unnecessary in according to the department of transportation of flights on u s carriers arrived within minutes of schedule only flights last year out of some million flown left the gate and then waited more than five hours to take off for the record most delays happen for three reasons roughly distributed equally errors on the part of the carrier a jam up caused by another plane or a disruption due to the antiquated air traffic control system when a flight is held up on the runway faa rules stipulate it loses its slot in the takeoff line if it returns to the boarding gate which is why the jetblue planes were reluctant to turn back in the face of an indeterminate delay in hindsight its easy to say jetblue waited too long but we wonder how many passengers offered a choice between the possibility of imminent clearance to take off and the certainty of many more hours in the terminal would have opted for the departure lounge a bill of rights mandating deplanings would take these decisions away from those trying if sometimes futilely to get their passengers where theyre going as quickly as possible ticket buyers who opt for low fare airlines are generally aware that the choice comes with tradeoffs jetblue has supported its low fare model in part by keeping its planes in the air which has meant being reluctant to cancel flights until last week that was an asset it had found that passengers preferred to get to their destinations even if late other airlines offer a different mix of conveniences priorities and costs this diversity is all to the good the self styled consumer advocates who think that government action here will prevent a repeat of last weeks debacle should be careful what they wish for meteorological mishaps cant be outlawed and rules designed to address one situation will be found inappropriate when the next no doubt different crisis arises mr neelemans solution of writing his own bill of rights has the virtue that consumers can decide for themselves if it meets their needs if it doesnt theyll book with someone else and thats the most important right of all
