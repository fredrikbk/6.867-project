pursuits food &amp drink eating out the tastiest molecules ever in chicago two chefs make cutting edge cuisine inviting chicago i have seen the future and i like the way it tastes here in the city formerly known as the hog butcher to the world they are pigging out on bacon martinis two chicago restaurants alinea and moto are part of a vast radical conspiracy on both sides of the atlantic to deconstruct traditional cooking with lasers and other tools normally associated with lab science odd combinations of alchemically altered ingredients come to the table in round bottomed bowls or bobbing at the end of long thin springs both the presentations and the flavors are deliberately theatrical you might think that deconstructive cuisine is too far out for you but in the hands of the right chef the actual tastes and combinations not to mention the stagecraft can be a very approachable novelty most of the flavors at alinea and moto are clever intensifications of ones you already know if you have learned to eat raw sea urchin "roe" at sushi bars nuclear gastronomys flamboyant dishes will be a piece of cake well maybe the bacon martini will take a sip or two before its logic takes hold this cutting edge movement sometimes called molecular gastronomy first surfaced in spain at ferran adrias el bulli the home of foam and powdered popcorn and spread to heston blumenthals the fat duck outside london where diners feast on roast foie gras with almond fluid gel and camomile both now have three michelin stars in new york mutton chopped wylie dufresne presides over a deliberately provocative menu at wd that recently featured pickled tongue with fried mayonnaise chicagos food scene includes world class venues such as charlie trotters and tru whose kitchens are innovative places but way out there on the fringe are two of the most original chefs anywhere grant achatz of alinea and homaro cantu of moto you could say that mr cantu is mr wizard a witty magician flavoring smoke and putting his dishes through technological mirrors mr achatz is more like a ringmaster running a highly sophisticated and technically accomplished cirque de cuisine or a funhouse the prestidigitation begins at the door indeed finding the door is a trick in itself the building is black and has no sign if you look hard you can make out the street number you check the address in your notebook this must be the place and lo the door opens leading into a longish hallway also unmarked and a bit like someones back hall you press forward and suddenly a set of electric pocket doors open onto a small vestibule with a high tech stair ascending a woman appears after a suspense filled moment could it be calculated and takes your coat you walk up one flight into one of three smallish dining rooms men in black bustle about noiselessly your course tour begins the portions are small but intricate a little universe of foods in a spoon or on a fork the menu merely lists the ingredients of each course giving no idea of what is to come not taking away the suspense i dont want to do that either so i leave it to your imagination to wonder what alineas gifted chef who learned his trade at thomas kellers french laundry and perfected it at the legendary trio in evanston will produce with "duck mango yogurt pillow of juniper air" or "venison encased in savory granola " alinea is the latin name for an old fashioned typographical symbol indicating that a new thought will follow and so they do with carefully matched wines waiters give verbal forecasts of each course and the sommelier previews the wines but these bursts of info are no substitute to your own palate and minds analysis of what alinea has done with that old bistro favorite skate with brown butter a hint lemon caper and brown butter have been transmogrified into intense powders the beauty and whimsy of the presentations are an essential part of this literally amazing meal at moto life is both simpler and stranger the menu is somewhat more explicit but the science flaunts itself with dada brio nitro sushi roll has been flash frozen in liquid nitrogen goat cheese snow is what it sounds like the flavor condensed into an aerated hill of "snow " there is jalapeno ice cream a pizza soup and a green puree that started out as caesar salad rabbit with aromatic utensils comes with sage smoldering in wire cages of specially contrived skewers at about halfway through this "grand tour" menu of little courses i want to call them phenomena the wizard invites you into his magic cave actually an underground kitchen where the staff all wear black lensed goggles a sarcastic overreaction to the health departments trepidation about the lasers red beam chef cantu has computerized every aspect of his operation each table is online if a customer announces shes a vegetarian a keyboard command conjures a special menu ditto for kosherkeepers all this may seem far out but rest assured its not too far out to
