the week ahead our take on coming events politics can governors regain spotlight in race for the white house by christopher cooper this weeks nasty tit for tat between democratic senators hillary clinton and barack obama may have raised the appetite among partisans to take a fresh look for somebody anybody outside the beltway as their presidential choice what about the folks running the states as the national governors association gathers for its annual meeting in washington this weekend it hopes that some of its members will grab the spotlight that has largely eluded them in the nascent rounds of the presidential campaign makes sense governors have dominated nearly every presidential field of the past years so far this campaign hasnt been kind to the governor candidates on friday ex iowa gov tom vilsack dropped his presidential bid just three months after formally launching it his tent folding followed demurrals by former virginia gov mark warner and indiana sen evan bayh who had been touting his time as governor more than his time in washington new mexico gov bill richardson remains as the only state executive in the democratic field though he lags far behind mrs clinton mr obama and former north carolina sen john edwards among republicans former massachusetts gov mitt romney is considered top tier though the lower part of it behind a senator and a former mayor ex arkansas gov mike huckabee toils far behind and yet the facts are these only four u s senators have become president since warren harding won in and one of them was richard nixon who left the gang of a full years before ascending to the oval office historically conventional wisdom holds that governors have a better shot at making the presidency they have the grassroots political organization to turn out state delegates and the sophisticated fund raising machines that can hoover up astonishing amounts of money running a state also parallels the demands of the presidency far more closely than a seat in the senate does as executive officeholders governors often have the clean record of accomplishment that senators lack and they dont spark the long trail of compromise that senate votes often bring "the campaign trail is no place to be talking about cloture and amendments and getting caught up in senate speak " says scott reed former campaign manager for vanquished presidential candidate and former sen bob dole mr reed said one of his first tasks as manager was to examine the votes mr dole cast during his long tenure in the senate he says there were of them but then even mr romney who has begun airing ads touting himself as "the republican who turned around a democratic state"" is having some "senate speak" trouble of his own during a failed run for u s senate in massachusetts in the conservative republican let slip that he favored gay rights it has come back to haunt him in the early going mr romney is a mormon and at the beginning "everybody thought his weakness would be his religion "" says mr reed "funny that it turns out to be his political philosophy and his flip flopping " technology a look at dells bottom line amid challenging times by christopher lawton wall street may finally get a glimpse of just how bad things are at dell inc on thursday the giant personal computer maker will release its fiscal fourth quarter earnings its first quarterly results since founder michael dell resumed his job as the companys chief executive last month mr dell who was last dells ceo in took back the ceo reins from protege kevin rollins who resigned after months of poor performance at the round rock texas company since then mr dell has pledged to steer the company through its many challenges the year old has already hired new top executives from motorola inc and solectron corp to help him turn the ship around but while some on wall street have toasted these changes investors remain lukewarm since mr rollins resigned the companys stock is up only indeed there has been very little clarity on dell in recent months the company is still embroiled in an investigation into its financial accounting by the securities and exchange commission and its own audit committee among others in november when dell released its preliminary fiscal third quarter earnings the company didnt host an analyst call on thursday the company will once again release earnings without a conference call some analysts suspect dell may release some preliminary conclusions regarding its own investigation into its accounting as early as thursday which could help clear the air earlier this year the company said it plans to file some information regarding the investigation to the nasdaq stock market by march but added it will unlikely be able to file its delinquent earnings reports to the sec by march if dell misses these deadlines it wont be compliant with nasdaqs listing rules meaning the company could be delisted from the exchange dell has said it plans to ask for more time to file its earnings reports meanwhile the company last month warned that its fourth quarter earnings would fall short of wall street estimates of cents a share if sales figures over the holiday season are any indication dells revenue may also follow a lower trajectory dells world wide pc sales fell in the last three months of according to market research firm gartner inc by comparison hewlett packard co increased unit sales by dells financial woes have been compounded as growth in the pc market has shifted to consumers buying laptops and to emerging markets dells business is roughly commercial and is oriented towards desktop pcs while its international sales are growing fast the majority of its business is still in the maturing u s market keith bachman an analyst with bank of america says dell should move away from low margin pcs and commodity products and expand into areas such as special purpose computer servers and storage "we believe that dell can use both its stock and cash to buy into new markets and growth " mr bachman wrote in a recent research report fashion gap fiddles as holders do slow burn by amy merrick and joann s lublin investors are impatient to hear what gap inc has to say about its future thursday when it reports fourth quarter earnings and updates a strategic review of its troubled gap and old navy brands but they are unlikely to hear much to convince them that this year will be anything but a washout it has been nearly five weeks since former chief executive paul pressler resigned gap has named a new president of the gap brand to succeed mr presslers fellow walt disney co alumna cynthia harriss but the san francisco company hasnt even signed up a search firm to find a permanent chief executive to succeed interim ceo robert fisher on wall street at least that doesnt bode well moodys which recently downgraded gaps debt rating below investment grade said it believes "there will be no meaningful improvement in gaps operating performance until well after the board of directors completes its search for a new ceo " meantime "the underlying business is deteriorating too fast " says richard hastings senior retail analyst with smyth bernard sands llc a new york based credit advisory firm he calculates that on a per store basis gaps earnings before interest and taxes fell in the third quarter compared with the same period a year earlier gap says it expects to have earned cents to cents a share for its fiscal year ended feb well below the &# a share it earned in its previous fiscal year it posted sales of &# billion for the year just ended a slight decrease from the prior year some industry watchers hope gap will slow down store openings and close some existing locations moves that could help it regain ground against smaller more flexible rivals and address stores that have become less productive mr hastings says gap should close at least of its more than stores world wide others have suggested that gap close hundreds of locations a spokeswoman for gap said the company will give an update on its real estate plans thursday as usual for the end of its fiscal year boards of big companies often line up a search firm even before they announce a ceos departure in other cases they choose a recruiter shortly afterward typically through a contest known as a "shootout " gap officials are telling certain recruiters that the shootout for their ceo hunt probably wont occur until sometime next month the delay may reflect directors desire to complete the strategic review or a board split over which recruiter to hire some speculate the delay may also mean that the board is hoping it ultimately can persuade mr fisher the companys year old chairman and son of gap founder donald fisher to take the job himself mr fisher has worked hard to restore morale at the retailer in a recent memo to employees titled "how well be great again " he wrote about encouraging creativity and focusing on the companys core business rather than tackling too many smaller projects he also noted that the companys &# billion in available cash makes a turnaround less daunting
