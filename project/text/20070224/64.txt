treatment delivered by a robot and coming soon to canyon ranchs las vegas outpost self serve stations for salt scrubs and aloe rubs in opulent marble halls and jasmine scented rooms across the country the &# billion spa industry is pushing an unusual new form of pampering do it yourself saddled with costly overhead from a building spree that has seen the number of u s spas climb in two years operators are devising a new generation of treatments that save on labor costs by getting customers to do more of the work the result is a variety of self service treatments with some spas explicitly touting their solo options in hope of tempting shy spa goers and others playing up the social aspect of packages where friends or spouses paint each other with exfoliating clay spas say rising competition combined with a growing mini industry of spa consultants who scrutinize costs has even the most renowned names looking at this approach demand isnt keeping up with the industrys expansion over the past two years the number of spa visits rose only according to ispa the industry trade group expansion has also driven up labor costs with trained massage or facial therapists now earning upwards of &# an hour overall labor was up in the past year alone estimates robert mandelbaum a research director with hospitality consultant company pkf consulting the self serve approach helps trim those labor costs and has some novelty appeal for frequent spa goers obsessed with trying the newest treatments but its also risky for luxury spas "the point of difference is human interaction " says craig reid senior vice president of operations americas for the four seasons hotels and resorts a full day at a top spa can cost upwards of &# at prices like those some consumers say they want other people to do all the work karen stoner a mother of two from cleveland has sampled both camps shes paid &# for full service eucalyptus scrubs and massages and shes tried diy bathing treatments while staying at the fairmont sonoma mission inn &amp spa in sonoma calif both were relaxing but shes prepared to pay to completely switch off "its kind of nice to go to a spa and let someone do something for you instead of you sitting there scrubbing yourself " says ms stoner "i could do that at home " to find how the new approach changes the value equation for pampering the wall street journal sampled treatments at spas in more than a dozen cities we tested how much time the staff spent with us and then factored in the cost what we found not all full service spas give you the same amount of attention per dollar and the pampering can vary widely in do it yourself treatments too we also discovered some issues that cropped up repeatedly at self serve treatments such as the difficulty of following complicated treatments while still keeping relaxed hoping to stand out in the saturated palm springs calif spa market the miramonte resort &amp spa embarked on a &# million expansion three years ago it hired consultant polly johnson from spa equip a california spa design and equipment distributor that has worked with the ritz carlton and starwood chains spa director jennifer di francesco says she had noticed more groups and couples coming and asked ms johnson to come up with a communal treatment that would appeal to them one suggestion diy mud bars "it was a loose concept " says ms di francesco who wound up creating a treatment called "pittura festa " italian for "painting party " customers spend half the session applying different colored muds to each other with paintbrushes before rinsing off in an outdoor shower a therapist then steps in for the second half of the treatment to apply lemon scented lotion and give a massage the cost of this diy treatment for a couple &# for minutes &# less than a regular couples massage less staff contact adds up to a better profit margin for miramonte "your highest paid staffer is your therapist " says ms di francesco at the four seasons spas diy isnt on the menu recent focus groups of luxury travelers suggested that one of the things customers remember most about their spa visits was the time spent with staff says mr reid the americas senior vice president of operations as a result the four seasons concluded it wouldnt make sense to offer lower priced treatments with a reduced level of attention "theres a cost associated with that but i think the luxury traveler sees the benefit of that cost " he says though new to american spas the diy strategy is an old idea more than years ago romans would sit and bathe in large communal "thermae " grand bathhouse structures built by emperors looking to win favor with their subjects bathers would rub themselves with sand and olive oil to exfoliate says alexia brue the author of "cathedrals of the flesh " a book about bathing cultures and a consultant who has worked with spas with communal themes based on ancient traditions like the standard hotel in miami in the last five years some operators sought to draw in more customers by launching spas with a medical emphasis selling pricey botox injections and laser hair removal alongside facials and massages others focused on asian therapies including acupuncture and ayurvedic massage now more emphasis is on improving profit margins taking a cue from the airline and hotel industries some spas are adopting yield management programs to attack a persistent problem keeping rooms filled throughout the week on a tuesday morning as few as of treatment rooms are filled on weekends they can run as full as to lure guests during these slow times starwood is experimenting with reducing rates at the westin kierland resort and spa in scottsdale ariz an minute "golfers massage" ranges from &# to &# depending on

"igloo" kept at a chilly degrees as well as stations where customers can apply aloe mud and salt these "self guided" areas will be able to handle as many as customers staffed by two attendants mr feeney says the profit margin on these day pass customers will be at around compared with for guests getting massages "it really increases our profitability " says mr feeney the spa hopes to double day passes share of overall sales from its current level some spas say they hope these diy features will draw novice customers alicia brady from catonsville md is a regular at the nearby pearl spas blue grotto room which features a diy session for friends or couples who pay &# each to sit unattended and slather on mud and then scrub it off "its weird at first i have to admit " says the year old insurance saleswoman but she was eventually won over by how smooth her skin felt next month shes taking her husband along on a surprise visit ms brady is hoping the self serve aspect will help him relax "if we go to the blue grotto without a therapist hed be more comfortable " she says how much does the masseuse matter which spas give you the most bang for the buck to answer that question we sampled spots in more than a dozen cities including some with do it yourself treatments we looked at how much time the staff spent with us and how factored in the cost the bottom line not all full

chilly during this outdoor diy mud treatment but we liked the massage by the therapist at the end note the cost per minute of staff time was calculated by dividing the total price of the treatment by the number of minutes we interacted with a staffer or therapist for the cost of a standard massage we took the price of a minute swedish massage or the closest option to it if the massage time was longer or shorter than minutes we calculated the price per minute and multiplied it by for an even comparison where there was a flat fee for all day access to diy areas we either tested based on the spas recommended time or on a fair time spent doing a few treatments
