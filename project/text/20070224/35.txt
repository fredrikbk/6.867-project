mandates in black if the cost of health insurance is breaking your back consider the case of north carolina democrat jim black the former speaker of the tarheel state house pleaded guilty this month to a host of corruption charges one of which is especially instructive accepting &# from three chiropractors in return for pushing legislation to force insurance companies to cut patient copays for visits to chiropractors north carolina already required insurers to pay for chiropractic care before black sweetened the coverage but the episode is emblematic of the problem created when politicians determine the extent of health insurance coverage the incentive is for politicians to serve as mediators for health care special interests that want coverage "mandates " all of which drive up the cost of insurance for everyone north carolina has such mandates and the john locke foundation estimates that the chiropractic mandates alone increase the cost of insurance by with an average family plan estimated at &# including the portion paid by an employer thats more than &# that could otherwise go to more pressing needs across the states the average number of mandates is one of the most expensive and irrational is "guaranteed issue " which defeats the actuarial logic of insurance by allowing patients to wait until theyre sick before they buy insurance without being penalized that leaves insurers little choice but to charge everyone else a little more to make up for the premiums the sick never contributed while they were healthy the congressional budget office crunched the numbers a few years ago and found that health insurance would likely cost less if insurers were allowed to get out from under some of the most expensive mandates one study cited by cbo estimates that removing the average states mandates would allow as many as one fourth of those who are uninsured to buy their own insurance health insurance in north carolina is now more expensive than the national average and only about a hundred dollars cheaper a year than in new york but rather than repeal their mandates tar heel lawmakers are watching the number of uninsured grow mark holmes of the cecil sheps center for health services research at the university of north carolina has found that in the latest year for which numbers are available of state residents under were uninsured thats up from in as for black before his back spasm was uncovered he had also been pushing a law requiring an eye exam for students before their first day of kindergarten he happens to be an optometrist however many parents lacked insurance to cover eye exams and were outraged at having to dig into their own pockets the legislature repealed the black eye mandate before the first day of school last year
