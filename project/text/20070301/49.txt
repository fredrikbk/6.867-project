jitters or come close to recovering tuesdays point plunge in the dow jones industrial average following reassuring remarks by federal reserve chairman ben bernanke in testimony to congress investors

nearly yesterday and in hong kong the hang seng slid the shanghai composite index rebounded in europe londons ftse slipped the frankfurt xetra dax fell and the cac in paris was down analysts and traders in the u s spent the day debating whether the modest recovery was the first cautious step in a rebuilding process or a temporary technical recovery that presages more declines "we expected a little bit of a recovery the bulls would have liked to see a little bit more " said stock trader larry peruzzi at boston companyasset management it is a truism on wall street that stocks never go straight up or straight down regardless of whether the market is headed for another record or for more pain the short term outlook is likely to feature more up and down swings as traders "test" the markets limits some nervous investors are booking profits by selling winners that they think could suffer in the coming weeks others with more confidence are buying some of those same stocks on the grounds that the economy corporate profits and interest rates all are just fine believing that tuesdays decline was overdone until it becomes clearer which side is in the drivers seat the swings could be sharp typically a bull market doesnt end quite as abruptly as this said phil roth chief technical market analyst at new york brokerage firm miller tabak mr roth himself is in the bearish camp viewing recent market moves as a "topping" process that will lead to a longer running decline but he doesnt see the decline happening just yet before tuesdays collapse he notes just about every major index had been at or near a long term high the dow industrials transports and utilities all had recently hit records as had indexes of small stocks and middle sized stocks stocks dont typically just collapse after showing that kind of broad strength instead they bounce up and down he expects to see them bounce back up before the bull market ends "we may not have seen the final high for some of the averages " mr roth said although "we may have seen the final high for lots of individual stocks " several analysts including mr roth pointed out that a decline such as the dow industrials recorded tuesday isnt as rare an event as it might seem it hadnt happened to the dow in nearly four years but since it has happened times an average of more than once a year according to research by quantitative analyst marc reinganum of oppenheimerfunds it is perfectly normal for an index like the dow occasionally to fall over a five day period even during a bull market as it has just done added tim hayes chief investment strategist at ned davis research in a report to clients "the bottom line is that it would be premature to conclude that a bear market has started " mr hayes wrote mr bernankes comments to congress yesterday helped soothe investors jitters in previously scheduled testimony to the house budget committee the fed chief said financial markets "seem to be working well " he reiterated his view that the economy could pick up steam later this year and said he saw no reason for china or japan to "dump" u s treasury bonds stocks which had been down before he began speaking rose as he delivered his testimony given that mr bernankes predecessor alan greenspan had helped roil markets with a remark early this week about the possibility of a recession mr bernankes
