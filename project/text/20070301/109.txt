walter reuthers ghost the house of representatives has scheduled a vote as early as today on a bill that strips million u s workers of the right to decide in private whether to unionize naturally its called the employee free choice act big labor has been agitating to ease union formation requirements for more than a decade and prior to last years election the afl cio afscme and their allies made it clear to democrats that this vote would be the most important return they expected on their investment in a nancy pelosi speakership this is payback day the union claim is that employers are engaging in rampant unfair labor practices to prevent employees from exercising their right to organize but data from the national labor relations board which oversees union elections show no rise in such activities the reality is that union membership has been in decline for decades and labor leaders are desperate to rig the rules in order to reverse the trend in the s of private sector workers were unionized by the early s the number had fallen to and today it stands at just the reason for this decline isnt illegal management meddling in organizing efforts the problem is that unions havent been able to persuade the workers themselves our own longstanding position is that when a company is organized it is almost always the companys fault but workers of all classes and skills can also read the news and understand that unions no longer provide job security if they ever did the most heavily unionized industries such as airlines and detroit carmakers are typically those that are financially beleaguered and shedding jobs workers know that unions often provide short term wage gains at the cost of longer term job insecurity all of which explains the drive to rewrite the rules and do away with secret ballot elections administered by the nlrb a procedure in place since the wagner act under current rules once of employees at a workplace express interest in unionizing by signing an authorization card organizers can go to management and demand voluntary "card check" recognition the employer then has the option of recognizing the union or demanding an election it shouldnt be surprising that many workers who sign these cards later have second thoughts after getting the employers side of the story workers sign cards for all kinds of reasons including peer pressure and intimidation its not uncommon for an organizer to approach an employer with cards that show of the workforce wants to unionize only to have the percentage plummet once employees hear about the downside of a union shop and have a chance to vote by secret ballot so big labor wants to dispense with these petty elections and make union recognition mandatory as soon as a simple majority of workers sign a card notably nearly every american business group is united in opposing this affront to worker freedom they understand this will make organizing that much easier thus making their own businesses that much less competitive one business response would surely be to hire fewer workers the opposite of what the unions claim to want the bill nonetheless has co sponsors including seven republicans mostly from blue northeast states such as new york new jersey and connecticut because the senate is expected to filibuster the bill and the white house is threatening a veto these republicans may figure they can have it both ways score points with the unions by supporting a measure that isnt going anywhere but members who go on record opposing secret ballot elections will also have some explaining to do the next time they ask for business support so far this congress democrats have been trying to present themselves as "moderates" who wont return to their bad special interest selves pre but this union enabling bill strips away that mask and exposes an anti business animus out of the s if not the s even if it fails this congress this weeks vote is a warning about what could become law if democrats and their union backers hold all the levers of power after
