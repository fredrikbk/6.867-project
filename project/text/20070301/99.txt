best plans including ones in utah and virginia offer low costs and well run underlying funds both states plans have been on the morningstar best performance list since the investment research firm

winning s are plans sponsored by nebraska and colorado and new to the list this year is the maryland college investment plan on the flip side one of alabamas broker sold plans turns up on morningstars

performance and broker sold offerings from alaska missouri and west virginia congress gave a big boost to s last year by making permanent the plans federal tax breaks which had been set to expire at the end of investments in the plans jumped in recent months lifting total assets to over &# billion at the end of according to financial research corp with plans investors deposit after tax income into an account that typically carries a range of investment options usually mutual funds distributions arent subject to federal income tax as long as the money is used to pay for higher education competition among plans has prompted states and plan managers in recent years to cut fees and sweeten state tax breaks in selecting a plan investors should consider a number of factors foremost you should check whether your own states plan offers a tax deduction for contributions which can raise the appeal of investing close to home but the benefits of such a deduction can be reduced if a plans total costs including management fees and any broker commissions are relatively high whats more a state tax deduction might be less meaningful if the states tax rate is low though nearly every state offers at least one plan many states have multiple plans some of which are sold directly to investors and others that are only available through brokers making it difficult for consumers to compare options information about comparing plans can be found at savingforcollege com and morningstar com among morningstars list of top plans is the maryland college investment plan run by t rowe price group inc which last year cut annual fees in the plans it manages for both maryland and alaska morningstar analyst kerry oboyle says the maryland plan has reasonably priced investments and a sound asset allocation strategy the plan also provides maryland residents with a state tax deduction the utah educational savings plan which is run by the state remains a top choice due to a diverse lineup of portfolios and low annual expenses which mostly range from to across its portfolios "theres lots of different age based tracks to meet different types of risk tolerances " mr oboyle says the college savings plan of nebraska run by union bank &amp trust co offers low cost index funds from vanguard group as a core holding in its portfolios while giving investors the flexibility to supplement those funds with reasonably priced actively managed offerings from american century investments fidelity investments and pacific investment management co or pimco he says two highly rated broker sold plans include virginias collegeamerica plan run by capital research &amp management co s american funds and colorados scholars choice college savings program run by legg mason inc s cam north america llc business the appeal behind virginias plan the largest plan in the country is its relatively low cost and steady well run underlying funds morningstar says the investment lineup of the colorado plan got a boost after legg mason which bought citigroup inc s asset management business added a range of options last year some s that were listed in previous years surveys among the worst plans were dropped from the list when those states decided to shutter those plans wyoming for example closed its high priced wyoming college achievement plan and merged it with one of colorados savings plan last year arizona closed two of its plans to new enrollments this year what some of the worst offenders on morningstars list including the alabama higher education fund and nebraskas aim college savings plan have in common are high fees and mediocre funds says mr oboyle many investors in alabamas age based portfolios which consist of a "mixed bag of lackluster funds " may pay annual fees of about to a year by contrast reasonably priced plans should cost approximately to a year for broker sold plans and less than a year for direct sold plans he says although nebraskas aim plan announced an overhaul of its age based portfolios for march investors are still paying above average costs of about to for aggressively allocated growth leaning portfolios with some "weak and unproven underlying funds " morningstar notes in the report other high priced plans include alaskas john hancock freedom plan and west virginias cornerstone smart and leaders smart plans in figuring costs of a investors should consider whether they can buy a plan directly from the state rather than going through a broker which can add an extra layer of expenses there may be other perks to consider as well some states wont count the assets held in plans in a decision whether to award state financial aid says andrea feirstein managing member of akf consulting llc a new york consultant to the industry and while new jersey residents wont get a state tax deduction for contributions to the plans their children could be eligible for scholarships if they attend a state institution "dont focus just on the deduction and dont be swayed by it if you live in a state with a low tax rate " she says investors should also look at how the asset allocation in age based portfolios shifts over time investors with a moderate risk tolerance for example should look for an allocation that is stocks when the child is a newborn then gradually shift to a roughly equal split between stocks and bonds by the time the child is to years old suggests mr oboyle by the time the beneficiary is ready to withdraw the money a reasonable allocation should be about equities fixed income and cash he says "saving for college is different than saving for retirement where investors have to years to save " mr oboyle says since you only have years to save for college and have less time to make up sudden losses investors should look for more conservative asset allocation strategies he says comparing the plans when shopping for a plan consider its costs investment options and asset allocation strategies weigh any tax advantages of investing in an in state plan against the plans total costs look for annual costs of under for direct sold plans or to for broker sold plans compare plans at www savingforcollege com
