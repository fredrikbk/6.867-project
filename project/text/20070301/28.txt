ebay bids for younger auction crowd at social network sites in its search for growth ebay inc is starting to go after teenagers wallets teaming with social networking sites to lure younger customers the san jose calif online auctioneer is working on launching a feature for visitors to social networking company bebo inc which caters largely to teenagers the idea is bebo users would be able to use the site to post lists of items they want to sell or buy on ebay clicking on an item on the list would send bebo users to ebay bringing ebay a potentially lucrative stream of new visitors ebay is "looking to engage a younger demographic in a very creative way " says jim scheinman vice president of business development at bebo san francisco the majority of ebays users now are to years old this is just one of several overtures that ebay has recently made to social networking web sites the popular online hangouts where people can build personal profiles with photos and videos and send messages to each other ebay has also been talking to news corp s myspace the biggest social networking site which counts teens and somethings among its core user base about ways to partner on "peer commerce " say people familiar with the matter this would allow myspace users to buy and sell items from each other using ebays online commerce technology and paypal electronic payment system these people said myspace declined to comment in january ebay also quietly made a deal with facebook inc another large social networking site aimed primarily at college age users facebooks users can now search for used textbooks on a special ebay sponsored "student superstore" page on facebook and join a group associated with the page to search for or buy items users can type words into a search box that then directs users to half com a discount e commerce site that ebay owns another search box directs users to the main ebay site ebay paid facebook an undisclosed amount to create the page and post other advertisements cody lyell a year old high school student in stamps ark joined the "student superstore" group on facebook a few weeks ago and has visited it six or seven times since he was already an ebay fan but recently he used the facebook link to ebay to search for a cellphone instead of opening a new window in his browser "im on facebook all the time and its easier to get to " he says "it makes sense that ebay would advertise half com on facebook " says mike murphy facebooks vice president of media sales "half com is targeted at college students and young adults and facebook engages that demographic like no other site can " the move to build partnerships with hot social networking sites comes at a time when ebays growth has slowed last year ebays revenue grew to &# billion down from its triple digit pace in the late s ebay has reached a saturation point with its existing audience analysts say to spur new growth ebay has tried expanding overseas in countries including china and korea and has launched a more mainstream site called ebay express to sell products at fixed prices which has so far fallen flat ebay could now be looking to attract new internet users as they come online ebays visitor traffic dwarfs that of myspace facebook and bebo it attracted million unique u s visitors in january compared with million for myspace million for facebook and million for bebo according to comscore but the social networking sites which have been around for just a few years are growing quickly among a coveted younger audience that sees the sites as a new front door into the web today only of ebay users are to years old compared with of myspace users of facebook users and of bebo users according to comscore working with social networking sites "establishes ebay as the resource to find what you want a used ipod for example and gets young users aware early " says patti freeman evans an analyst at jupiterkagan inc s jupiterresearch still she notes that young people actually spend less money online than their older counterparts as they have less disposable income ebay is playing down its partnerships with social networking companies spokesman brad williams says the efforts are disparate deals with the facebook venture amounting to a straightforward advertising purchase and the bebo deal a way for ebay to take advantage of a feature that bebo provides to all of its users "were always talking with potential partners and making deals " he says adding that making deals with social networking companies to reach a younger audience is "not a strategic priority for us " but he acknowledges any deal with myspace could potentially be more significant internally ebay is also looking at ways to leverage the social networking phenomenon ebay research labs formed in to research new technologies is examining how ebay could let its buyers and sellers join communities on its web site based on their interests and buying habits just as high school students on myspace might create groups around a common interest like a rock band the tie ups with young web companies may not only help ebay attract a younger audience they also are a test for ebays effort to use partnerships to pull in traffic from other web sites some of its current relationships are becoming more complicated last week of traffic to the main ebay site came from google compared with in the year ago period according to hitwise a web tracking service ebay last year signed a multiyear deal with google inc allowing the internet search giant to exclusively display text ads on ebays sites outside of the u s in exchange for paying ebay a portion of the revenue from some ads but google is now becoming more of an ebay rival giving ebay a motive to seek new partnerships that would bring visitor traffic its way google last year introduced google checkout a service that rivals ebays paypal electronics payment service adding to that search engine advertisements are increasingly costly some of ebays biggest sellers have built their own retail web sites outside of ebay and are using ads on google to drive customers there that adds to competition for search engine keywords from mainstream rivals like target corp "when one channel is wildly successful for you as well as for others it will become more costly and youll naturally want to look for diversification " ms freeman evans says one potential downside establishing a presence on the popular social networking sites gives some ebay critics a high profile forum for their gripes at facebooks "student superstore" group which recently counted more than members one student posted a message that read "how cool ebay on facebook " but another commented "half ripped me off dont use them " julia
