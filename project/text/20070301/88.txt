revolving door at dell ushers in high profile team the revolving door at dell inc is spinning faster than ever since december the giant personal computer maker has lost about a third of its member plus executive suite to resignations and retirements among those leaving its chief executive and chief financial officer as well as at least six other veterans who had been at dell for nearly a decade at the same time dell founder michael dell has returned as chief executive and has helped bring in at least nine new executives including don carty former chief executive of amr corp parent of american airlines who was appointed finance chief several other new hires including a former chief executive of solectron corp and top executives from motorola inc and international business machines corp are taking newly created positions at dell heading global operations and the consumer and health care businesses on tuesday dell also promoted two executives from inside the company to its management team one of them will head its europe middle east and africa business more changes are expected soon dell is working with the executive search firms christian &amp timbers spencer stuart egon zehnder international and russell reynolds associates inc to fill other high level vacancies christian &amp timbers says it is specifically seeking senior executives for dells north america and asia operations dell says it also is looking for a chief marketing officer while the search has been going on for nearly three years in one form or another mr dell has broadened the job description and will require the executive to report directly to him the musical chairs represent the biggest overhaul of dells executive suite in years and they reflect the problems the pc maker is facing in the early s dell went through a similar upheaval at a time when the company was experiencing growing pains back then mr dell brought in new executives such as thomas meredith a sun microsystems inc treasurer and mort topfer a former motorola executive to help him run the company but this time the troubles at dell which sells pcs directly to customers over the phone or internet are more severe the round rock texas company has suffered as pc demand has shifted away from its core strength of corporate desktops and toward laptops for consumers in addition dells effort to expand out of pcs into other categories such as television sets and printers has been bumpy dell faces stiff competition from a rejuvenated rival hewlett packard co since dells stock has fallen while h ps stock has risen the company is still embroiled in an investigation into its financial accounting by the securities and exchange commission and its own board audit committee among others some analysts suspect dell could release some preliminary conclusions from the investigations as early as today dell spokesman bob pearson says the company is "moving towards a streamlined structure clarity and accountability " he adds "michael has moved very quickly to build his leadership team and that is something that is a real positive for the company " dell releases quarterly earnings today mr dell who founded the company in his university of texas dorm room in has always been active in recruiting management for dell but several months ago the year old even insisted on interviewing certain prospects for open positions that reported to then chief executive kevin rollins recalls a person close to the situation "it was very clear that michael was driving the recruitment process " this person adds such an extensive overhaul of top talent is tricky after hiring so many big guns mr dell has a lot of large egos to manage "these are big cats theyre used to playing their own game " says deborah cornwall managing director of corlund group llc a boston organizational consulting firm what is more the numerous comings and goings mean "a lot of institutional wisdom is gone " she says "any new team requires three to six months to gel " dell spokesman mr pearson responds that many executives with institutional wisdom are still at the company including mr dell dells new executive team may face other disruptions mr carty who had retired from amr before he became dells finance chief isnt likely to stay longer than a year in his new position according to one person familiar with the matter mr dell is trying to persuade mr carty also a dell board member to keep the post longer because he considers mr carty "a voice of sanity " an acquaintance of mr dell says the company declined to make mr carty available for comment and he didnt respond to direct calls but mr pearson says the company expects the executive to "continue to be an important part of dell in the years ahead " meanwhile mr dell has twice tried to hire mark begor a top general electric co official as dells finance chief according to an acquaintance of mr begor both approaches occurred several years ago with dell flying mr begor and his wife to texas on the corporate jet in one instance dell declined to comment on mr begor mr begor who oversees the americas for ges consumer finance business also declined to comment overall dell is whittling its executive team down to just members from more than the company also is abolishing its practice of splitting high level jobs by assigning two executives to head up a business unit the structure helped create a bureaucratic organization in which no one was responsible for the whole business the breadth of dells hiring underscores how troubled many of the companys businesses are even in areas that are considered dell strengths last month dell hired michael cannon a former chief executive of solectron as president of global operations an implicit acknowledgment that the company needs to improve its famed supply chain andy neff an analyst at bear stearns co says dells supply chain has become too complex over the years creating confusing product pricing for customers in an internal email sent last month mr dell called the "dramatic de scaling" of the consumer business a mistake with his hiring choices mr dell also is highlighting areas he wants to develop last month he appointed james coffin previously world wide vice president of health care and life sciences at ibm to a new job heading dells health care business while dell had a health care team that focused on selling computers to hospitals mr coffin is now responsible for increasing that business by also targeting biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies many of the executives mr dell has brought in have been involved in corporate turnarounds before mr cannon for example is credited with rejuvenating hard drive storage maker maxtor corp which is now owned by seagate technology and helping to boost solectrons growth mr dell "is trying to put a baseball team together with people who know baseball people who know how to manage a large organization that has multiple challenges " says mr neff
