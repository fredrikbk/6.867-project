style fashion journal after the show the real business of fashion we shadow a retail buyer as he shops for his boutiques &# blouse threshold all month its been hard for the fashion minded to miss the wall to wall coverage of the industrys globetrotting runway marathon the countless photos of svelte models sauntering down catwalks in new york then london milan and now paris the media are the real audience for these runway shows at the max mara show in milan last week i counted seats marked for the press and just seats for the retail buyers who actually purchase clothes for stores for the buyers arguably the most important link in the fashion food chain the circus like theatrics have little if anything to do with the real business of fashion after the models slip the clothes off their bony shoulders runway samples head straight to ateliers studios where retail buyers pull and poke and even try them on then ponder the practicality of derriere hugging hemlines and dutifully record purchases in their laptop computers in private showrooms all over paris milan and new york i tagged along with todd hanshaw one of the squadron of retail buyers to figure out just how the runway meets the realities of the global luxury economy sales are by appointment clothes are produced once the orders are in and a buyer who is unimpressed with the offerings for this fall winter season may buy a few anyway mainly to ensure access to next years collection surprisingly much of what is purchased never even saw a runway these items are often called "pre collection" or they are simpler versions of the attention getters from the shows mr hanshaw has had a successful career buying for barneys new york and dressing celebrities including patti labelle and nicole kidman wynn las vegas yes the casino hired him away a couple of years ago with the lure of creative freedom to fill several of its stores including outfit and jean paul gaultier for which he buys of course gaultier the shops at the wynn resort draw enough high spending clients that mr hanshaw is greeted warmly at showrooms all over the globe the evening before zang tois new york show as his assistants looked on in dismay the designer ripped the garment bags off of his runway collection show so that mr hanshaw could take a look after all outfit has sold a ferre gown for &# and the store regularly sells gowns in the &# to &# category the buying process is a little like a mini fashion show buyers with the help of a salesperson comb through the racks of clothes models are available to try on the items these women spend a long day changing in and out of the same clothes buyers or their assistants photograph the looks they are purchasing then buyer and seller sit at a table frequently in the philippe starck louis ghost chairs that seem ubiquitous in showrooms and read inventory numbers back and forth sometimes food and wine are served one of the magic tricks that take place in showrooms occurs when salespeople try to accommodate reality they note for example that a particular hemline will be lengthened from the runway version or a neckline modified for modesty mr hanshaw often finds that clothes designed for the body of kate moss arent suited for the average womans curves but its important that he buy things for his stores that customers will actually want to wear his bonus depends on high sales "basically you get one shot to make six months worth of business " mr hanshaw says at monique lhuilliers plush showroom in new york for instance mr hanshaw loves a long leopard print gown embellished with tulle and embroidery it was the designers splashy finale in her show but mr hanshaw asks to buy it "without the hoop la" of the embroidery which would be too showy for most women mr hanshaw a lover of fashion himself stocks his stores with many of the designers he likes most of whom are well known in the u s alexander mcqueen malo and missoni but every buyer has their secret weapons and blumarine is one of his at the blumarine showroom in new york he ordered quantities of the italian labels richly woven silk charmeuse blouses which will retail for about &# and coy scoop necked stretch dresses which you may find in stores for just over &# blumarines feminine look rich italian fabrics and expert tailoring have drawn his admiration "their stuff sells itself " he says for an outsider its easy to get lost amid the quotations of wholesale and retail what may sound like a healthy retail price that &# missoni "prehistoric print" dress turns out to be the wholesale price the markup from wholesale to retail is remarkable roughly with some variations from brand to brand this explains how clothes can be marked down time and again and gives hagglers the wherewithal to ask for a better deal from clothiers they frequent it also explains why designers are eager to sell direct to consumers by manufacturing clothes for so called sample sales mr hanshaw isnt overly concerned about price since his customers arent either but there is one threshold at which he balks and it caused a kerfuffle at a recent stop "i have a problem with a white blouse selling for over &# " he informed the givenchy saleswoman in new york the other day as he rejected a shirt that would retail for about &# he continued "&# im fine with but that &# price difference plays with customers heads " "theyve been selling so well " the saleswoman replied coolly "people havent had a problem with it this year " mr hanshaw noted that luxury fashion sales are strong for him as well january sales were over plan he told the givenchy saleswoman at missonis new york showroom many of the jackets for this fall will be priced to retail in the neighborhood of &# but one puffy jacket with a shawl collar will carry a vastly lower retail price of &# the missoni salesman explained to mr hanshaw "this ones a bargain because its made in china "
