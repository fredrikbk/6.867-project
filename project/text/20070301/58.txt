local search sites draw users input when dave kim moved to sunnyvale calif the year old manager for a software company was looking for a new place to get a haircut he didnt like the results he got at several barber shops he wandered into and a handful of large online search sites didnt offer any useful suggestions then he stumbled on yelp com a local search site that ranks its results based on feedback from its users a search for "haircut" in sunnyvale pulled up some results leaping out at him was julieqs hair and nails whose reviewers raved about a free scalp massage included with a haircut "when there are some reviews and no one says a bad thing that tells you something " says mr kim who has been stopping by at julieqs for a &# cut every few weeks ever since online search services that can pull up a list of florists by zip code or bakeries in a particular area have proliferated in recent years but now some start ups are taking local searches one step further by basing their results on recommendations and reviews from local users taking cues from social networking sites like news corp s myspace or photo sharing sites like yahoo inc s flickr they are addressing the problem by soliciting a wide array of information from their users a number of established search directories have also begun launching new features that make it easy for consumers to swap advice on local topics like where to get a nearby oil change or find the tastiest burrito these range from features that allow anyone to post photos and comments about a business to reviewer profile pages which users can fill with details about their interests and use to pose questions directly to other local experts on the site aware of the ultralocal trend local search veteran citysearch a division of iac interactivecorp today is announcing it has agreed to acquire insider pages a local search start up for an undisclosed amount insider pagess roughly user reviews will be folded into the citysearch database insider pages takes a different approach to local search through features like allowing users to pose questions "where can i find the best ice cream in san francisco " for instance directly to other members on the site yahoos yahoo local is steering its users towards user generated content as well the site taps nearly three million user reviews to find the most relevant results for queries on good banks or real estate brokers and the like late last year it added a "my local" feature that allows users to save and share reviews create collections of their favorite places and receive recommendations users also can post their photos of a particular merchant on the businesss official profile page at&amp t inc s yellowpages com recently began allowing users to rate and review businesses launching the feature on yellowpages com which has generated some reviews nationwide in february several start ups are also turning to their users to get the pulse on popular places while demystifying the review process by encouraging reviewers to create profile pages where other users can post feedback about the reviews truelocal inc which has a database of nearly million u s businesses soon will allow users to create their own profiles in order to share detailed factual information about the businesses years in business or seating capacity for example in their neighborhoods with other users san francisco based yelp inc ranks its local search results according to how users have rated the business while yelp has reviews nationwide the bulk are from major metropolitan areas yelp co founder jeremy stoppelman says the site aims to solve the difficult problem in local search how to search the information in peoples heads "that kind of information doesnt exist anywhere " he says "you have to find ways to get people to talk about that information " to date local search services have been wary of encouraging users to weigh in believing that the hodgepodge of opinions would be more distracting than useful depending on reviewers comments also risks alienating merchants many of whom still have mixed feelings about the exposure "anyone can get behind any computer under any alias and vote that your place is good or bad " says kevin suto general manager of zacharys chicago pizza inc "some of this stuff should be treated with a grain of salt " moreover businesses have yet to make much money around community driven local search services while u s local search advertising revenues are forecast to grow to &# billion in from &# billion in according to the kelsey group some local search start ups have found that selling advertisements isnt enough "reviews dont make a business " says andy sack co founder and chief executive of judys book inc a local review site founded in the site soon will relaunch with a new focus directing users to local and national shopping deals in their area in order to generate revenue through lead generation fees from retailers but as user generated content and reviews have taken off across the web existing local search services believe they cant afford to miss out on user ratings reviews and photos occasionally even providing gift certificates for submissions to win over merchants they are encouraging businesses to provide their own writeups and to update their listing information with hard to come by details such as their hours of operation or which credit cards they accept the growing appeal of unfiltered user reviews is what attracted citysearch to insider pages a start up launched in for years citysearch which iac bought in compiled whats now some merchant million listings with a staff of more that editors and freelancers who also often provide reviews that editorial approach coupled with extensive city guides helped the site grow into a leading destination for local business information on the web but as of late the service has been struggling as competition increases u s traffic to the site declined to million unique monthly visitors in january down from million in january according to comscore networks inc now iac is trying to put citysearch back on track with an array of new features the site is helping small businesses to post their own videos on the site and expects to launch with several hundred short clips by may and its looking to insider pages which has some two million unique monthly u s visitors according to comscore to help it quickly boost its audience and authority by adding more voices from real people "users submitting reviews can cover a lot more content than any editorial team " says peter horan chief executive of iac media &amp advertising
