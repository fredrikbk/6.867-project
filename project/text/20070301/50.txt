its not all youtube the web is a trove of watchable videos i love youtube as a pop culture junkie i watch its videos daily whether goofy amateur productions or clips often of dubious legal status lifted from tv shows or movies but while youtube is sometimes seen as synonymous with the internet video revolution there is a lot more to web video in fact some of the most interesting video on the web isnt even the type of stuff thats most popular on youtube short one off clips in various corners of the web people are producing real episodic tv shows including news drama and comedy sometimes with real actors and professional production values some of these longer form episodic shows are called video blogs or vlogs but others simply call themselves shows instead of lasting just a few minutes they can run up to half an hour these programs have more in common with regular broadcast and cable shows than with those emailed clips one of these days a real hit show will emerge on the web to be sure such web tv shows arent brand new ever since apple began offering free video blogs on its itunes store people have been making them one of the first to achieve popularity was a cheeky daily newscast called "rocketboom " which made a star of its first host amanda congdon who has moved to the abc news web site "rocketboom" continues with another host another was a comedy called "tiki bar tv " but the trend has accelerated and deepened lately and a number of interesting sites have sprung up my favorite is blip tv run by a team made up of a former systems administrator for the nhl and a former tv news reporter and producer blip tv not to be confused with a similar sounding site called bliptv com hosts a bunch of these new web tv series and also helps them attract funding sponsors and advertisers anyone can upload a show one of my favorite shows available on blip tv is called "goodnight burbank " a comedy series about the squabbling that goes on behind the scenes at a local tv news show another is "alive in baghdad " news reports from americans and iraqis on how the war affects average iraqis "cube news " is a series about life in the office cubicle other shows ive enjoyed on blip tv include "hotroast " "the ministry of unknown science" and "josh leo " each show on blip tv is accompanied by a profile page comments from viewers and sometimes a blog many arent exclusive to the site some have their own web sites and episodes can also be found on youtube and downloaded from itunes and other sites in fact blip tv provides links that make it easy to subscribe to shows on itunes and other sites but blip tv does a good job of gathering a whole bunch of these web tv series in one location another good place to find these kinds of video blogs and web tv series is at the itunes store unlike the music commercial tv shows and movies that apple sells there these web video series are free and because they are on itunes you can easily download them for viewing on a windows or macintosh computer or on an ipod you can even watch them on a real tv if you plug a computer or ipod into the set or buy apples forthcoming apple tv product there are way too many web series and video blogs on itunes to list here but if you go to the podcast page in the itunes store and scroll down to featured video podcasts you can get an idea of what is available itunes includes several web only video series produced by the big tv networks including a fascinating series from abc called "the day it happened " with historic footage on events such as the kennedy assassination the fall of the berlin wall and the wedding of princess diana another site worth watching is brightcove com from a company whose main business is selling the technology for doing web videos to big media concerns including dow jones &amp co the publisher of this newspaper but brightcove also hosts web video from average folks and small outfits it will soon introduce a feature to allow average users to record video directly to its web site and then mix it legally with clips licensed from big media companies yet another worthwhile site is network tv which attempts to aggregate a wide variety of web videos in one place ive only scratched the surface of the available video sites but if you like youtube you may love what else is out there email me at mossberg wsj com see video versions of my reviews at wsj com mossbergvideo
