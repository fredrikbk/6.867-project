take my emissions please options expand for consumers to offset their energy use where do the payments go calling herself an environmentalist "in a lazy sort of a way " jen sader pays about &# more on her monthly bills from bowling green municipal utilities to put toward renewable energy she opts for paperless bank statements and paid extra to offset carbon emissions for a flight she booked on expedia com "all you have to do is click this box and pay &# why not " says ms sader a year old graduate student in toledo ohio with a winter that brought snow to tucson ariz and degree weather to new york city along with an academy award for the global warming documentary "an inconvenient truth" climate change has become more ingrained in the public consciousness not everyone may be willing to overhaul their lives to accommodate the environment but more people are opting for the rising number of options offered by companies to neutralize their "carbon footprints " meaning the amount of energy they consume most carbon offset programs require consumers to make small payments that in turn go to programs that create renewable energy or absorb carbon dioxide to counteract emissions but while the thought of offsetting carbon dioxide is a nice gesture its debatable whether the small donations make a significant impact some companies such as at&amp t inc and bank of america corp offer to donate money toward tree plantings or forest conservation for those who opt for paperless statements or bills the average global citizen emits tons of carbon dioxide per year according to cool air clean planet a nonprofit group that researches ways to fight global warming the average u s citizen tons a grown tree meanwhile can absorb only three to pounds of carbon dioxide per year according to tufts climate initiative at tufts university skeptical consumers are also wondering whether the programs are really offsetting their carbon footprints or whether theyre meant to just rid them of guilt or worse some suspect the programs are lining the pockets of companies who dont advertise them as profitable or that companies are using them primarily to boost their image not to help the environment several farms and wind farms that receive money from these sites verified that the policies listed on the sites have been followed some offset programs are not as successful as others the farm owners said but that has more to do with construction delays and production issues and is not because the concept is flawed experts say the key thing to keep in mind is this buyer beware those purchasing offsets should research a companys projects procedures partnerships and verifications on their web sites or by calling before handing over money according to tufts climate initiative which aims to counteract climate change and released a report for consumers and businesses interested in investing in carbon neutrality reputable companies will be transparent about their operations listing on their web sites the projects they support how much renewable energy they create and how much money goes toward them they will also list in detail all verifications and audits they receive many
