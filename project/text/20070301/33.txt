genocidal messianic regimes dont subscribe to nuclear rationality a few quotes from nobel prize winner thomas schelling "the weekend interview with thomas schelling mr counterintuition" by michael spence editorial page feb in regard to nuclear and biological weapons proliferation "once a country becomes the owner of nuclear weapons it is imperative that they learn to deal with them responsibly" and terrorists "also need to understand that nuclear devices are really only useful for deterrence " while it may be possible to apply some of his cold war experience to the current state of foreign affairs this creaky rhetoric is perilous when applied to genocidal messianic regimes and suicidal non state actors that desire only death and could care less about deterrence democratic countries cannot expect rational policies and responses from irrational leaders and fanatics he speaks of having "a shared interest in elevating the level of competence in the nuclear club" and a "well managed nuclear arsenal" as if writing a handbook for a supermarket clerk this must be how iran and north korea reassure the iaea during negotiations mr spence describes this thinking as "counterintuitive" i e it is permissible for holocaust deniers and planners to have weapons of mass destruction as long as they are in a safe place and exist for deterrence only mr schellings philosophy is in fact obsolete naive and dangerous to all free societies paul iadarola d d s bethesda md i acknowledge tom schellings view that america is safer with sophisticated rational enemies however when a thoughtful position is devoid of any reference and possibly a lack of understanding of an ideology that favors death over life the substance and message of mr schellings position is hollow and becomes meaningless i am not criticizing him rather i want to point out that western society embraces life and the longevity of life but hopelessly believes that other civilizations hold to the same cherished belief it is truly the tragedy of our times and history that a year old ideology can infiltrate a culture and subvert its values and the host culture doesnt have a clue that it is being subverted it doesnt matter if the weapon of annihilation is nuclear chemical biological or whatever the end justifies the means for the sub culture that is inflicting its will upon western culture in the path of allah and i am afraid that the greatest country on gods green earth is letting it happen the question is to what point geoff tasker thousand oaks calif with all due respect to their status as nobel laureates messrs schelling and spence can keep their wine sipping wisdom which is as useful for formulating serious policy as ruminating over how many angels can dance on the head of a pin i prefer the solid common sense realism of tony blairs observation regarding the terrorists "they killed but if they could have killed or they would have rejoiced in it " thom mckee marriottsville md mr spence observes "iran and north korea probably think they need nuclear weapons to prevent being attacked by us or others hostile to them " the iranian and north korean authorities who are pushing their nuclear programs may well harbor such expectations should our policy free them from concern that aggression against us or their non nuclear neighbors will result in non nuclear retribution the problems of nuclear strategy have always needed to be set in the context of a world of many actors and one beset by actual as well as threatened violence using a variety of means other than the cold war stereotype of a "nuclear exchange " mr spence quotes mr schelling after the north korean nuclear test urging that the u s "first mission" should have been to encourage reaffirmed adherence by taiwan south korea and japan to the npt regime but our most urgent need is a clarification of rights and responsibilities under the npt regime to keep it from continuing to provide a screen for actions to subvert its stated ends iran specifically justifies its current efforts in terms of its "inalienable" rights under the npt mr spence says mr schelling "expects" iran to get nuclear weapons and quotes him on the urgency of seeing to it that possessors of nuclear weapons take measures to assure that such weapons are not themselves vulnerable to attack and remain under the control of duly constituted authority should mr schellings expectation be our certainty for policy purposes iran is still a considerable distance from having an operational nuclear capability among the difficulties it faces are some that messrs schelling and spence would remove it is odd that the concept of moral hazard appears nowhere in this discussion by a nobel laureate in economics fred s hoffman los angeles
