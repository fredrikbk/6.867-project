home &amp family cranky consumer trying out photo transfer services benefits of saving family pictures can be worth risk special to the wsj slides these days are about as useful as eight track tapes but thats changing now with the spread of digital transfer services available through national retailers and on the web such services convert slides photos videos and negatives to dvds and cds we worried though about sending our family treasures to unknown technicians to find out if our fears were justified we tested five digital transfer services we found the benefit of reliving our family history in funky hues that are characteristic of s photography was usually worth the risk we learned it is important to organize old photos in advance since the ordering process is confusing we also benefited from speaking with phone representatives at mail in services instead of store clerks who werent as knowledgeable they advised us on scanning resolutions measured dots per square inch or dpi we found that increasing the resolution costs more scanning slides at a minimum of dpi and photos at dpi is generally adequate a telephone representative from brite pix in miami answered our questions about scanning resolution the company alerted us via email when our order arrived for processing and sent a price for our restoration &# we received cds of our slides and old photos and contact sheets cents per page three weeks later but we were surprised when the completed order including original slides and old photos arrived from costa rica a brite pix manager said labor costs are cheaper there but we werent aware that our pictures would be making a second journey out of the country our digital images from digital memories photo &amp video in orient ohio were worth the trouble of an eight page order form we received follow up questions via email and an estimate for digital photo restoration in our case &# our images arrived on cds in separately labeled cases a custom dvd slide show proved worth the money as we relived the s to our favorite classic tunes digmypics in mesa ariz delivered prompt service and email that alleviated concerns about our photos whereabouts but our own haste in reading the instructions meant ordering a jpeg dvd instead of a dvd video jpeg files dont play continuously we had to click "play" to view each one we would have understood the difference if we called customer service ahead of time but the reasonable price and processing time were good reasons to order again several months later at wal mart two clerks assisted customers while operating photo machinery we wanted our slides scanned and burned onto cd but after waiting minutes we learned the cd burner wasnt working we ordered prints instead which wouldnt be nearly as versatile as digital images the pictures were fuzzy and some were printed backward we returned to transfer a video to dvd and restore a family photo our dvd worked well the restoration was lovely but pictured another customers family fortunately a technician scanned our original photo and returned it when we placed the order a manager was supposed to call about the mix up but never did a wal mart spokesperson offered free reprocessing we tried yesvideo a service available via drop off points at pharmacies and discount stores an eckerd clerk didnt know the service existed we eventually spoke to a manager who vaguely recalled the service we felt uneasy about leaving our slides and video and with good cause they arrived at yesvideo a month later but we dont know where they were during that time we received our completed order six weeks after drop off eckerd discounted our order by a spokesperson said the employees would be aware of yesvideo in the future write cranky wsj com company web
