nokia maps plan for gps handsets addition of navigational service to phones may help stem price declines executives at nokia corp want to tell you where to go the worlds largest cellphone maker recently has unveiled several handsets that offer navigation service with turn by turn directions nokia which is seeing the price that it can charge for its phones fall hopes that by adding new features to its phones it will be able to stem some of those declines but the new direction leads nokia into competition with established makers of hand held navigation devices such as tomtom international bv as well as google inc and microsoft corp which are making a push into mapping related services the strategy also bumps against some of nokias largest customers cellphone service providers that already sell their own navigation services further crowding the field other handset makers are expected to follow nokias lead "youre going to see a proliferation of devices " predicts analyst ben wood of collins consulting ltd the new nokia phones will have a global positioning system receiver which uses satellites to determine a users location speed and direction local maps come installed in the phones and additional maps can be downloaded from nokias web site either directly to the phone or via a computer many phones in the u s now contain gps technology as a result of federal regulations intended to help locate people in emergency situations but americans typically dont make much use of gps services on their cellphones in japan one of the most advanced cellphone markets in the world location based services on cellphones are already relatively well established with its new phones nokia is trying to get the types of services that already are relatively common in japan adopted elsewhere it hopes that customers wont only use maps and searches for local restaurants and hotels which it will offer as free services for the most part but also will pay for additional content such as city guides and the navigation service with spoken directions just like services from established makers of stand alone navigation devices such as tomtom the nokia phones will give spoken turn by turn directions to the user prices of the services will vary depending on the type of content among other factors a europe wide subscription for the spoken turn by turn navigation service for example will cost euros &# a year for instance or euros a month meanwhile the travel guides from partners including berlitz international inc will cost about euros for a one off purchase of course for a company that ships several hundred million phones each year and posted billion euros in revenue last year sales from added services such as navigation are unlikely to make much of a difference to nokias financials any time soon and the cellphone industry long has touted the promise of offering services based on a users location such as finding a nearby restaurant but such offerings so far have failed to gain much traction that has been in part due to the cost of handsets and the services as well as ease of use hurdles nokia chief executive olli pekka kallasvuo acknowledges there have been issues and says the industry is addressing them as for not upsetting its large carrier customers by treading on similar turf with location services he says "we need to be flexible enough to be able to support different types of strategies " speaking at a recent media briefing mr kallasvuo added that he feels "a very very good buzz when it comes to navigation " one of the new handsets the navigator will come with a local navigation service bundled into the cost of the handset selling for about euros wholesale excluding taxes that phone plus the n and e models that also are gps enabled start shipping in europe and asia in the coming weeks and months nokia says it plans to launch gps enabled handsets in the u s but hasnt yet said which products will be launched and when the espoo finland company says more gps phones will follow this year analysts expect many consumers will be prepared to pay more for a phone with navigation they point to the already rapidly growing market for portable navigation devices which can cost between euros and euros consumers bought about million such gadgets globally during last years first nine months more than twice the number of the year earlier period according to british research firm canalys com ltd analysts expect established makers of navigation devices to respond by adding more features to their services such as traffic updates that nokia wont initially offer says nomura analyst richard windsor "thats where the other guys will be fighting back "
