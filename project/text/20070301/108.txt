two approaches to the same weill and brecht opera the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny los angeles opera through sunday los angeles and boston recently two productions of kurt weill and bertolt brechts "the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny" by no means a standard repertoire work were mounted in close succession by los angeles opera and opera boston a third is scheduled for the spoleto festival usa in charleston s c in may "mahagonny" is not just another curiosity from the archives but a challenging musical score with a harsh political message brechts fierce satire of bourgeois values and his indictment of a society in which the only real crime is to be without money was intended to shock its hearers into recognizing themselves when john dexter directed the piece at the metropolitan opera in he followed some brechtian theater principles such as stark settings and placards with slogans and in the final moments of the opera the house lights were raised as the "citizens" of mahagonny marched into the audience hokey perhaps but it certainly got our attention while directors need not necessarily adhere to brechts methods "mahagonny" needs a strong point of view and while both the los angeles and boston companies each using an occasionally clunky english translation by michael feingold made good cases for the musical merits of "mahagonny " neither communicated its essential message "mahagonny" is a work of contradictions its musical language includes hummable tunes thorny orchestrations and big atonal chorales it requires operatic vocal ranges and the directness of theater and cabaret performers it has spoken dialogue and a large orchestra the story is brutal three grifters on the run from the law end up in a california desert that according to brechtian geography is not far from pensacola fla and found a town that lures rubes with whores and cheap whiskey jimmy and his three lumberjack friends from alaska are ensnared but too many rules make the place boring brechts satire of the effect of bourgeois values on the working class and when a typhoon threatens jimmy declares that real happiness is anarchy the typhoon bypasses mahagonny and it is remade into a place where you can do what you like eating having sex fighting drinking as long as you can pay one by one jimmys friends are destroyed by their excesses and when jimmy buys a round of drinks for which he cannot pay he is condemned to death by a "court" where justice can only be bought the town a living hell dissolves in chaos the los angeles production while superficially employing brechtian starkness was more about hollywood values it brought in some big broadway names director john doyle renowned for his unusual productions of stephen sondheim musicals and theater divas patti lupone as widow begbick the brains behind the mahagonny operation and audra mcdonald as jenny the hard nosed prostitute who is jimmys companion as long as the money lasts much fizz was no doubt expected to come from ms lupone but her begbick was generic a variation on her mrs lovett in mr doyles "sweeney todd" though with fancier clothes and no tuba and the music was too high for her audra mcdonald had no such challenges with her soaring soprano and eye catching figure ann hould wards glamorous costume left little to the imagination she was glorious and a fully realized character beside whom everyone else seemed a little flat even anthony dean griffey whose jimmy was vocally able but theatrically subdued like the other opera singers in the cast he seemed inhibited by the amplification designed by dan moses schreier which although subtle robbed the singers of immediacy the overall flatness also stemmed from mr doyles direction which was nonspecific and low key with minimalist sets by mark bailey the performers often seemed lost on the big stage of the dorothy chandler pavilion act i was played in a kind of no mans land act ii introduced random modern elements such as vegas style signs and live video feeds for jimmys trial in which begbicks partner in crime trinity moses donnie ray albert grandstanding as a corrupt prosecutor was made to look like the rev al sharpton the conductor james conlon seemed determined to show off the beauty and complexity of weills score and both the orchestra and the large male chorus did sound beautiful but weighted more toward the "phony richard strauss" sound that brecht accused weill of having than the aggressive scrappy approach that this material also requires finally the whole show was very slick and undemanding by contrast the boston production in the seat cutler majestic theater directed by sam helfrich tried to be gritty and contemporary caleb wertenbakers set was an abandoned concrete building flanked by dumpsters and three portable toilets the cast all opera singers unamplified played the denizens of mahagonny as rough unglamorous and desperate joyce castles occasional vocal wobble gave begbick some depth and the whores led by amy burtons fierce uncompromising jenny were costumed by nancy leary like street corner hookers rather than victorias secret clad call girls tenor daniel snyder played jimmy like a man bent on self destruction and frank kelley gave begbicks sidekick fatty a sneering intensity trash accumulated as the show went on and as jimmys friends died they were deposited unceremoniously in the dumpsters at the end two men in hazmat suits cordoned off the whole set the six member male chorus was less polished but more involving than the big one in los angeles gil rose was the lively conductor it was a tighter more absorbing production than the one in l a and it made its point more clearly but now that weve seen a lot of opera productions updated into sordid ugly settings what made this one particularly apt for "mahagonny" after all the crime of being without money would probably mean more in a country club or on wall street the boston production let us observe the decadent city but not feel that it had anything to do with us ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
