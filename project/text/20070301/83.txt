politics &amp economics capital how fred krupps singular style serves business environment well fred krupp has demonstrated a knack for headline making in his years as head of the advocacy group environmental defense cutting a deal with mcdonalds to reduce its waste negotiating with white house aide boyden gray in the first bush presidency to reduce acid rain working with fedex to design a fuel efficient low emission truck and enlisting actor paul newman as a spokesman but putting a green stamp of approval on a &# billion takeover of texas electric utility txu in exchange for the new owners abandoning plans to build eight coal fired power plants is a milestone not only for him but for his business friendly market loving strain of environmentalism the deal highlights the breadth of the odd bedfellows coalition that in response to global warming is pushing the u s government to adopt mandatory limits on carbon emissions along with a "cap and trade" system allowing polluters to buy rights to emit carbon from those who cut their emissions at environmental defenses behest that coalition now includes txu its an approach that mr krupp says in the ceo soothing words that are his style "recognizes the realities of the world and deals with them it harnesses market forces and incentives so companies are rewarded in the court of public opinion or in the emissions trading system " or as kert davies of greenpeaces washington office puts it "they have carved out a space that no one else has dancing with companies while groups like greenpeace tend to dance on companies " mr krupp a yale graduate with a university of michigan law degree earned his green stripes in the late s as a lawyer in private practice in new haven conn founding the connecticut fund for the environment he gained attention for pressuring the town of southington to close municipal drinking water wells contaminated by industrial waste in in mr krupp landed the top job at environmental defense then a &# million a year outfit with employees roots in the campaign to ban the pesticide ddt and the informal motto "sue the bastards " even then it showed affection for market based incentives for example successfully advocating a mechanism to buy conserved water from western u s farmers mr krupp blew on those embers publishing a manifesto on the wall street journals op ed page that called for "a new environmentalism" that went beyond fighting pollution to solving "legitimate social needs" that produce pollution and working with "coalitions of former enemies " so while other green groups were loudly campaigning to get mcdonalds to get rid of polystyrene clamshell sandwich boxes in mr krupp knocked on the front door and ended up with a point agreement to help mcdonalds reduce its solid waste blindsiding the other groups and attracting the national spotlight today environmental defense has more than employees a &# million budget and pays mr krupp &# a year according to its latest public filing the group doesnt accept donations from companies with which it works nor does it accept compensation when for instance it assigns two employees to work in bentonville ark on wal mart stores get green effort with its suppliers mr krupp says environmental defense does take money in some cases lots of it from individuals who work at and own those companies though sam walton of the wal mart family is on its board it turns out there are a lot of rich environmentalists and theyre a lot more comfortable with environmental defenses approach than with more confrontational outfits that inevitably makes more aggressive green groups suspicious the right on the other hand accuses mr krupp of shaking down image conscious companies to pursue environmental defenses social agenda mr krupp isnt a one man band the natural resources defense council is part of the txu deal too but his style is key to his organizations clout and a big reason the would be buyers of the utility approached him a rolling stone article described mr krupp as "slightly nerdy but persuasive " his wifes response as he recalls it today wasnt exactly an ego booster "i didnt realize that the reporter actually met with you in person " "most people you deal with are very good at expressing their position on an issue " says james rogers chief executive of duke energy whose directors mr krupp addressed this week "what fred has an ability to do is see the issue through your eyes and then address the issue reflecting his insight into your concerns thats a gift " one big risk now is that mr krupp dependent on the goodwill of rich contributors and hooked on the approval of prominent ceos will be used and outmaneuvered by business interests his solution a business minded focus on outcomes not motives "the results we aim for are ambitious the results we praise are praiseworthy " he says the txu deal certainly qualifies on the first count mr wessel responds to reader comments at wsj com capitalexchange or email him at capital wsj com
