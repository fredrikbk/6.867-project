in the fray if birds were doing it it would be banned judging from the past two decades the boundary lines of what does and does not count as a sport are as pliable as a gymnast the once backyard game of frisbee now has college coaches and team budgets today such activities as skateboarding kite surfing and bicycle acrobatics play to wide television audiences in the x games where the "x" stands for what has been termed "extreme" sports at about the same time that the idea of skateboarders as athletes burbled into our collective consciousness extreme fighting or mixed martial arts began nudging its way onto television screens and toward the sports pages the first matches were held in in a steel cage called "the octagon" under the banner of the ufc ultimate fighting championships the bouts featured fighters from different schools of self defense such as judo karate and boxing the events bore a striking resemblance to professional wrestling with two important differences the fights and blood were real at the start there were neither time nor weight limits and the only prohibitions were against biting and eye gouging the outcome of the contests always came in the form of either a knockout or a submission in the early s this free for all form of combat entertainment was legal only in the state of colorado a boxing aficionado sen john mccain rightly went to the mat trying to stop what he took to be a human form of cockfighting among other things sen mccain was concerned that this professional form of "fight club" was not regulated fifteen years later some though not enough constraints have been put in place and extreme fighting is permitted in states immensely popular in the age range mixed martial arts is arguably the fastest growing spectator sport in america on saturday tim "the maine iac" sylvia will battle randy couture for the ufc heavyweight championship in a major pay per view event mixed martial arts bouts are explosive and brutal enough to make even hardened boxing people cover their eyes i asked world champion boxer oscar de la hoya about his impressions of the sport with a sense of irony given the fact of his own profession mr de la hoya replied "its just too violent with all the punching and kicking on the ground " the legendary boxing trainer emmanuel steward has been in the corner for many a gory ring battle and yet he expressed the same sentiment as mr de la hoya mr steward recalled "i went to a mixed martial arts event a few years ago i left after the third fight i couldnt take it it was just too uncontrolled and brutal " different mixed martial arts sanctioning bodies vary in their regulations some such as the ufc want to retain the edgy renegade quality others such as the international fight league ifl are trying to move mixed martial arts toward sports legitimacy with more safety restrictions such as banning the use of elbows strikes to the throat and head kicks when a fighter is on the mat a coach in the ifl the brazilian renzo gracie is the dean of jujitsu experts and one of the most storied extreme fighters ever "mixed martial arts is not violent violence is poverty or beating up your wife " he told me "i have never ever gone into the ring wanting to hurt my opponent " mr gracie insisted "not once " he emphasized jabbing the air still mr gracie and other mixed martial artists are willing to break an opponents arm to get him to submit indeed mr gracie told me that his grandfather once broke both of his foes arms because he would not surrender after he snapped the first like mr gracie most mixed martial artists will tell you that their intent is to win not to harm their opponents but there are exceptions in an interview prior to a fight one mixed martial artist with a shaved head and cauliflower ears blurted that while he did not want to kill anyone he went in the ring to hurt people a study recently published in the journal of sports science and medicine concluded that there is less danger of head injuries in mixed martial arts than in boxing after all mixed martial arts combatants do not absorb the hundreds of blows to the head that are common in boxing but injury risk may not be the best indicator of the level of violence in a sport not long ago i caught a clip from a pride fight pride is the organization with perhaps the fewest prohibitions two heavyweights were on the canvas as one got on top of the other he pulled his leg back and then blasted his knee into his opponents skull knocking him cold but the referee did not notice that the man on the bottom was out and so for a few seconds the one grappler kept kneeing an unconscious man in the head the fight was finally stopped but then the man who was knocked senseless came to and though on his knees he began again attacking his opponent not realizing the bout was over the crowd and commentators loved it in a ufc event i glimpsed on the cable station spike tv one fighter had another on his back he held his hand on his opponents chest and frenetically slammed his forearm into his foes face as hans gumbrecht has eloquently argued in his "in praise of athletic beauty " sports can be sanctified on purely aesthetic grounds carlo rotella the author of "cut time " complained that with mixed martial arts there is a "childish emphasis on anger as the ruling aesthetic " muhammad alis piston like jab was something to behold as was joe fraziers whizzing left hook but it is difficult to discern the art and grace of a man smashing his elbow into the face of an opponent whose back is on the mat the attraction is of a different kind the almost no holds barred bouts are as compelling and electric as a street fight albeit between two combat artists one college student who was also an amateur boxer confessed to me that while he could not help but admire the skill and bravery of the mixed martial arts fighters viewing the contests gave him the same adrenaline rush and vaguely guilty feeling that he had when he watched two men take their differences out into the parking lot many commentators have been focusing on whether this hybrid form of fighting qualifies as a sport but it is not as though there is some metaphysical essence of sports that activities as diverse as dressage and judo share as the roster of events in the olympics attests the world has opened its mind on this issue instead of asking if mixed martial arts is a sport it might be more useful to ponder whether it is a sport that ennobles or imbrutes participants and fans fans who by the way might just find themselves munching on popcorn as they watch one man choking another unconscious mr marino is a professor of sports ethics in the college of health and human performance at the university of florida see related
