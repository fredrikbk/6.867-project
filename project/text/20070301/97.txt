the daily fix columnist blasts new age stats and new age writers blast back online edition dont bring your newfangled statistics murray chasss way yesterday the veteran new york times scribe checked in with a column about spring training topics he thinks he should be off limits offering pointed jabs at selfish players and trivia minded reporters alike and then things took an odd turn with mr chass ranting about "statistics geeks promoting vorp and other new age baseball statistics " "for the longest time i had no idea what vorp meant and didnt care enough to go to any great lengths to find out " he wrote adding "it stands for value over replacement player how thrilling how absurd value over replacement player dont ask what it means i dont know i suppose that if statsmongers want to sit at their computers and play with these things all day long thats their prerogative but their attempt to introduce these new age statistics into the game threatens to undermine most fans enjoyment of baseball and the human factor therein people play baseball numbers dont " that put mr chass on a collision course with the breed of new age baseball writers known as bloggers nate silver of baseball prospectus a site singled out for abuse by mr chass responded with an even keeled open letter noting that "you will find that we are talking about many of the same things that you are were talking about how the oakland as can win the world series how the veterans committee is doing a poor job of recognizing the contributions of players like ron santo and how recent moves in the baseball industry are shoving baseballs most devoted fans aside sometimes our arguments involve statistical analysis and sometimes they do not to the extent that we use statistics we look at them as part of the puzzle rather than the whole picture " at the feeding the monster blog seth mnookin isnt so even keeled "its been a good long time since ive heard a reporter actually brag about his total and utter lack of curiosity regarding his work one of the biggest changes in baseball over the last decade has been the emphasis on using everything possible to understand the game this doesnt undermine enjoyment of the game any more than learning the historical references contained in shakespeare plays leeches the enjoyment out of a night at the theatre " amid flung insults some profane some quite funny fire joe morgan nails the laziness of mr chasss attack " new age is touchy feely new age is spiritual new age is intangible vorp mr chass is not new age it may be relatively new but it is not new age it is the opposite of new age it is an attempt to quantify to measure to analyze you know a more scientific approach to knowledge " on dodger thoughts jon weisman revisits a four year old column about stat wars "just to show that we should be past statphobia by now " "it seems to me that baseball is not baseball without numbers " he writes "it is a poetic game to be sure and a visual one but fundamentally you keep score one team gets more runs than another stats help us evaluate who helps their team get more runs than another this shouldnt be like a high school war between the jocks and the geeks watching a player has its role and evaluating a player with numbers has its role they can co exist that said can we agree that its okay to use newer better stats " the fix is no fan of those who see baseball less as a sport than as something to be dissected with stats but we also think that easy caricatures aside there arent many such people and most baseball fans know that the stats they grew up with can misrepresent a lot of whats going on between the white lines its common knowledge that a hitter who doesnt walk or hit for power isnt nearly as valuable as his batting average might indicate or that a middle reliever can have an era below but still let lots of inherited runners score most of the new stats mr chass decries are efforts to fill such gaps with varying success ops is an example of a "new" stat that tries to capture what batting average doesnt and its pretty easy to grasp its just on base percentage plus slugging percentage the same goes for the very stat mr chass disparages vorp statistical wrinkles aside it attempts something useful in trying to measure how much more valuable a player is than whatever cheap benchwarmer a manager might run out there new stats like these can take some work to grasp but its not like all the venerable stats are so straightforward take the wrinkles of figuring out an era or the permutations of the save rule and in the right hands new stats can be intellectually satisfying and even have a bit of poetry to discover that mr chass need look no further than alan schwarz writer of the sublime "the numbers game" and a columnist for his own paper as just one example heres mr schwarzs examination of inherited runners prevented more than anything else though the fix is disappointed mr chass is literally a hall of fame columnist the fix knows he didnt get to cooperstown by being as close minded and dismissive as he was yesterday no texas kept its dreams of sharing a big title alive with a thrilling win in two overtimes no less over no texas a&amp m as kevin durant put up points and rebounds overcoming points including treys to force both overtimes from the aggies acie law if the longhorns beat no kansas saturday theyll share the big title with the jayhawks if kansas wins the title is theirs as for mr durant he may depart for the nba after just one college season which prompted texas fans to chant "three more years " "it is one of those things that you want to see in person at least one time or you know you have missed something special " writes tim cowlishaw in the dallas morning news "tiger at augusta favre at lambeau durant in austin im not kidding there never has been a texas basketball player quite like kevin durant for all we can tell there never has been a freshman basketball player anywhere quite like kevin durant " mr cowlishaw notes that "there are all kinds of superlatives you can toss in the direction of a player averaging points and rebounds here is the primary one in the last years only eight players have ranked in the nations top five in scoring and rebounding as durant currently does most came from small conferences none were sophomores let alone freshmen " "this was the best game in the erwin center since kansas defeated texas in overtime in with uts victory over oklahoma in the final four season of a close third " writes mike jones in the fort worth star telegram "but this is the way it should be texas vs texas a&amp m taking its place alongside kansas missouri and oklahoma oklahoma state as one of the premier rivalry games in the big where the price of poker keeps going up and this is the way it should be for a long time if coaches rick barnes and billy gillispie maintain their present addresses " nothing is guaranteed for the chicago bears but at least they wont play under the cloud of a lame duck brain trust the team reached deals on contract extensions with coach lovie smith given a four year extension through and general manager jerry angelo given a five year extension through in the chicago tribune david haugh moves to pre empt arguments that mr smith won or lost a test of wills "demanding halas hall declare a winner or loser after smith and the bears finally came to terms wednesday night on a four year contract extension misses the point entirely the bears win for an organization in desperate need of stability since firing mike ditka in the repercussions of this victory in the boardroom could reverberate louder than any on the field during their super bowl season " found a good column from the world of sports
