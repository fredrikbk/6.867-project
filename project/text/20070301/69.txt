new accent nbc faces trials bringing law &amp order to france u s studios hope to localize hit shows proper use of ca ching paris to create a french version of "law &amp order criminal intent " writers had to do much more than simply translate scripts from the hit tv show they adapted scenes to reflect the napoleonic legal code they agonized over the set trying to make it gritty like the american one but also sleek like modern paris police stations the french set designer cluttered desks with papers and trash but built curving walls meant to evoke the feet of the eiffel tower "we took out any reference to the mob " says writer franck ollivier "we dont really have that here " he jokingly adds "unlike americans we are all nice people " this production a french replica of the hit nbc drama is the first phase of a localization strategy that the media giant hopes to roll out around the world foreign tv companies have already paid more than &# million for dubbed reruns of nbcs three "law &amp order" shows but nbc universal a unit of general electric co thinks the emerging business of creating foreign clones of current hits could be a significant new market "paris enquetes criminelles " as the french version will be called highlights a major shake up brewing in the tv industrys &# billion export business foreign broadcasters once happy to buy dubbed versions of old u s comedies and dramas are discovering that their viewers particularly the younger ones advertisers pay a premium to reach would rather watch original shows as a result demand is softening for dubbed shows in some markets and soaring for new scripts to film thats prompting u s studios to offer localized versions of their tried and true hits to foreign customers touting them as an option thats faster than starting entirely from scratch even though dick wolf creator of "law &amp order " has experience overseeing spinoffs of the series in the u s translating it into french hasnt been easy he has insisted on elaborate control right down to the sound of the signature "ca ching" heard on each episode delays have caused the project to be nearly two years in the making as producers on both sides of the atlantic endured casting disputes cultural tensions and the occasional debate over gun toting techniques when television francaise sa frances largest broadcaster premieres the series later this year mr wolf will have much at stake though two spinoffs of the series are thriving he has had to cope with a ratings downturn at the original "law &amp order" in recent years successful localization of a monster hit especially in a place as protective of its culture as france would "prime the pump for a lot of other deals " he says from "all in the family" to "who wants to be a millionaire " some of the biggest tv hits in u s history have been replicas of foreign shows but rarely are contemporary american shows copied in other countries partly because few have the infrastructure to pull off a remake to the standards of u s studios now production facilities in locales far removed from hollywood have become more sophisticated thanks to the proliferation of digital technology russia and mexico are emerging as two of the biggest buyers of so called "formats" for scripted shows the reality tv boom is also playing a role u s studios have profited hugely over the past decade by setting up local productions of reality shows such as "survivor" around the world nbc universal which produces three u s versions of "law &amp order" in partnership with mr wolfs company is just one of a pack of media behemoths pursuing foreign customers sony pictures television which first experimented with localizing in the s has made a blitz of deals in the past two years including one to remake the sitcom "the nanny" in indonesia walt disney co s abc television studio recently sold a clone of "desperate housewives" to a channel in ecuador mr wolf years old has always vigilantly controlled his shows and he knew that a flop in paris could hurt the "law &amp order" brand in europe so he insisted on keeping an extra tight rein on the project even creating a step by step instruction manual for his french partners to follow the resulting page "bible" covers everything from character outlines the lead detective is "an american sherlock holmes but should be culturally adapted" to set dressing tips "remember cops are very busy and have lots of paperwork so the squad room should be active and a bit unkempt " theres also a section on concocting realistic looking blood for murder victims "flour is a key " the contract with tf which took nearly six months to complete was equally detailed lawyers devoted an entire page for instance to proper usage of the famous "ca ching" noise that viewers hear periodically during any "law &amp order" episode the sound should never be used more than two times per act and should be used to signal a shift in the storytelling not just a change in location "ca ching " according to the contract is the official spelling of the noise which is a blend of many different sounds including the slamming of prison cell doors "we didnt expect this level of detailed involvement from dick " says maxime lombardini president of alma productions the company producing the series for tf "absolutely nothing has been left to interpretation " one issue mr wolf expected to receive a credit as creator and another as executive producer the same titles he receives on the versions of "law &amp order" on nbc but the french government limits foreign involvement in its prime time shows for "paris enquetes criminelles" to qualify as a prime time series for tf mr wolf had to give up his executive producer title settling instead for "artistic consultant " it was says leslie jones nbc universals head of international format sales "the negotiation of the century " preproduction started in october when a team of french producers arrived in new york for what mr wolf deemed a weeklong "boot camp " they shadowed "law &amp order criminal intent" writers to master the shows five act structure tried their hand at casting guest roles and scouted off site locations for filming writers on the u s version say they were startled by how little their french counterparts seemed to know about making episodic television "they seemed nervous and overwhelmed a little like they had just been hit by a freight train " says executive producer fred berner "it was a little disconcerting " american dramas typically minutes long have lately become popular with younger french audiences but the bulk of french writers have been trained to make shows and tv movies in minute installments says takis candilis president of frances tf "were great at movie style storytelling but its true that most writers and directors dont know how to work in the shorter format i needed " he says "those who do couldnt do it fast enough " he says he realized that developing a series on his own could take years and there was no guarantee it would be a hit tf pays nbc universal about &# an episode in return for scripts and the right to use the concept and structure of the "law &amp order" show they also get the consulting from mr wolf and ms jones in all "paris enquetes criminelles" costs about &# million an episode about more than an average hour of tf programming still that is a fraction of the cost of creating a series out of whole cloth nbc pays about &# million for a single episode of "law &amp order criminal intent " according to people familiar with the matter an early timeline called for french producers to complete most of the casting by january with finished episodes to air the following october but casting became a quagmire tf wanted to cast a much older actor as the lead detective mr wolf and his team had serious reservations about the age tf wanted a hunk to play a cheating husband mr wolf insisted the characters unattractiveness was key to the plot for the lead role of detective goren tf ultimately hired vincent perez a well known french movie star mr wolf and his team were happy to green light that decision ms jones says mr perez will bring crucial buzz to the series because french movie stars rarely work in series television as casting dragged on writers translated scripts from the first season of "law &amp order criminal intent " while trying to keep the stories and dramatic peaks and valleys identical writers tweaked plotlines to reflect french language and culture nbcs ms jones says they had to make changes in how the show addresses romantic affairs since having a mistress is less shocking to french audiences filming began last fall and mr wolf and ms jones quickly had their turn at culture shock mr wolf a former writer for "hill street blues" and "miami vice " has spent three decades on tv sets and ms jones has worked in television since when she joined nbc sports but they werent prepared for their first visit to "paris enquetes criminelles " the pair arrived on the set around noon to find the cast and crew breaking for lunch mr wolf was startled to discover lunch was typically a three course meal served by waiters as opposed to the self serve buffets on most u s sets as the cast and crew languidly drank a dozen bottles of red wine and played with a dog allowed to roam the set ms jones nervously checked her blackberry and applied liquid hand sanitizer says emmanuelle lepers a show consultant "we move at a different pace over here " she says while a u s crew often churns out episodes in nine months french production companies usually complete a quarter of that in a year french law limits the workweek to hours paying overtime isnt an option and local customs such as lengthy lunches and regular smoking breaks eat up a lot of time in the u s it isnt unusual for crews to start work at a m and keep going until a m the following day following the sale of "law &amp order criminal intent" to tf nbc universal has set up two local versions in russia a task that required ms jones to meet with kremlin officials wary of a u s propaganda effort ms jones says she has also had talks with customers in italy germany the united kingdom and china "a lot of potential customers are waiting to see how the french manage which is one reason this production is so important to us " she says tf plans to start airing "paris enquetes criminelles" sometime between may and july and ms jones continues to troubleshoot despite the production bible for instance the french have had a hard time "making good blood " she says lately there have been lengthy discussions about the punctuation of the title should there be a comma after paris a colon or nothing and while watching snippets of footage she recently spotted a subtle problem the lead actors were trying to move like real cops but occasionally drawing their weapons in unrealistic ways in one instance pointing a gun at a partners head ms jones arranged for mr perez and co star sandrine rigaux to travel to new york and ride along with police officers in their squad cars something that is fairly easy to set up in the u s but nearly impossible in france if everything goes smoothly the french actors could be back in the u s in the fall starring in a crossover episode on "law &amp order criminal intent" that introduces them to the million viewers who regularly watch the series "if that happens the extra ride along training will be valuable " ms jones says "we cant have cops watch the show and then call in to say the french people didnt know how to hold a gun "
