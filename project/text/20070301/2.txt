a shanghai education one benefit of tuesdays rout in equities is that it is causing everyone to learn more about the chinese financial system to wit despite all the talk of "contagion" emanating from china that countrys domestic stock markets dont have all that much to do with the rest of the world financial system welcome to the reality of a closed capital account consider tuesdays shanghai slide which is said by many to have triggered the global stomp out of equities perhaps the fall spooked some investors in new york who are easily spooked or were worried about other things too but the truth is that the causes of the shanghai plunge were mainly local mainland investors woke up saturday to headlines warning that beijing would soon set up a task force to investigate illegal stock brokerage practices and bank loans to punters then on monday morning the shanghai exchange crossed the psychologically important marker for the first time so chinas punters took profits and when the market fell far enough they bought back the cheap stocks on wednesday the shanghai bourse bounced back even as other asian markets kept falling a little perspective helps prior to last year chinas investors mostly stayed away from shares preferring to stash their money in banks poor corporate governance untransparent financial statements and rampant speculation made the market more of a roulette wheel than a proper exchange and with no pension savings to speak of why risk your hard earned savings however in beijing started selling down its state owned shareholdings part of that game included giving goodies such as cash and free shares to diluted investors around the same time beijing put the screws on property speculation concerned about rapidly upward spiraling prices this made a powerful case for playing the stock market all the more so because mainland investors arent allowed to invest abroad the lesson here is that the performance of the shanghai index bears little correlation to chinas underlying economic growth hsbc even finds a negative correlation chinas economic engine has motored along officially at around growth each year over the past few years and unofficially at rates several percentage points higher than that yet shanghais a share market shares of chinese companies only available to mainland investors sank in and in only last year did it start to soar so it doesnt make sense for world markets to fall merely because shanghai has a bad day the far larger threat of "contagion" from china is from u s protectionism or lobbying for beijing to revalue its currency either one of those could send the real chinese economy not just the shanghai stock casino into slower growth or deflation or both and that surely would echo around the world given the growing integration of the real chinese economy with americas what isnt integrated yet is the chinese financial system chinas markets wont act this way forever if beijing manages to clean up the way mainland companies do business efforts to impose standardized accounting rules and crack down on corruption help but the best way to develop chinas stock markets is to impose market discipline and especially to let average chinese put their &# trillion of savings where they may then a chinese stock selloff really would mean something to the world
