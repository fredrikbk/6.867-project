moving on just say yes or just say no whatever happened to maybe yes or on second thought no lately the dynamics contained in those two words "yes" and "no" are fueling more motivational tomes and seminars than ever just look at todays self help bookshelves "why great leaders dont take yes for an answer " "how to say no without feeling guilty " "the answer to how is yes " "the two most fundamental words in the english language are yes and no " says william ury co author of the best seller "getting to yes" and director of harvard universitys global negotiation project "life is the dance of yes and no every second were saying yes ill do this or no i wont " but why does our culture make us want to boil everything down to yes or no can focusing on those two words really change our lives and whatever happened to maybe on the yes front motivators embrace americas optimistic spirit delivering the message "you are what you think " says jonathan black who investigated the motivational industry for his book "yes you can " he found that seminar attendees are encouraged to be "totally yes positive " the message "if you say yes to the universe the universe will say yes back to you " one danger is that yes disciples can end up sounding like meg ryan in the restaurant scene from "when harry met sally " "yes yes " she said acting out how women fake lovemaking "yes yes oh yes yes yes " many inspirational workshops and books are built on "literally half a thought " says mr black but even if a spiel is simplistic people can find value in it because it helps them picture achieving their goals the runaway self help hit "the secret" available in dvd and book form lands firmly in the yes camp by preaching that if you envision what you want it will be yours workplace consultant bj gallagher uses her book "yes lives in the land of no" to help companies she predicts that the presidential candidate with the most idealistic "yes" persona will prevail "yes always wins " she says "people want the optimist who says america is great and getting greater " jeffrey gitomer may be americas top yes man author of the "little gold book of yes attitude " he has trademarked the term "yes attitude " in his book he explains that he is using the phrase to create "online courses and helpful products ad infinitum " and he reminds readers that they need his permission to use "yes attitude" in their writings or training programs his book encourages the memorizing of mantras such as "the main reason people rain on my parade is because they have no parade of their own " those in the "no" camp of course dont want to align themselves with rained on parades instead they sell the concept of using no to put on the brakes in jim camps upcoming book "no the only negotiating strategy you need for work and home " he advises us to start every negotiation with the word no whether it involves our teenagers curfews or clients seeking a price break "no" allows for a closer look at the real issues says mr camp a negotiating coach mr ury agrees "right now the world is hurtling so fast whether its expanding email or eroding ethics and we need to be able to use the stop button to say no as a complement to yes " he says his latest book out next week is "the power of a positive no " eight of the ten commandments are framed as nos mr ury says but our culture stigmatizes the word he points out that when toddlers assert themselves by saying no we attribute it to "the terrible twos " as he sees it rosa parks was a heroine of the positive no because she said no to surrendering her bus seat which was a way of saying yes to dignity and equality for all meanwhile the one word motivators speak of most dismissively is "maybe " they call it wishy washy and counterproductive "maybe is absolute death to effectiveness " says mr camp its a fair point after speaking to these yes and no enthusiasts ive come to a conclusion maybe theyre on to something email jeffrey zaslow wsj com
