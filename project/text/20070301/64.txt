mossbergs mailbox technology columnist walter s mossberg answers readers questions q i use microsoft word for writing family histories with many photographs but the program doesnt handle photographs well is word any better a word isnt primarily a page layout program so i cant say if youll consider the new version dramatically better for photos but microsoft did put some effort into improving the graphics layout and photo handling features in the new version if nothing else words system for positioning and manipulating photos is easier to understand because of the new interface microsoft introduced q in internet explorer is there a way to delete favorites other than one at a time i have tried to select several while holding the shift or control key but only one at a time is deleted a one way to do it is to avoid using the very limited organize favorites feature in internet explorer itself and locate the folder on your hard disk where the files that represent the favorites reside then you can delete the favorites like any other files this folder is called favorites and can be found through windows explorer as opposed to internet explorer its under documents and settings inside a folder bearing the name of the user or account you use in windows for example if your user account name the name that appears at the top of the windows start menu is "janet " the favorites folder would be c documents and settings janet favorites the icon for this folder is a star rather than a picture of a folder q is it true that microsofts license terms for vista prevent mac users from installing it using the parallels software that creates a virtual windows machine on a mac and does this also apply to apples boot camp system for running windows on a mac a microsoft has decided to legally bar the installation of the most common consumer versions of the new windows vista operating in a virtual machine a virtual machine is a software environment that allows one operating system to run inside another by creating a faux or virtual computer this prohibition covers vista home basic and home premium and it applies not only to parallels on a mac but to other virtual machine systems on other kinds of computers even windows computers vista home basic and home premium will in fact work fine in parallels on a mac according to the maker of parallels but if you install them in parallels or any other virtual machine you will violate the microsoft license to comply with the license you have to buy and install the more expensive vista business or vista ultimate versions however i dont believe the microsoft license prohibition applies to running windows on a mac via apples boot camp system since boot camp doesnt create a virtual machine when you run windows on a mac under boot camp the computer becomes a real windows computer not a virtual one no other operating system is running windows is in total and sole control of the mac hardware i should note however that boot camp was designed to allow macs to run windows xp and apple hasnt yet modified it for vista you can find mossbergs mailbox and my other columns online at the free personal technology web site http ptech wsj com
