mac and pcs overseas adventures globalizing apples ads meant tweaking characters clothing and body language when apple inc wanted to bring its series of "mac vs pc" ads to international markets it faced a difficult issue whats funny in one culture can seem ill mannered in another in the american ads made by omnicom group inc s tbwa chiat day a nerdy pc guy keeps getting trumped by his hip mac counterpart who uses pointed banter that demonstrates how macs are better in one recent spot pc is proudly having a camera taped to his head so he can do video chatting only to discover that mac already has a built in camera in another pc is flanked by a gruff security guard who insists on getting his permission each time mac tries to say something to him meant to represent security in microsofts new vista operating system for pcs but in japanese culture where direct comparison ads have long been frowned upon its rude to brag about ones strengths so for japanese versions of the ads that rolled out last fall two local comedians from a troupe called the rahmens made subtle changes to emphasize that macs and pcs are not that different instead of clothes that cast pc clearly as a nerd and mac as a hipster pc wears plain office attire and mac weekend fashion highlighting the work home divide between the devices more than personality differences in the first ad of the series mac even gives pc a nickname waaku a playful japanese version of the word "work " pcs body language is a big source of the humor in japan mac looks embarrassed when the pc touches his shoulder or hides behind macs legs to avoid viruses "pc constantly makes friendship level approaches that mac rejects in a friendly irritated way " says oliver reichenstein the founder of tokyo based interactive brand consultancy information architects ltd "the western mac ads would backfire in japan because the mac would appear to lack class " the international campaigns reflect a growing move by u s companies to refine their ad campaigns for overseas markets with more businesses looking to tap into consumer bases in international markets navigating cultural differences can require a subtle touch starting with a basic concept then tailoring it to individual areas works better than "just buying one ad or one picture and repeating it slavishly in every country around the world " says toby hoare chief executive of wpp group plcs jwt europe who oversees a global ad account for hsbc holdings "what we dont say is one size fits all " over the years coca cola co and mcdonalds corp have gone back and forth over whether to consolidate costs and messaging with a single global campaign and the companies have ended up trying universal ads dubbed ads as well as completely local fare figuring out when to reshoot and when to dub is complicated it was culture not cost that drove procter &amp gamble to intentionally use dubbed western actors in ads for herbal essences shampoo in japan the ads featured women shouting in ecstasy while washing their hair "in that naughty but nice character you get from herbal essences the fact that it comes from a foreign person makes it ok in japan " says linda kovarik executive planning director of p&amp gs ad agency beacon communications a joint venture between publicis groupes leo burnett and japans dentsu inc some advertising messages translate more easily than others apples long running ipod campaign that showcases silhouettes dancing to music also created by the los angeles area office tbwa chiat day ran globally as well since they have no dialogue those ads were tweaked only slightly in the "mac vs pc" series the u s ads were dubbed in the local language for spain france germany and italy but apple chose to reshoot and rescript the ads for the u k and japan both important markets and home to unique advertising and comedy cultures casting was particularly important the u s ads which began airing nine months ago are very popular primarily because they use actors with cachet among young viewers droll "daily show" commentator john hodgman plays a bumbling pc always shown up by comic actor justin long playing a mac mr long who recently starred in the movie "accepted " says his goal is "to not come off like sorry man im just better than you like im gloating and im kind of celebrating the fact that im better that comes off as smug and thats the danger " mr long years old says his agents told him he was selected for the ads because apple ceo steve jobs saw him in something and liked the performance "most of the time i have to audition " he says to recreate the delicate dynamic in the u k apple hired two moderately well known actors david mitchell and robert webb who have their own tv sitcom in britain called "peep show " the actors play characters similar to their roles in the show which follows the lives of two friends sharing a london flat mr mitchells character a bank loan officer is sensible and stuffy mr webb plays a musician who is sociable and uninterested in getting a regular job the u k versions hew closely to the original though some dialogue is made more relevant to local audiences in one u s ad that shows the pc suffering from a terrible cold meant to represent a computer virus the bug is a "doozy " but in the u k the virus is a "humdinger " tbwa also wrote a new spot for the u k that uses a real statistic to deliver one of the key messages of the campaign that pcs are designed for work and macs for fun in the ad mac points out brits work longer hours than any other nationality in europe "and they get less holidays " says pc "smashing isnt it " even with the use of local comedians the ads havent received a completely warm reception in britain one newspaper columnist charlie brooker of the guardian mocked apple for trying to be too cool and delivering a "series of brutal coordinated attacks " "when you see the ads you think pcs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately loveable whereas macs are just smug preening tossers " he wrote on february a tosser is a pretentious person a polling firm yougov plc found respect for apple fell in britain after the ads started appearing in cinemas and web sites january according to a yougov daily survey of people perceptions of the apple brand measured on a scale of to fell to from in the five days after the ads first appeared "there was nothing else happening that we know of that would have moved the figure " says sundip chahal brand index director at yougov some consumers in japan were also offended an ad that "slanders rival products can never be popular in japan " wrote one anonymous poster on kotaro blog a pop culture commentary others said the popularity of the comic duo the rahmens made the comparison approach palatable apple declined to comment on the campaign side by side comparison ads are still rare in japan pepsi broke taboos when it unveiled its aggressive "pepsi challenge" comparison ads in japan in and faced a backlash "in japan youre considered particularly dumb and obnoxious if youre caught bragging about your strengths and smart and nice if you play them down " says mr reichenstein in tokyo thats a challenge because aggressive comparison has long been at the heart of apples advertising in the u s apple is often perceived as a "scrappy underdog " says denise lee yohn an independent branding consultant if people in other countries are not as familiar with the brand ms yohn suggests they might interpret such advertising as "a more aggressive challenge " another issue in the process of localization apple may have lost some of the meaning in the actors clothing meant to personifies the mac and pc brands in the u s ads macs office casual clothing implies that he could be an internet entrepreneur or a hip rocket scientist but thats not what the clothing means to some japanese viewers who havent adopted americas "office casual" movement "the mac guy looks like he is wearing uniqlo the gap or muji these say simple and low cost low end brands " says ms kovarik as for the pc guy looking like a nerd "theyre really quite revered now in japanese culture " she says miho inada in tokyo contributed to this
