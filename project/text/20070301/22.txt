eurolinks daily view enels strike leaves e on floundering online edition german power company e on ag had banked heavily on acquiring endesa to employ its huge cash pile and cement its position as one of europes largest power and natural gas utilities endesa would extend e ons reach into faster expanding markets in southern europe and south america well beyond its current reach in central europe the u k nordic countries and parts of the u s now with italys enel sa having bought a stake in endesa late tuesday and secured rights to an additional thursday through share swap deals boosting its stake to pending spanish regulatory approval enels holdings combined with a stake held by spains acciona sa could make it all but impossible for e on to secure control as mike esterl reports under spanish takeover laws e on cant increase its current offer which expires at the end of march when that offer expires the company is prohibited from making a new offer for six months unless another company makes a bid to acquire endesa e on may try to challenge the recent moves by enel and acciona in court especially if there is any indication that the italian and spanish companies broke takeover rules by acting in concert to block the bid but such a legal strategy is no sure thing and could drag out the dispute indefinitely some analysts and investors think e on may try to sit down with enel and acciona to win their support by offering to share some of endesas assets or other holdings such concessions could prove costly and would mean nothing if enel or acciona are intent on gaining control themselves e ons management also has less room to maneuver if another company makes a takeover offer for endesa and the german company can make a renewed bid read our report by mike

contracts with their employers though vast numbers of chinese now own their own homes and run their own businesses it is difficult to settle precisely who owns what and what they are allowed to do with it as andrew batson reports private property rights in the abstract have been recognized in chinas constitution through a series of amendments beginning in but those vague principles are of little help in handling specific cases such as the governments frequent confiscation of land for development nonetheless the proposed law has attracted vocal opposition from leftist scholars concerned it will pave the way for the accelerated privatization of state companies and widen the gap between the wealthy and the poor the draft antimonopoly law under discussion for more than a decade has also been held hostage by disputes among policymakers some want to use it to break open still closed parts of the economy while others see giving the government new antitrust powers as a way to strengthen its control over businesses particularly powerful foreign companies that have dominant market share in china read andrew batsons report from beijing http online wsj com article ""sb html detente with
