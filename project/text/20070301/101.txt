the expat life experiencing chinese new year for the first time in beijing online edition it is truly exciting to be here for chinese new year the holiday is like thanksgiving christmas new years and fourth of july wrapped up into one holiday that celebrates family nation and a love of food and fireworks before moving to china i had only a vague awareness of the holiday which barely extended beyond understanding that each year was named after one of animals in the chinese zodiac here a palpable buzz was evident about two weeks before the actual holiday which fell on sunday february and runs for days ending with this sundays lantern festival our kids enjoyed learning about the zodiac with this being the year of the pig and each child participated in a chinese new years play at school they understood that something was afoot but all of us had only an inkling of the holidays true significance gift boxes of fruit and candy began appearing in large stacks in grocery stores and at little fruit stands all over town cartoon pigs and other decorations went up everywhere fireworks stands sprouted like mushrooms in a cave though they go off randomly year round the volume noticeably picks up day by day as the holiday grows near the explosions rattled my nerves at first i had a bit of a fireworks phobia before moving here but i began to barely notice them by the first week of february the parking lot of the local market up the street filled with new years lanterns and red decorations of every shape and size on the busy jingshun road people trailing overstuffed suitcases packed onto long haul buses heading back to their hometowns or villages for holiday visits chinese new year is an especially momentous holiday for the millions of migrant workers from rural provinces who fill the countrys booming cities they often work in grueling conditions living in unheated dorm rooms with no running water while their entire families are left behind the holiday marks their annual trip home where they are expected to arrive bearing the fruit of their labor a couple of months ago reporter mei fong profiled wei zhongwen a beijing worker from the northeastern jilin province which is close to harbin several readers were moved to contribute money and i attended a ceremony at beijings legal aid society where wei and other workers gratefully received about yuan us&# that night of the were boarding a special migrant workers train home leaving at am for an hour ride that costs yuan they were particularly happy to have some extra cash to bring home wei their leader spoke with an eloquence that surprised me "thank you from the bottom of our hearts " he began "though the money is not big it is very heartwarming for us that people pay attention to our lives having a voice in society is very important to us " those final words really moved me and prompted rebecca and me to give some small gifts to some of the guards and other employees at our compound most of them are very young migrants and they stand duty all day and night in any and all weather i thought it was important to acknowledge that we see them as people on the day of new years eve we put yuan into envelopes and the kids and i rode our bikes around and gave them out along with oranges which are said to represent good health and long life jacob enjoyed handing out the gifts and i reminded him to say "chun jie kuai le" "happy spring" each time the guards seemed surprised touched and a little nervous i dont think theyre supposed to accept presents we then drove downtown to ditan park where a temple fair was kicking off as were thousands of similar ones all over china because tradition calls for families to gather on new years eve for a large meal most people were at home preparing the roads were amazingly empty the fair uncrowded in sharp contrast to the throngs who would flock there the rest of the week we watched a traditional lion dance which excited the kids initially but couldnt hold their attention they were more interested in the previous performance which featured young children dressed up as emperors and empresses and most interested in the carnival games we blew a lot of yuan to win three stuffed animals stopped in the peaceful temple to light some incense then headed home friends joined us and we all enjoyed gorging on mounds of jaozi dumplings the traditional new years food we asked our ayi housekeeper to make the prior day before giving her the afternoon and following week off later we all drove down a nearby country road to set off some fireworks the pyrotechnics scared me but it was thrilling to be outside on an isolated lane listening and watching as the horizon lit up and booms reverberated in the distance i wondered just how much it could pick up at midnight and appreciated the no fireworks rule within our compound which made it an island of calm by the back gate a crowd of onlookers watched two american men smoking cigars and lighting roman candles in the middle of the road nearby two young chinese men lit huge chains of fireworks while their dates held their ears an old man rode up on a flatbed tricycle and loaded the large cardboard boxes that littered the street we hustled the kids home and off to bed as more cars pulled up to participate and watch the action at midnight rebecca and i watched a truly awesome fireworks display that filled the sky in every direction remarkably it made everything that had come before seem tiny all fireworks exhibitions i have seen in the past were municipal events with definitive boundaries and established beginnings and ends this was all the result of uncoordinated individual launchings which continued on for hours in the morning the acrid smell of gunpowder hung in the air as we drove over to the apartment of our chinese friends george and jen to welcome the year of the pig georges parents were ensconced in the kitchen cooking up endless mounds of jaozi which they added to the piles of food on the dining room table a bucket of kfc chicken sat amidst the traditional chinese fare on our way home we tried a shortcut and ended up on a busy clogged little lane we were in the shadows of the beijing airport but could have been deep in the country we stopped to buy sugar cane from a fruit hawker who took out a machete and started peeling a seven foot stalk and cutting it into inch sections a crowd gathered and i urged jacob and eli to pass some of the sugar cane out to other kids they did so happily and i didnt have to remind them to say "chun jie kuai le "
