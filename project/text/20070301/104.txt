the morning brief is there a new balance for risk and reward online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here u s stock markets recovered a bit yesterday but the anxietys still out there the biggest reassurance came from federal reserve chairman ben bernanke who used a previously scheduled appearance before the house budget committee to say there was "no material change" in the feds expectations for moderate economic growth in the u s and that financial markets were "working well normally " as the financial times reports following his remarks investors tiptoed back into the markets but they focused on what the wall street journal calls "larger safer seeming stocks" like those of procter &amp gamble walt disney american express and verizon and the mild point gain to didnt come close to making up for tuesdays point plunge the journal notes there were some winners amid tuesdays losses including john meriwether former head of the ill fated long term capital management hedge fund whose collapse nearly set off a global financial crisis people familiar with his results tell the journal mr meriwether benefited from bullish bets on treasuries and the yen among other investments another winner was deutsche banks greg lippman but more on his bets in a minute one question puzzling market watchers was how u s stocks took such a hit from a wave of selling that began in shanghai after all as the los angeles times notes "chinas year old stock market is undeveloped small and volatile " and foreign investment accounts for only of its value but china plays a big role in nearly every major economic story these days manufacturing energy trade etc and significant u s corporations like general motors wal mart stores and many others are looking to china as a key generator of now and future profits but the shanghai losses which resumed today after a respite yesterday and expressions of concern about a possible u s recession from the still influential alan greenspan were only playing into an environment rife with plenty of other worries mr lippmans success tuesday came from months long bets against an index of subprime mortgage loans the journal says and concerns about lenders gamble on risky borrowers arent going away as the new york times reports while many wall street executives maintain that investment banks and the broader financial system arent significantly threatened by poorly performing subprime loans the insurance premiums on wall street bonds are sharply higher suggesting greater concern about potential exposure renewed apprehension about the u s housing market isnt helping since falling home values make it that much harder to pay off a mortgage the commerce department said yesterday that sales of new homes fell in january from december to a pace that was slower than it was a year earlier and the median price of &# was down as the journal reports adding to economic worries it turns out the u s economy seems to have grown at an annual rate of just in the fourth quarter well short of the commerce departments initial estimate of growth in gross domestic product the main reason as the journal reports was that companies sold fewer manufactured goods than predicted leaving an inventory problem that was particularly bad in the usual suspects the home building and auto industries and yet it seems too easy to blame the anxiety behind tuesdays market plunge and lingering risk averseness solely on economics another interesting development yesterday was a vote in the house approving a bill that would fortify u s scrutiny of business deals involving foreign governments as the journal reports in other words at a time of bitter partisan division congress found unanimity on at least one principle caution at a time of war of fierce re examination of policy choices in iraq of intelligence officials warnings about a resurgent al qaeda of aggressive global moves by an assertive kremlin when congress remains split on so many key issues including the long foreseen demographic threats to u s entitlement programs that were mr bernankes nominal main subject yesterday on the hill following months and months of warnings from a handful of wall street sages about the hazards of having too much money out there in search of investment risk reward calculations may be swinging back toward balance microsofts antipiracy soapbox with microsofts new user generated video service now online the

delano roosevelt and andrew jackson carried strong arguments that such forceful individuals could bend history as the new york times says and his work on the administration of john f kennedy including the pulitzer prize winning book "a thousand days" was seen by some critics as a little too much like a novel mr schlesinger who worked for the kennedy campaign and as a special assistant to the president nevertheless won two pulitzer prizes and was a major liberal voice in american politics for decades as the los angeles times notes and even his last book "war and the american presidency " published in entered the political debate at the time by challenging the invasion of iraq and the bush administrations restrictions on civil liberties saying the results would echo those of similar
