wonder land the real american idol amid the mad jumble that makes the news in our time the white house on monday held a ceremony for a medal of honor recipient his name is bruce crandall mr crandall is now and earned his medal as a major flying a huey helicopter in in the vietnam war the medal of honor is conferred only for bravery in combat it is a military medal and it is still generally regarded as the highest public tribute this nation can bestow it is also very rare still the medal of honor does not occupy the place in the nations cultural life that it once did this has much to do with the ambivalent place of the military in our angry politics in the house debate just ended on a "non binding" resolution to thwart the sending of more troops to iraq its most noted element was the democratic formulation to "support the troops" but oppose the war we will hear more of this when the members of the senate debate their own symbolic resolution in last novembers congressional election the democrats picked several military veterans as candidates to mitigate the notion a burden since vietnam that an endemic hostility toward things military runs through the partys veins those democratic veterans won notwithstanding the bitter divide over iraq the presence of these veterans in congress should be a good thing if one thinks that the oft publicized "divide" between the professional military and american civilians is not in this countrys interest it surely cannot be in the countrys interest if over time more americans come to regard the life of u s soldiers at war and in combat as an abstraction as say mainly oscar nominees or as newspaper photographs of scenes of utter loss at arms two men have received the medal of honor for service in iraq army sgt first class paul r smith who died defending some fellow soldiers allowing their withdrawal and marine cpl jason l dunham who died after he dove atop a live grenade to protect his squad cpl dunhams act was the subject of a wall street journal story by reporter michael m phillips and later a book "the gift of valor " bruce crandalls medal of honor at an emotional remove of years offers a chance to ponder just where the military stands now in the nations life the particulars of lt col crandalls act of heroism and what others said of it at the awarding of the medal on monday offers we civilians a chance to understand not merely the risks of combat but what animates those who embrace those risks mr crandall then a major commanded a company with the th assault helicopter battalion carrying soldiers to a landing zone called x ray in the la drang valley an assault from the north vietnamese army erupted as described at the white house ceremony monday three soldiers on maj crandalls helicopter were killed he kept it on the ground while four wounded were taken aboard back at base he asked for a volunteer to return with him to x ray capt ed freeman came forward through smoke and bullets they flew in and out times spent hours in the air and used three helicopters they evacuated wounded the battalion survived a medal of honor requires eyewitness accounts and an officer there attested "maj crandalls actions were without question the most valorous ive observed of any helicopter pilot in vietnam " gen peter schoomaker the army chief of staff spoke at the ceremony of what he called "the warrior ethos " look at his words and consider whether they still stand today or whether as a matter of the nations broader ethos of commonly accepted beliefs they are under challenge gen schoomaker said "the words of the warrior ethos that we have today i will always place the mission first i will never accept defeat i will never quit and i will never leave a fallen comrade were made real that day in the la drang valley " at issue today is the question is that ethos worth it worth the inevitable sacrifice and not only in iraq but in whatever may lie beyond iraq the secretary of the army francis harvey went on in this vein "the courage and fortitude of americas soldiers in combat exemplified by these individuals is without question the highest level of human behavior it demonstrates the basic goodness of mankind as well as the inherent kindness and patriotism of american soldiers " an american soldier in combat demonstrates "the basic goodness of mankind" and the highest level of human behavior this was not thought to be true at the moment maj crandall was flying those choppers in vietnam nor is it now to embrace the thoughts of gen schoomaker and of secretary harvey is to risk being accused of defending notions of american triumphalism and an overly strong martial spirit thought inappropriate to the realities of a multilateral world this is a debate worth having but we are not having it we are hiding from it in a less doubtful culture maj crandalls magnificent medal would have been on every front page if only a photograph it was on no ones front page tuesday the new york times the cultures lodestar had a photograph on its front page of president bush addressing governors about an insurance plan maj crandalls medal of honor was on page in a round up three lines from the bottom other big city dailies also ran it in their news summaries some the washington post usa today ran full accounts inside most school children once knew the names of the nations heroes in

for direct combat with the enemy did it in a trench in iraq her story should be in schools but it wont be all nations celebrate personal icons and ours now tend to be doers of good thats fine but if we suppress the martial feats of a bruce crandall we distance ourselves further from our military and in time we will change at some risk write to henninger wsj com see related letter "letters to the
