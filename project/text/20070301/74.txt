politics &amp economics china pushes openness first order unveil rules dictating transparency hong kong a regulation mandating greater transparency in chinas government is moving forward in beijing but its contents are a secret the regulation eight years in the making may do more to strengthen beijings sway over its bureaucracy than to meet growing public demands for accountability in a country where information is closely guarded chinas chief administrative body the state council approved a draft of the government release of information regulation in january officials have said the regulation will give individuals a legal recourse to demand information that some parts of the government often decline to share which could include court decisions death tolls in emergencies and disasters and parts of the proceedings of chinas legislature the national peoples congress it remains unclear whether the new regulation would make it easier to get access to often secret draft legislation such as this one on information transparency a legislator who helped to shape the draft wrote in february in the communist partys peoples daily newspaper that the regulation would spur a "self revolution by the government changing some of the traditional concepts about the government " the legislator gave no timeline for the regulations implementation but offered some highlights the rules will require the government "to respond to individuals request for disclosure of information " wrote zhou hanhua from the chinese academy of social sciences he added that the regulation would provide "legal remedy" measures for people whose requests for information are rejected because the rules dont carry the weight of a law offenders cant be prosecuted in court mr zhou declined to discuss the rules in detail saying it is up to the government when they are made public chinese news reports and analysts suggest that beijing is promoting the regulation as a way to check the power of local authorities at a time when scandals such as one last year involving high level party officials in shanghai have embarrassed beijing and angered the public china is responding to such pressure partly because protests and riots over land seizures and local corruption are growing more common "this legislation is important in the sense that it changes presumptions about information in china making release of information the rule rather than the exception " says david bandurski a research fellow at the university of hong kongs china media project among those who have been pressing for the transparency regulation are members of the nations legal and media communities they hope it could be used to pry open records and unleash reporters who fear punishment for revealing state secrets a category that is vaguely defined ideally they believe such rules could help bind chinese journalists and citizens together with new powers to play watchdog over the government wang sixin a media law professor at the communication university of china in beijing calls the draft regulation a kind of "sword" for journalists "its a protection for them and its an authorization for their work " he says yet many chinese journalists say they doubt the new rules would enable them to push the envelope in news coverage at least in the short term under president hu jintao who took office four years ago china has instead tightened some restrictions on the press and on internet content chinese publications will still report to the partys propaganda department whose administrative powers could trump even thorough transparency rules the impact of the regulation could depend on whether it is applied as much to journalists as to ordinary citizens "one of the key issues here is how the media will fit in the media should be the primary means of getting information out to the public " says mr bandurski "we know theres been resistance from propaganda officials and we can expect that resistance to continue " still the regulation is part of a genuine if selective official effort to increase government transparency in recent years as old systems of information control are strained by the internet cellphones and other new technologies many parts of the government bureaucracy have added press representatives and live news conferences within the past two years though those functions as in the west are as much about spin as about transparency the government has also in general divulged natural and industrial accidents sooner than it used to the rules have been a hot topic in some chinese periodicals amid a wider effort by journalists and lawyers to protect their ability to report on corruption the regulation will be "the most exciting big news of recent times" for chinas government hu shuli editor of the magazine caijing wrote in may caijing helped uncover the shanghai scandal "just as releasing information is mandatory in stock markets so the release of government information once legislated becomes an obligation of the government " ms hu wrote since caijings publisher seec media group ltd has published some content by dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal the rules which the chinese academy of social sciences started to research in got a boost in the aftermath of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome at the time local governments didnt share information about the disease and reporters were largely forbidden to write about it exacerbating the outbreak china has since been seeking to demonstrate openness in advance of the olympic games in beijing jason dean in beijing contributed to this article
