as market fell some big names won their bets ltcms meriwether deutsche bank gained a day traders losses market routs always leave plenty of victims behind a savvy or lucky few can come out ahead amid the chaos though winners from tuesdays market plunge included one of the more renowned traders in recent wall street history john meriwether mr meriwether formerly ran long term capital management the hedge fund whose collapse in nearly triggered a global financial crisis he now runs a &# billion fund jwm partners which was up after markets closed tuesday and has generated positive returns for february according to investors the year old mr meriwether who was traveling and unavailable for comment benefited from bullish bets on the yen and japanese equities and u s treasury bonds according to people familiar with his results another winner was deutsche banks greg lippmann who in recent months has made paper profits for the bank of roughly &# million betting against an index of subprime mortgage loans which plunged more than tuesday before rebounding a bit yesterday mr lippmann deutsches asset backed securities trading chief has urged his firms clients to bet against the value of mortgage bonds underpinned by subprime loans as those made to borrowers with weak credit are known according to attendees at a september dinner he boasted "this trade will work " mr lippmann declined to comment yesterday the ability of messrs meriwether and lippmann to stay afloat while the market was sinking illustrates how some of the most sophisticated players have learned to take advantage of heightened risk levels in the financial system these days to be sure some of the gains and losses so far exist only on paper and whether they will actually materialize in the real world especially for trades that arent easy to unwind is an open question meanwhile a number of small investors making more mundane stock market bets were left holding the bag hit especially hard were individuals stampeding into mutual funds in january especially stock funds that invest overseas joseph clark a year old day trader in buffalo n y initially steered clear of stocks most of tuesday because he didnt see any good opportunities for a quick profit after spending most of the day painting his sons room he checked his eight dell computer monitors and decided to buy at p m he bought shares of allegheny technologies for about &# a share with some other trades he plunked down about &# of his &# portfolio he lost &# within a few seconds as the dow industrials suddenly plunged about points due to a glitch in computing the index "before i could blink the stock had sunk to &# so i started selling at a loss " he says "it went to hell in a handbasket it was disgusting " and some hedge funds private partnerships that cater to wealthy investors and large institutions that focused largely on stocks were pinched as well many individuals and hedge funds have been using heightened levels of borrowed money to amplify returns and that left them exposed on bad bets when stocks dived "in u s equities and volatility the damage was much sharper and faster with the bulk of the move we saw in may last year delivered in a single day " noted goldman sachs group economists dominic wilson and david heacock yesterday stock prices rebounded a bit from tuesdays point decline with the dow jones industrial average rising points to but the recent action highlights how some of the markets heavyweights have profited from the sudden pullback in various markets world wide that have been marked by excesses financial markets for some time have been awash in cash leading to huge amounts of cheap financing and market players have benefited from buying riskier securities around the world and letting them ride the question is whether tuesdays plunge could begin to change that scenario mr meriwethers macro fund which like other macro funds has a no limits investment strategy that can make for volatile performance profited from having bought japanese yen which rose tuesday as investors sought the currency to unwind so called carry trades in these transactions investors buy a currency whose central bank pays low interest in this case japans yen to invest the money in places with higher yields in addition jwm held lots of u s treasury bonds whose reputation as one of the safest places to park money drew buyers fleeing riskier assets tuesday the firm had also bet against riskier issues of corporate bonds compared with other hedge funds pursuing the same strategies mr meriwether has done well last year his macro fund generated returns of down from in the macro index compiled by hedge fund research inc of chicago was up in and in meanwhile deutsche banks mr lippmann promoted his winning bet at a september dinner with several dozen top hedge fund clients in a private dining room at the palm restaurant in new york at the gathering mr lippmann strongly argued that the value of mortgage bonds underpinned by loans to borrowers with weak credit would begin to fall some in the room had already lost money trying to predict a softening in the housing market and they were skeptical that mr lippmanns timing was right attendees say on tuesday mr lippmanns bet became even more profitable when the abx index which reflects the value of such risky mortgages fell on top of a decline since the beginning of the year yesterday the abx index rebounded rising roughly the abx index tracks how much it costs to insure a group of bbb minus rated bonds based on subprime mortgages the index is a derivative that falls in value when the cost of insurance rises so it is seen as a proxy for the value of the underlying bonds the position mr lippmann was promoting involved betting that the cost of insuring such bonds would rise causing the index to fall in value the same bearish bet championed by mr lippmann at deutsche was widely popular among hedge funds analysts say "the abx market appears to have been in control of bearish investors for some time now " says peter dimartino an asset backed securities strategist at rbs greenwich capital in connecticut "folks who historically would have made bullish bets on the index have been hesitant to step in which has made it an even more illiquid market " of course mr lippmann and hedge funds could lose big if the index rebounds strongly given how the illiquidity makes it difficult to buy and sell in this burgeoning market says loren katzovitz of fund firm guggenheim advisors "ive spoken to over hedge fund managers in my world and the trade is in the billions " for more than a year hedge fund manager evan claars caution weighed on his portfolio mr claar who runs new york hedge fund crossway partners keeps about one third of the firms money in short positions or bets that stock prices will fall and another third in restructurings and other investments that tend to be uncorrelated to the market his fund gained almost last year but could have done even better with fewer short positions on tuesday the strategy paid off though as the market tumbled mr claars positions rose in value helping the fund maintain its gains for the year yesterday mr claar did a bit more selling he says "last year our short positions were painful" because the shares he held kept going up he says but on tuesday "we were vindicated for maintaining our short exposure and it shows how important it is to always stay hedged " mr claar says technology stocks remain overvalued citing excess inventories and he has worries about the subprime mortgage sector but he is more bullish on the overall u s economy mr clark the buffalo day trader managed to recover half his losses before the markets closed tuesday and amid yesterdays rebound he managed to generate gains of &# trading a tiny technology stock but the weeks action has left him shaken "it doesnt inspire confidence " he says "i can control my own trading plan but i cant control what the market does " gregory zuckerman and ianthe jeanne dugan contributed to this article
