deal making minions ought not to be feeling a sense of malaise these days over a bourbon though a hint of self doubt emerges among them have another and a deeper malaise comes through its never been easier to make a dollar on wall street but behind the scenes many investment bankers say its hard to make a difference investment bankers are paid to put companies together and pull them apart now the value of what they do is changing as new money sweeps through wall street bankers describe jockeying between squads of advisers each trying to make an impression during interminable conference calls the "private equity guys" they say with a clench of derision prefer bankers stay out of the way vast amounts of capital have also reduced the art of the deal they say into a postmodern abstraction in short many clients want the banks money but not their advice "deeply dissatisfying " says one banker about the state of most assignments a deal lawyer lobs in his own stinging assessment "bankers are sitting in coach " these folks are too highly paid to earn much sympathy for their woes but it is worth understanding how in their greatest hour the double windsor set is wallowing in insecurity around the street there is the widely held belief that will be the last year of a historic four year run a slew of retirements are already planned for early and in the mergers and acquisitions world there is a feeling that the psychic rewards of the job have moved inversely to the monetary ones "smart people in this industry are trapped " between those diverging lines says one young banker much of the time he says his clients have their own staffs of in house advisers who dont need much outside guidance "do we add a lot of value i struggle with that personally " its easy to stereotype bankers as craven salesmen who conveniently position themselves near vast flows of money to siphon off their tidy take of course thats part of the game but you also find some exceptionally bright people who for reasons of vanity and otherwise find purpose in providing strategic counsel conveying experience and delivering that small but crucial observation to a ceo in need this is the part thats not about the money "its such a pleasure to be wanted " the young banker confides the advisers role though is being overwhelmed by what were once his two greatest weapons information and capital

equity or in house at a corporation a company like johnson &amp johnson for instance might have some people doing such work internally this has yielded its own heaving mass of information and insight most bankers quietly admit its difficult to come up with an original idea so many people have already picked over the same territory flowing around this are the same google powered forces changing the realms of news and politics older bankers recall how clients once relied on them for real time stock quotes from quotron machines information about realms once inscrutable be it private indian companies or russian aluminum are more instantly obtainable and even if some tidbit is hard to locate it wont take long for a deal obsessed army of blogs message boards and news media to find out companies have eagerly exploited these changes they mercilessly spread their business around rather than seeking out wise counsel from the few they now award work to a wide cast of banks hoping to tap into deep pools of cash from the many it all makes bankers more eager to please and more on edge just look at international business machines which in the last nine years has used different banks in its acquisitions according to data provider capitaliq on the street this has become derisively known as the "lazy susan" trade banks differentiate themselves by promising gobs of capital to buyers the important advice comes from the whiz kids structuring the loans and not the deals themselves "capital is everything " says one banker at a top five firm its a change that most galls old fashioned advisers "a lot of bankers pull the levers inside their own banking machine to make transactions happen and thats a different function from being an adviser on a much more personal level where the
