politics &amp economics bush and democrats talk trade negotiations on labor rights may help revive latin deals doha washington the bush administration and congressional democrats are attempting to negotiate a grand compromise on trade that would allow several deals to move forward by elevating the importance of labor rights in those agreements after democrats won control of congress in november in part by attacking free trade agreements president bushs globalization agenda seemed all but dead for the rest of his term among priorities were bilateral deals with peru panama and colombia the doha round of multilateral talks as well as renewal of a broad presidential authority to negotiate agreements and push them through congress which expires in june but the white house and lawmakers have decided to try to find common ground as mr bush has signaled flexibility on labor standards after years of resisting the talks are being led by u s trade representative susan schwab house ways and means chairman charles rangel of new york and rep jim mccrery of louisiana the ranking republican on the committee much of the negotiations has been at the staff level but the three principals have played a role conferring in face to face meetings on capitol hill or over the phone it isnt clear a deal will be reached soon if at all given the bitter history surrounding the issue the democrats main demand is to incorporate into trade agreements a requirement that other countries embrace the basic principles for workplace rights outlined by the geneva based international labor organization these ban forced labor and child labor limit workplace discrimination and reserve for workers the right to organize and bargain with employers negotiators are struggling to find a way to translate those general goals into specific language that works for the u s and would be partners in free trade agreements especially for developing countries where labor rights vary widely they are also discussing ways to craft wording that would prevent the agreements from being used to challenge the u s s own labor standards a successful agreement could clear passage of the latin america deals and help jump start the stalled doha round it could also presage bipartisan cooperation on other fronts such as climate change middle class taxes and immigration "if youre serious about addressing problems youve got to be serious about working with the other party " said mr mccrery of ways and means which has jurisdiction over health and tax policy as well as trade democratic critics of mr bush pushed by organized labor want to elevate the importance of labor rights according them the same status as business priorities such as patent protections that u s negotiators pursue on behalf of drug makers mr bush so far has preferred to deal with labor rights outside any actual pact critics say that strategy has made it difficult to enforce labor commitments since they arent subject to the same sanctions that back up business priorities a few weeks after the november elections ms schwab signaled in a u s chamber of commerce appearance that she wanted to deal with those concerns for democrats mr rangel said the goal is "not to do damage to trade" but to find a compromise that shows "this great country is at least concerned" with minimum labor rights standards the issue of labor rights began to take on broader significance in the mid s when nations moved to lower trade barriers and integrate their economies critics worried that workers would suffer and pushed for enhanced protections these efforts culminated in a u s trade pact with jordan at the end of the clinton presidency that affirmed the ilo standards critics say securing similar protections under mr bush has been difficult in the current talks one challenge vexing negotiators is how in concrete terms to carry out any agreement the panama pact which was concluded recently was left open to accommodate any labor commitments the administration might agree to with congress but the details of the peru and colombia deals have been settled since last year and it remains uncertain whether they would be reopened or whether democrats would agree to address their concerns in side commitments a problem that especially worries republicans and the administration is how to ensure new labor commitments dont unintentionally rebound at home where american businesses already have high workplace standards under u s law some officials fret about the limits imposed by u s law on the ability of government workers to organize and worry that putting ilo principles in a bilateral trade deal might lead to legal actions over whether the u s itself fully complies with the basic international rights "what were trying to do is make sure everyone else lifts their game up but not do it in a way that would affect u s law " said schwab spokesman sean spicer of course other hurdles from environmental concerns to port security could arise and a labor rights deal between democrats and the white house wouldnt likely be supported by the afl cio given its concerns with globalization but the bush team is betting that a deal backed by mr rangel and michigan democratic rep sander levin a senior ways and means member would strengthen support for trade among house democrats and perhaps begin to rebuild the bipartisan coalition for free trade that existed for much of the s for democrats the issue is fraught after years of being frozen out of trade policy messrs rangel and levin want to show they are players but their ability to compromise may be limited since trade was an election turning factor last fall "if rangel and levin cant achieve a large amount of change they cant move " said lori wallach head of public citizens trade watch a labor backed advocacy group she said democrats need to demonstrate for voters that they have made real changes to mr bushs trade agenda "if they do more of the same they will not be in the majority after "
