weekend journal the wealth report stalkers of the high seas yacht spotters reveal locations infuriating owners paul allen the billionaire co founder of microsoft is famously private especially when it comes to his foot yacht octopus his crew members have to sign confidentiality agreements he has rarely if ever permitted the media to photograph the boat and he prefers to sail in the worlds most remote waters yet anyone visiting the web site yachtspotter com can find a wealth of information about octopus they learn that it spent the summer in micronesia before motoring to australia south africa and barbados two weeks ago the site says octopus was anchored off bermuda yachtspotter com also has candid photographs of the ship one shows it with a helicopter on deck sailing alongside mr allens other megayacht tatoosh off the coast of france another depicts the craft leaving the antibes yacht club in france at sunset mr allen didnt authorize any of the photos or location information they were posted by an oddball collection of dockworkers marina clerks boat owners and other boat enthusiasts who call themselves yacht spotters they are to yachts what train spotters are to trains devoted sometimes obsessive trackers of the worlds biggest pleasure craft and they are making life miserable for todays superrich boaters "its a bit disturbing that people can now track exactly where a certain megayacht is located or where shes anchored " says jonathan beckett chief executive of nigel burgess a yacht brokerage firm in britain "i can see how it might be useful to some people but i dont think its very healthy " a spokesman for mr allen says he doesnt discuss his personal property yacht owners better get used to it the online posters have been nurtured by an explosion in the size and number of yachts more than yachts feet or longer are under contract or construction says showboats international magazine up from in and technology has made it easier than ever for fans to spot a boat snap a digital picture upload it to a web site and record its coordinates more than a dozen sites carry some form of yacht spotting information including shipspotters com yachtforums com and superyachttimes com the two most popular are yachtspotter com and power &amp motoryacht magazines "megayachts" forum yachtspotter com is run by a french engineer raphael montigneaux who says that while he isnt in the business yachts have been his "passion since childhood " he says he takes about yacht photos a year diane m byrne power &amp motoryachts editor says her magazines site has dozens of anonymous contributors from yacht brokers in florida to a bored office worker in seattle who snaps photos from his window overlooking the harbor "theyre enthusiasts " says ms byrne "but its also voyeuristic these people want to peer into a world that they dont belong to and see how the other half lives " the yacht spotting sites have a few ground rules boats under feet arent of interest photos of boat owners and guests especially in revealing swimsuits are discouraged snapshots of yachts under construction are also frowned upon as are blueprints or discussions of a boats layout since they could be used by terrorists or kidnappers in a megayachts forum poster uploaded unauthorized pictures of a boat nearing completion in a shipyard but ms byrne took them down after the owner complained she declines to give the owners name she screened all the photos on the site for a few years but this year decided to let people post photos without her approval "theyve become a self policing group " she says still the sites reveal intimate details of yachts from the size of their engines and upper deck jacuzzis to their mishaps the big event this may involved lady moura the footer owned by a saudi businessman which hit the shore off the coast of france "lady moura is aground off the entrance of port canto in cannes " wrote a spotter called nok just minutes after the accident "she has a port list of about five degrees and is leaking fuel guests and luggage are being off loaded " another poster pascal immediately posted pictures of the guests and crew filing off the boat with their bags yacht spotters also track rising sun the footer co owned by oracle chief executive larry ellison and entertainment czar david geffen yachtspotter com followed the ships movements this summer from majorca and barcelona in spain to portofino capri and venice in italy and eventually to villefranche in france this month the boat was in bremen germany presumably to get work done at the shipyard there several photos of rising sun on the megayachts forum show guests lounging on the deck eating breakfast and boarding a jet ski one enthusiast posted pictures of a crew member washing the ships dozens of windows using a special ladder "i think that its the first time that we see it in use " said the poster another noted that rising suns logo had recently been changed messrs ellison and geffen through representatives declined to comment
