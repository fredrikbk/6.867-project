google under fire over a controversial site racist speech porn stir battle in brazil a pandoras box sao paulo brazil google inc makes billions marrying advertising to the web just yesterday it reported yet another surge in revenue and profit but here in brazil the internet powerhouse is embroiled in an embarrassing episode over its efforts to profit from social networking one of the fastest growing activities online google has gotten in hot water over its web site orkut which like other social networking sites allows people to swap information and create personal web pages while many americans have never heard of it orkut is a powerhouse overseas with more than half its million monthly visitors in brazil by some measures it ranks among the top sites on the web in popularity alongside other heavily used social networking sites such as news corp s myspace and facebook inc a central challenge for all these companies is how to turn the usage into cash all of the big players are looking to advertisers to generate revenue for most of its history orkut was ad free then when google tried putting ads on the site it ran into trouble critics in brazil released a report showing advertisements on orkut alongside pictures of naked children and abused animals google immediately suspended the ads but the mountain view calif company is still grappling with the fallout from critics orkut campaign the head of googles brazilian operation is facing criminal contempt charges for refusing to turn orkut users data over to police and next month there is a hearing in a case brought by a sao paulo prosecutor threatening daily fines of &# or the shuttering of googles brazil office "we have won " says thiago tavares nunes de oliveira a year old brazilian law professor who wrote the graphic report and has crisscrossed brazil making the case that google allowed orkut to become a redoubt of criminal activity including child pornography and racist speech the u s based national center for missing and exploited children which tracks reports of child pornography says orkut generates a comparable amount of pedophilia complaints as other social networks google says it regularly removes illegal content from its services it adds that while orkuts data are not directly subject to brazilian law the company has changed its policies to more swiftly address brazilian police and judicial requests google also acknowledges the company made mistakes by not devoting enough resources to understanding a culture and country where its site had become popular "wed do it differently today " says alexandre hohagen the head of googles brazil office who is facing contempt charges "the product grew faster than the support that is a fact " indeed googles traditionally hard line stance on privacy issues which it views as necessary to preserve user trust exacerbated the situation in brazil as well last year the u s justice department took google to court for refusing to hand over data about consumer web searches that yahoo inc microsoft corp and time warner inc s aol had supplied google eventually complied after a federal judge ordered the governments request dramatically scaled back but what makes social networking sites so popular the ability of anyone to post material also makes them hard to control threatening the ability of internet companies to make money off them new york attorney general andrew cuomo this week reached a settlement with privately held facebook in which the palo alto calif company promised to respond to user complaints about nudity pornography or harassment within hours mr cuomos office had accused facebook of being slow to respond to complaints about sexual predators the regulatory problems are more acute overseas u s laws on internet privacy and freedom of speech are relatively well developed but thats often not the case in other countries where companies face conflicting laws unpredictable environments and national or religious sensitivities brazilian law for example does not offer internet companies the same immunity for defamation related claims that they enjoy in the u s in india nationalists have called for an orkut ban and the site is already blocked in some arab countries for advertisers the orkut episode helped reinforce concerns that social networks are an unreliable advertising vehicle "orkut is a pandoras box " says brian crotty a vice president at mccann ericksons brazilian advertising office liquor maker diageo plc of london says it stopped advertising on all of googles properties after learning that its ads ran alongside pornographic images on the site spokesman stuart kirby says diageo didnt realize that ads for its johnnie walker brand had appeared on orkut where many users are below legal drinking age orkut screen shots collected by mr tavares also show content he views as objectionable running next to ads from alibaba com a business to business site based in hong kong and whose parent is owned by yahoo an alibaba spokesman said the company is concerned about the situation "we are contacting google to understand what steps they are taking to insure that search advertisements do not appear alongside content that is inappropriate or illegal " he added in a statement google is exploring ways to put advertising back on orkut without it appearing alongside content advertisers find objectionable says one person familiar with the matter addressing such problems can prove expensive news corp s myspace faced similar complaints in recent years now company executives say each of the eight million new pictures uploaded to its site each day is reviewed at least once by a human being that program costs myspace several million dollars a year news corp has agreed to acquire dow jones &amp co the publisher of the wall street journal in addition news corp and google have an agreement for google to sell ads that appear on myspace and share the ad revenue how to make money from orkut and keep increasing revenue from outside the u s are strategic questions for google in the third quarter of this year of googles revenue came from outside the u s up from in and in thanks partly to the fact that brazilians are some of the most active internet users in the world orkut now has about as much global overall traffic or "page views " as googles top ranked search engine according to data from comscore inc google released orkut named after creator orkut buyukkoekten a google software engineer in it became a surprise hit in brazil where it quickly won millions of users hewing to its usual strategy the internet giant didnt immediately try to make money from the site as recently as the middle of google had just three employees in brazil googles low investment in orkut contrasted sharply with its growing importance in latin americas largest country orkut has become a major center of brazilian social life with two thirds of all internet surfers using the service many of them children the site rapidly became a reflection of the good and bad of brazilian society a country famed for its fun loving spirit as well as slum violence communities were built around such themes as soccer love and overcoming injustice almost people joined discussions in a group called "my mother is the best on earth " google says criminal elements also connected with each other and recruited sympathizers on the site including neo nazis organized gangs and pedophiles mr tavares says in one year he recorded thousands of pages related to pedophilia other communities boasted names like "black the inferior race" and "im a nazi so what " "it was like there were two orkuts a normal orkut and a pornographic orkut living in parallel " says irineu de carli jr a brazilian software consultant orkuts dark side drew the interest of mr tavares a solemn man who became the second ever youngest professor at his school the catholic university of salvador in mr tavares received a small grant to track human rights violations on the internet he says he soon discovered that while internet use is exploding in latin america the region has few laws and limited resources to govern the rapid growth in december of mr tavares set up a nonprofit group called safernet modeled on u s organizations the site allows users to report online crimes via its web site within weeks he says the site was receiving hundreds of complaints more than were about orkut mr tavares began pointing out problems to internet companies he says yahoo of sunnyvale calif and microsoft of redmond wash promptly removed material he flagged as offensive and promised to hold copies for authorities microsoft invited mr tavares to a meeting with its top brazilian executive but the young lawyer says google gave him the brush off he says mr hohagen the head of googles brazil operation didnt reply to several requests for meetings in early mr tavares gave a google press officer a cd containing pages of evidence of alleged orkut crimes he never heard back google in brazil says it cant find clear records of any such meeting requests by mr tavares but mr hohagen confirms his account of the cd google meanwhile began looking to make money in brazil in july it formed a local subsidiary to sell online advertising orkut was part of the strategy "i lose sleep just thinking about the gold mine that orkut could represent " mr hohagen told exame brazils leading business magazine in but google faced a growing wave of complaints many instigated by mr tavares sergio gardenghi suiama a federal prosecutor in sao paulo in charge of human rights began flooding the companys brazil office with subpoenas seeking identifying information such as email addresses of orkut users accused of committing crimes online under direction from googles u s headquarters mr hohagen refused to accept the subpoenas googles chief legal officer david drummond traveled to brazil to explain the situation in april mr drummond testified at a congressional hearing requested by mr tavares he said google wished to assist authorities but orkut data were all stored on computer servers located in the u s therefore he said the data were subject to u s laws not brazilian ones those laws include strict protections on users private data and typically dont allow google to reveal private communications without a users express consent except under very limited conditions and when ordered by a u s judge and some crimes being investigated by brazilian authorities like racist speech arent crimes in the u s if google met brazilian demands what would it do if saudi arabia where homosexuality is a crime began asking it to unmask gay users orkut has been sparking debates over freedom of expression elsewhere the united arab emirates blocked the site this summer after concerns that a community called "dubai sex" was promoting immorality in india members of the army of shiva a political party responded to criticisms of it on the site by attacking cyber cafes and demanding that orkut be banned as a "threat to national security " but brazilians are sensitive to the idea that americans dominate the internet in for instance brazil joined china in a bid to wrest control from the u s of the internets domain name system the management of suffixes like com and net that help route internet traffic google took other steps that angered local officials the company gave responsibility for handling its brazilian legal crisis to an outside lawyer durval de noronha goyos jr head of one of brazils largest law firms mr noronha criticized the prosecutor mr suiama for presenting "inept" judicial demands to googles brazil subsidiary rather than its headquarters in california where the company wished to handle them mr suiama he said was more interested in "exhibitionism in the media" than in solving problems the approach backfired in august of mr suiama requested a police investigation of mr hohagen for disobeying judicial orders and filed a lawsuit threatening google with heavy fines unless it complied with his requests that case is scheduled to go to an arbitration hearing next month "if they want to do business in brazil they must obey the laws here " mr suiama says by early this year mr hohagen says google was already looking to shift strategies it sent orkuts creator mr buyukkoekten on a three week tour through brazil where he was mobbed by fans for autographs during the tour google announced that a test of orkut advertising which had started in india and the u s last year would be extended to brazil but the test provided additional ammunition for mr tavaress person team at safernet trawling through orkuts communities mr tavares noticed that googles automated ad system couldnt tell the difference between a page dedicated to pedophilia and one with ordinary content on aug mr tavares sent an page complaint to brazils advertising watchdog known as conar documenting cases of embarrassing juxtapositions advertisements for diageos johnnie walker whiskey next to pornographic images a pet store pitch on a community dedicated to stabbing animals with knives in the report mr tavares alleged that googles "flagrant illegalities" had resulted in ads appearing next to "barbaric" content after conar opened an investigation a few days later google immediately suspended advertising world wide on orkut the company described the ads as part of a test marketing program involving only of orkut pages given orkuts heavy usage however the ads could have been viewed by users hundreds of millions of times a month google has since moved swiftly to address critics concerns in brazil in a news conference last month in sao paulo mr hohagen announced a shift in strategy google brazil would begin accepting police and judicial requests although he said the companys u s parent would still respond to them and the company offered to outfit nonprofits including safernet with special accounts so their complaints about content would receive top priority in late september mr hohagen called mr tavares and the pair sat down for a five hour meeting they discussed steps the company could take to improve orkut "it was obvious that they could only commercialize orkut after they proved to everyone they had solved the problem " mr tavares says vauhini
