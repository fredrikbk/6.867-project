the morning brief sarkozy the strike his wife and the treaty online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here early this morning european union leaders agreed to a treaty that would replace the scuttled eu constitution and unify the bloc as never before and while the potentially tumultuous ratification process ahead gives the pact an uncertain future the continent this morning seems more occupied with a far more compelling question was news of nicholas sarkozys divorce timed to coincide with the french transportation strike mr sarkozy and his counterpart heads of state or government were in portugal which currently holds a rotating eu presidency that would be transformed by the new treaty while the lisbon treaty lacks the national anthem and other trappings that helped make the constitution a little too transnationally unifying for voters in some countries its main goal is the same greater political power that could harness the eus economic prowess and give the bloc more global influence a new eu presidency would invest a chief executive with a year term a foreign policy high representative would get enhanced powers the european commission would in theory be slimmed down starting in and the european parliaments role would grow as the financial times explains to reach agreement on this the eus members had to overcome last minute opposition from italy which won an extra seat in parliament and poland which appeared to at least partly get its wish for a more complex voting system that could keep bigger eu members from bullying smaller ones the treaty would take effect in if it can survive the gantlet of each member nations legislative ratification process and at least one national referendum but without provisions deemed challenging to national identity which helped sink the constitution in the lisbon treaty seems to have a much better chance british prime minister gordon brown for example "has set aside up to three months" to seek ratification and told cabinet colleagues he hopes that "detailed examination will dampen eurosceptics opposition while demonstrating that the document is too complex to be decided by referendum " the times of london reports once the treaty was out of the way eu leaders were still working together to form a common front ahead of the world bank international monetary fund group of seven financial confab this weekend in washington preparing joint approaches to issues that range from sovereign investment funds like those of china and qatar as the ft notes and the sky high euro which reached yet another record against the dollar in trading today and is feared by some eu leaders as an economic threat to their merchants oil also reached a new high in overnight trading and today was holding near &# a barrel and is likely to draw some g attention all of the above may carry more consequence for europeans and even the french than the personal plight of mr sarkozy and his wife of years cecilia but it isnt every day that a sitting president and his wife divorce even if she as le monde notes never really settled in at the elysee palace following mr sarkozys election in june an elysee spokesman yesterday announced that they were separating came back to the press a short time later to explain separation meant divorce and then once more to say that in fact they had already been to a judge and that said divorce was a fait accompli the news capped a drama that burst into the pulic eye more than two years ago when cecilia sarkozy showed up at a jordanian conference "on the arm of another man " as newsweek notes the couple went through a stop and start reconciliation when the presidential elections heated up and mr sarkozy reportedly said after the vote that his wife was his biggest worry while the french media never tired of pointing out how uncomfortable she looked most of the time in her role as first lady as regine torrent author of "first ladies from eleanor roosevelt to hillary clinton " tells newsweek "weve been waiting for this since monday we had a bet going in our family that the divorce would be announced today the day of the strikes " and thats what made it such a busy day yesterday in europe when french transportation workers were striking against mr sarkozys economic reform plan which is in some ways as much a part of europes evolution as the treaty in lisbon among other things mr sarkozy wants to increase the length of time railway and utility workers must contribute to their pension plans yesterdays strike which lingered into today for parisians was the french unions first big attempt to fight it in the streets an important arena for french politics mr sarkozys plans stand a much better chance than those of some predecessors a poll taken for le figaro and the cable news network lci indicates of the french support him on the reform but none of this helps clear up a question about the timing of master politician mr sarkozy were the strikes supposed to overshadow the divorce announcement or the other way around mukasey take two action a different day a different mukasey or maybe a different senate judiciary committee after a harmonious session wednesday when his nomination hearings opened yesterday michael b mukasey the former federal judge and president bushs attorney general nominee "embraced some of the administrations most controversial legal positions suggesting that bush can ignore surveillance statutes in wartime " as the washington post reports mr mukasey also declined "to say if he considered harsh interrogation techniques like waterboarding which simulates drowning to constitute torture or to be illegal if used on terrorism suspects " the new york times says and he "went further than he had the day before in arguing that the white house had constitutional authority to act beyond the limits of laws enacted by congress especially when it came to national defense " the tone of senatorial questioning the times adds was "far more aggressive than on wednesday "
