save the bush tax cuts the most troubling threat to the economy is not a recession induced by subprime loan worries the drivers of economic growth are factors such as technology investment and population and inhibitors of growth include taxes and regulation these inhibitors especially taxes are the real source of danger in the years ahead the likely expiration of the bush tax cuts is bad enough more ominous still are the plans to hike taxes on saving and investment that are bubbling away in every congressional committee for whatever program they are currently drafting energy agriculture health etc every liberal member and presidential candidate has his or her favorites the bush tax program particularly the tax act boosted productivity by encouraging the investment to make a larger capital stock possible that investment is what finally kicked the recovery into a higher gear what was the quantitative effect of the tax cuts and what would be the damage from letting them expire here are my estimates using the heritage macroeconomic seminar service price and tax rate revenue calculator developed by gary robbins and a simple cobb douglas model of the economy used at the institute for research on the economics of taxation for a capital asset to be worth creating and employing it must be projected to earn enough to recover its cost before it becomes unproductive depreciation pay taxes imposed on its revenues and leave about a risk adjusted real after inflation rate of return to its owners that combined gross rate of return is the service price of capital or the hurdle rate the lower the service price the higher the sustainable capital stock the average wage and the level of gdp the bush tax cut knocked the service price down by nearly how the cap of tax rates on dividends and capital gains was a very large reduction in the double taxation of corporate income it was equivalent to a big cut in the corporate tax rate and the biggest boost to investment of the bush tax packages lowering the marginal income tax rates in the top four tax brackets cut the service price for noncorporate businesses and rewarded work and risk taking the projected end of the estate tax would give a further boost to investment nevertheless the investment surge from the bush tax cuts will taper off as the added capital made possible by the lower service price is finally acquired by about historically it has taken about five years for the quantity of equipment to adapt to major tax changes and about years for structures growth should then revert to a more normal pace but from a higher base keeping growth near the rate of the last three years would require more reductions in the service price of capital we need more than an extension of the bush tax cuts deeper cuts in the tax rate on dividends and capital gains cutting the corporate tax rate and marginal tax rates on noncorporate businesses and letting businesses write off their investment spending faster if instead the bush tax cuts expire as scheduled at the end of much of the newly acquired capital made possible by the tax cuts would no longer be sustainable we would see businesses disinvest investment would slump to allow the capital stock to shrink back to old law levels through attrition that would flirt with recession ominously this is exactly what some members of congress and candidates for president are espousing they would keep parts of the tax cut that are politically sacred but do little or nothing for growth the child credit expansion and the bracket for example but let the parts that spurred expansion die killing the tax rate caps on capital gains and dividends the marginal rate cuts the bracket widening for joint returns marriage penalty relief and the partial estate tax relief currently in place would jump the service price of capital by more than to from about currently according to the heritage service price calculator a jump in the service price is a big deal a lot of capital would be unable to earn enough to pay the higher tax i estimate that the stock of business plant equipment and inventories would ultimately be about less compared to what it would be under current tax rates hours worked would fall private sector output and wage and capital income would drop that would mean an eventual reduction in gdp the present congress thinks it can raise &# billion a year at income levels by letting the growth provisions of the present tax system die but with no damage to gdp wishful thinking the tax calculator shows that a reduction in private sector income would depress federal individual income tax revenues by &# billion more than a drop because lower incomes drop people into lower tax rate brackets thats not all i estimate that payroll taxes federal corporate income taxes customs and excise taxes and the estate tax would drop &# billion result a net loss of &# billion state and local governments also would take a revenue hit and likely raise taxes further depressing gdp worse this would all cost workers and savers roughly &# billion to &# billion in lost output and income those would be the permanent effects the transition is even dicier reverting to a lower capital stock would mean slashing business fixed assets and inventories by &# trillion over years it would require cutting investment spending by or of gdp more in the first five years less later the investment slump would reduce a annual expansion to a crawl if disinvestment spread to the home building sector it could mean recession alarmist consider precedent lyndon johnson pushed a war surtax on income through congress in april it was the primary trigger for the recession congress rushed to end it early in investment spending crashed by and rebounded after the surtax was history that surcharge had a fraction of the impact on the service price of capital that would occur if the bush tax cuts expire consider japan as well in the miyazawa tax program aped and outdid the worst anti capital elements of the u s tax reform act of japan instituted a capital gains tax where there had been none and ended near universal tax favored saving incentives for everyone below retirement age it raised land taxes twice these hits to capital crashed stock and land prices made banks insolvent and crushed investment it took japan years to recover if congress goes down this road expect a similar outcome when congressmen do not study history the rest of us are condemned to repeat it we should rather be thinking of more rate cuts growth will slow even if the bush cuts are simply extended but we would keep the increase in the base level of gdp they made possible letting the cuts expire would undo a fair bit of the capital formation since forestall gains yet to come and shunt gdp to a lower baseline hiking other taxes would only make matters worse mr entin is president and executive director of the institute for research on the economics of taxation
