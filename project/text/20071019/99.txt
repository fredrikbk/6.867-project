soup line new trend in germany food handouts for the poor decline of welfare state spurs private charity i fell a long way wuppertal germany men with shoulders hunched against the rain line up at the back of a van where volunteers dole out bowls of stew and chunks of bread once served the men take shelter under shop awnings to eat few speak the scene could date from the great depression but it takes place every evening in this bustling industrial city in western germany like others sipping their soup hans martin says he comes here for a simple reason "hartz iv " that is the welfare law that slashed benefits for germans who have been out of work for over a year mr martin a year old former warehouse worker with heart trouble and numerous missing teeth says he cant find work his monthly benefit checks cover him for only about days he says toward the end of each month he comes to the soup van to avoid going to bed hungry "im lucky i dont drink " he says "others here do and they run out of money on day " for decades germanys welfare state kept the vast majority of people out of poverty even the unemployed could often live comfortably the state paid them benefits worth over half of their last salary indefinitely that meant unemployed germans were often better off than the lowest paid workers in the u s today as in many other european countries germanys welfare state is in retreat europes stuttering economic performance over the past decade has led governments to trim benefits hoping to rein in public spending and push people who have become dependent on welfare back to work for some especially those without higher education that means low paid work or none at all as the holes in germanys social safety net grow bigger more people are falling through germany gained poor residents when it absorbed the ex communist east in but poverty is rising fast in the countrys more economically developed west too in of western germanys population lived under the poverty line defined as less than of median household income in that rose to according to the german institute for economic research in all of germany around million people or of the population live below the poverty line which today corresponds to a monthly income of about &# for a person living alone such poverty is far less acute than the destitution found in slums of developing countries or even in those of some u s cities and in contrast to millions of poor americans all germans have health insurance yet for germans the growing split in society is a jarring break with the postwar decades then a "social market economy" spread affluence widely by combining industrial growth with a strong welfare state "the poor always existed but they used to be a narrower group of untrained workers with casual jobs such as cleaning " says berthold vogel of the hamburg institute for social research today blue collar workers are falling out of germanys once broad middle class he says "i fell a long way " says mr martin stirring his vegetable and sausage soup with a plastic spoon and gazing into the evening gloom after working for more than years at a machine tool component maker he was laid off in a company restructuring in and sank into a personal crisis "i had never been unemployed in my life " he says for a while he was homeless he now has an apartment but his health is poor his benefits have sunk to the new hartz iv flat rate about &# a month plus an allowance for rent and heating the economic upturn of the last two years has cut germanys overall unemployment rate but it has largely bypassed the low skilled and the long term jobless the german economy is short of highly skilled workers but has a surfeit of low skilled youths and laid off manual laborers the tasks they used to do have moved to low cost countries "there just isnt work for everyone any more " says wolfgang nielsen the volunteer head of the wuppertal table before volunteers set up food distribution centers known as the table movement in germany the poor didnt starve but often fell into debt mr nielsen says "what people save on food thanks to us they can use to pay off their rent and other arrears or to get their electricity switched back on " when the year old former insurance salesman set up the wuppertal table in it was one of the first in germany the idea of handing out surplus groceries to the poor had crossed the atlantic two years earlier from new york after german social workers saw the city harvest food charity at that time food handouts by private charities were unheard of in germany europes biggest economy now over towns in germany have so called "tables" or volunteer groups which collect food that supermarkets would otherwise throw away and give it to the needy the wuppertal table which runs the roving soup van as well as a canteen a fresh food stall and even a medical service feeds more than people a day at first mr nielsen says he struggled to persuade wuppertals businesses citizens and politicians to support the idea people were used to funding the welfare state with their taxes and didnt think extra charity was needed "soup kitchens were not accepted here like in the u s " he says a breakthrough came when car maker daimler ag made a gift of mercedes benz vans to the budding german table movement paving the way for other corporate donations mr nielsen says he raised money from banks and foundations to buy and convert a disused printing shop into a food handout center the tables odd helpers are mostly volunteers they include pensioners doctors lawyers businesspeople and their spouses "tables are in its chic to get involved with them " mr nielsen says now retired he says hes "not mother teresa" and never planned to work long hours for free "it just worked out that way " every morning supermarkets and bakeries let mr nielsens volunteers carry off unwanted stock greens fruit bread meat and other inventory thats too near its sell by date has minor packaging flaws or was just overproduced the food is unloaded at the old printing works while a line forms outside the building women and men young and old some with children wait in the drizzle for the a m food distribution adults pay a token euro cents to enter the building and fill shopping bags the fee is meant to reduce the stigma of receiving alms on a recent day alexandra vermoehlen filled two plastic bags with salad bread and fruit while her husband thomas held their year old son tim the family started coming to the table last month as rising food prices broke their budget "its getting impossible to cope " says ms vermoehlen mr vermoehlen lost his job as a machinist at a metallurgy company a year ago when the firm went bust searching for a job has been "miserable " he says "for manual workers there is no more work " he tried to retrain as a truck driver but says wuppertals employment office wouldnt fund him after ruling that his blood pressure was too high for long distance driving "they put rocks in your path " he says his former salary was "fine " he says although the family couldnt afford vacations living on benefits has changed what they can afford to eat "i used to like to make pork roasts " ms vermoehlen says but she hasnt made one for over a year "you start regarding various kinds of food as luxuries " she says noting that meat fruit vegetables even breakfast rolls are now exceptional purchases for the family recently they have taken to eating lots of canned food noodles in tomato sauce or the cheapest lentil soup getting food at the table saves them about &# a week mr vermoehlen says but he isnt happy about it "in the past i worked for my living now im dependent on others " he is hoping to find another job some helpers at the table have hit hard times too stefan jackel a year old with a strip of black hair running down the middle of his blond crew cut works at the table because he couldnt pay a fine imposed for not paying his debts the former paint shop worker says he lived on temporary jobs until they dried up three years ago but he ordered clothes and other goods that he couldnt pay for he says and ran up mobile phone bills the state prosecutor slapped him with a fine of about &# commuted to hours of socially useful work mr jackel his wife and two children now try to make ends meet on reduced hartz iv benefits he takes home food from the table for his family which he says saves about &# a week he wants to escape unemployment by setting up his own pub but doesnt know yet how hes going to finance it at lunch time another line formed at the tables kitchens helpers dolloped out goulash sausages potatoes carrots peas and salad from large steel pots as the clientele filed by although many tables around germany demand that guests prove their penury wuppertals doesnt "if people shouldnt be here you see it and you hear about it " says mr nielsen in the canteen ludger jany polished off his meat and potatoes and two pieces of cake now he lost his job of years at a music mail order company two years ago when it went bust after suffering a stroke he got an early pension but struggles to live off his &# a month after rent bills and debts he has about &# a day to spend "that lunch would normally cost euros " or about &# he says eating at the canteen two or three times a week allows him to put a euro a day into a piggy bank that way he still has some cash at the end of the month a friend who works in a pub and pulls mr jany the odd draught beer without charging him also helps him to enjoy life a bit he says "basically im still doing ok " he says "when i see some people here like the alcoholics i say thank god i havent slid down that far " some of wuppertals worst off people including alcoholics drug addicts and the homeless cant or wont come to the tables base in the old printing works so at dusk volunteers set off through town in a pair of vans the soup van is shadowed by a "medimobil " an improvised ambulance carrying local physician christian bunemann and his medicines "its good for ones self to do some work for no money " dr bunemann says as the vans snake through wuppertal which lies stretched along a narrow valley patients he meets on these evenings have health insurance but wont go to a doctors office or hospital he says "theyre ashamed theyve fallen deep they smell " theres plenty of wealth in wuppertal which has been a center for metallurgy pharmaceuticals and other industries for more than a century but the loss of manufacturing jobs combined with welfare cuts means wealth is less evenly spread than it used to be "the poor live down in the valley the rich live on the hillsides " dr bunemann says at one stop sascha stauss took his soup and sat in a darkened doorway to avoid the rain the soup is "undefinable " he said "but ok better than nothing " the year old says he is a trained circus juggler but has been diagnosed as suffering from a psychosis which leaves him unable to work he lives off about &# a month plus a stipend for rent the lowest rung of welfare in the past he says germanys generous welfare state meant everyone could live in comfort and nobody was forced to work for a pittance "those times are over " he says "those were golden times "
