weekend journal taste houses of worship gospel truth the evolution of an american musical tradition if the success of a fledgling cable channel can be predicted by cute tshotchkes and dancing fuzzy robots then god is likely to keep blessing the three year old gospel music channel or gmc when i received publicity materials from gmc what drew my attention immediately was a lamb wearing a choir robe and cross necklace upon pressing his hoof the channels stuffed icon exhorts listeners to "put your hands together lets have a holy ghost party " as a gospel choir backs him up and the lamb waves his arms and sways like the backup singers for ray charles thelonious the gospel lamb so i dubbed him entertained the house cats until his battery ran out unlike gmc which has been broadcasting since october and now reaches more than million households gmc sprang from the inspiration of charley humbard best known as the son of rex humbard the pioneering pentecostal television evangelist who died last month at age it boasts of being the "first ever advertiser supported music channel dedicated to the broad spectrum of gospel and christian music " those who do not follow gospel may be puzzled by the gmcs capacious slogan "rock pop country soul its all gospel " weeknights prime time on gmc is divided by genre and implicitly by race monday is "country and southern night " wednesday features "soul " and friday is "pop rock and hip hop " primetime artists range from ricky skaggs a bluegrass gospel performer to kirk franklin and yolanda adams well known contemporary black gospel singers this motley medley of musical forms so rarely heard on genre specific radio formats is true to the biracial heritage of gospel music in america its remarkable that this music sprang from low church protestants who for centuries only grudgingly accepted aesthetic cultivation in worship practice precisely because music was beautiful it was dangerous "harmony is voluptuous " a th century virginia churchgoer pondered in his diary "it requires no pious emotions for a man to love harmony " yet with its roots deep in the south originally gospel always has seized on popular tastes the call and response of african music the black spirituals from the antebellum era white hymns scots irish folk music transported to the american upcountry south blues inflected guitar and singing from the early th century all combined in a cauldron of southern religious sounds to produce the gospel that now in updated form appears on gmc the rise of "southern gospel" and "black gospel " now marketed together at gmc with an explicitly family values orientation illuminates the separate and shared traditions of white and black american southern evangelicalism from the early confluence of protestant melodic forms and african rhythmic styles to the joint appearance of white and black country and gospel sounds on the radio two streams of musical religious culture traveled beside each other never merging but sometimes intersecting thus white country gospel featuring early classics such as albert brumleys "ill fly away" and black urban gospel with thomas dorseys composition "precious lord take my hand" serving as the genre definer moved into racially defined church worlds and later into separate commercial environments race defined gospel even as church choir directors and sheet music publishers without conscious credit or acknowledgment crossed racial lines in search of great tunes and lyrics black choirs took up white standards such as "old rugged cross" and "amazing grace " while white groups added country instruments to black originated classics such as "peace in the valley" and "down to the river jordan " the gospel business according to music historian bill malone "drew much of its dynamism and much of its personnel from the holiness pentecostal movement of the late th century and early th century " a movement that took off in an explosion of interracial revivalism in but quickly moved into racially distinct church organizations among white gospel groups the pioneering mississippi born performers doyle and james blackwood later told one historian that pentecostal churches in the s and s including the assemblies of god rex humbards original denomination based in his hometown of hot springs ark were the "first denomination to use our type of gospel music they were more given to singing songs with a beat " one of the major touring black gospel foursomes the golden gate quartet was often paired with white groups including the blackwood brothers the records of black gospel star andrae crouch graced the record turntables of millions of conservative white protestants in the s gospel quartets increasingly followed popular styles provoking one perplexed early gospel music publisher to ask "why should people who love the lord and clean christian society have to listen to music of the juke box to find a medium of expression toward god " despite such concerns the music of southern protestantism and the tunes of the juke box intermingled frequently through the th century as did the musical worlds of white and black protestants of course the same was not true of the churchgoers themselves mr harvey is a professor of american history at the university of colorado at colorado springs
