feeding kids healthily would be a success it initially printed copies and then added another in reserve before its oct publication date it wasnt nearly enough ever since ms seinfeld the wife of comedian jerry seinfeld appeared on "the oprah winfrey show" on oct demand has far outstripped supply amazon com is telling its customers they will have to wait three to six weeks to get a copy of ms seinfelds book "deceptively delicious simple secrets to get your kids eating good food " altogether the publisher says it has ordered million copies and expects to sell at least million by christmas with the unexpected success has come some unexpected controversy the books popularity has prompted the author of another childrens nutrition book to note similarities between the two titles even as sales of her book are being lifted by ms seinfelds fame collins the division of harpercollins that published ms seinfelds book is repudiating the complaint its biggest fear is that it may be losing sales with ms seinfelds book unavailable at many stores "its a nightmare scenario you never want to wake up from demand that is so intense sales velocity so high that you are hard pressed to keep up " says steve ross president of the collins division "were going to have a lag time of two to three weeks because we dont have enough books " ms seinfelds book is no today on the wall street journals nonfiction best seller list it will also be no on the hardcover advice list published in the new york times book review section dated oct mr ross says he thinks that ms seinfelds book may also slip a slot or two down the times list because of the continuing shortage the book has been no on amazon coms best seller list but that could also change because amazon cant get enough books to keep pace with orders a spokeswoman said the online bookseller is working to get more books as soon as possible some barnes &amp noble stores are out of copies as well "even the big chains are out of it " said alan zumel a salesman at the cooks library a los angeles bookstore specializing in cookbooks the premise of ms seinfelds book is that meals kids enjoy such as lasagna tacos and pita pizzas can be tweaked to be more nutritious she sneaks carrot and spinach purees into a recipe for brownies while a recipe for chicken alphabet soup includes cauliflower puree in her introduction ms seinfeld notes "this book is nothing more than one moms coping skills " during ms seinfelds appearance on ms winfreys talk show the host praised the book and snacked on some of ms seinfelds recipes before sharing them with her audience "after oprah requests began pouring in from customers at the stores and online " says liz harwell director of merchandising for barnes &amp noble inc the nations largest book retailer ms seinfelds appearance on the show also ignited a culinary discussion on one of ms winfreys online message boards and across the web some viewers have noted that adding pureed vegetables to favorite recipes isnt a new idea one writer specifically cited "the sneaky chef simple strategies for hiding healthy foods in kids favorite meals " by missy chase lapine published in april by the running press an imprint owned by perseus books llc an independent publisher the books by ms seinfeld and ms lapine feature similar recipes for macaroni and cheese that have vegetable purees mixed in both books also have recipes for chocolate pudding with pureed avocado however while the concepts are similar the recipes differ in their specifics "our author is concerned that there are many significant similarities between the sneaky chef and the seinfeld book " says david steinberger chief executive of perseus in an email "we agree that the books appear to be very similar in many ways but we dont know enough about how this happened to accuse anyone of wrongdoing we have a bestseller in the sneaky chef we feel it is a terrific book and right now we are focused on selling more copies of it " in a telephone interview ms seinfeld a mother of three said that "ive never held that book in my hands and i swear that on my life when i was told there was a book of a similar type i told myself i would never go near it and there is no way i borrowed anything why would i spend my time doing that i never claimed to have invented pureeing many grandmothers would say it is something theyve always done i created something that i thought would help other families " mr ross of collins says there are similarities among all books that treat sneaking nutritious elements into childrens food of which he said there is "practically a library " mr ross also says that collins has reviewed the concerns expressed by ms lapine and "found them to be without merit " in her introduction ms seinfeld explains how she came up with her book "then one evening while i was cooking dinner pureeing butternut squash for the baby and making mac and cheese for the rest of us i had the crazy idea of stirring a little of the puree into the macaroni and so i did " ms lapine didnt return calls seeking comment ms lapine originally submitted her proposal to collins says mr ross but it was rejected on may because it was deemed too similar to another book "lunch lessons changing the way we feed our children " that collins eventually published mr ross says less than two weeks later on june an agent submitted a proposal for ms seinfelds book a different collins editor decided to set up a meeting because of the authors celebrity status and the editor thought it was an interesting subject says mr ross ms seinfeld came in and cooked food for the attendees of the meeting and "basically wowed everybody who attended " ms seinfeld also appeared to be a passionate advocate for feeding children healthy food says mr ross as a result collins bought the book to keep pace with the demand for ms seinfelds book collins is now employing the full capacity of six binderies to churn out more copies mr ross says the books are being shipped directly to retail stores rather than to a harpercollins warehouse although the spiral binding has complicated the manufacture of the book mr ross says that collins is shipping new copies every day with weekly tallies in the hundreds of thousands mr ross says the books will continue to be manufactured and shipped through the end of january "were fairly confident that well sell between million copies and million copies through dec and thats sell not ship " he says the book is also expected to sell well in january a month when many consumers turn to bookstores for diet help harpercollins is owned by news corp which has agreed to buy the wall street journals publisher dow jones &amp co for more than &# billion meanwhile ms lapines book will be no on the new york times paperback advice list for oct
