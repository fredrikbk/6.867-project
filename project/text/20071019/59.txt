investors bet beijing is minding the price gap wide stock price disparity between mainland hong kong exchanges spurs arbitrage buzz stocks in shanghai and shenzhen fell sharply while hong kong shares rose as investors bet that beijing officials will take steps that close the large gap between prices of chinese companies listed in the different markets triggering the share movements in part was a report by bloomberg news that quoted china securities regulatory commission vice chairman tu guangshao as saying the agency was studying how to introduce ways for investors to earn money through arbitrage that is based on the price differences between the markets later jiang chaoliang chairman of shanghai based bank of communications co told reporters his bank has been consulted about such an idea after trading ended yesterday an official at the securities commission said the original bloomberg article was misleading an article on bloombergs web site last night reported that liu fuhua a spokesman for the regulator said mr tu "misspoke" and declined to confirm if such a plan is being considered analysts doubted beijing plans outright arbitrage because it would be difficult to open a way to buy and sell between markets without undermining chinas ability to control its exchange rate "its like getting a little bit pregnant " said jake lynch head of china research at macquarie securities the shanghai composite index fell to its biggest drop in five weeks while hong kongs hang seng index rose to during the past two years surging prices in mainland china have fueled talk of a speculative bubble chinas rigid capital controls largely have prevented local investors from investing overseas creating the price difference between shares of chinese companies sold in the domestic markets of shanghai and shenzhen known as class a shares and those sold in hong kong known as class h shares class a shares now trade at a substantial premium to h shares although the stocks represent the same underlying ownership of a chinese company whether they are traded on the internationalized hong kong market or the domestic exchanges of shanghai and shenzhen prices arent aligned because the markets have very different sets of investors the shanghai composite index has risen this year making it one of the hottest stock markets globally in recent months hong kong shares have powered sharply higher as well in large part because of expectations that authorities in beijing ultimately will let money flow more easily between the markets last month hong kongs government bought a small stake in the local exchange prompting expectations it could facilitate a tie up with the shanghai market the markets already are becoming more closely linked as new mutual funds this year have made it easier for chinese to invest in hong kong and in august a chinese government agency announced plans to permit individual chinese to buy hong kong shares directly a change dubbed the through train even before the through train has been implemented investors have bid up h shares in expectation that the liberalizing steps would narrow price differences between the markets since the first news of the through train the hang seng index has risen the discount for class h shares that have counterparts listed on the shanghai and shenzhen exchanges has narrowed to less than on average but the shares of
