to tackle fans in europe nfl tries a new playbook the national football league may be all powerful in the u s but most europeans still put it in the same category as velveeta cheese a distinctly american product they cannot fathom its an attitude the nfl has long tried to change so far without success but its not giving up next week the miami dolphins will face the new york giants in london before more than fans at a sold out wembley stadium the first regular season nfl game played outside north america the event is the first of what are planned to be one or two regular season games a year played on foreign soil through along with england the league has named germany canada and mexico as future sites for similar contests this is no small step for the league because one of the teams in each game will be ceding a home date one of eight precious regular season home games the initiative runs the risk of alienating hometown fans but nfl owners keen to find new avenues for growth think its worth the risk if the league grows in europe they expect it to generate merchandising television and online revenue since the league has played preseason exhibition games in europe but those games lost their cachet the more fans realized how little was at stake the nfl tried an offshoot league with a separate set of players the world league of american football which over time morphed into nfl europe and then nfl europa but that managed a cult following only in germany as franchises in london edinburgh and barcelona folded the nfl scrapped that league altogether this summer "people are pretty sophisticated eventually they figure out this is your best product or something less than that " says john mara the new york giants president and chief executive the nfl has now decided that to sell american football abroad it must be undiluted with the best players playing full games that count instead of exhibition games which the english call "friendlies " the upcoming london game is set to be a contest in intense midseason smash mouth mode "this is not friendly " emphasizes nfl commissioner roger goodell mr goodell has talked big about his leagues european plans he made waves monday when he said strong outside interest in holding a super bowl in london would prompt the league to examine that possibility he later said in a phone interview that the nfl has "no plans at this time" to move the championship game offshore the national basketball association which boasts a long roster of non american superstars such as germanys dirk nowitzki has had an easier time going global than the nfl because basketball requires much less equipment and fewer players to start a game turning a european soccer or rugby fanatic into an nfl fan requires a shift in ingrained cultural habits that doesnt promise to be easy while the upcoming wembley game sold out quickly and tickets are selling for above face value on ebay some fans say its been eclipsed by englands unexpected success in the world cup rugby tournament in france where it will play in the final against south africa tomorrow "im not going to spend gbp &# to see a cheap imitation of rugby " says rickell samon a year old street campaigner for british charity oxfam who follows the chelsea soccer team "weve got a ways to go to be a player in the media universe especially in the u k germany and other european cities " says dolphins president bryan wiedmeier mr goodell says hes bullish on the nfls international prospects although he notes that foreign revenue now accounts for a very small percentage of the leagues &# billion in revenue the nfl hopes to lift that percentage with the help of television which helped to fuel footballs robust growth in the u s the upcoming game will be broadcast in britain on sky sports the tv channel owned by an affiliate of news corp whose fox network will air the game in the u s news corp has agreed to buy the wall street journals publisher dow jones &amp co for more than &# billion a marketing push is planned to get viewers to tune in on monday for instance a foot high animatronic "action figure" of dolphins defensive end jason taylor will walk around trafalgar square built by a tv special effects company artem ltd the robot will be towed to a different location in london each day posters advertising the nfl game went up this week in the display windows of foot lockers large oxford street store but inside there are only three racks of nfl jerseys and a few nfl labeled reebok sneakers for sale "reebok paid us to do that " says store manager calvin venus referring to the window display "well be getting more merchandise soon well try and capitalize on the media hype " the dolphins recently hosted reporters from eight large british dailies and three television stations but some editors remain skeptical "its still a fringe sport here " says gordon thomson editor of entertainment magazine time out london the magazine ran a full page preview article about the game but doesnt plan more coverage to change attitudes the nfl is relying on a year old kenyan born briton mark waller whose british boarding school education left him with a love of soccer rugby and cricket that understanding of the european fan is precisely what the all american league needed according to mr goodell mr waller who was hired from liquor giant diageo plc early last year as the nfls senior vice president for international operations was named to head the leagues overall sales and marketing division in june mr waller tweaked the nfls foreign broadcasts to include more basic information for the novice fan the nfl is also ramping up its online educational tools by starting language specific sites like nflatino com in spanish mr waller hopes foreign fans will pick up the game through videogames and web sites not just on the field "the only way you could learn before was by playing " he says the nfl may have a long way to go in europe but it is on firmer ground in mexico and canada its game in mexico citys azteca stadium saw a regular season league record crowd of over fans yesterday the buffalo bills stated their desire to play a regular season game in toronto to help expand the teams northern fan base the wembley game has piqued interest among some sports fans alex byars a senior manager at deloitte &amp touche llp plans on going to the game with friends he says the fact it is a regular season game means a lot "i have never seen a live nfl game although i have watched it on tv " mr byars says "the experience of watching in the stadium you cant replicate that "
