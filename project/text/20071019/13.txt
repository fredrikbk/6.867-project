child offensive congratulations to house republicans who succeeded yesterday in sustaining president bushs veto of a major expansion of the state childrens health insurance program they were able to withstand an intense day "for the children" offensive calibrated to scare enough members for an override and the line held theyre right on policy especially in their opposition to expanding schip to upwards of of poverty but this exercise is largely political with democrats trucking out every last deception to portray republicans as something out of oliver twist the rhetoric reached a nadir on the house floor yesterday when california democrat pete stark said the administration was unwilling to pay for childrens care not true but would instead spend money in iraq where soldiers "get their heads blown off for the presidents amusement " the partisan schip offensive was also waged by the democratic campaign committees and partners like moveon org and other pressure groups it included child mascots as young as two years old to roll the republicans they didnt now well see if the democrats are really interested in kids health or simply in winning more congressional seats next year the administration is willing to compromise yesterday democratic leaders were already saying no way what a surprise
