in the middle east even movie actors must play politics israeli jew of iraqi descent portrays saddam hussein and sparks outcry in cairo cairo egypt earlier this year egyptian actor amr waked landed a role in a miniseries about the life of saddam hussein for mr waked who had appeared with george clooney in the film "syriana " the job seemed like another big career boost instead it sparked an outcry here in the arab worlds movie making capital igal naor the year old actor playing mr hussein is israeli and thats a big problem in egypt where anti israel feelings still run deep the countrys actors union has launched an investigation of mr wakeds participation in the series a joint production of hbo films and the british broadcasting corp and could expel him from its ranks while making the miniseries mr waked says he asked mr naor where he came from mr wakeds heart sank when he heard the answer israel "i was breathless for a moment " he says "i recognized right away that they would crucify me " they the egyptian press were very distressed critics accused the actor who is in his thirties but wont give his age of cultural "normalization " thats a dirty word to many in the middle east used to describe having ties to israel some egyptian newspapers also denounced the filmmakers decision to cast mr naor an israeli jew of iraqi descent and a onetime soldier in the israeli army in the role of mr hussein with a growing number of movies and tv series focused on the iraq war tensions in the middle east and the aftermath of the terrorist attacks including the recent hollywood films "the kingdom" and "rendition " which is being released today western media companies are combing the region for talent but for actors here looking for their big break balancing opportunities in the west with political and cultural sensitivities at home can be tricky egypt in was the first arab state to sign a peace treaty with israel after decades of conflict the two countries continue to maintain diplomatic relations and economic ties still many people have deep resistance toward dealings with israel especially in the cultural sphere it can be career threatening for artists in egyptian playwright ali salem was expelled from the countrys writers guild for his "normalization activities " he had made trips to israel and had written a book chronicling one of his visits mr salem fought the decision in court and won but resigned from the union on principle egyptians complaints about israel are generally focused on the conflict between israel and the palestinians many egyptians object to american foreign policy including u s support of israel but american culture remains popular here getting a role in a hollywood movie can be a big career booster for middle east actors mr waked appeared with george clooney in the film "syriana" as a charismatic recruiter of young suicide bombers fresh from that success mr waked was approached to play mr husseins son in law hussein kamel who defected to jordan but later returned to iraq where he was killed in mr waked says no one told him before he signed on that an israeli actor would be playing mr hussein the series which the bbc is currently calling "between two rivers " is to be rolled out in four parts next year in the united kingdom and the u s the bbc declined to comment on the controversy or to make other cast members or executives involved in the miniseries available for interviews a spokeswoman for hbo referred questions to the bbc once in tunisia for filming mr waked says he was intrigued by mr naors name and asked where he came from mr naor dropped his bomb meanwhile thanks to media reports the word got out here in cairo journalist mohamed abdalla wrote in an opposition newspaper that mr waked "has taken lightly a long history of struggles and the lives that have been lost at the hands of the arrogant zionist enemy " mr wakeds manager suggested he give a phone interview to another local paper to set the record straight in the interview mr waked said he didnt know anything about mr naors nationality when he signed on at the time mr waked says he told his interviewer he might not have taken the job had he known mr waked agonized over whether to walk out of filming but decided to stay some articles in the egyptian press defended mr waked arguing the backlash against him was unwarranted in the meantime the two actors struck up an off set friendship mr waked now says hed do it all over again despite the controversy "hes a good actor " says mr waked of mr naor "hes a good guy " the two talked politics only briefly he says but agreed on many points more often they hung out at their hotel exchanging jokes and sharing meals they spoke in both english and arabic a language that mr naor grew up speaking mr waked picked up a few hebrew words mr naors film credits include playing a palestinian professor targeted for assassination in steven spielbergs movie "munich " he said he feels bad that mr waked is taking heat for associating with him "its just a pity " mr naor said in a telephone interview from los angeles where he was recently helping to promote "rendition " in which he plays the chief of a north african security agency but he said he knew he had to play the part of mr hussein he first heard about the project when he was filming "rendition" in morocco he looked up the casting directors name and got in touch he had his photos taken with a mustache and an arab style scarf on his head and sent them off after several auditions he was chosen for the role "the guy has a bit of mr husseins charisma a bit of his looks " says mr waked "he was a perfect choice " after mr husseins execution the dictators status among many arabs has grown as a symbol of resistance to american foreign policy mr naor says he hopes audiences in the middle east will look past his nationality he even expects his role will spark criticism in israel because it humanizes mr hussein after they left tunisia the two actors stayed in touch and they swap phone calls mr naor has a photo of himself and mr waked on the wall at his home in tel aviv back in egypt the actors union is still weighing actions against mr waked as part of the investigation a three member committee questioned the actor for about two hours when he returned to egypt last month the outcome of the inquiry is pending ashraf zaki the head of the actors union said he couldnt comment on what disciplinary action if any may be taken if the committee finds that taking the role constituted normalization mr waked could be expelled from the union mr waked says he is sad about the uproar "i am not ashamed " he says "the only thing i am ashamed of is the reaction "
