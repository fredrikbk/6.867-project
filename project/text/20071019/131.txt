you shouldve fixed amt back then chuck only a politician who has breathed the toxic fumes of government power for as long as sen chuck grassley could offer a solution to "fix" "one of the worst policy failures in the near century" "how to fix the amt " editorial page oct short of demanding an absolute overhaul of our anti entrepreneurial tax code including the complete elimination of the sinister many would argue illegal alternative minimum tax sen grassley and his colleagues need look no further to understand why congressional approval ratings hover around with real leadership sorely lacking in the continual blame game of a two party system it is no surprise that voter turnout is so low and hopes for our countrys economic social and moral future so dim while sen grassley blames democratic leaders for an "ill conceived poorly executed total failure of a policy" and admits republican failure for not aggressively eliminating it what is his final resort to "hope instead for an intervention of common sense and fiscal restraint " i can think of no more sure recipe for guaranteed failure than that bryan buck newport beach calif sen grassley blames president clinton for vetoing amt reform in and labels the current democratic congress obstructionist for requiring any amt relief to be offset by increased taxes elsewhere if the democrats stood in the way why didnt the gop reintroduce and pass their legislation between and when they controlled both houses of congress and the white house the senator sidesteps this question by referring to the five year amt stop gap measure passed in which he claims to have been a temporary fix he intended to revisit in this is a canard as a tax aide to sen dianne feinstein during parts of the th and th congresses i bore witness to the deep bipartisan addiction to the amt during debate over the tax cuts sen grassley spoke the plain truth about amt reform when he said "i want to be candid with the taxpayers of america and tell them that we are not doing in this bill because of costs now what we did in when during the clinton administration the senate and house sent to the president a bill abolishing the alternative minimum tax " of course the cost then of phasing out the amt was less than the cost of lowering marginal income tax and dividend rates but there was no political will to repeal a hidden tax the amt instead of making cuts to highly visible income tax rates in fact the amt provided a crucial revenue backstop to those tax cuts in the second half of the year budget window lowering cbos score of the bill well below its true cost had sen grassley intended to repeal the amt permanently in he would presumably have highlighted the cost of the and tax cuts without the amt but he did no such thing luckily we need not rise to the alarm of the amt doomsayers rather we should be thankful for the amt because as the revenue raised by the amt grows it will push us in the direction of much needed fundamental tax reform sooner or later we will end up with a tax code for the st century something along the lines of the system proposed by my old law school professor michael graetz that would replace the current exemption riddled mess with a vat and one or two tiers of low marginal income tax rates to be paid by only the wealthiest of americans the amt with its low rate and lack of deductions points us toward that goal paul nitze denver sen grassley is correct congress and most especially the bush administration need an intervention of common sense and fiscal restraint perhaps we could begin with terminating the u s occupation of iraq how many billions of dollars would that save congress certainly needs to address the amt problem but sen grassley indicates that the lack of amt relief is the fault of the democrats that is incorrect i recall president george w bush agreeing to amt relief only if the relief was revenue neutral republican and democratic leaders need to put aside party differences in order to solve both debacles the invasion of iraq and the amt as well as earmarks pork and other traditional washington tactics tom hubbard san francisco
