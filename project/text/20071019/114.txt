weekend journal review theater two tickets to paradise pygmalion roundabout theatre company american airlines theatre w nd st new york &# &# closes dec six characters in search of an author peoples light &amp theatre company conestoga rd malvern pa &# &# closes nov new york with the prospect of a show stopping strike by the stagehands union casting a shadow over broadway the roundabout theatre company pulled off a coup last night it opened a solid gold hit in a strike proof theater david grindleys extravagant exhilarating production of "pygmalion " in which claire danes is making her debut as a stage actress is the best classical revival mounted by the roundabout in recent memory no sooner do the lights go down than it takes off like a supersonic skyrocket powered by a cast that is strong from top to bottom nowadays most theatergoers know eliza doolittle ms danes the spunky london flower girl and henry higgins jefferson mays the fanatical professor of phonetics who seeks to turn her into a lady by erasing her cockney accent from "my fair lady " in which lerner and loewe sprinkled sugar all over george bernard shaws greatest comedy the real "pygmalion " by contrast is a double edged satire of the british class system that takes no less cutting a view of the progressive reformers who sought and seek to flatten it out shaw shows us that higgins like so many of his well meaning kind prefers people in the mass to individual human beings he treats eliza like a lab rat not a creature of flesh and blood and her scornful dismissal of his high minded heartlessness rings as true today as it did in "the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves but how shes treated i shall always be a flower girl to professor higgins because he always treats me as a flower girl and always will " of course youll want to know about ms danes and the news is good if i hadnt known that this was her first straight play id never have guessed it unlike so many movie and tv stars who dabble cluelessly in legitimate theater she has mastered the elusive art of projection not only is she audible but she is blazingly visible as well lighting up the seat american airlines theatre with the kind of space filling energy that comes naturally or not at all to see her eyes snap and shine when colonel pickering drolly played by boyd gaines calls eliza "miss doolittle" for the first time in her young life is to know that ms danes has a great stage career ahead of her if she wants it it goes without saying that mr mays lately of "journeys end" and "i am my own wife " knows his way around a stage hes as fine a henry higgins as you could hope to see a fetching blend of mad scientist and spoiled brat though helen carey and jay o sanders are equally impressive as higginss mother and elizas father mr grindleys staging is pointed and shrewd among other good things he makes a point of purging the climactic confrontation between eliza and higgins of the cheap romantic overtones in which lesser directors are wont to indulge while jonathan fensoms damn the expenses set and costumes are as vicwardian as a hansom cab even the incidental music selected by gregory clarke from the works of sir edward elgar shaws old friend and admirer is right on the button strike or no strike i expect itll be a long time before we see any of shaws plays done half so well on broadway or anywhere else malvern pa is there a regional drama company with a better name than peoples light &amp theatre this year old ensemble which operates out of a two theater complex in a suburb just west of philadelphia is putting on louis lippas newly translated freely adapted performing version of "six characters in search of an author " the play in which luigi pirandello beat the postmodernists to the punch a half century before the fact its every bit as satisfying as the roundabouts "pygmalion " and a lot easier to get into "six characters" actually gets under way with a rehearsal of a different pirandello play which is cut short by someone knocking on the stage door enter the members of a turn of the century italian family whose urbane patriarch stephen novelli informs the director peter delaurier that he and his unhappy brood dont really exist they are he explains characters from an unfinished play who are looking for a playwright willing to complete their script and "allow our tragedy to play to its end " in short order they take over the rehearsal and by the time the night is through what started out as a farce has ended in black and bloody heartbreak mr lippa has further postmodernized "six characters" by changing its setting to a peoples light &amp theatre rehearsal sprinkling the script with witty references to the philadelphia theater scene and replacing the stilted translatorese of edward storers long standard english version with the colloquial chatter youd expect from a roomful of american actors the imaginary italians carry themselves more formally but their dialogue especially that of kim carson who plays the angry sexually aggressive stepdaughter has been sharpened up as well almost always to appropriate and highly dramatic effect the cast strikes a perfect balance between the plain spoken naturalism of the american actors and the melodramatic even operatic demeanor of the italian characters while ken marini the director undoubtedly deserves much of the credit for this achievement his actors mr novelli and ms carson in particular are so good that its impossible to divvy it up more than speculatively acting staging costumes lighting sound design all sweep over you in a way so unified and involving that youll feel disoriented when its over as though youd just emerged from a funhouse in which truly scary things happen so far as i know its been two decades since "six characters" was last seen in new york and it doesnt get done all that often anywhere else so why not make a weekend
