the daily fix beckett keeps red sox alive sends series back to boston online edition josh beckett took the mound in cleveland last night staring winter in the face winter blinked first the ace of the boston red sox struck out in throttling the indians to stave off elimination and bring the american league championship series back to boston bostons curt schilling and clevelands fausto carmona will face off in game tomorrow night with the bosox trailing in the washington post dave sheinin calls mr beckett "the big hairy alpha male of jacobs field on thursday night standing on the dirt hill at the center of the diamond and daring anyone to come knock him off he roared at lesser beasts who dared cross his path he stalked his territory slow and assured the baddest man in the house that anthem singer pretty and sweet voiced beckett used to date her as she sang thursday night he never even looked at her " "becketts postseason numbers are staggering " writes steve buckley in the boston herald "he is a combined in the division series and alcs he has walked one batter in three starts combine this with his staring into the jaws of death performances with the florida marlins during the postseason and we are talking about a man who has joined curt schilling as one of the first great postseason pitchers of the st century but it wasnt just the pitching it was the look the walk the glare it was something " in the cleveland plain dealer bud shaw wonders "what has happened to the pound the strike zone mantra c c sabathia embraced and saw reinforced in the work of jake westbrook and paul byrd what of the big game appetite the indians watched develop in the second half of that grew ravenous this season " back to the post for thomas boswell who writes that "a glance at the indians roster a study of how they acquired their stars and a gasp at their &# million payroll rd in the sport shows where the old game may finally and mercifully be headed toward sanity " mr boswell calls the roll of big payrolls that yielded small results yankees mets dodgers angels cubs phillies white sox and concludes that "since free agency arrived in money hasnt been the only thing in baseball that mattered but like it or not wealth has been the sports no competitive factor now thanks to a series of hard won insights inside the sport coupled with more revenue sharing among franchises more teams realize that brains and team chemistry can compete with hessian lineups " suppose youd spent years in your job performing at the highest possible level every year despite huge expectations free spending rivals ever changing personnel and no shortage of prima donna employees now suppose after all that your bosses left you to twist in the wind for nearly two weeks then called you in and said they were going to cut your base salary and make you earn it back through bonuses oh and if you didnt hit certain targets that are mostly luck anyway you wouldnt get rehired if you have any sense of dignity youd walk which is exactly what joe torre did after the new york yankees rewarded his straight playoff appearances with an insulting offer that appeared designed to be rejected team president randy levine spun the firing in semi disguise hard enough to generate his own tornado yesterday praising the man whose ouster hed just helped engineered so did the gotham papers buy it lets take a tour "the yankees probably think they played this just right but they arent fooling anybody here " writes john harper in the new york daily news "its obvious they didnt want joe torre back no matter what theyre saying they just didnt have the guts to fire him " "where there was once one boss there are now pinstriped nesting dolls of incompetence " writes selena roberts in the new york times "the honorable thing to do when you want to fire someone is to fire them " writes tim marchman in the new york sun adding "it is of course possible that this offer was tendered in full sincerity if thats true though the yankees are being run by morons since the yankees are not in fact run by morons the only conclusion to draw is that theyre being run by people willing to behave dishonorably " "four championships a dozen consecutive playoff berths and a zillion moments of common decency and grace werent enough to save torre from the men who wanted him gone " ian oconnor writes "steinbrenner and his boys hank and hal and the team president randy levine did the deed and then planted their vile daggers by torres lifeless side like macbeth they all have blood on their hands " hmm that would be a "no " the junior steinbrenner eras off to a heck of a start isnt it it probably didnt jump out at you as a key college football showdown a while back university of south florida at rutgers but in this topsy turvy season thats what it was a big east clash between the no bulls and the scarlet knights this one went to rutgers thanks to a pair of trick plays some tough defense and senior back ray rice and led to fans storming the field as they did last year after rutgers knocked off no louisville "the maturation of south florida football has come at a frantic pace " the st petersburg timess john romano writes "they learned quickly how to scheme and how to dream they figured out how to turn empty seats into hysteria and to create history where there was none they discovered remarkably the swiftest path to the top of college football and today they have learned of heartbreak given a shot at glory the bulls now understand its cost for the only thing worse than having no hope at all is understanding that you let it slip away " as stewart mandel writes on si com rutgers win was its conferences loss "for the second straight year the scarlet knights ended one of their conference foes dreams of an undefeated season " he writes "in all probability they also assured their conferences irrelevance for the rest of this season when youre an lsu or oklahoma you can lose a tough conference road game brush it off and return to the top five within a couple weeks as if it never happened when youre usf and you lose a tough conference road game just four days after an already skeptical set of voters tabbed you the no team in the country almost as an obligation you can expect the court of public opinion to be somewhat less merciful " noah van niel is a fullback for the harvard crimson and a talented tenor whos served apprenticeships in florence and new york an nfl career probably isnt in the cards but opera school or a professional training program is as john powers recounts in the boston globe "he hasnt yet performed at the met or la scala but the man has worked his craft in front of more than spectators inside a stadium modeled after a roman colosseum and a greek amphitheater " he writes "next month van niel will suit up for his finale at the yale bowl then walk off one stage and onto another " catching legend johnny benchs year old son bobby is a senior on the football team at st xavier hes six foot seven and pounds but this isnt a story about a new generation of athletic superstars mr bench is a backup tight end who tried out for the baseball team twice and was cut both times but as tom groeschen writes in the cincinnati enquirer thats ok "while johnny is one of the most famous athletes in cincinnati history and one of the most acclaimed athletes in american history period he could not care less that bobby will never be another johnny bench athletically speaking that is bobby is just a fine young man johnny said recently i couldnt be prouder of him " tip of the fix cap to readers don hartline and warren rosborough found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix
