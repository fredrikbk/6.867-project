weekend journal the drivers seat speeding through cornfields at four mph when you love cars its always exciting to slip into the drivers seat of the latest four wheeled wonder but in my position testing a different brand new vehicle each week its easy to become disillusioned by the onslaught my time tested cure is to log a few miles behind the wheel of something else my corvette a buddys racetrack ready bmw m a u haul truck anything to break the tedium of new car smell so when a friend offered to arrange a test drive on a combine i leapt at the opportunity now here was the definition of something else a brobdingnagian harvesting machine that weighs over pounds giddy with anticipation during the six hour drive to champaign ill from my michigan home i didnt dwell on my slight agricultural background consisting of infrequent visits to the local farmers market and a failed attempt at gardening resolute in my belief that routinely being handed the keys to six figure sports cars would somehow translate to harvesting corn i sped south on interstate in a yellow porsche turbo cabriolet the loaner car surely had a lot to do with my optimism as i basked in the bright autumnal sun grinning stupidly from ear to wind whipped ear i remained oblivious to the fact that the only thing more out of place in a central illinois cornfield than a &# german convertible is me i left the porsche in the parking lot of my hotel in favor of the truck driven by the public relations man from case ih the combines maker the truck was red the corporate color that serves as a foil to john deere green in an agricultural rivalry im told is as fierce as ford vs chevy case ih traces its first combines back to models that were contemporaries of fords model t though it wasnt until that those machines then made by international harvester became self propelled the combines name comes from its function it combines the harvesting threshing and cleaning of crops like corn soybeans and wheat that makes it an incredibly complex vehicle of proportionately huge size as i ascended the six rungs of the ladder to the cab i imagined that this must be what it feels like for my year old daughter to climb on the riding lawnmowers outside the hardware store the case ih axial flow measures about feet long feet wide and feet tall roughly the size of a dozen s stacked three high the cab is luxurious by the standards of vintage agricultural equipment meaning that its enclosed air conditioned and equipped with a nice stereo but youre still not going to want to spend any more time up there than you need to bring in the harvest even the chinese have plusher automotive interiors than the one in this &# rig i sat in the center mounted bucket seat perched at the bow of the machine like a ships figurehead with the steering wheel tilted all the way down into my lap the combine seemed two parts tractor to one part volkswagen bus the floor to ceiling windshield gave me a clear view of the "header " thats the foot wide metal and plastic claw that grabs cornstalks and delivers their fruit into the guts of the combine the violence of this action is awesome to behold the tall tough stalks are mowed down as effortlessly as a child might pluck a dandelion but this is only the beginning of the combines work the ears are delivered to the threshing rotor behind and beneath the cab where the corn is rubbed from the cob and centrifugal force separates the kernels from cobs husks and the rest then the corn is fed to two sieves deep within the machine where it is further cleaned the undesirable material gets blown out the back by a giant fan while those golden kernels are fed by augers into a tank of course you cant see all this happening as you move along save for glancing over your shoulder to watch the window that looks into the grain tank becoming quickly filled with corn you can however monitor and control all of the combines processes on a inch color touch screen that effectively serves as a computerized instrument panel its multilayered menus and screens are complex enough to make bmws nefarious idrive seem like pong the screen is situated off to the right of the driver next to a button laden joystick that controls the throttle it looks like just the ticket to mastering flight simulator the combine does have brakes and a floor mounted brake pedal but they went unused in the flatness of illinois thanks largely to a hydrostatic drive system that uses hydraulics to provide motive power and can slow the vehicle as well the setup also means that unlike in a car where a mechanical coupling links the engine to the wheels the s nine liter inline six cylinder diesel engine can run at optimal full throttle efficiency all the time it produces a staggering pound feet of torque at rpm and a mere peak horsepower by comparison the porsche i had left at the hotel produces pound feet of torque and horsepower now if i had any idea what i was doing i would have been paying attention to all the little readouts on the screen that reported on each of the processes going on behind me i would have known to listen for the chime when the grain tank got close to full probably even anticipating its charismatic tone when the tractor hauling a grain cart pulled up alongside me i certainly wouldnt have slowed down but instead pressed the button to activate the unloader without pause but i didnt just a few minutes into my hands on combine lesson i had arrived at an important realization you dont really drive a combine you operate one and even the driving part was proving challenging the combines rear wheel steering was tricky to compensate for and the width of the row header made it hard to gauge the arc i needed to line it up on the correct row of corn feedback through the steering wheel is nonexistent and i have no idea whether my constant steering adjustments were necessary or the combine was just ignoring them the hydraulic drive system allows for precise modulation of power but its hair trigger reaction to the joystick had me jerking the whole machine around like a kid who doesnt know how to drive a stick shift i was scared of overflowing the grain tank or screwing up some other aspect of the harvesting operation so i kept fruitlessly swiveling my head back to the grain tank window like id just passed a cop while doing miles per hour over the limit then there was the public relations man riding shotgun barking orders and reaching around me to adjust inexplicable controls it was like being a year old during drivers training sensory overload made it all i could do to keep the combine moving straight down the rows at a four mph clip thats not a typo while harvesting corn combines dont travel much faster than seven mph but even at a slower rate my first rip through the foot tall stalks felt like i was back in the porsche after a few more passes through the field however the controls began to seem more familiar and the combine started to do what i wanted without complaint the progression of the harvest became hypnotic and the combines windshield started to magnify the beauty of the dull dry earthy stalks that stupid grin began to spread across my face and the satisfaction of my mastery over this machine was as sweet as any contact me at jeff sabatini wsj com
