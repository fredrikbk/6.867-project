weekend journal review books fame and fawning inside inside by james lipton dutton pages &# damon runyon once came up with the theory that in the bowels of new yorks exclusive "" club there was a "laughing room" a sound proof chamber where the restaurants proprietors convened each morning to set the days prices does a similar chamber exist beneath the stage on "inside the actors studio " the long running bravo television series in which james lipton interviews various movie stars the hallmark of the show the reason it has been parodied on everything from "saturday night live" to "the simpsons" is mr liptons fawning obsequiousness to whoever happens to be sitting in the guests chair no matter how undistinguished his or her career it is one thing to ask paul newman how he preserves the clarity of his "instrument " but how can mr lipton put that sort of question to sylvester stallone or to val kilmer or ben affleck or jennifer lopez and maintain the same air of solemnity could he have a "laughing room" of his own that he retreats to whenever the strain of keeping a straight face becomes too much if such a chamber does exist mr lipton is not about to let on his furrowed browed earnestness about the acting profession may well be a disguise he has adopted to lure self important celebrities onto his stage but he never lets the mask slip at least not in his page autobiography "inside inside " on the contrary mr lipton is as complimentary about his guests in print as he is on the show thus tom cruise demonstrates "how effortlessly fame and decency can coexist" melanie griffith is "gracious bright and fascinating" mike myers is "polymathic" robin williams is "entrancing beguiling bewitching" barbra streisand is "the definitive interpreter of americas art song uniquely and effortlessly able to fill every whole note with rippling hemidemisemiquavers of thought and emotion" and russell crowe is "an amiable guest a knowledgeable teacher and a conscious craftsman " apparently mr lipton has never met a famous person he didnt like and he has met quite a few as he makes abundantly clear in this book mr lipton begins "inside inside" by asking the question that was posed by the narrator of "david copperfield" will he turn out to be the hero of his own life or will that station be held by anybody else the answer rather surprisingly is the latter "the mask is off mystery and suspense evaporate " he writes "inside inside will be about a considerable number of anybody elses " needless to say this modesty turns out to be false mr lipton begins each chapter with a few choice quotes from the stars he has interviewed over the years on "inside the actors studio" and sometimes from other important people he hasnt like soren kierkegaard and andre gide then quickly returns to his own life story which he relates in painstaking detail it is almost as if he is indulging in a fantasy that has long possessed him as he listens to the celebrities on his show drone on namely to lean over and say "thats enough about you now back to me " mr lipton writes about himself in the same breathless tone that he uses to praise his guests to hear him describe his own career it is incredible that he wasnt a celebrity in his own right before he reinvented himself as a talk show host we learn for instance that a novel he wrote called "mirrors" kept paddy chayevsky up all night and was turned into a critically acclaimed tv movie a gala he produced at lincoln center to raise money for the library of the performing arts resulted in "the largest gathering of performing artists ever presented on its stage" and the birthday tribute to bob hope he put together for nbc "happy birthday bob" was "the most watched program of the week " his proudest achievement is "an exaltation of larks " a compendium of collective nouns "a murder of crows " "a parliament of owls " etc that he describes as "my letter to the world" "in the years since an exaltation of larks was published it has never been out of print going through several expansions and numberless editions and has progressed from a perennial to a classic " reading between the lines one cant help thinking that mr lipton felt cheated of the fame he believed was his due and from that point of view "inside inside" is a book with a happy ending he gleefully recounts what a television institution "inside the actors studio" has become telling us that it is available in million homes and countries and has received emmy nominations what he neglects to mention is that he was by the time it debuted on april at an age when most talk show hosts are thinking of hanging up their navy blue blazers james lipton was just getting started he is now but even with a lifetime achievement emmy under his belt he shows no signs of flagging for mr lipton the actors studio has become the perfect show business retirement home by the time i reached the end of "inside inside " it was clear that if there is a "laughing room" beneath "inside the actors studio " it must be inch thick with dust mr lipton has absolutely no sense of absurdity whether he is discussing barbara walters "one of the heroes of my life" or himself this guilelessness though almost redeems him like many people in "the business " he is completely uncynical about those who have dedicated themselves to the performing arts the desire for money fame and beautiful lovers doesnt come into it apparently and mr liptons essential innocence means that there is in his mind nothing false about the effusive praise he lavishes on his guests when he describes sylvester stallones promise as being "fulfilled monumentally and historically" by "rocky " he means every word mr young is the author of "the sound of no hands clapping" da capo
