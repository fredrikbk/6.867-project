politics &amp economics cairos litigious cleric fighting secularism in court cairo egypt amid a widening cultural war between secular and fundamentalist muslims a conservative cleric here is pushing his own courtroom offensive against everything he deems un islamic more than a decade ago yusuf el badry religious scholar former parliamentarian and onetime mosque preacher in new jersey pioneered the practice of suing ministers poets academics and religious scholars in egypts courts to promote his strict interpretation of islam the approach was simple and often effective use egypts legal system which is based on western and islamic law and is mostly independent to counter what he sees as a dangerous wave of secularism his most famous victory was a court ruling ordering a university professor whom he called an apostate to divorce his wife after that case made headlines around the world the government pushed through legal changes to make similar cases harder to pursue but now mr el badry is making waves again as egyptians have become more conservative and religious frustration with the government which is perceived by many as aloof and elitist is helping to revive islam as an alternative mr el badry has filed a flurry of fresh legal complaints and lawsuits that have underscored this divide between the middle easts secular elite and a growing tide of islamist activists these activists have increasingly resorted to mainstream tactics such as the ballot boxes and the courthouse to push their strict interpretation of the faith last month mr el badry went to court to contest a government ban on female circumcision a popular practice here meanwhile a recent libel ruling in his favor has cairos intellectual elite up in arms "going to court is the only means i have to weed out bad deeds " mr el badry says "a judges pencil is the best and most powerful way to do so " he got an early start in the islamist cause at a young age he participated in a protest against the then king of egypt to protest the marriage of the kings sister to a christian in the late s he used his podium at a mosque outside cairo to call for establishing a government ministry that would enforce morality and weed out vice along the lines of saudi arabias powerful religious police he served in parliament from to in the early s he preached as an imam in a mosque in paterson n j he won international fame when he spearheaded a case against nasr hamed abu zeid a university professor he accused of heresy and apostasy the judge ruled in his favor and ordered the professor to divorce his wife since a muslim woman isnt allowed to be married to a non muslim mr abu zeid and his wife fled to the netherlands mr el badrys flurry of new cases has won him the support of some who see him as a defender of islam he has become a courtroom celebrity appearing regularly on egyptian and arabic satellite tv shows his legal maneuvers are followed closely by the local media he isnt a trained attorney but he prefers to argue his cases before the judge himself with his flowing robes and white turban he stands out in court where attorneys typically wear suits intellectuals across the middle east have railed against his crusade saying he stifles creativity and the sort of critical and religious thinking needed to check extremism "the gravity of what el badry is doing lies in that it represents a wider phenomenon that of fanatic religious thought chasing after culture intellectuals and creativity of all kinds in our arab and islamic worlds " palestinian writer khaled hroub wrote recently in emirati newspaper al ittihad last month armed with files he showed up in an administrative court in cairo for the first hearing in his lawsuit against the minister of health and population seeking to reverse a ban on female circumcision the subject became a lightning rod this summer after the government closed loopholes in its longstanding ban of the practice circumcision remains widespread in egypt the practice predates islam but many egyptians support it on religious grounds some say the practice is endorsed by sayings of the prophet mohammed though that is at the center of debate opponents point out the physical and psychological dangers and many muslim religious figures condemn the procedure the new ban came after the high profile death of a year old girl undergoing the procedure but the governments move fired up mr el badry and other islamists "the decision to criminalize circumcision means criminalizing something from islam " he bellowed in court "this is a disaster " another recent case of mr el badry has cairos intellectual set fuming a few years ago he sued poet ahmed abdel moety hegazi and a local magazine for libel he claimed an article mr hegazi wrote effectively called him an extremist in december a court upheld a ruling ordering the defendants to pay mr el badry about &# mr el badry then filed another complaint against eight people including mr hegazi for writings or commenting publicly about the earlier case he accused them of casting doubt on the fairness of the ruling that complaint is still under investigation by prosecutors who can either throw it out or refer it to court in another complaint he said a poem mr hegazi allowed to be published in a different magazine he edited insulted god "had sheik el badry sent me an article saying what a silly poem this is i would have published his opinion " mr hegazi says but mr el badry and other like minded islamists "dont deal with opposing opinions as something that can be discussed or refuted " amid his recent courtroom appearances some of mr el badrys critics argue his cases are more self serving than aimed at protecting islam a charge he denies "i dont need fame " he responds "i do what i do aiming to please god "
