weekend journal the home front let mcmansions bloom wealthy chinese buy in villa compounds tom cruise in bedroom beijing on a tour of the model homes in palais de fortune sales manager cai siyu points out features one might expect in any french style chateau there are sculptures of cherubs adorning the front gate a swarovski crystal chandelier hanging above a sweeping central staircase and a maid in a lace ruffled uniform waiting at the front door next door just feet away another miniature versailles rises out of the beijing smog and down the road there are more just like it the sight is a jarring reminder that this gated community where houses cost about &# million and measure approximately square feet isnt in france its one of the most exclusive if architecturally incongruous neighborhoods in china a peek inside offers a view of what its like to be rich in a country thats still coming to terms with being communist in name only just a generation ago wealth in china was considered a sign of corruption most rich chinese hid their fortunes fearing that the government would confiscate their money or put them in jail today two decades after the post mao economic reforms that transformed the country there are chinese billionaires according to the hurun report rich list many chinese still dont like to talk about their wealth but theyre not ashamed to show it off the lavish granite clad homes in the acre palais de fortune embody new chinas infatuation with foreign lifestyles or at least its image of them "our developers went to france to study the style " mr cai says during the model home tour he shows off the gleaming white "western style" kitchen which features a coffee maker a wine rack an oven and other appliances plus a bowl of plastic fruit palais de fortune notes the marketing brochure "represents the lifestyle of top rich families around the world " about similar luxury developments which the chinese have dubbed "villa compounds " have been built in beijing and shanghai in recent years the district where palais de fortune is located on the way to beijings airport is the site of more than a dozen suburban style developments the gated compounds come complete with cookie cutter villas that cost millions of dollars international schools and manicured golf courses initially homes in these communities attracted expatriates but now real estate agents say theyre being bought up by chinese too many of whom have made their fortunes in manufacturing property and finance despite the obvious western influences the compounds are uniquely chinese tucked around the corner from that western kitchen in the palais model home is a more functional "chinese style" one outfitted with a wok range and a grease filtering range hood and the developments are situated among factories and farms indeed sheep sometimes graze near the palais front entrance the mansions there are made all the more striking by their proximity to a village of migrant construction workers across the street it isnt easy for an individual to build a large private residence in beijing or shanghai in part thats because of government planning the response to a housing shortage brought on by millions of workers streaming into urban centers in search of jobs looking to maximize land use the government sold off large plots to developers who built dense apartment blocks or farther away from the city centers exclusive enclaves for the rich "it is a very different situation than what you would see in the states " says edward cheung the china chief executive of property consulting company dtz "the governments policy of land sales means it only makes sense to sell mass parcels rather than small plots of land " even though the government helped create the villa phenomenon lately it has shown it isnt entirely comfortable with the idea amid chinas growing wealth gap earlier this year beijing forbade billboard ads for luxury villas and last year the government introduced a nationwide ban on new villa compounds though work continues on previously approved projects the effort may have slowed a high end real estate bubble but it has also increased the price of houses in some existing developments inside these subdivisions theres another local real estate quirk developers usually pack in the mansions one right next to another an effort to squeeze value out of expensive property in palais de fortune each three story villa sits on little more than a third of an acre the view out some windows through the gold tipped wrought iron fencing that encloses each copycat property looks right into the windows of the house next door and since the tight plots allow little room for backyards swimming pools are often built in the basements of the houses privacy is another reason for the indoor pools as is the desire to escape from beijings windy dusty climate the cramped plots dont bother one wealthy customer touring palais de fortune on a recent afternoon "i like the overall atmosphere of the community " says the textile tycoon who asked not to be identified like other visitors he is wearing blue plastic booties that look like shower caps over his shoes to keep the dust from beijings streets off the marble floors "i think i would make some good relationships with the neighbors " he says sipping tea in the show houses drawing room here as with most chinese villa compounds the property management company also plans community activities ranging from ball games to cigar clubs and swimming activities the fee for this service is about &# per month focal points for social activities include a lush community garden and a giant clubhouse which resembles a parisian train station living in such an exclusive community itself conveys a sense of privilege but it also reflects a growing anxiety about violence against the wealthy not surprising in a country where the booming economy is creating a widening gulf between rich and poor in there were more than reported kidnappings in china according to a report in oriental look a respected chinese magazine in there were just in one high profile case last year a forestry bureau official and his wife were both stabbed to death inside their beijing villa as a result security is a big selling point palais de fortune still under construction has four guards for every five villas and infrared cameras monitor the perimeter of each house "there are no blind areas around any of the houses and should you have some disaster and the guard cant come you can run into the panic room " says mr cai showing off a double steel door reinforced bunker in the basement he says the panic room which costs an extra &# or more depending on the size will keep residents safe from gunfire earthquakes even poison gas attacks a video screen on the wall shows whats happening at the front gate of the house with images relayed from the cameras mounted outside a sign on the wall explains that panic rooms have been featured in the movies and "in use for many years by the rich and famous corporate executives and powerful figures around the world " bao zhiyi a construction worker who has lived in the settlement of laborers across the street from the palais gates for three years doesnt seem to resent his wealthy neighbors even though he says he is not allowed inside the development taking a cigarette break in front of his own gate which features a rusted crest with a lion he says "its not for me but these people are capable of making money so they deserve it " copying lavish architectural styles from abroad has a long history americas th century robber barons fashioned their estates after european castles sometimes importing them brick by brick spanish style villas and louis xiv mansions can be found almost anywhere around the world where people have money still theres a theme park feel to much of chinas luxury real estate rose garden a development with houses in north beijing and one of the citys first villa compounds is divided into six "lands" america europe japan space canada toronto vancouver and newfoundland and neoclassical north america sometimes the actual differences between them can be confusing "we have many styles here " says zhang yan a rose garden sales manager as she points with a pool cue at miniature models of the homes space is based on the city that many chinese think epitomizes futuristic architecture skyscraper clad hong kong offering a tour of rose garden in a golf cart a colleague of ms zhang zips past japan and parks in a cul de sac in neoclassical north america where the houses are painstakingly crafted versions of what look like california mcmansions the developers claim that the style was inspired by a town in quebec called richelieu in fact there are several architectural styles in this mini america identified on the mailbox of each home including roman holiday tuscan american classic sunny mediterranean and victorian inside roman holiday model number the decor is not as lavish as the chateaux in palais de fortune but there is no less attention to detail a boys bedroom features wallpaper with s era american images of youths playing baseball in another bedroom there are framed photos of tom cruise and katie holmes outside a man made river weaves among the villas a nod to the chinese love of water features designed to resemble one of the rivers that flow toward lake champlain "water is fortune " reads the sales brochure "many wealthy people here have a u s background or have been heavily influenced by american culture and education " says real estate agent zhang jifeng director of the beijing strategy department at e house china a real estate services company "they want to recreate that lifestyle here " while some americans might find such a heavily themed development a bit like living in disneyland mr zhang sees nothing incongruous about that "is it unbelievable to americans to live inside disneyland " he says "im not sure a chinese person would think that is a problem " as chinas own view of itself in the world continues to evolve so do its tastes at palais de fortune mr cai says the developers have been easing back on french style finishings in the newest homes such as elaborate carvings on the exterior walls and introducing simpler more contemporary chinese styles and several years ago the entire rose garden subdivision was itself turned into a kind of traditional chinese courtyard when the developers added a foot red wall around the perimeter their inspiration the red wall that encloses beijings famous forbidden city former home to chinas imperial family "one reason we added it is to respect chinas traditions " says ms zhang "the other is for security "
