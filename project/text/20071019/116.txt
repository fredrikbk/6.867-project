weekend journal taste de gustibus defining luxury down in monty pythons timeless skit "four yorkshiremen " michael palin graham chapman terry jones and eric idle play a group of nouveau riche english vacationers comparing their miserable childhoods while sipping glasses of chateau de chasselas as they bid to outdo each other in outrageous tales of early sorrow mr palins character offers the tidbit that he once "lived for three months in a paper bag in a septic tank " "luxury " rejoins mr chapman "we used to have to get out of the lake at six oclock in the morning clean the lake eat a handful of hot gravel work a hour day at the mill for tuppence a month come home and dad would thrash us to sleep with a broken bottle if we were lucky " i was reminded of the skit not long ago on a morning when an exterminator was due to arrive in my new york city apartment to rid the place of bedbugs as i left for work i spotted a large sign on the building posted by my landlord it said "luxury rentals " with a telephone number and an arrow pointing inside i live in a large lower manhattan apartment complex that has the great virtue of being situated directly across the street from my office other than that its hard to see how the complex built in a brutalist style of unadorned heavily chipped concrete that would have blended well in east germany meets any plausible definition of "luxury " the popcorn ceilings certainly arent luxurious nor are the single plate windows that dont quite keep out the winter cold and lets not talk about the condition of the air conditioning units fortunately the rent isnt too luxurious either albeit if only by the big apples otherworldly pricing standards yet thanks partly to manhattans circumscribed geography partly to the stock markets record highs and partly to the verbal effusions of billionaire mayor mike bloomberg who in described his city as a "high end product" gucci on a metropolitan scale theres very little in new york today that isnt a "luxury " in name if not in fact in turn this has created linguistic challenges or opportunities for real estate developers trying to distinguish their offerings from the rest of the pack call it subprime language in an era of subprime mortgages consider a building called the visionaire which is currently under construction just north of battery park on manhattans southern tip exhausted by the chores connected to our bedbug infested "luxury " my wife and i paid a visit to its attractive sales office we loved the model kitchen and the illustrations of the playroom and pool seemed nice but certain details in its brochure which we leafed through later that evening left us scratching our heads "the visionaire " we read "is an all encompassing lifestyle that embraces the essence of home " "lifestyle " asked my foreign born wife "i thought it was a building will they provide bohemian chic friends for us too theater tickets designer clothes and midget dogs " i was more worried about the "essence of home" part in my experience the essence is what something boils down to more concentrated yes but quantitatively less and that was pretty much true here take a suburban three bedroom home with garden distill it to its "essence " and what youre left with is a square foot apartment with a view of a car park starting price &# million elsewhere in the city similar mysteries i recently received in the mail a highly glossed "invitation" to something called "the unconventional world of philippe starck " whoever that is "sales experience now open " it said on the inside page by way of an elliptical pitch for "visionary condominiums" on rd street only one sentence in the entire ad was written in clear english a small print disclaimer noting that "all illustrations are artists representations and do not constitute a representation of any aspects of the final product " then there is a former nondescript office building smack in the middle of the financial district what used to be broad street has now been converted into an upscale residential building called "the setai " and whats that "theres no word for it in english " explains its web site "perhaps because nothing like it ever has existed before " nothing ever well that may be true in the sense that it wasnt all that long ago that developers and real estate agents used such plain english words as "spacious " "prime location" and "park views" to suggest the merits of the places they were attempting to sell now we have an alchemy of abstractions experiences essences and lifestyles that work to magically transform any place into a luxury dwelling of course if manhattan real estate continues to appreciate as it has it is our children who will one day live in real paper bags just like the lads of the monty python sketch and when we tell them about their early childhoods spent in square feet with an army of militant bedbugs it is they who will shoot us a look of contempt and shout in a thick yorkshire accent "luxury " mr stephens writes the journals global view column
