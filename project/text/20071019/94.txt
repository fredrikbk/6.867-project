the weakening dollar it hit another low against the euro in overnight trading gives prices a kick from two ends said stephen brown director of energy economics at the federal reserve bank of dallas since by convention oil is priced in u s dollars those selling it arent being rewarded with the same buying power when the value of those dollars slip and that gives them a strong incentive to hike prices on the other end those buying oil with yen or euros are getting a bit of a bargain when the dollar weakens that gives them an incentive to stock up adding more demand and thus more upward pressure on prices also theres the trouble on the turkey iraq border and what it might mean for oil production in the kurdish region mr brown noted that previous oil price spikes stemmed from not mere threats to supply but actual pinching such as in the case of the disruption of suez canal shipping in the s and the oil embargo of the early s "basically now what were seeing is a tight market where
