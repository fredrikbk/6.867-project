weekend journal tastings a wine lovers everyday dozen bottles that make a wine refrigerator truly indispensible in last weeks column we recommended the perfect gift a small wine refrigerator for a mixed case of everyday wines so there would always be something perfect to drink with dinner tonight and at a nice temperature too if you missed that column drop us a note at wine wsj com or go to wsj com tastings so what wines would we have in our wine cooler for immediate consumption here they are but first some caveats we have not included any sparkling wines or dessert wines thats because we believe there should always be a bubbly in the regular refrigerator well chilled and ready to celebrate important events such as getting home safely or seeing a nice sunset we also think its a good idea to have a bottle of dessert wine in the regular refrigerator to slowly drink small glass by small glass over a period of time our case below also doesnt include a rose because we dont often drink rose with dinner but there are more and more excellent dry roses available from all over the world and especially during the warmer months of the year wed probably want to have one in the cooler we would want to constantly change whats in our cooler after finishing the first case wed want the second case to include something different thats what keeps wine fun and interesting also the perfect drink me now case depends somewhat on where you are if greek wines were readily available where we lived we might be more likely to include those and if we lived in oregon for instance wed probably always have a local pinot gris in the cooler with each new case wed be more and more adventurous our most important advice is to try new things and trust your own taste stock types of wine that you like but force yourself to get out of your comfort zone youll find many delicious surprises wines that will be new friends to greet you at home wines that make you smile here is a case of wines that would make us smile that we know would pair with anything we might cook for dinner tonight they are listed from white to red muscadet from france its the classic wine to have with fish fun easy to drink and inexpensive riesling kabinett from germany this is a must have with pork and veal but also lovely to drink on its own alsatian white from france probably pinot blanc or gewurztraminer if were calling in spicy asian food this would stand up to it and its great with pork roast with herbs or pork with simmering apples prunes and raisins inexpensive chardonnay from the u s most inexpensive chardonnay these days is sweet heavy and unpleasant but theres a reason chardonnay is still americas favorite wine when its good there are few wines as enjoyable and casual when we were young our house chardonnay was estancia we bought it by the case and always had a bottle in the refrigerator when we had informal happy food like quiche over the years weve liked beringer bogle cambria gallo of sonoma hahn r h phillips and others as our house chardonnay but this is one you really need to decide for yourself this can pair with anything from fried chicken to seafood dishes if we saw a lower priced gruner veltliner from austria or torrontes from argentina we might substitute one of those because theyre more delightful than chardonnay to sip on their own before dinner but those are harder to find than chardonnay better chardonnay from the u s or if there were a reliable one a white burgundy from france sometimes we make a special meal that needs a white of some stature and this would fit the bill wed probably look for a montagny rully or saint veran from burgundy since weve had good luck with those the american chardonnay would probably be anything we hadnt tried before because theres always a new one out there and its fun to experiment by having it in our drink now cooler wed open it instead of waiting for a special occasion sauvignon blanc from new zealand chile or south africa depending on how much we wanted to spend sauvignon blanc is mouth watering and hunger inducing and there are so many good ones today from so many places these pair with a variety of foods including salads hearty grilled vegetable dishes and seafood beaujolais from france inexpensive good both chilled or warmer perfect with just about any food from salmon to hamburgers how could we not have a bottle around we might simply have a beaujolais villages but wed probably have a bottle from one of the villages for our column about this drop us a note a red rhone from france or a portuguese red we often eat comfort food like meat loaf or macaroni and cheese and comfort food requires comfort wine wed get a portuguese red if we could find one we love their earthiness and their low prices but if we couldnt wed probably go with one of the lesser known and therefore lower priced rhone wines like vacqueyras mid range bordeaux from france if we were having steak or short ribs wed have to open a good bordeaux we might actually go to the bigger cellar for this and break out something with age but if not wed want to have a bottle of chateaux gloria phelan segur beychevelle gruaud larose or pontet canet theres nothing magical about those five names except theyre wines weve enjoyed for decades so they give us a smile pinot noir from the u s wed probably spend about &# or so on a california or oregon pinot noir to include in the cooler because these days there are few wines as reliably food friendly and delicious we also find that pinot is especially fun to linger over so wed open it when we got home and sip it through dinner good ones always seem like several bottles as they change through the night and theyre great with a wide variety of dishes from salmon to roast chicken to lamb an informal red from italy we imagine many people like us eat lasagna pizza and other casual italian dishes pretty often so wed want to have a wine to pair with those we might just go with antinoris delightful inexpensive santa cristina but perhaps wed have a bottle of barbera dalba or dolcetto instead malbec from argentina or carmenere from chile we dont often have game but if we had anything that reminded us of game a rich stew or an herbed roast these would be perfect malbec is far more widely available but carmenere is the kind of fun different often inexpensive wine that reminds us that there are always new tastes out there to be discovered remember if you buy wine by the mixed case you will usually get to off and wines always taste better with a discount
