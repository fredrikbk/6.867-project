weekend journal review film del toro rescues things we lost a tale of grief berry skillful as widow grim gone baby gone suffers from thin script the camera cant seem to get enough of benicio del toros face in "things we lost in the fire " at first its off putting even oppressive an in your face performance of such insistent unsubtlety as to make you wonder if he has lost all sense of proportion but no he has not mr del toro is a fearless actor and his jerry a heroin addict lurching toward redemption is the heart and soul as well as the haunted rubbery visage of a story of grief and loss that would be fairly lifeless without him this is not to discount the performance of his co star halle berry she plays audrey a wife and mother whose serene happy life is shattered when her husband brian david duchovny is struck down in a spasm of random violence ms berry is skillful and affecting occasionally ferocious and subtle enough for two in what is essentially a two character drama after brians death audrey provides bed in the garage and board for jerry who was her husbands close friend since childhood and who audrey believes in her distress was indirectly responsible for his death but there are limits to what any actress can do within the confines of a script by allan loeb that lurches in its turn from one arbitrary notion to another on the way to rehabilitation for its her and heroine alike ive sung ms biers praises on the occasions of three brilliant danish language films "open hearts " "brothers" and "after the wedding " her work in all three was spontaneous and intimate with a camera style notable for its fluid searching motion she brings some of the same techniques to this her american debut and achieves a similar intimacy at several lovely moments including one with jerry in a swimming pool teaching audreys young son to put his head under water flawed as it is the movie as a whole is a guilty pleasure if truth be told ms biers searching camera the cinematographer was tom stern is a problematic fit with this melodramatic material which doesnt need to be searched for its already out there in italics and boldface remarkably though mr del toro proves that bigger and much bolder can be better than tasteful restraint some of his grimaces recall gena rowlands channeling popeye some of his posturings are clownish or grotesque and goodness knows he makes no effort to soften jerrys edges the guy is a disaster that couldnt wait to happen yet jerry is alive and you cant take your eyes off him heres a style of acting so old that its new gone baby gone casey affleck makes an improbable but plausible hero in "gone baby gone " hes patrick kenzie a diffident meek private eye who turns out to be one smart sheep among underworld wolves this thriller about the search for a missing year old girl was directed by the stars older brother ben affleck whose behind the camera debut is not just plausible but admirable hes expert with actors pays attention to telling details and sustains a dark tone of pervasive evil john tolls camera work gives the darkness an alluring glint yet the script is another story not enough of a story even though it was adapted by the director and aaron stockard from a novel by dennis lehane who wrote "mystic river " theres finally much less than meets the eye in what amounts to a linear tour of greater bostons criminal minds even the surprises arent all that enthralling despite the presence of a first rate cast ed harris as a police detective whos also working the case morgan freeman as a police captain amy ryan as the missing childs drug addict mother and michelle monaghan as angie gennaro patricks partner in life and anti crime although ms monaghan does drama and comedy with equal aplomb this script gives her little more to do than stand by or nearby her man storytelling problems surface toward the overwrought climax but the worst problem is the unrelenting grimness its hard to like a movie that leaves you with no hope reservation road its amazing how quickly movies can reveal themselves i say this on the basis of a little game i sometimes play with myself trying to infer whats to come style pacing gracefulness clumsiness promise or lack of it from the first five or seconds of the first scene much more often than not those few seconds prove predictive they certainly are so in "reservation road " a deadly earnest and deadly dull psychological thriller whose opening shot of an audience at an outdoor music recital is at once artificial overlit suspiciously static and yet discernibly almost haplessly acted the next few seconds at a red sox game may not qualify for my own game but theyre stridently and insistently manipulative a story of interlocking im tempted to say gridlocking fates "reservation road" was adapted by john burnham schwartz and the director terry george from mr schwartzs novel of the same name the precipitating event is a terrible accident ill say no more for fear of making the movie sound interesting and tempting you to see it an accident that touches the lives of a husband and wife played by joaquin phoenix and jennifer connelly and a divorced father played by mark ruffalo both fathers are remarkably dislikable while every step of their way a route that takes us through grief guilt rage and vigilantism is predictable the directors approach to his turgid tale is nothing if not forthright his only aesthetic strategy as far as i could see from the many minutes that followed the first five seconds was putting vaseline on the lens during a long shot at a funeral dvd tip benicio del toro doesnt give bad performances hes never less than a strong intriguing presence whether in " grams" which won him an oscar nomination for supporting actor or in "traffic" which won him an oscar in that category he has only given one performance to my knowledge with a yiddish accent that was as an ostensibily hasidic diamond dealer in guy ritchies "snatch" which also starred brad pitt as an irish gypsy boxer who speaks almost incomprehensible english corrections &amp amplifications susanne bier directed the film "things we lost in the fire " a film
