weekend journal review television strange days at downing with a title reeking heavily of the feel good and a veritable sitcom of an opening episode that delivers same "the amazing mrs pritchard" beginning sunday p m edt on pbs check local listings looks far from promising a look not to be trusted as it turns out nor is there in this five part "masterpiece theatre" drama about a supermarket manager from west yorkshire who becomes prime minister much thats amazing about its improbable heroine there is at most something odd about writer sally wainwrights decision to model mrs pritchard on a character by now rather well worn the feminist superwoman late s model and there are speeches to match to hear ros pritchard jane horrocks mother wife and head of staff at the greengages superstore declaim on all the ways in which men are inferior to women and incompetent to run the world women are more reasonable truthful peaceful dont need to be right all the time etc etc is to feel the decades roll away in somewhat the same way time seemed to stop during last months emmy awards no work of fantasy when sally field declared in her acceptance speech that " if the mothers ruled the world there would be no expletive wars in the first place " ros pritchard wouldnt to be sure be caught dead using profanity of this sort at least prior to her rise to power though by the time shes established as pm and busy pushing bills in the interest of goodness and truth her husband has to caution her to please stop using the f word in front of the children by this time too "the amazing mrs pritchard" has worked its way steadily seductively to powerful drama despite the flighty beginning tone the thin unconvincing creations wandering about as her needy daughters and a script that could clearly have used some oversight the number of times characters murmur "are you all right " to one another is in fact amazing if mrs pritchard herself is not the miniseries has hardened into a gritty tale of betrayal ambition misprized love and warring loyalties all of it absorbing there is no mystery about this transformation which begins as soon as the key figures surrounding the new prime minister begin taking center stage effectively offsetting the weightless lead character theyre a nestful of vipers these advisers in grim battle with one another and the exigencies of their career stuffed lives but all devoted in their ways to the pm and her political aims certain of those progressive aims carless wednesdays which mrs pritchard wants sprung on citizens as a way of fighting global warming not to mention her insistence on moving the seat of government from historic whitehall to a new suburban address dont go down easily even with devotees like these the pms nearly all female team of advisers are the pragmatists here the tough controllers who struggle to rein in the dreamer they moved heaven and earth to elect those struggles and the superb tensions they generate are what keep the life fires burning in this improbable drama as chancellor and deputy pm catherine walker janet mcteer delivers a performance stunning for its force and magnetism quite simply she runs away with the series formerly a prominent member of the conservative party catherine has defected to ross party the purple alliance and now finds herself having to explain to the pm the symbolism of whitehall and why the history cannot blithely be tossed away to accommodate ross passion for revolutionary change also advising the pm is the somewhat less flinty miranda lennox jodhi may and the earnest home secretary hilary rees benson a straight arrow with a distinct touch of the malign about her portrayed by the admirable geraldine james ros cant be said to absorb their instruction even when ready to concede error here and there the pm is certain in her heart of hearts that most of the world feels as she does about most things if only they knew it in a world currently focused on a prominent american woman running for the democratic nomination "the amazing mrs pritchard" might have been expected to have a certain relevance it has none a work that presents the heroines main qualification for the highest office in the land as being precisely her complete ignorance total lack of experience and complete indifference to politics and the way government operates all that matters is taking an interest ros claims is relevant to nothing outside the world of fantasy even the sorts of political candidates who actually once preened themselves on being washington "outsiders" have fallen curiously splendidly silent of late about that so forget relevance even the jabs here at george bush and the iraq war are so halfhearted as to seem unreal and enjoy this dark entertainment the death knells for abcs "cavemen" tuesdays p m edt began sounding quite early but before its interment it ought to be said that this strange slice of life about three male cavepersons making their way in the workaday world has its charms even for those of us who would have preferred a sitcom peopled by that lizard the chief source of that charm is the unmistakable hint of wit in the writing only a hint but its steady which is enough to seduce among the cavemen in question the urbane eminently reasonable joel bill english is the only one holding a regular job paying bills and dating a girl herself not a caveperson she is one of those majority homo sapiens certain embittered cavemen call "smoothies" which is to say white people not covered with hair bill has a younger brother andy sam huntington who appears to spend a good part of his time hoping to find a girl smoothie or otherwise and then there is the difficult nick nick kroll their problem roommate nicks main problem extraordinary quantities of self esteem and a fervent belief that the world is threatened by his intelligence has kept him from trying anything remotely resembling a job the trios adventures and preoccupations have a touch of the familiar about them familiar as in "seinfeld" chatter about food and fads as evidenced in the latest episode where the trio held forth on the newest hot foodie trend and chased after a certain unforgettable yogurt the caveman conceit perhaps like the "cavemen" show isnt likely to have an extensive future though the writers make stabs at sustaining talk about their special society what is really working here is the freewheeling nature of this sitcom about three smart mouthed roommates distinguished from most other bachelor characters on tv by a lot of extra hair a lack of obsessive reference to sex and a certain unpredictability interesting enough to keep a viewer guessing
