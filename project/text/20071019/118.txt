weekend journal taste the new death writing in encounter magazine in the british anthropologist geoffrey gorer argued that death had become the great unmentionable the victorians were prudish about sex and candid about death he said whereas westerners of the mid th century were garrulous about sex and well stiff about stiffs death be not loud in pop culture nowadays though death is mighty loud traveling exhibits like "body worlds" are popular and profitable with preserved cadavers dribbling basketballs hurling javelins and pondering chess boards hbos "six feet under" frothily blended sex and death for five seasons alice sebolds novel "the lovely bones " narrated by a dead girl spent more than a year on the new york times best seller list amazons "death &amp grief" section has more than titles ernest beckers "denial of death" sells well enough to seem oxymoronic but we shouldnt be too hasty in congratulating ourselves and deriding earlier generations as uptight and self deluded we can chatter and chortle about death without honestly confronting it in fundamental ways our culture is reinventing death rites and in the process growing further apart from death itself the old attitude toward death is poignantly illustrated by "the undertaking " a documentary airing on pbss "frontline" oct it features thomas lynch a michigan funeral director essayist and poet whose books include a volume called "the undertaking life studies from the dismal trade " in the film we see the dead being embalmed dressed powdered laid out for display and even cremated most hauntingly mr lynch talks with a couple who face the imminent death of their two year old son blind and unable to speak since birth as a result of a rare genetic abnormality the mother says that she cant imagine life without him but the "traditions that we follow maybe will help us survive " those traditions seem to be withering as mr lynch acknowledges he told me about "theme" funerals that focus on the deceaseds favorite pastimes "golf or bowling or boxing " once a gift to the dead the funeral is fast becoming a gift from the dead planned in advance like a bequest with "pre need" funeral arrangements survivors can be saved from having to make difficult choices "people say they dont want to be a burden to their children " mr lynch recounts "i say why not theyve been a burden to you " in funeral rites venerability once provided solace the communitys traditions live on even as individuals die as well as caution your day will come too buster for many americans now by contrast ancient rituals are intolerably old fashioned and rigid at once crusty and procrustean "in an era where options surround us everywhere from the toothpaste selection at the grocery store to a hundred versions of white paint at the hardware store " amy meyerson writes in obit the web site of a soon to be launched death centric magazine "its natural that our choices regarding the dead be equally complete and equally reflective of the individual consumer " a stroll through the exhibit floor of the national funeral directors association convention in las vegas earlier this month suggests that death options are indeed as plentiful as toothpaste brands you can get a casket thats biodegradable wicker or big and tall or cowboy style "rustic pine" with "hand forged iron hinges" and it "can be personalized with a brand" coming soon a casket modeled on "the popular photon torpedo design seen in star trek ii the wrath of khan " even hair reliquaries have a distinctive st century look trifac inc markets shapely models called the lotus the lumen and um the hymen cremations accounted for less than of american deaths in now theyre up to a third and the cremation association of north america expects them to pass by mobility stokes the flames when we stayed put mr lynch says we planted our ancestors when we flit from place to place ancestors need to be portable now as "frontline" shows not only can you watch the cremation you can step up and throw momma to the flame afterward her ashes can be reheated inside molten glass to form an attractive crystal ball or processed into diamonds or blended into plant food which come to think of it is where were headed anyway the funeral associations neo necro products represent only part of the new mortality "deathcare " as its called is abuzz with change some folks get buried with their blackberrys survivors can text their sorrows away a developer in las vegas has proposed a "stylized version of the coliseum in rome " featuring a mausoleum a gift shop a "virtual casino" whatever that is and balm for bereavements sting a tavern in the threepenny review earlier this year bert keizer described one frolicsome funeral a woman biked to the grave pulling a cart that bore the colorful casket the dead mans young son sat atop the casket and pretended to drive to mr keizer it seemed like "a desperate attempt at saying howdy to death " according to anthropologist nigel barley a family in lancashire england a few years ago wanted "dad" chiseled on the churchyard tombstone but the vicar insisted on "father " if "dad" were permitted he said "it will not be long before we have cuddles squidgy and ginger which would make the last resting place sound like a pets cemetery " such a dispute is unimaginable in the u s chummy yet individualistic and it should be said increasingly fond of burying its pets a lucrative sideline at the funeral directors convention hidebound tradition is the grimmest reaper of all though its far from the norm sassy saucy death chic is spreading as mr keizer observes attitudes toward death change as belief in the afterlife fades goodbye isnt quite the same when the departed is headed for a hole or a furnace and no place else sociologist tony walter suggests that squinting at death is fun when as now death isnt staring unblinkingly back at you in a global war or pandemic the topic may not seem so amusing for their part boomers want a final woodstockian opportunity to jolt the culture even though much of their original audience the easily scandalized older generation is getting its groove on elsewhere whats wrong with all this at the individual level funerary frivolity trivializes both the death and the life that preceded it at the social level tradition and ritual passed from generation to generation create a common framework for discussing lifes ultimate questions when we choose customized individualized let it be me funerals we start slipping from lingua franca to tabula rasa soon were talking only to ourselves mr bates teaches at the hank greenspun school of journalism at the university of nevada las vegas
