patent incentives lead to more and better drugs josh kramers oct letter to the editor suggesting that pharmaceutical companies reduce the price of patented drugs "life extending drugs cost may force patent change" wrongly assumes that the companies would continue to develop the same number of expensive drugs without patents financial incentives work we have more and better drugs because of patents than we would have without patents which of the drugs whose patents recently expired would we not have cheaper generics for today if the patent incentive had not been in place years ago and which is worse failing to extend a single life because of the lack of access to expensive drugs or failing to extend a far greater number of lives because no one developed the drugs in the first place joe hepworth kaysville utah
