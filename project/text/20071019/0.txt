a real regulatory redundancy today marks the th anniversary of the crash when the u s stock market dropped in a single day capping a week where it lost a third of its value this event shocked market participants and caused the greatest crisis in confidence in the stock market in years multiple studies were done to investigate the causes of the crash and to suggest actions to restore investor confidence in u s financial markets today the dow jones industrial average hovers near almost seven times the djia value at the time of the crash trading volume in stocks options and financial futures on an average day dwarfs the volume that overwhelmed the markets during the crash in many ways the strength of our financial markets is due to improvements implemented to the infrastructure of the securities and derivatives markets as a result of the crash as well as to the transition to electronic from manual trading although improvements were made to the overall resiliency of our markets in the wake of the crash a troubling aspect of our regulatory system persists today and continues to threaten the soundness and competitiveness of our markets regulation of equivalent financial instruments continues to be divided between two agencies the securities and exchange commission sec and the commodity futures trading commission cftc the sec regulates "securities " which include stocks bonds mutual funds and options on these instruments the cftc regulates "commodities " which include futures on financial instruments as a result options on stocks and stock indexes come under the secs purview and are subject to securities laws while futures on similar instruments fall within the cftcs area and are subject to a completely separate regulatory and statutory regime this structure was developed in the s when the futures markets traded contracts almost exclusively on traditional commodities such as grains and metals a separate agency sprung from the department of agriculture was deemed appropriate for "this specialized segment of the market " the bifurcated system was already outmoded when the market crashed in at that time the "commodities" futures markets were already trading contracts on a variety of financial instruments including stock indexes foreign currency and government securities the quaint divide between commodities and securities no longer held up indeed the presidential study of the crash the brady report found that the markets for stocks options and futures were actually one market and should come under the overarching purview of a single regulatory agency fast forward years and the problems with divided regulation have intensified todays cftc regulated "commodities" markets have become primarily markets for futures on financial instruments and options on those futures yet the divided regulatory and statutory system remains intact this structure hampers the competitiveness of u s financial markets impedes innovation and creates serious public policy concerns no other country uses such a structure for over years the divided jurisdiction has created needless legal uncertainty as to the status of new financial products any novel derivative that hints of a futures contract must be vetted by the sec and the cftc as to its legal status the result often is an interminable delay as the two agencies try to decide which has jurisdiction over the product for example our exchange the chicago board options exchange filed a proposal in june with the sec to trade options on exchange traded funds that invest in gold the proposal has gone nowhere because the sec and cftc are still trying to decide more than two years later who should regulate the product markets overseas do not have this problem and as a result often trade new derivative products long before they are available in the u s the public policy issues from the system are numerous u s financial firms are subject to duplicative and disjointed oversight from separate agencies when trading virtually equivalent products key investor protection and market soundness provisions such as margin levels are handled very differently by the two agencies for similar products disputes arise on managing market events for example when sentinel management group experienced problems this summer the sec and the cftc clashed in court as to how to dispose of client funds held by sentinel the judge in the matter asked "why doesnt this agency of government go over and talk to this other agency of the government and get your act together for crying out loud " any rational unbiased assessment of the bifurcated regulatory system leads to the conclusion that there should be a single agency recently mary schapiro who has served both as chairman of the cftc and as acting chairman of the sec called the u s oversight regime a "spaghetti bowl" of regulators and questioned the sense of having two separate regulatory agencies combining the sec and cftc into a single agency or even creating a new agency has been a much needed fix for the past years the combination of the two agencies has failed to occur for one reason congressional turf the sec and cftc are overseen by different committees in congress none of which wants to lose jurisdiction in the event of a merger of the agencies it is high time to end the congressional roadblock to addressing a problem that impedes the competitiveness of our markets and compromises investor protection combining oversight of the two agencies under a single committee in each chamber of congress and allowing these committees to address this pressing need is one way to bypass the roadblock in calling for a single agency i do not seek to favor one agency over the other i believe the chicago board options exchange could readily live under the statutory and regulatory oversight of a properly constituted federal agency what we cannot and should not tolerate is being subject to the ongoing duplication uncertainty and delay that results from divided jurisdiction under two agencies the treasury department currently is conducting a study of the competitive issues facing u s financial markets and has included this issue as part of its study i am very encouraged by this and hope that members of congress likewise give this issue serious consideration it should not take another catastrophic market event to spur washington to do the right thing mr brodsky is chairman and ceo of the chicago board options exchange he previously served from as ceo of the chicago mercantile exchange this article was adapted from his recent testimony before the house agricultural committee on risk management
