love &amp money job advice can spouses give it to be clear i know pretty much nothing about the health care industry my wife amy is equally ignorant about the news business but that never stops either of us from dishing out career advice on everything from dealing with bosses and colleagues to negotiating for a salary increase its only natural that couples should play career counselor to each other after all we have to live with our spouses jobs too their happiness on the job their schedules their salaries and benefits it all has a profound impact on our lives as well but our desire to advise leaves both parties in a tricky spot as the person receiving advice how do you handle it especially if its worthless how do you tell your spouse that he or she doesnt really understand your situation meanwhile as the adviser are there certain types of advice that are more appropriate than others how do you make sure your advice isnt just in your own best interest but also in your spouses best interest and perhaps most tricky how do you react if the advice is ignored because at least in my experience more often than not it is heres a perfect example of what im talking about amy has for the past couple of years been pushing me to seek a raise for writing this column she cranked up the volume in recent months when she and i began doing podcasts and now were talking of doing video the process adds a meaningful amount of work to my evenings and its adding to her weekly workload as well since she is part of the audio and video effort what really irks her though is that even though i agree that i deserve a raise i dont press my editor for one except subtly as im doing through this column i feel that asking will get me nowhere and could breed resentment it simply isnt worth it and that drives amy crazy "i get really frustrated with you " she says "you always say it wont go over well but no one needs to understand health care or journalism or whatever to see how much effort someone puts into their job and to know they should be compensated for all this extra work they do " still im not the only one in this relationship who ignores advice case in point the k plan at amys company ive pulled it apart and know it needs serious reorganization to provide workers with more appropriate investment options so i have advised amy on several occasions to discuss this with her employer i once even spent an evening typing a memo for her yet amy has never discussed this with her boss "this is the plan these doctors have always had in place and making this kind of suggestion impacts the whole company not just my job " she says "i dont feel comfortable possibly stepping on peoples toes and i dont feel confident defending this because i dont understand it the way you do " in part the acceptance of advice depends on whether it is solicited or not if were seeking advice as amy has done with her pay and work schedule were more likely to heed the words but when the counsel arrives unsolicited such as my concerns about amys misguided retirement plan the advice falls flat so if much of the advice goes unheeded why ask amy says im missing the point she says that often when she asks for advice she isnt really asking for advice she has no intention of following it sometimes she is frustrated at work and wants to vent to somebody who cares other times shes simply trying to engage me in her life to feel more connected to me i shouldnt be insulted that she doesnt follow my advice she says i should understand that she is asking me as a way to get closer to tie me more into her life outside the home my friends in seattle jack and colleen offer another example of when advice serves an important function in their case mundane office matters arent at issue instead its the big career moves many times jack says he has arrived home with exciting news of some job opening or an employment pitch he has received colleen he says will "react like i came home and said i was joining the circus i would walk away wondering whoa what just happened there why is she raining on my parade " through the years though jack has come to realize colleens advice even when unsolicited is a necessary reality check jack is the family of fours sole breadwinner and as he says is prone to wearing "career blinders " thus while he builds a rosy view of a cool new job colleens advice is based on how a change could profoundly affect the family shell see the impact on jacks commute or on how much time he will have for their two daughters or the risk a new job would pose to her ability to be a stay at home parent with the kids "i always wanted to resist thinking that she was the voice of reason " jack says "but i had an aha moment when i realized that her advice was her way of being more holistic about career " jack says he realized colleen never had a different view of his career wants she just had a broader view that brought family into the mix maybe thats the ultimate message career advice from a spouse solicited or not isnt always about the advice itself maybe as with jack and colleen its a way to talk about their lives together and their priorities as a couple and a family maybe as with amy its about the two of us getting closer communicating the specific advice is secondary to that broader context maybe but i still think amys k plan needs fixing jeff opdyke
