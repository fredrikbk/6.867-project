eyes on the road will the chrysler deal affect what people drive online edition most of us only buy cars not car companies so what does it matter to ordinary car shoppers who owns chrysler thats a question that doesnt get a lot of attention in the hurly burly of covering a big business deal such as cerberus capital management llcs agreement to buy of chrysler from its german parent the company formerly known as daimlerchrysler ag the first benefit to society from this deal we no longer have to write or read the name daimlerchrysler itll just be daimler for most consumers outside of chryslers southeast michigan base "it means zero " says jason vines chief spokesman for chrysler customers care about how they are treated by dealers he says and they want to know that a car maker will be around long term to back up a purchase mr vines says research hes seen and his own experiences tell him that for the vast majority of americans chryslers big deal is no big deal restructuring sick giant companies is difficult work and there are no guarantees of what will come from cerberus wager on chrysler cerberus clearly is hoping that consumers will reward the company if it decides to spend less money on fire sale marketing and runaway health care and instead invest in making vehicles that are more efficient safer longer lasting and probably somewhat more expensive to buy chrysler skidded off the road after a profitable run earlier in this decade in part because the companys management lost touch with consumers it built more hemi powered cars super sized jeeps and big pickup trucks than consumers wanted to buy in the face of rising gas prices shutting factories is expensive for detroit because workers get paid and earn benefits whether they lines run or not the company offered consumers big discounts to take excess inventory off dealers hands the end result chrysler had an operating loss of about &# billion last year and gave up market share chrysler executives have said that as they restructure the company closing factories cutting jobs and killing redundant models theyll be less likely to repeat that kind of mistake if they succeed that could mean up front discounts wont be as generous but theres another side to this chryslers jeeps and dodges that people do buy might be worth more at trade in time thats the way honda motor co and toyota motor corp operate and theyre gaining share david cole a longtime industry consultant who leads the center for automotive research in ann arbor mich says one of most critical challenges facing chryslers new owners is negotiating with the united auto workers what he calls a "transformational labor contract" that lifts from the company much of the &# billion burden it carries now for retiree health care why should consumers care because restructuring the health care burden would free up capital for research and development leading to better technology and improved quality for future models mr cole says perhaps transaction prices for chrysler cars would go up but the cars would be better in theory if chrysler had another &# to &# to invest in each car &lt ndash&gt about what it spends on healthcare now it could offer more standard safety equipment without drastically raising the sticker price in fact offering more features while holding prices relatively flat is another strategy toyota has used to boost sales in the coming years auto makers face intense pressure to invest in new technology and fuel efficient vehicle designs one of the few things that president bush and the democratic congress appear to agree on is that the auto industry should be compelled to increase significantly the overall fuel efficiency of new cars and trucks president bushs decision last week to order the federal bureaucracy to begin work on new mileage standards to achieve his goal of cutting gasoline consumption by means that none of detroits auto makers can afford the luxury of pouring money down the drain of a failed business model chrysler leaders know this much consumers dont support the status quo buyers who responded to surveys last year by j d power and associates seeking information on the long term reliability of different models gave all three of chryslers brands chrysler dodge and jeep scores below the industry average a separate study of repair frequency by the consulting company walden consultants ltd shows that chrysler vehicles on average need repairs roughly more frequently than toyotas walden uses an index is average for all vehicles chryslers scored while toyotas averaged just under long term reliability has a powerful influence on consumer buying choices analysts say but improving it isnt just a matter of goof proofing the assembly line reliability is engineered into a car from the beginning based in part on choices about how much to spend on making parts more robust or the engineering more sophisticated "the bigger question is whether cerberus ownership impacts the companys long term philosophy when it comes to quality and product development " says j d power vice president chris denove "it wouldnt make sense to acquire chrysler and then drop the ball on quality " he adds bob lutz general motors corp s vice chairman for product development was asked during a taping last week of the national public radio show program "wait wait dont tell me " what advice he had for chryslers new ownership mr lutz a former chrysler executive who was a key player in one of the companys previous comebacks replied "build great cars and trucks " the line got a round of applause this is easier said than done of course but the auto industrys recent history suggests that its almost impossible to do when a companys leadership is distracted by the internal politics of a failing merger or throwing capital into desperate efforts to clear a backlog of last years models send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
