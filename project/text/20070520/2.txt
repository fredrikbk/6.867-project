getting going classics of financial advice good and bad maybe its time to go back to school old school that is every year investment and personal finance books are published by the truckload when the review copies hit my desk ill spend a minute or two with each my snap judgment in most cases the trees died in vain that got me to thinking what about the classic finance books that are touted again and again are they any better i recently breezed through three of them and came away captivated by two the richest man in babylon by george clason i am often asked what book i would recommend for a financial novice i have never had a good answer until now "the richest man in babylon " a slim book with a cult following among the self improvement crowd may not live up to its lofty reputation but its pretty darn good the book is a collection of pamphlets written starting in the s by businessman george clason the parables are a little hokey and the archaic language can be a little grating yet theres something compelling about the stories as evidenced by the books enduring popularity if nothing else this book is a useful reminder of just how easy it is to amass wealth forget all the chatter about hedge funds oil prices and the yen carry trade these are just befuddling distractions to get rich all it takes is regular savings and years of investment compounding think youll find happiness at the shopping mall "all men are burdened with more desires than they can gratify " mr clason observes reckon youve found a hot stock "gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers " he notes the book is at heart a paean to self discipline delayed gratification and prudent investing "a part of all you earn is yours to keep " mr clason writes "it should be not less than a tenth no matter how little you earn " he continues "wealth like a tree grows from a tiny seed the first copper you save is the seed from which your tree of wealth shall grow the sooner you plant that seed the sooner shall the tree grow and the more faithfully you nourish and water that tree with consistent savings the sooner may you bask in contentment beneath its shade " the battle for investment survival by gerald loeb "the battle for investment survival" is one of those classic wall street texts that even today often gets cited i thought i was in for a treat i was disappointed the book was first published in by gerald loeb who spent almost his entire career at e f hutton where he eventually became the brokerage firms vice chairman the editions available today typically reflect a later revision which doubled the books size by adding over chapters the result is a hodgepodge of material that while occasionally informative and entertaining doesnt hang together terribly well maybe however i am not the right person to read this work indeed the book could be used to profile investors if mr loebs advice strikes you as outdated misguided and sometimes downright dangerous you are probably a buy and hold mutual fund investor who has taken to heart the lessons of academic finance you realize that beating the market is awfully tough and that your best bet is to diversify broadly keep costs low and invest for the long haul on the other hand if you find yourself cheering each chapter you likely think that all this talk of efficient markets is garbage youre a trader by instinct and wall street is a game you are confident you can win mr loeb favors short term investment bets but only when market conditions seem ripe and only when "tape reading" indicates a stocks price action is in your favor "intelligent capital is like a rabbit darting here and there to cover " he writes as mr loeb makes clear again and again he is no fan of diversification "selection of too many issues is often a form of hedging against ignorance " he argues true enough but as best i can tell ignorance is pretty pervasive in the financial markets so hedging seems like an awfully smart idea where are the customers yachts by fred schwed jr in his latest annual letter to berkshire hathaways shareholders celebrated investor warren buffett describes "where are the customers yachts " as "the funniest book ever written about investing " that is quite an endorsement but its entirely deserved first published in the book was penned by fred schwed jr who worked as a reporter at the new york times and the wall street journal before becoming a brokerage firm "customers man" during the heady days of he continued working on wall street through the crash and the great depression that followed the book is relentlessly cynical and yet it has a light touch skewering each subject with a playful turn of phrase like "the richest man in babylon " you could knock off "where are the customers yachts " in three or four hours the big surprise mr schweds book isnt just a humorous romp through wall street it also contains a heap of investment wisdom wisdom that is still applicable today consider one example when folks hear about wall streets most successful investors they usually conclude that these market mavens must be skillful not lucky mr schwed suspects otherwise to prove his point he uses a simple mathematical example suppose you have contestants who face off in pairs in each round a coin flip decides the winner so you have winners and losers like investors who beat the market year after year some coin flippers will compile wonderful winning streaks as mr schwed notes "eventually there are about a dozen men who have won every singe time for about fifteen games they are regarded as the experts the greatest coin flippers in history the men who never lose and they have their biographies written " market beating mutual funds anyone correction in my may column i said the notion of fundamental indexing originated with pasadena calif money manager robert arnott while mr arnott has produced perhaps the best known research on the topic he wasnt the first to advocate the strategy jonathan clements also writes the "getting going" column that appears wednesdays in the wall street journal write to him at
