reply all should the fcc curb tv violence online edition in a long awaited report the federal communications commission recently called on congress to draft tougher regulations on violent television programming the report which lawmakers requested three years ago concluded that current efforts to protect children from violent content the v chip blocking technology and a voluntary rating system are not effective the fcc urged congress to adopt a standard for "excessively violent programming" that the agency would enforce and suggested restricting violent programs to late hours the agency also pressed cable and satellite services to allow consumers to opt out of channels that carry violent programming the agency currently regulates obscenity and profanity only on broadcast networks sen jay rockefeller d w va has said he plans to introduce legislation in coming weeks that may incorporate some of the fccs suggestions but should the government regulate violence on tv wsj com invited former fcc commissioner gloria tristani who chaired the agencys v chip task force to debate the topic with rene balcer the executive producer of "law &amp order" and co creator of "law &amp order criminal intent " their conversation carried out over email is below ms tristani begins parents health professionals and most americans agree that we need to take steps to protect children from excessive violence on television the scientific community is in agreement that media violence can increase aggressive behavior in children indeed there is a stronger connection between violence on television and aggressive behavior than there is between lead exposure and lower iqs in children the v chip technology and the tv voluntary ratings system have not worked adequately to curtail violent tv from reaching our children too many parents are unaware that the v chip is available and even those who are and use the v chip with the ratings find the tv ratings are too often inaccurate and or confusing parents need more and effective tools to help them guide their childrens tv viewing the u s congress is currently exploring what it can do to address this problem and they are considering options which may include limiting excessive violent content during the hours children are most likely to be watching mr balcer responds you assume the government needs to regulate violent content on television i dont i think the government should make sure parents have the tools and information necessary to regulate what their kids watch on tv i also think its proper for the government to encourage i hesitate to say compel the tv industry to fully disclose the content of their programming so parents can then make an informed decision as to what they let their kids watch the problem with current v chip and similar technology is that most parents either dont know that their sets are equipped with it or that their cable satellite services offer it or they dont know how to program it most adults still havent figured how to program their dvd players and i guess we cant ask the kids to program our v chips for us so it seems the answer is simpler technology and more information about it on the ratings side whatever inconsistency exists reflects confusion as to what constitutes violent programming even the fcc threw up their hands in trying to come up with a definition ms tristani blaming and calling parents technologically inept is not helpful and does not go to the root of the problem parents have every reason to be confused tv content ratings are not uniformly applied across the industry and they are different from the movie ratings and different from the ratings for videogames in addition under the current systems in place content rating information is usually available only for the first seconds of each tv program parents need help in navigating a tv world where the average child will be expected to see acts of violence before the age of even though difficult congress and the courts have defined obscenity and indecency in the context of sexual expression the courts have found that there is a compelling governmental interest in protecting children from sexually explicit tv programming and could find that there is a similar interest in protecting children from excessively explicit violent tv programming mr balcer i dont know about lead and lower iq but i do know that it is absolutely not true that the "scientific community is in agreement that media violence can increase aggressive behavior in children " even the fcc report admitted that the jury is still out on finding a causation between tv violence and aggressive behavior at most some studies have found a correlation between violent programming and aggressive behavior but as any scientist will tell you thats a far different thing from saying tv violence causes real life violence the whole "violent tv violent kids" equation has developed into an urban myth with very little actual science behind it ms tristani certainly i am aware of no one who believes that tv is the sole cause of any real life violent behavior the consensus is that tv violence is a risk factor and the fcc report found that it agreed with the surgeon general that "exposure to violence in the media can increase childrens aggressive behavior in the short term " in addition going back to a wide group of health organizations ranging from the american academy of pediatrics to the american medical association found that viewing violence can lead to desensitization towards violence children exposed at a young age have a higher tendency to violent and aggressive behavior later in life children exposed are more likely to assume acts of violence are acceptable and viewing violence increases fear of becoming a victim of violence moreover one of the few experts with a contrary view who has been repeatedly employed by industry has never conducted any empirical research on the subject its time to get beyond disputing that violent tv content can hurt children the status quo is not an option lets talk about how to deal with this mr balcer maybe you should direct your comment about "blaming and calling parents technologically inept is not helpful" to the fcc since theyre the ones who stated in section of their report that "many parents do not even know if the television sets in their households incorporate this technology and of those who do many do not use it parents low level of v chip use is explained in parts by parents unawareness of the device and the multi step and often confusing process necessary to use it " the fcc report wasnt about regulating "explicit" violence it was about regulating violent programming period explicit sex is far easier to define than violence seven words a half dozen body parts a dozen sex acts pretty much cover the former as for defining the latter one definition quoted in the fcc report would bar showing a police officer raising his weapon to arrest a suspect thats why the fcc passed the buck and made an exception for violence in newscasts and sports for some reason in their unscientific construct the fcc must believe that kids somehow arent affected by the real life violence in security taped beatings and hockey fights ms tristani one of the many reasons parents have not been aware that new television sets are equipped with v chips was the continued reluctance of the television and the consumer electronics industries to inform parents about this during my tenure at the fcc the industry consistently resisted consumer education about the v chip and the ratings system it was only after the janet jackson super bowl incident that the v chip and tv ratings suddenly reappeared in the industry vocabulary defining excessive explicit violence would not be easy and the fcc report did not fully engage in a comprehensive discussion one definition that has been suggested is content that "visually portrays in detail graphically describes in lurid detail the violent physical destruction torture or dismemberment of a human being provided this is done to exploit morbid or shameful interest in these matters and not for genuine scientific educational or artistic purposes " such a definition would allow for news and other exceptions such as sports or you could define violence like the late supreme court justice potter stewart defined pornography i know it when i see it congress may undertake the difficult task of defining violence or explore other options mr balcer i know you may not want facts to intrude in this discussion but to address your comment about the surgeon generals report on youth violence that report also said that television violence has little or no role in causing real violence and the report from the american academy of pediatrics was as admitted by one of its authors full of inaccuracies and based on flawed surveys of existing studies look it goes without saying that anyone who cares about kids wants to protect them from disturbing images thats true of everyone im involved with in my industry everything is scrutinized for violent content not only by the standards department but also by the creative people who create and control the content we do police ourselves we realize parents even the parents in our industry are deeply concerned about the issue but as i said at the onset any inconsistency in the ratings reflects the difficulty in defining what constitutes violent programming far from believing that american parents are too inept to regulate what their kids watch give them the tools and the information to do it i dont think theres much any industry can do to counter congress natural inclination to attack straw men especially in an election cycle once congress gets a populist straw man between its fangs its usually reluctant to let it go let me play devils advocate for a moment and suggest that if congress really thinks tv violence is harmful to our kids then by all means they should back up their position with real legislation to demonstrate their serious intent and concern let them subject television to the same regulations alcohol and tobacco are subject to if its a crime to give alcohol to kids then make it a crime to put a tv in a kids bedroom going by the definition offered by gloria showing an autopsy would be verboten unless it was for an artistic purpose and we all know what a great loophole that is by the way other than that republican favorite "" which might get a waiver under the "artistic" loophole i cant think of any network tv show in recent memory that comes close to showing a scene that violated the guidelines in the definition even the cable show "dexter " about a serial killing forensic technician cut away before the killing began the choices i make are usually dictated by my own tastes its a gut test since i write about crime violent acts are part and parcel of the drama generally id rather suggest than show violence the one area im especially concerned about is the sexualization of violence im not in the business of breeding or titillating sexual sadists everything under my purview gets scrutinized right down to the amount of fake blood at a crime scene but again i cant speak for all my colleagues i would support an educational campaign directed at the content creators in television but i would not support big brother regulation of content ms tristani its a shame that a month after the tragedy of virginia tech we should be having a discussion about whether it is in the public interest to do everything we can to limit the flow of excessive violent tv images that reach our children the scientific consensus is that violent tv content is a risk factor to violent behavior we can battle this back and forth or we can work to do something about this i am glad to hear that you and your colleagues share the concerns of most american parents unfortunately there are too many in the industry who evidently do not share these concerns there are programs like the one you produce "law and order " that do not glamorize violence or the aggressors and show the real consequences of violence but there are far too many shows where the violence is gratuitous and excessive the latter are the types of programs that most concern health professionals and parents instead of getting into discussions about banning tvs from kids bedrooms lets try to have a productive discussion lets have a dialogue between parents child advocates and industry members to discuss ways to effectively address the problem there are many suggestions that merit exploration everybody including industry needs to participate and take ownership of the health and well being of our children in a world which is saturated with real life violence we need to do everything we reasonably can to counter each and every risk factor that contributes to that violence the task does not lend itself to easy and facile solutions but we need to try mr balcer concludes since theres been no indication that the virginia tech shooter even watched television dragging murders committed by a mentally disturbed student into a discussion about tv violence is gratuitous and shameful and trivializes the tragedy and it adds nothing to the debate unless you want to talk about how the round the clock news coverage of the event impacted children like most americans and most people in my industry im concerned about what our kids see on television i believe that congress should take a leadership role in promoting technological innovation and informational initiatives to allow parents and the broadcasting industry to meet their responsibilities toward our children i would also support congress funding research research that adheres to strict scientific protocols into the relationship between violent programming and aggressive behavior i agree with you that dialogue and education are the key but like most americans i dont want congress censoring what i can or cant watch parents presently have the most powerful screening tool in their hands the "off" button on their remote networks are acutely sensitive to market pressures low ratings for an objectionable program will get it zapped quicker than any legislation what do you think should the fcc curb violence on tv share your thoughts and join the discussion
