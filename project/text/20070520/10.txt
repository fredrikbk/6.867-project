special report etfs what you need to know evaluating exchange traded funds thinking of dabbling in etfs exchange traded funds baskets of stocks or bonds designed to replicate the returns of the market or a segment of it have been enjoying a lot of buzz lately they are touted for their advantages over conventional mutual funds such as lower management fees and smaller tax bills and the fact that etfs can be bought and sold all day long not just once a day assets in etfs have grown dramatically doubling to more than &# billion in less than three years but that doesnt mean small investors should be leaping on the bandwagon in fact while etfs do offer certain benefits many of their bells and whistles are more useful to institutional investors making complicated financial bets or moving quickly in and out of a small corner of the stock market than they are to main street investors saving money for the long term moreover etfs have some of their own drawbacks too notably extra fees like brokerage commissions these charges can make etfs more expensive in some circumstances than conventional index mutual funds that have been available to investors for years yet some individual investors have found etfs quite useful here are five things to help you decide if they make sense for you trading flexibility as their name implies etfs can be traded on exchanges at fluctuating prices throughout the day like stocks thats in contrast to conventional mutual funds which are priced just once a day after the market closes at p m so if its important to you to be able to sell at a m or p m in response to market news or a change in your personal views etfs might be just the ticket also many conventional mutual funds impose fees and other penalties to discourage investors from rapidly buying and selling shares trading activity that can harm long term shareholders for instance there may be a redemption fee imposed by the fund if you decide to sell your shares within several months of making a purchase or a limit on the number of times you can buy and resell shares in a given time period there can be similar charges imposed by discount brokerage firms that distribute funds in their "no transaction fee" supermarkets and separately "contingent deferred sales charges" that apply when you sell some funds distributed by full service brokerages within several years of purchase etfs in contrast "give you the ability to get in and out quickly without a redemption fee " says james peterson vice president at the schwab center for investment research still jumping in and out of hot markets can be very risky its notoriously hard to predict which way the stock market will move in the short term and the cost of trading eats away at returns "people have this idea in mind that investing is finding a hot area and piling on " mr peterson adds "thats dangerous people follow returns and get in at just the wrong time " indexing appeal at least so far all etfs on the market are index funds that means they aim to replicate the returns of a benchmark such as in the stock arena the standard &amp poors stock index or indexes tracking a single industry or overseas market by contrast most conventional stock mutual funds which employ fund managers and teams of research analysts aim to pick stocks of attractive companies that will outperform their peers etf advocates like to tout the index orientation as one of the prime advantages of etfs picking winning stocks is difficult and because paying people to pick stocks is expensive and these costs reduce fund returns most mutual fund managers usually fail to outperform the stock market as a whole by comparison etfs costs are often razor thin allowing them to deliver returns almost equal to their benchmarks however while indexing certainly has its virtues etfs dont have a monopoly on that type of investing in fact there are plenty of mutual funds that follow the index model just like etfs so even if you are a firm believer in indexing you should compare etfs with traditional funds one thing to watch for in coming months or years is the possible advent of actively managed non index etfs much discussed these funds could dramatically expand the etf landscape but their arrival is by no means certain expenses and brokerage fees etfs typically boast low expenses compared with the average mutual fund but if you compare etfs against other index funds which also have low fees their advantages seem less dramatic for instance the largest etf on the market spdrs spy which tracks the s&amp p charges investors of assets a year in fees thats pretty impressive compared with the average stock mutual fund which levies an annual fee of but investors looking for cheap options among conventional index mutual funds can do pretty well too fidelity spartan index fund fsmkx for instance charges investors just annually moreover buying etfs involves extra costs that investors in index mutual funds can avoid because etfs are traded like regular stocks investors pay brokerage commissions whenever they trade shares these are the hidden costs of investing in etfs etf investors also face bid and ask spreads small differences between the prices at which market makers are willing to buy and sell conventional index funds can usually be bought directly from the fund companies without these expenses brokerage commissions to buy etfs can be small sometimes less than &# per trade and bid and ask spreads may be only pennies but over years and with compound interest magnifying the effects of lost returns these costs can add up making a difference of thousands of dollars etfs can be cheaper than conventional index funds for investors who have a big lump sum like an inheritance or proceeds from a property sale to invest but if you are making numerous small investments conventional index funds are typically a cheaper way to save for the long term tax advantages another thing etfs are known for is their tax advantages etfs use a different mechanism than conventional mutual funds to create shares when new investors want to buy into the fund and to eliminate shares when existing investors want to exit etfs unique workings allow them to avoid selling their stock holdings to pay departing investors avoiding sales which can prompt conventional funds to realize capital gains capital gains realized by the fund manager can lead to big capital gains distributions paid to investors which may in turn lead to tax bills for the investors who hang onto the fund again the advantage etfs enjoy in this area looks more dramatic when they are compared with the average mutual fund than with other index funds compared with mutual funds across the board "etfs live up to their billing" in terms of limiting the bite of the capital gains tax says morningstar analyst dan culloton but he notes some conventional index funds from well known vendors such as vanguard group tiaa cref and charles schwab can compete with and even outperform comparable etfs in terms of after tax returns targeted investing etfs are known for slicing the stock market into dozens of market niches allowing investors to buy baskets of all kinds of companies among the portfolios introduced in recent months are ones that own steel companies and foreign real estate concerns other etfs provide exposure to alternative assets like gold or foreign currency that can otherwise be hard for small investors to trade "etfs have gone farther down the food chain" than traditional index funds says tom lydon president of global trends investments a financial advisory firm in newport beach calif who uses etfs on behalf of his clients still not everyone is cheering the recent proliferation of niche etfs while advisers like mr lydon say a wide array of funds make it easier to own different types of investments and to ride trends in the stock market critics warn that main street investors are apt to misuse the funds by betting too heavily on narrow areas of the market that happen to be hot email forum sunday wsj com
