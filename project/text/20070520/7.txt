marketwatch prepare for changes in b plans thanks to increased scrutiny from the internal revenue service major changes are likely coming soon to b plans thats good and bad news for the teachers health care workers and other nonprofit employees who invest in such retirement plans with many b plans particularly at the k educational level and at smaller nonprofits employers dont manage the plan instead the employees deal directly with financial services companies often in face to face meetings with sales representatives to invest in fixed or variable annuities and mutual funds in some plans right now "if im a b employee im calling all the shots " says linda segal blinn a hartford conn based vice president of technical services at ing the financial services company in atlanta but under proposed irs rules expected to go into effect in january "there is really going to be a paradigm shift " ms blinn says plans will likely look and feel more like k plans which is already the case for many of the b s at colleges and some hospitals the irs wants employers to exert "more centralized control over the plans " says elaine immerman associate general counsel for tiaa cref in new york "the irs is looking for b s to be run more like qualified plans such as k s and theyre trying to do it through these regulations tiaa cref manages more than half of the assets in the &# billion b market according to cerulli associates a boston based consulting firm as nonprofit employers take on more responsibility for plan oversight they may limit investment choices and more closely track employees requests for loans and hardship distributions industry experts say "for employees who are used to doing all the decision making on their own its going to be a culture shock " ms blinn says overall about million workers are invested in b s according to cerulli associates "the old days of an employee being able to pull money out of their b because they want to buy a new car are coming to an end " says david blask a senior pension consultant with lincoln investment planning a b vendor in wyncote pa some "employees treated their b as a glorified savings account " some experts say the changes are good news for workers "when an employer is monitoring the plan keeping an eye on costs and fees monitoring investments and following a written plan that could make things better for participants " says tom modestino a senior analyst with cerulli associates but some changes may be less than popular one perk with many b plans is the so called transfer named after the number of the rule that allows participants to move their money to just about any b provider even those unassociated with their employer "you have the ability to move money out of a b at any time without having to consult with the school district and ask their permission " says scott dauenhauer a financial planner and president of meridian wealth management in laguna hills calif and co author of "the b wise guide " "you may have surrender charges that you pay but you have freedom " he adds but starting as early as january the new irs rules will likely restrict employees to investment options approved by their employer so "if you think theres a better investment option out there thats right for you " mr dauenhauer says "it would probably be a good idea to think about doing that now rather than later " but be sure to weigh the surrender charge and other costs before transferring money and be wary of sales agents urging transfers while it may make sense to switch to an investment option that charges lower fees and earns a better return sales agents may use the impending rule change to urge "people to move their money and churn them into something else " mr dauenhauer says also since the irs hasnt yet issued final regulations its hard to know how the rules will treat recent transfers only make a transfer if youre sure you can get a better investment elsewhere under the new regulations employers may restrict employees to a shorter list of approved b vendors "ive heard stories of school districts that forward contributions to different companies " mr blask says "those days will go " that could be a good thing though "where you have a district that is on the ball and looking out for their participants and a union looking out for their members you may have a good situation where the district and the union work together to put something together thats really good " mr dauenhauer says also employers are likely to hire vendors to administer the plan reducing employees meetings with salespeople investors may miss that one on one relationship but mr dauenhauer says that change too may be for the better in many b plans mr dauenhauer says "most people arent getting the quality of advice they deserve and yet theyre usually paying fairly high prices for it " and under the new rules it may take more time to process loans and hardship distributions as employers get involved "i dont think itll be more difficult in terms of approval " mr dauenhauer says but "it might take longer to get it done " to compare your plan offerings to others try bcompare com while its aimed at
