special report etfs what you need to know including the latest bond etfs exchange traded funds have been one of the hottest investments of the past five years proliferating into every nook and cranny of the fund world except that is for one type of investment bonds there are etfs that specialize in all different sizes of companies and styles of stocks including portfolios that narrowly slice the health care industry and even focus on the water business however in the past investors who wanted to add a fixed income etf to their portfolios found they had only a few choices that finally changed earlier this year so far in barclays global investors has added fixed income etfs to the six it already had in its ishares family last month vanguard group came out with its first four bond etf offerings those firms along with others like state street ameristock and bear stearns are planning to launch additional bond etfs soon according to regulatory filings for now there is a total of around &# billion in bond etfs that specialize in corporate bonds of different grades of credit quality treasurys of varying maturities and mortgage backed securities that tally is still a narrow slice of the total &# billion that state street says sits in the coffers of etfs but with these recent additions its now possible for investors to use etfs for every facet of their portfolios "these funds have helped fill in some of the gaps " says matt tucker head of fixed income investment solutions at barclays ishares operation but like everything about the red hot etf world investors must do their homework before jumping into one of these new fixed income funds after all they arent all built the same way there are big differences in the securities in their portfolios and in the fees they charge and investors shouldnt assume that bond etfs like stock etfs can be more tax efficient than traditional mutual funds ultimately in some cases investors might be better off with a traditional bond index mutual fund or an actively managed bond mutual fund that has a seasoned pro at the helm "im not that confident using etfs for fixed income " says brett darcy a director at cbiz financial solutions a wealth management firm in san diego "i still think there are really good managers out there who can beat the market " one important wrinkle to be aware of with the new bond etfs while many of them aim to track identical market benchmarks their holdings are sometimes quite different for instance both the vanguard total bond market etf bnd and the ishares lehman aggregate bond etf agg are pegged to the lehman brothers u s aggregate bond index a benchmark that includes bonds thats far more individual securities than in most stock market benchmarks and its not practical for bond index etfs or mutual funds to hold them all the vanguard etf which is just an additional share class of a long established index mutual fund holds issues the ishares product holds just bonds each firm says its approach is better "our funds are core holdings that offer a lot of diversification " says ken volpert head of vanguards bond indexing group barclays notes that many individual bond issues perform similarly which it says makes owning so many separate securities redundant and potentially costly to fund owners "many of these bonds share the same characteristics so you dont need to hold them all " says mr tucker of barclays the same scenario is apparent with other etfs in the vanguard and ishares families like their intermediate term bond offerings while tax efficiency is a key appeal of stock etfs investors should understand that that is not as big a factor when comparing bond etfs to bond mutual funds the unique underlying structure of etfs allows them to hold down capital gains distributions to investors thats important for stock investors since most of the return from stocks may come from capital gains when funds can delay distributing gains to investors taxable investors get to delay paying tax but when it comes to bond funds most of their payments to shareholders are derived from bond interest not capital gains that income is taxed the same way whether you own an etf or a bond mutual fund in weighing the bond etfs the deciding factor for investors may be fees the ishares lehman aggregate charges an annual expense ratio equal to of assets while vanguard which levies the same on a share class of its similar bond fund has chopped the fees for its etf version to that might not seem like a big gap but in the bond world where the separation between outperforming a benchmark and lagging it is very slim a advantage can make all the difference in comparing bond etfs to bond index mutual funds investors need to factor in the trading commissions theyll pay to buy or sell the etf shares as well as any transaction costs on the traditional funds meanwhile many advisers are shying away from indexed bond portfolios altogether and sticking with proven managers who charge higher fees but have earned that paycheck with above average performance for instance the loomis sayles bond fund managed by industry veteran dan fuss has posted an average annual return of during the past five years eight percentage points ahead of the lehman aggregate index performance like that if it continues is worth the fees
