rising rates to worsen subprime mess interest payments set to grow on &# billion in mortgages in the subprime mortgage crisis is poised to get much worse next year interest rates are set to rise or "reset" on &# billion worth of adjustable rate subprime mortgages according to data calculated by bank of america corp while many accounts portray resetting rates as the big factor behind the surge in home loan defaults and foreclosures this year that isnt quite the case many of the subprime mortgages that have driven up the default rate went bad in their first year or so well before their interest rate had a chance to go higher some of these mortgages went to speculators who planned to flip their houses others to borrowers who had stretched too far to make their payments and still others had some element of fraud now the real crest of the reset wave is coming and that promises more pain for borrowers lenders and wall street already many subprime lenders who focused on people with poor credit have gone bust big banks and investors who made subprime loans or bought securities backed by them are reporting billions of dollars in losses the reset peak will likely add to political pressure to help borrowers who cant afford to pay the higher interest rates the housing slowdown is emerging as an issue in both the presidential and congressional races for and the bush administration is pushing lenders to loosen terms and keep people from losing their homes banc of america securities a unit of the big charlotte n c bank estimates that &# billion in subprime mortgages are resetting during the current quarter and the same amount will reset in the first quarter of that will rise to a peak of &# billion in the second quarter the estimates include loans packaged into securities and held in bank portfolios larry litton jr chief executive of litton loan servicing says resetting of adjustable rate mortgages or arms has recently emerged as a bigger driver of defaults "the initial wave was largely driven by a higher frequency of fraudulent loans and loose underwriting " says mr litton whose company services loans nationwide "a much larger percentage of the defaults were seeing right now are the result of arm resets " more than half of the subprime delinquencies and foreclosures this year involved loans that hadnt yet reset and thus were due to factors such as weak underwriting and falling home prices according to rod dubitsky an analyst with credit suisse the majority of subprime arms due to reset next year are so called loans which carry a fixed rate for two years then adjust annually thereafter in a speech earlier this month federal reserve governor randall kroszner explained how a typical subprime loan issued in early might work he said the interest rate on the loan would start at then jump to after two years for a typical borrower that would add &# to the monthly payment besides the &# billion of subprime arms that are scheduled to reset during &# billion of other loans with adjustable rates are set to reset according to banc of america securities the other resetting loans include "jumbo" mortgages of more than &# and alt a loans a category between prime and subprime the latter category is the riskier in part because it includes borrowers who provided little or no documentation of their income or assets the number of borrowers facing higher payments isnt growing merely because the amount of loans with resets is higher another factor is that those with a looming reset now have a tougher time sidestepping it by refinancing or selling their home "there is a large amount of borrowers who are in products that either no longer exist or that they no longer qualify for " says banc of america securities analyst robert lacoursiere falling home prices mean that many borrowers have little or no equity in their home making it tougher for them to get out from under their loans treasury secretary henry paulson and the chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp sheila bair have been pressing lenders to modify terms in a sweeping way rather than going through a time consuming case by case evaluation that could end up pushing many people into foreclosure officials at the federal reserve and in the bush administration have estimated that mortgages are resetting a month ms bair has proposed that mortgage companies freeze the interest rates on some two million mortgages at the rate before the reset to help borrowers avoid trouble "keep it at the starter rate " ms bair said at conference last month "convert it into a fixed rate make it permanent and get on with it " picking up on that theme california governor arnold schwarzenegger in the past week announced an agreement with four major loan servicers including countrywide financial corp the nations biggest mortgage lender to freeze the interest rates on certain arms that are resetting the freeze would be temporary rather than for the life of the loan the program is aimed at borrowers who are living in their homes and making their mortgage payments on time but arent expected to be able to make the higher payments after reset the mortgage industry opposes a blanket move to modify loans that are resetting says doug duncan chief economist of the mortgage bankers association while modification may make sense in some cases he says it may also simply postpone the inevitable or reward borrowers who didnt manage their finances wisely mr duncan says the industry is working with government officials and consumer groups to develop principles that could be used to determine quickly who qualifies for a modified loan the political efforts are aimed at keeping the u s economy out of a housing triggered recession the mortgage bankers association estimates that million homes will enter the foreclosure process this year and another million in up from in the projected supply of foreclosed homes is equal to about of existing home sales and could add four months to the supply of existing homes says dale westhoff a senior managing director at bear stearns this is a "fundamental shift" in the housing supply says mr westhoff who believes that home prices will drop further as lenders "mark to market" repossessed homes foreclosed homes typically sell at a discount of to compared to the sale of an owner occupied home analysts say lenders are eager to unload the properties and the homes tend to be in poorer condition "people didnt leave the house happily " says jason bosch a broker with home center realty in norco calif "there are often signs of that theres used dirty carpet the grass is dead " mr bosch says he now has about bank owned properties for sale or in escrow compared with none a year ago federal reserve chairman ben bernanke told congress earlier this month "a sharp increase in foreclosed properties for sale could weaken the already struggling housing market and thus potentially the broader economy " the big concern is a vicious cycle in which foreclosures push down home prices making it more difficult for borrowers to refinance and causing more defaults and foreclosures real estate agents who look at prices for comparable homes or comps say the sale of bank owned properties can have a big impact "one month the comps are showing one price and then a bank comes in and sells a property for &# less " says randal gibson a real estate agent in henderson nev "all of the sudden thats the new comp it hurts everyone in the neighborhood "
