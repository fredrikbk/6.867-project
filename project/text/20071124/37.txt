politics &amp economics kurdish rivalries play out on cellphones providers battle soon to ease points to underlying lack of unity in iraq region suleimaniah iraq like many iraqi kurds kawa hassan must carry two mobile phones one is for staying connected in this kurdish city where he runs an art gallery the other is for talking to his girlfriend in erbil the capital of iraqi kurdistan miles to the north customers of the two kurdish networks can call the rest of iraq and abroad but they cant call each other the two companies korek telecom and asiacell telecom have fought hard to keep it that way they split iraqs autonomous kurdish enclave into two hostile cellular ministates damaging the notion of kurdish unity trumpeted by the regions leaders with u s backing in the s iraqi kurdistan won self rule from baghdad soon after civil war broke out between the two dominant kurdish factions they have since declared an end to their old rivalries and formed a joint government but the two parties are still reluctant to relinquish much control there are two defense ministers two interior ministers and two finance ministers "when they speak of a unified kurdistan it is a big lie " says asos hardi a newspaper editor in suleimaniah nowhere is the division more jarring than in cellphone service at the offices of iraqi airways here managers can sell tickets to flights leaving only from suleimaniah not from erbil the reason they cant reach their colleagues by mobile phone the preferred means of communication in a country with bad fixed lines the split stems directly from the rivalry between the two kurdish parties the patriotic union of kurdistan puk led by iraqi president jalal talabani and the kurdistan democratic party kdp led by massoud barzani who is president of the kurdish region both fostered rival carriers when cellphones first came to kurdistan for years asiacell and korek wouldnt connect calls between the two networks and wouldnt allow each other roaming rights korek has been pressing asiacell for a roaming deal but asiacell says its license from baghdad bans the company from allowing unlicensed operators to roam on its network the kurds are unlikely trailblazers of the iraqi cellphone market in the s when mobile phones were unheard of in iraq kurdish businessman faruk mustafa rasool began smuggling components of a cellular network across the mountains into kurdistan crates carrying switches were intentionally mislabeled to fool the customs of the neighboring countries who were enforcing a trade embargo against saddam husseins regime "nobody believed i would succeed " mr rasool recalls the ragtag operation would eventually grow to become asiacell making mr rasool one of the regions richest men the son of an imam mr rasool had an unconventional career for years he lived in the mountains with kurdish guerrillas battling mr husseins army he joined the communist party and says he was considered leftist even by his party comrades "in the old days we didnt believe in money as motivation " he recalls that changed when mr rasool fed up with politics went into business in the late s he brought automated slaughterhouses to kurdistan and dabbled in construction his cellphone business was supported by the puk the kurdish party that controls suleimaniah "it was very important to build a connection between ourselves and the rest of the world " recalls noshirwan mustafa amin a former member of puks leadership to reward mr rasool for his risky venture the puk gave him an exclusive license to operate in suleimaniah the city under the partys control puk members also took a stake in asiacell though exactly how much remains in dispute u s officials believe the puk may control as much as of asiacell while mr rasool says puk members own no more than of the company across a mountain ridge in erbil the city under control of the rival kdp a similar experiment was taking root there a nephew of kdp leader massoud barzani was also starting a cellular service he named it korek after a famous kurdish mountain keeping the cellphone signal alive in the rugged mountains was a huge challenge that required dotting the landscape with extra towers kdp gave korek a monopoly to operate in erbil and another kurdish province under the partys control asiacells mr rasool says he helped korek procure the cellular technology and insists asiacell was the first service provider in iraq korek officials dispute the account and say korek was the true pioneer both companies continue to claim to be first in their promotional materials after mr hussein was toppled in the u s occupation authorities granted three mobile licenses to cover iraq as the only two incumbent operators asiacell and korek both wanted a license asiacell prevailed an outcome that has left korek bitter to this day the other two companies that won licenses are iraqna a unit of egypts orascom telecom holding and mtc atheer part of kuwaits mtc group armed with the national license mr rasool took asiacell national its service is now available in baghdad and other cities asiacell built towers in erbil too thinking its national license would allow it to operate anywhere in iraq mr rasool dispatched othman faraj to serve as his representative in erbil the two had met in the s when both were running chicken slaughterhouses mr faraj set up shop behind a grimy red sign reading "asia telecom " on oct he flipped a switch and asiacells signal went live within four hours the local ministry of communications dispatched two police officers who escorted mr faraj to the control room and asked him to turn the signal off "they set up towers without permission and kept trying to switch them on " says nawzad junde koreks managing director the local communications ministry says asiacell cant operate in erbil because it doesnt have a local license korek itself has strayed from its home turf last year the company plunked down a tower in baghdads international zone korek also has been trying to make inroads on asiacells home turf there a small company called sanatel had challenged asiacells monopoly only to face intense pressure from asiacell in local courts in korek struck a roaming deal with sanatel which gave korek a foothold in suleimaniah like many others mr hassan the art gallery manager signed up with sanatel so he could reach his girlfriend in erbil asiacell was outraged a few months ago plainclothes gunmen showed up at one of sanatels towers attacked the guards and turned off the signal says rebwar khan a sanatel manager mr khan is convinced asiacell was behind the attack asiacell denies it was involved "we dont have gunmen " mr rasool says in august iraqs central government auctioned off three new national licenses with neither prepared to lose asiacell and korek helped bid up the price to a mammoth &# billion and snatched two of the permits the third went to the kuwaiti operator mtc atheer iraqna withdrew from the bidding the license terms obligated the kurdish companies to hold talks on connecting their long divided networks they hope to link their systems on saturday a breakthrough eagerly awaited by their customers on a recent day in his art gallery mr hassan fumbled with his two handsets and complained about the petty rivalry to stay in touch with his girlfriend he had to buy a second phone and pay new subscription charges which puts a big dent in his monthly income of &# in carving up kurdistan he says "the companies didnt take the interests of the people into consideration "
