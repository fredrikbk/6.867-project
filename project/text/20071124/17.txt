ethanols bottom line to hear the candidates tell it especially those on the stump in iowa ethanol is the answer to americas energy security woes and back in washington politicians since have been putting your money where their mouths are ethanol is currently subsidized to the tune of cents per gallon when blended with gasoline to make sure foreigners dont share the ride on the ethanol gravy train moreover congress has imposed a cent tariff on imported ethanol president bush for his part has targeted a reduction in gasoline use mostly by substituting the renewable fuel farmers and refiners remain bullish on ethanol even though market prices have dipped in recent months and domestic production capacity will nearly double once refineries now under construction come on line yet in all the decades ethanol has been subsidized washington has never rigorously applied cost benefit analysis to ethanols myriad preferences a study i authored with caroline cecot just released by the aei brookings joint center attempts to fill that gap the results based on a recent environmental protection agency report on the economics of mandating the production of alternative fuels strongly suggest that that the case for ethanol is lacking we used epa numbers to calculate the environmental benefits of ethanol along with the security benefits linked to its potential to reduce oil imports we then compared these benefits with the direct costs of producing and distributing ethanol the environmental costs associated with its manufacture and combustion and the cost of the slew of incentives offered to refiners and corn farmers if annual production increases by three billion gallons in a plausibly modest number when the epa made its own calculations we estimate that the costs will exceed the benefits by about &# billion a year if domestic production reaches the more "optimistic" energy department projection for that year net economic costs would likely top &# billion annually our analysis is deliberately weighted to give ethanol the benefit of a doubt for example we assume that on balance ethanol from corn reduces greenhouse emissions even though recent science suggests that substituting ethanol for gasoline might actually have a negative impact it increases emissions of nitrous oxide a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide ethanol distilled from grasses and waste materials has a better environmental payoff but has much higher direct production costs even if ways are found to make alcohol cost effectively from otherwise worthless sources of carbon the process would undermine local air quality as it slowed global warming though ethanol is likely to reduce tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide and toxic hydrocarbons including benzene and formaldehyde the extra nitrogen oxides react in sunlight to form smog the picture on the energy side is a little brighter for each barrel of oil displaced by ethanol there are benefits in the form of slightly lower oil prices and reduced potential for economic dislocation from oil price spikes we estimate these to be in the neighborhood of &# million annually in but the emphasis here should be on the word "little " in the ethanol program used about of u s corn supplies but displaced less than of gasoline use even if all corn produced in the u s were devoted to distilling ethanol the renewable fuel would amount to about of the gasoline demand in and the more corn used to make alcohol the greater the potential for collateral damage beef producers not to mention mexicos tortilla makers are already upset with high corn prices environmentalists too seem to be waking up to the fact that ethanol from corn is no panacea this growing opposition could open the door to a midcourse correction in congresss commitment to preferences for corn based alcohol the first order of business ax the tax credit and the tariff on imported ethanol instead direct funds to research that might make a real difference in energy security and or climate change such as geoengineering the atmosphere to block solar radiation or converting biomass to electricity on a large scale congress should also begin using emissions taxes or market based incentives to drive private innovation if the tax route is taken the revenue should enable equivalent reductions of efficiency draining taxes such as the payroll tax congress might never have bet so much of the taxpayers money on corn based ethanol if an unbiased accounting of the consequences had been available early on we could use a separate agency shielded in part from political considerations whose sole mission would be to analyze the costs and benefits of regulations and government programs without such an agency interest group logrolling will continue to trump science and economics in major policy choices mr hahn is executive director of the aei brookings joint center and was co chair of the u s alternative fuels council under president george h w bush
