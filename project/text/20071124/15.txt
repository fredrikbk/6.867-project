cross country race and crime in new orleans new orleans it was a little after last saturday afternoon when they carried the body of new orleans police officer thelonious "tank" dukes out of the st peter claver catholic church in the citys sixth ward just outside of the historic french quarter dukes had been shot twice in a gun battle in october that erupted after would be thieves broke into his home in eastern new orleans he hung on for weeks but succumbed becoming the citys th homicide victim this year and making new orleans one of the most dangerous cities in america unlike most murder victims dukes a year veteran of the force was buried in front of hundreds of mourners and with honors that included a flag draped casket and a gun salute his case was unusual in another respect the day before the shooting year old elton phillips an early suspect in the case briefly took refuge in the home of the citys top crime fighter district attorney eddie jordan according to police reports mr phillips a friend of mr jordans girlfriend went to the das house after allegedly committing another armed robbery mr jordan has said he didnt know then that mr phillips who has not been charged in the dukes murder was on the lam but the incident came after a long string of failures within the das office that led to mr jordans resignation late last month in recent years mr jordan the citys first african american da headed an office that repeatedly released violent criminals onto the streets because it was unable to prepare indictments within the day period mandated by state law that issue seemed to come to a head in june when in short order mr jordan dropped murder charges against david bonds a suspect in the murder of dinerral shavers a popular local teacher and jazz musician and michael anderson the chief suspect in the murder of five teenagers in both cases mr jordan cited a lack of cooperative witnesses as the reason for releasing the suspects the police disputed the claim and quickly found people willing to testify who were apparently overlooked by the da murder charges have since been refiled in both cases for many critics the disarray in the das office can be traced to a decision mr jordan made shortly after being elected to a six year term in during the campaign mr jordan pledged to make the das office look "more like new orleans " code words many assumed for hiring more black staffers and attorneys using a "cultural diversity report" compiled by his transition team mr jordan proceeded to systematically fire veteran white staffers and replace them with african americans with little or no experience a later analysis showed that after about two months in office mr jordan altered the racial composition of the staff going to whites and blacks from whites and blacks among the staffers who were fired were white two were black and one was hispanic among the case investigators fired many retired police detectives all were white the committee making firing recommendations for mr jordan was run by stephanie butler an aide to louisiana rep william jefferson this is the congressman who drew national attention when federal agents found &# in his freezer which led to his indictment this year on bribery and obstruction of justice charges mr jefferson has pleaded not guilty when challenged in court mr jordan claimed the firings were "random " with no intentional racial component they were he said part of the standard turnover officials are entitled to make under the patronage system but in a federal jury disagreed finding that of the fired workers had been let go solely because of their race in violation of title vii of the civil rights act the jury awarded them close to &# million which ballooned with interest and attorneys fees to about &# million more than the das annual budget following mr jordans resignation attorneys for the plaintiffs seized the da offices bank accounts and threatened to foreclose on all its property to satisfy the judgment that threat prompted city and state leaders who for months had refused to negotiate to pony up &# million earlier this week to settle the case the majority of the payment requires the approval of some key state legislators who are usually hostile to anything that involves spending money to bail new orleans out of a jam after katrina it was hoped that state and city leaders would put aside their traditional chicanery to lead the recovery effort instead exactly the opposite happened in addition to mr jeffersons indictment and mr jordans resignation oliver thomas the popular head of the new orleans city council was indicted and pleaded guilty to taking bribes in july mayor ray nagin who managed to win a second term despite shoddy performance in response to katrina continues to be ineffective he makes news mostly by sticking his foot in his mouth such as when he said the citys soaring crime rate "kept the new orleans brand out there " nevertheless despite the crime corruption and incompetence demographic data released earlier this month reveal that new orleans is getting a second lease on life the citys population is rebounding growing between october of last year and this year it stands at just under two thirds of the pre katrina levels with the recent election of a new governor year old bobby jindal and new blood on the city council theres hope that maybe things have touched bottom of course as anyone who grew up near the louisiana bayous can tell you its often about the time you think youve touched bottom that you start sinking into the mud mr
