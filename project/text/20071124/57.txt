the buzz marketwatch weekend investor novastar offered early clues to looming mortgage tumult now that we know what we should have been looking for it is easy to spot signs that the mortgage morass was occurring long before it actually happened some warnings were more obvious than others even if they went unheeded take for example the matter of insurance at novastar financial once one of the leading independent subprime mortgage lenders in its heyday as its stock was spiraling higher with a dividend yield exceeding insurance was a big part of the novastar story it was so big that whenever i would raise red flags over its business which i often did investors would pepper me with emails that said the company couldnt lose because its loans were insured but that assumed its loans were done properly if they werent according to the fine print in novastars regulatory filings the insurers didnt have to pay on any claims that was boilerplate of course but sometimes boilerplate is there for a reason as it turns out as far back as insurer pmi started refusing to pay on claims on novastar loans that had defaulted that in retrospect was the first of three insurance related matters that should have been a clue that the mortgage industry was starting to spin out of control the second was that novastar started reducing the amount of insurance it bought claiming that it decided to self insure by taking more risk as prices of mortgage insurance started to rise rising prices by themselves should have been a sign of looming trouble insurers only raise prices as they perceive higher risk third pmi started curtailing its subprime coverage among the reasons it said were that routine audits had resulted in a "meaningful" amount of claims on defaulted loans that were denied novastar responded by suing pmi over the unpaid claims this was the first time the company said on an earnings call that it had sued an insurer but as the mortgage market heated up and the appetite for pools of subprime loans seemed to become increasingly insatiable concerns about insurance or a lack thereof were soon forgotten yet pmi didnt let the matter rest in denying the claims according to court records it cited material errors and omissions in loan origination documents it went so far as to blame novastars "own unclean hands " furthermore pmi said it had been under the impression that the subprime mortgage lender "would use the income stated on a borrowers loan application to qualify the borrower for a stated income loan " according to pmi that isnt what happened and in a deposition according to court papers novastar president lance anderson testified that novastar didnt use incomes stated on the applications to qualify borrowers instead according to the deposition mr anderson said if the income "seems reasonable then were comfortable not verifying it and not using it in our underwriting decision " still novastar denied making any misrepresentations and in the two quietly settled their differences just as the mortgage market was peaking by then pmi had stopped doing business with novastar altogether instead limiting most of its subprime coverage to countrywide financial which was expanding its own subprime business pmi however says it still limited the amount of subprime loans it would cover as we all know now the kind of charges pmi made against novastar appear to have been rampant throughout the industry die hard investors in novastar meanwhile could have avoided losses had they paid attention to the clues which were either missed or simply ignored they were blinded no doubt by the stock and dividend the stock which traded at a high of &# in reflecting a for stock split last july closed friday on the new york stock exchange at &# its dividend has since been discontinued and in its most recently quarterly financial filing novastar for the first time discussed that unless it gets a reprieve from its main lender wachovia bank a bankruptcy filing is a possibility adding insult to injury it also recently warned that it is likely to get booted off the nyse to the otc bulletin board a fitting end it would seem to a part of history that many homeowners and novastars investors would like to forget novastar declined to comment herb greenberg marketwatch senior columnist doesnt own stocks except his employers nor sell individual stocks short or invest in hedge funds marketwatch is a unit of wall street journal publisher dow jones email hgreenberg marketwatch com
