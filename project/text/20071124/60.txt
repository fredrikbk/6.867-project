weekend journal books a psychic detective of another sort the gold leaf lady and other parapsychological investigations by stephen e braude university of chicago pages &# the world of the paranormal is such a magnet for hustlers and charlatans that any book on the subject might seem at first like just another attempt to separate the curious or the desperate from their cash but "the gold leaf lady and other parapsychological investigations" is not a memoir from "miss cleo" of number fame or advice from "cold reading" specialist john edward on how best to contact your late aunt sophie it is a strange work by stephen e braude a philosophy professor at the university of maryland who believes in the existence of paranormal abilities in human beings but who also thank goodness goes out of his way to address the concerns of skeptics and to shoot down fakers who populate the field the paranormal for mr braude includes the possibility of "postmortem communications" and extrasensory perception but he is primarily interested in psychokinesis he writes because examples of the minds power over matter is "observable" and "at least potentially easier to document" and presumably to debunk mr braude does some of both in considering the five case studies that form the heart of "the gold leaf lady " among them is the case of ted serios a former chicago bellboy who became a hit as a cultural oddity in the s with his seeming ability to produce images on polaroid film by using a rolled up piece of cardboard he called a "gismo" to channel psychic energy into the camera photographer nile root who witnessed mr serios perform his "thoughtography" in later outlined a strong case against him mr root who died in concluded that mr serios was a faker whose notorious drinking problem was an excuse to behave erratically distracting observers from his surreptitious insertion of an image into the gismo an image that the camera would then reproduce mr root even described just how to produce similar "thoughtographs" on ones own mr braude acknowledges that mr serios "preferred to work in a state of considerable inebriation" and his behavior "fueled the skepticism of some critics " but the author is not among the doubters after studying records of mr serioss efforts interviewing a doctor who worked with him and then having a thoughtography session with the man himself three decades after his supposed abilities had gone into decline mr braude proclaims mr serios "a rich and undeniably important case " and he decries "many years of misrepresentation and dishonest criticism" of mr serios saying he hopes that one day "the truth will out " luckily for readers on the skeptical side mr braude is much less forgiving of joey nuzum were treated to a blow by blow takedown of mr nuzum a magician who said he also had the psychokinetic ability to move objects using just the power of his mind mr braude recounts how in the mid s the magician repeatedly frustrated the authors attempts to test his claims the deadpan narrative has the unintentionally comic tone of a police procedural set in paranormalville "i obtained a catalog called amazing and fascinating devices on page of which i found an ad for a device called a telekinetic enhancer " mr braude writes describing how he figured out that mr nuzum was probably using a magicians trick involving static electricity to perform his feat of making a dollar bill spin on a needle without being touched the nuzum affair ends when the magician whose supporters see nothing amiss in his hostility to close monitoring melodramatically blows off a test session accusing mr braude of destroying his concentration by trying to inspect mr nuzums props "joe is an unreliable subject " a dismayed mr braude concludes one of the most telling criticisms of practitioners of the paranormal is that they apparently cant find a way to profit from their talents celebrity psychics thanks to a credulous public are the exception to the rule for instance katie the "gold leaf lady" for whom the book is named claims a variety of paranormal talents most prominently the ability to manifest golden foil through her skin mr braude says that he saw it happen researchers at johns hopkins who tested the bits of foil for him concluded that the material closely resembled commercially available brass leaf and lost interest in the case a reaction he calls "unwarranted " the florida housewife also uses her psychic abilities to help solve crimes including the theft of &# in jewelry the author reports but katie herself cant afford expensive jewelry she lives in modest circumstances mr braudes own wife gina also possesses uncanny abilities he tells us yet she apparently has not put the couple on easy street either in the books last chapter "some thoughts on astrology " mr braude describes ginas zodiacal powers born in yugoslavia where she taught psychology for years at the university of novi sad according to the author gina had a sideline as "psychologist astrologer for several european soccer teams and another team in china" who valued her ability to "make accurate and specific predictions about forthcoming games " she also worked with the serbian mafia "primarily doing economic forecasting for their black market business not their drug business " he writes thats all very nice but a question looms for gina just as it does for every other alleged psychic astrologer or seer if you want us to believe why dont you place a big bet on the outcome of the super bowl and show us your winnings mr desio is a free lance writer whose work has appeared in the village voice new york press and the new york sun
