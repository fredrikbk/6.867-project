to oppose chavez youth in caracas rally behind stalin thats ivan stalin gonzalez student movement leader a broad dissent on campus caracas venezuela as venezuelan president hugo chavez attempts to push through what he calls st century socialism his biggest obstacle is an army of students led by a leftist named stalin ivan stalin gonzalez who prefers to be called just plain stalin is president of the student body at the central university of venezuela or ucv venezuelas biggest public university during the past few weeks mr gonzalez and other student leaders here have organized protest marches by tens of thousands of students opposed to a constitutional referendum set for dec the proposed changes would dramatically expand mr chavezs power and allow him to seek perpetual re election "historically students have represented the hope and conscience of venezuela " says mr gonzalez who unlike his bushy moustached and sinister mannered soviet namesake is scruffy bearded and laid back the student movement has taken the government by surprise highlighting an embarrassing irony for the fiery mr chavez university students long a bastion of the left here as in the rest of latin america are overwhelmingly opposed to him they have also emerged along with the catholic church as among the last major opposition to mr chavez in a country where he already controls the congress courts army and most media outlets elia lopez a year old architecture student at ucv worries that by the time she is designing buildings the only client will be the state limiting her creativity "imagine if you studied to do something creative and suddenly you couldnt do it or you could do it only if your ideas were the same as the government " she said variations of that concern are almost universal among venezuelas university students whether they are majoring in sociology dentistry or law in a ucv campus election that became national news in mid november anti chavez student slates won of the vote mr chavezs student supporters garnered students like mr gonzalez have traditionally played an outsized role in latin americas turbulent politics in the s university of havana students led a struggle against cuban dictator fulgencio batista fidel castro who forced mr batista from power and who is mr chavezs revered mentor got his start as a student leader at the university in mexico a massacre of students and other protestors in helped inspire the creation of half a dozen small guerilla groups in the s and in venezuela ucv holds an important place in political history in a student strike that began here eventually led to the downfall of dictator marcos perez jimenez half a century later many venezuelans hope mr chavez will meet his political stalingrad at ucv "student struggles have always preceded great historical changes " says fernando ochoa a former defense minister who was jailed when he participated in the strike as a high school student the sprawling ucv campus shows the scars of battles between pro and anti chavez students earlier this month involving stones homemade bombs and gunfire the law schools student center room a base for chavez supporters still smells of charred wood and plastic from a fire that recently destroyed it workmen are still cleaning up the school of social work there pro chavez students barricaded themselves for several hours during a standoff with a crowd of students until a group of armed civilians on motorcycles intervened to allow the chavez supporters to escape on a recent day the student radio station that plays constantly from speakers around the campus augmented the usual salsa tunes with student movement classics such as "age of aquarius" from the musical "hair " protest marches although sometimes met with violence by police have been generally marked by whimsy and wit taking to the streets students have thrust their palms up in the air the idea they are a peaceful movement bearing no weapons this week at a student press conference a tortoise bearing the initials of venezuelas supreme court crept across a table while students complained that the court had been slow to take up their challenge to the proposed constitutional changes the court rejected the students request to delay the referendum to give citizens more time to study the proposals anti chavez sentiment on venezuelan campuses burst into the open in may when the government pulled the plug on rctv a television network critical of mr chavez tens of thousands of students viewed the move as a blow to freedom of speech they were also alarmed by mr chavezs promises that the "revolution within the university" would be next likely expanding government control over areas like the curriculum they took to the streets creating a protest movement in campuses across the country the dec referendum has sparked a round of new protests caught off guard mr chavez has called the students "terrorists" and written them off as "pampered rich mamas boys " ucv which charges no tuition has a range of students from the scions of businessmen to the sons of taxi drivers mr chavezs description also hardly fits mr gonzalez the year old sixth year law student grew up in a poor household that dreamed of a communist venezuela his father a print machine operator was a high ranking member of the bandera roja or red flag a hard line marxist leninist party that maintained a guerrilla force until as recently as the mid s its members revered josef stalin as well as albanias xenophobic enver hoxha as a boy mr gonzalez remembers packing off to marches with his sisters dolores engels and ilyich named in honor of vladimir ilyich lenin as a young man mr gonzalez burnished his leftist credentials joining marxist youth groups and following his father into the bandera roja he traveled to socialist youth conferences in latin america mr gonzalez was still in his teens when mr chavez was voted into office in late even then he says he was skeptical about mr chavezs socialist rhetoric as are many venezuelan leftists mr chavez a lieutenant colonel who had staged an unsuccessful coup attempt in would be more authoritarian than egalitarian mr gonzalez reasoned he says his suspicions were confirmed when mr chavez started forming the "bolivarian circles" of civilian supporters some of which turned into armed gangs used to break up opposition gatherings "military men belong in the barracks " he said still seeking to make a life out of left wing politics mr gonzalez enrolled in at ucv rising in the ranks of the student body can be a fast track into political life and as head of the member student federation his studies have taken a back seat to politics he plans to graduate next year even before the recent marches mr gonzalez took positions on venezuela that set him apart from other leftists in organizers of a conference for young socialists in guadalajara mexico jumped him to the top of the speakers list "i think they saw my name ivan stalin from venezuela and put me first " he says they regretted the move he says speaking about a coup attempt against mr chavez the year before mr gonzalez pointed out that mr chavez had been reinstated by generals in the military not by a popular protest of supporters as the audience seemed to think "after i spoke the place went nuts all the cubans were lining up to denounce me " mr gonzalez says he says he wasnt invited to the groups meeting this year in quito ecuador for all his disappointment with mr chavezs brand of leftism mr gonzalez still holds a candle for his revolutionary heroes he has a signed copy of a seven hour speech fidel castro delivered at the university several years ago "i never got bored " he says he also hasnt totally broken with his namesake who was responsible for the deaths of millions "of course theres the murder and repression " he says but the soviet leader defeated hitler he says and propagated ideas of fairness and sharing that inspired the left in subsequent decades "he was important for publicizing some important ideas "
