scandalette attorney general michael mukasey has been on the job for a week and one of his first decisions strikes us as a deft political effort to improve justice department morale on monday u s attorney for minnesota rachel paulose announced she is resigning to become counselor in the departments office of legal policy the move takes ms paulose out of the line of fire in minneapolis where some career attorneys had rebelled against her management style relative youth at years old and washington pedigree her decision also gives democrats one less whip with which to keep flogging the political nag known as the u s attorneys "scandal " ms paulose had no role in the attorneys controversy having been appointed to fill a vacancy months before the dismissal of eight prosecutors last december but that didnt stop her critics from using the headlines to attack her not long after the u s attorneys story broke three of her deputies resigned their management posts in a coordinated protest most of the criticism against ms paulose amounted to the accusation that she can be a difficult boss if thats a hanging offense most of congress would be out of a job its also alleged that ms paulose "mishandled" classified documents and that she called a black woman in her office "fat and lazy " yet the employee who was supposedly insulted never filed an adverse report against her boss and ms paulose has said she self reported the documents incident to the justice department meanwhile the accuser who claimed to have been "demoted" in retaliation for making the charges was one of the three who had publicly resigned in protest in sum ms paulose seems to have been an innocent political bystander who got drawn into a classic beltway bloodletting congress wanted to take some public hostages the media played up the fight the career staff took the chance to trash a political appointee they dont like and a scandalette was born it would be a scandal of its own if ms paulose lost her job in these circumstances and her transfer allows her to stay at justice if she wants to the office of legal policy advises the attorney general on a variety of public policy matters and mr mukasey will presumably have a chance to judge ms pauloses capacities for himself as for replacing ms paulose in minnesota the ag ought to send that office someone wholl take no grief and clean out the whiners
