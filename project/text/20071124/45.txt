rivalry bigger than civil war its football midwest sports fans are grateful that a national newspaper like the journal finally gives front page coverage to the big football conference "the new powers in college football carry old baggage " nov it was disappointing however to see the story twisted to indicate that the rivalry harkens back to the civil war as missouris great former quarterback corby jones said "its a football game not a war " from my dad captain of the football tigers i learned about football m u loyalty and the rivalry with kansas dads family fought on the union side but civil war relics never figured in the fact that these two schools have long played each other in football and done so with great intensity this years game features two fine teams of great athletes that are very well coached tune in for the border showdown and see top flight exciting big football not a civil war replay and expect mizzou to win sen christopher "kit" bond r mo mexico mo your article was superb i grew up on the kansas side about miles from the border had an abolitionist great grandfather who was kidnapped in the s by "border ruffians" from missouri and rescued by the u s cavalry and yet i never could understand why my otherwise normal father hated people from missouri the way he did i apparently inherited some of his prejudice my son chicago born and bred and daughter in law recently moved from the missouri side to the kansas side of kansas city for objective reasons and my first reaction was "thank god my granddaughters are now officially kansans " bill schwartz nashville tenn this game is always a rivalry i have degrees from both schools and this game can make or break either of these schools seasons it is wonderful that they are both playing for such high stakes this year if one or the other fails to prevail against the big south winner we can only hope the big winner will play for the national title the ugliness you report surely is only being dug up in the bars in kansas city both schools are too deep in tradition to get mired in such out dated notions john e mcelhiney denver and we call other nations tribal andrea whitmore fairway kan
