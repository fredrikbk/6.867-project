hot topic guns and the constitution in recent decades the supreme court has discovered any number of new rights not in the explicit text of the constitution now it has the opportunity to validate a right that resides in plain sight "the right of the people to keep and bear arms" in the second amendment this week the supreme court agreed to hear the case of district of columbia v heller in march the court of appeals for the d c circuit declared unconstitutional the districts near total ban on handgun possession that ruling written by judge laurence silberman found that when the second amendment spoke of the "right of the people " it meant the right of "individuals " and not some "collective right" held only by state governments or the national guard that stirring conclusion was enough to prompt the d c government to declare judge silberman outside "the mainstream of american jurisprudence" in its petition to the supreme court weve certainly come to an interesting legal place if asserting principles that appear nowhere in the constitution is considered normal but its beyond the pale to interpret the words that are in the constitution to mean what they say however it is true that despite our vitriolic policy fights over gun control the supreme court has rarely ruled on the second amendment the court last spoke in detail in in u s v miller involving a bootlegger who claimed the right to transport an unregistered sawed off shotgun across state lines that opinion was sufficiently complicated that both sides now claim it as a precedent the dispute arises from the first four words of the second amendment the full text of which reads "a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed " if the first two clauses were omitted there would be no room for ambiguity but part of the legal controversy has centered around what a "well regulated militia" means judge silbermans opinion argued with convincing historical evidence that the "militia" the framers had in mind was not the national guard of the present but referred to all able bodied male citizens who might be called upon to defend their country the notion that the average american urbanite might today go to his gun locker grab his rifle and sidearm and rush minuteman like to his nations defense might seem quaint but at stake is whether the "militia" of the second amendment is some small discreet group of people acting under government control or all of us the phrase "the right of the people" or some variation of it appears repeatedly in the bill of rights and nowhere does it actually mean "the right of the government " when the bill of rights was written and adopted the rights that mattered politically were of one sort an individuals or a minoritys right to be free from interference from the state today rights are most often thought of as an entitlement to receive something from the state as opposed to a freedom from interference by the state the second amendment is in our view clearly a right of the latter sort as a practical matter on the court the outcome in d c v heller might well be decided by one man anthony kennedy the most protean of justices however in recent years he has also been one of the most aggressive justices in asserting any number of other rights to justify his opinions on various social issues it would seriously harm the courts credibility if justice kennedy and the courts liberal wing now turned around and declared the right "to keep and bear arms" a dead letter because it didnt comport with their current policy views on gun control this potential contradiction may explain why no less a liberal legal theorist than harvards laurence tribe has come around to an "individual rights" understanding of the second amendment by the way a victory for gun rights in heller would not ban all gun regulation any more than the courts support for the first amendment bars every restraint on free speech the supreme court has allowed limits on speech inciting violence or disrupting civil order in the same way a judgment that the second amendment is an individual right could allow reasonable limits on gun use such as to protect public safety heres hoping the justices will put aside todays gun control passions and look to the plain language of the bill of rights for instruction in this case as judge silberman had the courage to do
