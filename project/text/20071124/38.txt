politics &amp economics pauls supporters clash with media early halloween morning "taco john" posted a message board call to arms "baltimore sun hit piece take action now " the papers political blog had an item marveling at how republican presidential candidate ron paul had raised more money than "better known mike huckabee who is taken more seriously " taco john took to an internet forum frequented by paul supporters providing a link to the offending item as well as phone and email information for the newspapers public editor and advertising department "theyre trying to pigeonhole us " he wrote "if we dont fight back theyll keep doing it " taco john the online moniker of isaac lopez a year old technology marketer in vancouver wash is one of many cyber soldiers for dr paul the texas congressman gynecologist and vociferous opponent of the iraq war the paul brigade has largely drawn attention for its fund raising prowess raising a record &# million online in a single day in november and leaving the year old politician with more cash on hand than several rivals and a &# million tv ad budget for new hampshire but some paul supporters are displaying an aggressive side that seems to spill beyond advocacy into harassment of those who disagree or fail to show dr paul sufficient respect taco john for example posted contact information for a university professor who called dr paul "unqualified to be president " he also provided information on how to reach several reporters with whom he quibbled as well as the iowa republican party after it helped set rules for a debate later canceled that could have excluded the low polling dr paul taco john the handle comes from mr lopezs appreciation of former denver broncos quarterback john elway and tacos is a neophyte activist who says he was inspired by dr pauls libertarian platform some blogs have booted paul supporters for leaving incendiary comments they have also been frozen out of internet surveys and accused of electronic ballot stuffing dr paul rarely loses online straw polls even though he barely registers in national telephone polls his supporters argue that they win online polls because there are more paul supporters and theyre better organized many of dr pauls supporters say theyre simply fighting a media and political establishment that wont give him a fair shake the big nov "moneybomb" fund raiser was timed to coincide with guy fawkes day and inspired by the s comic book series "v for vendetta " in which a vigilante in a guy fawkes mask wages war against a totalitarian british state the paul campaign has also drawn support from antigovernment fringe groups and conspiracy theorists since mid september a large "ron paul for president" banner has flashed at the bottom of white supremacist internet forum stormfront org "really we havent seen a candidate like ron paul in some time the closest would have been pat buchanan" in says don black of west palm beach fla the groups founder and a former ku klux klan grand wizard who donated &# to mr pauls campaign the paul campaign has a hands off approach when it comes to supporters activities and political backgrounds while grateful for the money aides insist they arent responsible for what supporters do online "we dont know who a lot of these people are " says jesse benton a campaign spokesman mr benton declined to make dr paul available to comment "sometimes ron paul supporters get a little overpassionate and maybe a little more shrill than what some might like " mr benton says "for the most part our supporters are polite and mannerly " he has his own conspiracy theory some other candidates supporters may be masquerading as ron paul supporters to hurt his campaign the impassioned campaigning threatens dr pauls efforts to convince undecided republicans that he appeals to more than antiwar libertarians and fringes of the republican party "basically it got to the point where someone could put up a post saying they were going to the bathroom and a dozen paultards would comment vote for ron paul while youre there along with another dozen warnings of the zionist conspiracy in the toilet " says erick erickson founder of popular conservative blog redstate a month ago the site banned posts from some paul supporters branding them "morons " afterward the site was "deluged" with comments and "swarms and swarms" of hate mail mr erickson says he changed the sites phone number and says other blog owners have contacted him seeking advice on discouraging paul supporters from posting cris vanricma of ludington mich removed dr paul from his bipartisan presidential poll strawpoll com after receiving nasty emails from some paul supporters contending some polls that dr paul wasnt winning were rigged the year

argue that now isnt the time for half measures david chesley of van nuys calif put his law practice on hold so he could support dr paul mr chesley says he was attracted by the congressmans views on protecting the constitution after what he considers president bushs assault on civil liberties since the sept terrorist attacks "i have an obligation to make this my full time job " says the former democrat "all i do every day is go on the internet or make phone calls or email the media " when he felt the media paid too little attention to the nov fund raiser mr chesley who posts as "rp" on a ron paul message board was furious on nov he urged others to "ceaselessly bombard" media outlets "you need to organize call boycott protest and sue the media that is lying to us and if you dont it is your own d fault if ron paul loses " he wrote some paul supporters preach restraint "i cannot stand to read another reporter blogger complain about how they have received profane threatening intimidating responses from ron paul supporters " wrote "hestia " a frequent poster on the daily paul a popular pro paul site "sending hostile and abusive emails will not win supporters or encourage bloggers or reporters to write positive articles " hestia adds
