fda questions the safety of asthma drugs for kids washington food and drug administration drug safety reviewers questioned whether the glaxosmithkline plc asthma drugs serevent and advair are appropriate for use in pediatric patients and said the issue needs further review the asthma drug findings came in documents posted friday in advance of a meeting of the fdas pediatric advisory committee the session which starts tuesday is expected to focus on the safety of a number of drugs including the influenza medications tamiflu from roche holding ag and relenza made by glaxo serevent and advair which both contain the active ingredient salmeterol already carry a strong "black box" label warning about a risk of asthma related death the agencys reviewers said they hadnt identified side effects unique to children while the fda staff memo said the review was limited by the small number and incomplete nature of some potential side effect reports the staffers still "conclude that salmeterol may have an unfavorable risk benefit ratio in the treatment of pediatric asthma " they wrote that there was evidence inhaled steroid therapy sometimes taken to protect against possible danger linked to salmeterol was "not protective" in young people taking a similar drug novartis ags foradil the reviewers suggested a more in depth safety review of salmeterol that would also include foradil the fda staffers found five deaths among nine adverse event reports in children during its month review period of serevent three of the nine cases were associated with overdoses of serevent the fda documents said such reports from the fdas adverse event system however dont mean a particular drug definitely caused a problem and asthma itself can cause death glaxo said it believed serevent and advair were appropriately labeled to reflect the safety profile of the products the company also said "salmeterol continues to exhibit a favorable safety profile in pediatric subjects and the safety profile is similar to that seen in adults " fda safety reviewers also suggested that both tamiflu and relenza should get label updates with information about neuropsychiatric events such as hallucinations reported occasionally among users tamiflu already has a label precaution about this potential side effect which drew attention two years ago after reports of deaths and about three dozen neuropsychiatric events in japan in to more recent reports of similar episodes in young patients still "provide conflicting evidence as to whether these events are drug related only disease manifestation alone or a combination of drug disease expression " the fda safety reviewers said in a memo still the staffers wrote it "seems prudent" for the labeling of both products to include language about reports of hallucinations delirium and abnormal behavior roche in a document also posted to the fdas web site said that the company believes the current labeling language remains appropriate however roche spokesman terry hurley said roche is "open" to considering a label change if the fda thinks more details are needed roche also said theres no increased risk of neuropsychiatric events in influenza patients treated with tamiflu compared with untreated influenza patients glaxo said it didnt see a potential neuropsychiatric signal until a cluster of reports from japan surfaced in march however the company said theres no evidence the events were caused by relenza and it doesnt believe a labeling change is needed separately glaxo said friday that new data from a european clinical trial have shown its candidate vaccine rotarix is effective at preventing rotavirus gastroenteritis during the first two years of life the company said results from the trial of almost infants indicated rotarix was effective against rotavirus gastroenteritis of any severity effective against severe forms and effective against hospitalizations glaxo said the data published in british medical journal the lancet show its vaccine effectively prevented the infection which causes severe dehydration and diarrhea in infected children
