refinancing may be harder to enjoy while rates are down lenders tighten rules savings prove slender for people hoping to refinance a home it should be good news yields on u s treasury securities are falling which translates into lower mortgage interest rates however the upside of refinancing might not be as great as some expect due to continuing turmoil in the housing market some borrowers could find the savings arent as great as they expected or that they are being shut out of refinancing entirely as lenders tighten their standards for weeks yields on the year treasury notes have been moving lower they fell to on wednesday and slipped to on friday a new low since september and meaning they are low enough that mortgage rates are also starting to come down despite the industrys problems some lenders are trumpeting the news of lower rates to entice borrowers to consider refinancing lenders reeling from rising defaults and foreclosures of home loans are being stricter about lending they are also asking for higher "risk premiums " the amount above treasury rates that borrowers have to pay to compensate for the risk that the loan wont be completely repaid even from the best borrowers "theres no question that risk premiums have widened " says doug duncan chief economist of the mortgage bankers association as mortgage losses have climbed and the credit markets have dried up so has this premium for example interest rates on conforming year fixed rate mortgages dropped slightly in the past week to an average of according to hsh associates a publisher of consumer loan information based in pompton plains n j that is down from a recent high of in mid july or percentage point but treasury rates have fallen further the "spread " or gap between year treasurys and year fixed rate mortgages has widened substantially to percentage points now from just percentage points in june according to hsh this explains why refinancing isnt delivering the savings that some homeowners had hoped for "i would have expected rates to be better than they are " says steven walsh a mortgage broker in scottsdale ariz mr walsh says that some of his borrowers have called him looking to refinance and take advantage of lower rates but are going away empty handed in other cases borrowers who want to refinance are being stymied by tighter lending standards particularly in markets where home prices are declining and lenders are becoming particularly cautious about appraisals for the week ended nov the refinance share of mortgage activity increased to of total applications from the previous week according to the mortgage bankers association borrowers with good credit and if refinancing a chunk of equity in their homes are best positioned to benefit "to be a successful refinancer in this marketplace you have to be much more of a traditional kind of borrower " says keith gumbinger a mortgage analyst with hsh associates "you need to have some equity in your home you need to be documenting your income or assets you need to have reasonable or good credit " martin quijada an architect from gilbert ariz who has perfect credit has been looking to refinance his mortgage loan recently but two banks with good rates wouldnt sign off on the appraisal says mr walsh his broker another bank agreed that the appraisal was fine but had "terrible rates " mr walsh said "i was expecting a much simpler process " says mr quijada who plans to hold out for now in hopes of getting a better rate later but mr walsh warns that even if rates drop further mr quijada will still have to deal with the appraisal issue many borrowers with good credit have been running into such roadblocks recently according to the federal reserves senior loan officer survey from october of the u s respondents reported that they have tightened their lending standards on prime mortgages compared with only that reported having done so in the july survey borrowers with good credit can benefit from the lower interest rates says mr duncan of the mortgage bankers association "but if youre in a market where property values are falling it may not make much of a difference " it is a particular problem if the loan balance is greater than the homes current value the news is mixed for borrowers seeking "jumbo" mortgages these are the loans that exceed the &# limit for those eligible for purchase and guarantee by mortgage institutions fannie mae and freddie mac on the one hand rates on year fixed rate jumbo mortgages have dipped below according to hsh associates after reaching as much as in august but that is still well above the average for these loans in early june when the credit market was less jittery and the gap between conforming and jumbo loans was narrower for individuals looking to borrow or refinance shopping around is particularly important in the current environment for instance mr gumbinger says banks or credit unions that hold onto the mortgages they issue as opposed to selling them on to other investors in the form of mortgage securities may now offer better rates because they arent dependent on securitization and thus may have more capital available for lending "you cant make the assumption that the loan price at lender a is the most competitive price in the marketplace " he says "theres a wide variety of prices " melissa cohn a new york mortgage broker tells her clients who wish to refinance in the next three to six months to move quickly "lender guidelines will continue to get more stringent in the next few months before they ease up again " she says
