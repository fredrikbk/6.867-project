hedge funds leveraging the numbers size can be deceiving when borrowed money is added to calculation hedge funds have become famous for using borrowed money to boost their returns but the upheaval in credit markets is shedding light on another way they use it to make themselves look bigger than they really are when reporting their assets under management hedge funds typically refer to the amount of money they have attracted from investors a practice long established by mutual funds and other investment firms many hedge funds also borrow money to increase their "leverage " which amplifies their potential returns and potential losses in recent months as the market turmoil has forced many funds to cut back on their borrowing it has become evident that some were adding in the borrowed money when reporting their size for example bond fund yk said it had assets under management of &# billion as recently as july but after a tough summer london based parent wharton asset management uk ltd said the fund actually had less than &# million in investor capital and that most of the rest had been borrowed a spokesman for wharton declined to comment "its a pretty common practice that should be stopped " says bradley alford founder of alpha capital management an atlanta based investment advisory firm that caters to wealthy families though not illegal the practice is significant because size matters in the hedge fund industry investors tend to flock toward funds that have already attracted a lot of money from other investors also for management companies that make their money on fees assets under management offer an important indicator of earning power something akin to sales numbers at a retailer or reserves for an oil company the practice also raises questions about the true size of the global hedge fund industry at a time when it is trying to get away from its image as a bevy of secretive mavericks in an effort to head off calls for greater regulation a group of europes largest hedge fund managers last month drafted a proposed code of behavior that would give investors and banks more information about the risks hedge funds take and how they value their assets the u s treasury has also commissioned a group to look at a code of voluntary standards "its all to do with confidence " says andrew large chairman of the european group known as the hedge fund working group and a former bank of england governor "if people feel that the facts they are given they cant understand and rely on it doesnt give them confidence in the underlying" fund or in the industry take for example new york based fairfield greenwich group which describes itself in a prospectus sent to investors as "one of the largest" alternative asset managers with over &# billion under management as of october actually that number includes borrowed assets totaling around &# billion according to people familiar with the fund nevertheless the &# billion number is often reported to data gatherers according to these people fairfield declined to comment on the appropriateness of the firms reporting to be sure most hedge fund managers report their numbers according to the market custom according to fund brokers and investors those that dont tend to be either in the credit market where large amounts of borrowing are often used to invest in complex securities or are smaller funds looking to inflate their size the lack of consistency in reporting helps explain why the size and performance of the global hedge fund industry has been so notoriously difficult to pin down as of the end of june chicago based hedge fund research inc put the total assets managed by hedge funds at &# trillion while london based hedgefund intelligence put it at &# trillion credit suisse tremont which also tracks the industry puts it at &# trillion "while every index provider will do their best to present data as accurately as possible it is difficult to capture every fund accurately " says philippe schenk of credit suisse tremont mr schenk says the nearly funds run by the worlds largest hedge fund firms which have about &# billion under management are required to show audited financial statements the rest though are self reported borrowed money isnt the only factor skewing hedge funds reported size managers of funds that invest in other hedge funds for example sometimes double count when their investments include other funds they manage london listed rab capital plc for example has a fund of funds called rab multi strategy which invests about &# million across the groups other funds this money is added into rabs total reported assets under management of &# billion despite being counted twice rab capital says it does so because it collects a separate management fee on the fund "we are reporting on all the assets on which we earn fees " says philip richards rab chief executive otherwise "we would have a gap where there were incremental fees coming in out of thin air " he says
