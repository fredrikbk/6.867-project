weekend journal culture clinging to the rolodex in a blackberry age some top executives are still spinning their rotary card files finding salman rushdies old phone number walking liquid paper boulevard its in illinois and hunting for the sixth wheel two computer monitors two telephones and a blackberry sit in the office of jose w fernandez a year old partner of law firm latham &amp watkins floor to ceiling windows reveal sprawling views of manhattan and the walls are adorned with latin american art but when clients and colleagues stop by his office mr fernandez says "the only thing people notice is that i still have a rolodex " more than years after the digital revolution that forecasted the paperless office the "rotary card file" best known by the market leading brand name rolodex continues to turn as millions of social network users display their connectedness on their facebook pages a surprisingly robust group of people maintain their networks on small white cards most of these devotees also rely on blackberrys and other computer based address books but even as some executives cling to their rolodexes the models they covet most like the hulking card wheels that once signaled a huge network of contacts have vanished from the market rolodex has discontinued of its larger models during the past years most rolodexes manufactured today can handle a maximum of about cards a piddling amount by the standards of any hardcore networker a spokesman for sanford brands north america the newell rubbermaid inc company that owns rolodex says the smaller designs reflect the decreasing size of the average workers cubicle charles mcnally a managing director at investment advisory lyster watson &amp co has eight rolodexes on his desk six larger models and two small ones plus a ninth that he keeps in a drawer earlier this year faced with a growing pile of business cards that couldnt be fit into any of his rotary files he ordered a new wheel but when it arrived he found it couldnt hold as many cards as his others mr mcnally years old stuck it in a closet unused it "wasnt going to help enough to be worth giving up the desktop space " he says when alyse sobel of los angeles got started in the event planning business in the s she bought a massive rolodex with the capacity for cards its now so packed when she turns the wheel cards fall out ms sobel knows she wont be able to find another similarly sized rotary file now when she gets new cards "i stuff them in my filofax " she says the rolodex was patented in by arnold neustadter of brooklyn n y mr neustadters employee hildaur l neilsen actually invented it according to the company recently rolodex has been trying to reinvent itself at the companys corporate headquarters in oak brook ill hallways are designated with street signs nodding to sanfords various brands such as "sharpie road" and "paper mate place " near "liquid paper boulevard " the companys marketing team has set up stations where new media meet old there they display silver contraptions made by cardscan a company sanford bought last year the devices scan business cards and transfer the information into outlook or other electronic contact management systems sanford hopes that after scanning people will put their business cards in rotary card files in an effort to evolve with the times sanford has been expanding its rolodex product line to include a number of desktop organization tools for the digital age such as ipod docking stations and electrical cord organizers it also is producing more streamlined card file systems some of these hide rather than flaunt their contacts one flat file model folds up like a murphy bed and doubles as a photograph frame rolodex also has expanded its line of "card books " folders with plastic inserts for cards inside for rolodex loyalists though part of the card systems appeal has always been that it displays the size of ones business network for the world to see someones rolodex is "a reminder to themselves and an announcement to others about who they are and what they have achieved " says joel podolny dean of the yale school of management and the author of the book "status signals " jonathan galassi president of publishing house farrar straus &amp giroux proudly displays his five rolodexes on his desk flipping through his rolodexes one afternoon mr galassi grabs a card "this is salman rushdie before the ayatollah " he plucks another bearing the number of a favorite teacher "shes been dead since " he says he finds a card for holly stevens a daughter of the poet wallace stevens "i dont know if shes still around but i wouldnt want to get rid of it " he says ms stevens died in in a recent episode of the nbc comedy "the office " a corporate employee tries to get the staff to embrace blackberry technology but michael scott played by steve carell is committed to his analog tools like the rolodex that sits on his desk "michael is not cutting edge " says philip shea property master for the program to maintain authenticity mr shea flew to scranton pa where the show is set to collect props including local business cards that now are stapled into the characters rolodex the rolodexs popularity and sales according to former employees peaked in the late s when greed was good and contacts were king a recession in the early s deflated the items market with the introduction of personal digital assistants or pdas in the s the rolodex began to seem redundant sanford declines to provide sales figures and its public filings dont include individual office supply brands numbers however office supply stores in new york los angeles denver and houston report diminished card file sales in cincinnati spitzfaden office supplies

rolodex has a more than market share from to these sales dropped more than in the first half of this year they were down almost compared with the same time period in howard heckes president of sanford brands north america disputes that rotary card file sales are falling he says there has been "flat to modest growth" in the rotary files which the company says are manufactured in china derek leckow an analyst with barrington research associates who follows newell rubbermaid says rotary card files arent a growth business but because the design of the card files has changed so little in the last years and has required so little investment the category likely remains profitable "thats a cash cow " he says mike cahill oversees a global technology and media fund for chilton investment co based in new york he has five massive rolodexes two double wheel x models and one single wheel adjacent to the four computer monitors and blackberry sitting on his desk the count on the cards stuffed inside
