weekend journal food &amp drink hows your drink the art of drinking well novelist walker percy once penned an article on the joys of drinking bourbon neat and paused to worry that he was doing his audience no favor "an apology to the reader is in order " he offered "for it has just occurred to me that this is the most unedifying and even maleficent piece i ever wrote if it should encourage potential alcoholics to start knocking back bourbon neat " but on reflection percy concluded that it was worth the danger given the anomie fighting qualities of kentucky whiskey recommending good things to drink is an enterprise fraught with moral peril encourage folks to try a cocktail and there are sure to be some among them who will like it altogether too much i come from a family of teetotalers one reason my father a jazz musician is not a drinker is that he witnessed the toll the bottle took on many of his friends a well made cocktail may be a perilous pleasure but it isnt the only one more than a few people have been undone by love but we dont abjure it rather one of the central storylines in the history of civilization has been the effort to make love livable a good drink though not without risk can be eminently livable alcohol is no doubt a drug but in moderation it is a very social one it primes the conversational pump it nudges the shy from the bonds of their awkwardness it midwives romance it concludes treaties firewater like fire can be awesomely destructive learning to marshal the power of both is a hallmark of civilization oliver wendell holmes sr not jr the jurist but his father the physician and popular poet penned an ode to an old punchbowl seeing in it a metaphor for friendship and life well lived the poem is resonant with the ritual and tradition of drinking well "this ancient silver bowl of mine it tells of good old times of joyous days and jolly nights and merry christmas chimes they were a free and jovial race but honest brave and true that dipped their ladle in the punch when this old bowl was new " when we dip in that ladle ourselves holmes suggests we share in a small way in the virtues of those who ladled before us its a simple direct way to connect with that lost world "i love the memory of the past " writes holmes no doubt a sentimental old softy contemplating his silver bowl holmess "eyes grow moist and dim to think of all the vanished joys that danced around its brim " one could say the same of a well worn cocktail shaker and the many forgotten parties it enlivened fill that shaker up now and it holds more than just liquor and ice holmes imagines miles standish mixing a bracing draught in the old punchbowl at a moment when the mayflower seemed lost he sees an anguished mother sending her son off to fight at bunker hill ladling him a cup of resolve from the same bowl cocktails can work that way too connecting us with our past and reviving lost ways of living but what ways of living its all too easy to romanticize the more flamboyant excesses of creative types whose genius like a genie seems to reside in a bottle but drink didnt make hemingway clever kingsley amis cranked out a prodigious body of work in spite of his deep thirst not because of it h l mencken may have argued that a sober jack london never would have written anything worth reading but the truth is all the sauce did for london was to kill him a proper cocktail is one that connects us with each other even more than it connects us with the past at its best a good drink is a sort of secular communion a cup of fellowship in his book "martini straight up " classics professor lowell edmunds describes the making of martinis as a shared ritual and champions what he calls the "communal" martini martini drinkers are united in their commitment to the classic recipe a secular "sacramental drink that unites in spirit even those who have never met " which isnt to say the ritual is solemn anything but for f d r cocktail time the childrens hour he called it was the respite from a hard days war making if the cocktail hour was once widely observed it is no longer people drink no doubt but few of us structure our day around what bernard devoto breathlessly called "the hour " we might catch a drink here or there with friends perhaps even a proper pre prandial cocktail to get in the mood for dinner but the way we live now may be both too casual and too frantic for the formality of ritual at least that takes the pressure off the poor little cocktail which couldnt but groan under all that weight of meaning and importance its possible to be serious about drinking without being a serious drinker and especially without taking oneself too seriously amusement is the cocktails real line of work and a noble one at that harry craddock the legendary barman at londons savoy hotel in the s told his customers that the best way to drink a cocktail is "while its laughing at you " spot on just be sure to laugh back if there is anything to be serious about in the way of drinks it is this only that ones drink be delicious and if it can add to our pleasure by having a good story to tell all the better great drinks are like the tunes from the great american songbook they can withstand the endless variations that come from individual interpretation and enjoying those drinks makes one part of a living tradition a lineage of civilized drinkers "then fill a fair and honest cup and bear it straight to me " holmes urges "the goblet hallows all it holds whateer the liquid be " i have to admit that thats where holmes loses me whateer the liquid be isnt quite good enough why waste an all hallowing goblet on anything less than a well made cocktail that way there will never be any doubt about the answer when asked "hows your drink " this weeks column is adapted from my new book "hows your drink cocktails culture and the art of drinking well" surrey books chicago email me at eric felten wsj com
