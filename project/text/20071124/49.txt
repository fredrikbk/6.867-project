secs web push is more easily said than done washington christopher cox wants to bring the securities and exchange commission into the st century but while his initiatives to let shareholders get more corporate information electronically may define his legacy they also are running into bureaucratic and shareholder resistance "theres an opportunity to completely transform the kind of information that investors are getting from something static and very difficult to use to something thats very easy to work with and that provides a great deal more information " mr cox said in a recent interview using technology and the internet to benefit investors is both "the greatest opportunity and the greatest challenge " he said the sec has taken some steps and mr cox has more ideas in the works on nov for instance the sec voted to propose allowing mutual fund companies to send offering documents to investors over the internet following a rule passed last year to allow companies to send proxy materials the same way mr cox also is expected to put up for final vote wednesday a proposed rule that would enable companies to create online shareholder forums where investors and management could exchange thoughts establishing a kind of chat room to improve communication opposing that model is the aarp the lobby group for adults and older which said its studies show that doing so would result in fewer of its members participating in shareholder elections the sec is studying ways to let companies release important information to investors on corporate web sites to satisfy disclosure obligations mr cox said as well as creating an online database for municipal bond filings similar to the edgar electronic reporting system that exists for corporate disclosure his biggest effort getting companies to put electronic tags on financial information and executive pay data so investors analysts and others could easily sort and compare information across the internet has been harder to solidify still mr cox is signaling he may require that companies file financial statements using such technology next year mr cox talks up xbrl technology short for extensible business reporting language and more casually known as interactive data in speeches before congress and to about anybody who will give him an audience at the nov sec meeting mr cox said the use of interactive data would make it easier for investors to compare mutual funds before making decisions holding up a copy of the book "xbrl for dummies " mr cox tried to entice the audience by turning it on its side to show it couldnt be that complicated if it was just pages a week earlier mr cox met with regulators from japan china australia and others to discuss xbrl upgrading many sec rules pits two forces against each other the desire of businesses to embrace the internet as a way of reducing costs and the secs goal of ensuring that all investors have access to information in a manner they feel comfortable with the sec requires companies to disclose information material to their businesses to investors "making technology a part of the securities laws is generally something that would be applauded by most industry participants and most investors who dont like to get paper " says barry barbash a former director of investment management at the sec and now a lawyer at willkie farr &amp gallagher he adds "on the other hand not everybody is going to want material in computer format thats the tension " the sec so far has allowed such investors to opt for paper the xbrl computer language has been around for nearly a decade mr cox says one of the biggest reasons he was given for why the agency hadnt embraced it was whos to say xbrl is the best to use in the fall of sun microsystems inc chief executive jonathan schwartz contacted the sec to ask whether companies could use their web sites to satisfy regulation fair disclosure which requires widespread distribution of potentially market moving information to investors mr cox responded on mr schwartzs web log or blog and in a letter that such an approach posed potential challenges including ensuring that access to the information was broad and "non exclusionary " mr schwartz persevered he set forth several ways he believed companies could satisfy the requirements including posting information on investor relations segments of corporate web sites and using the internet news feeds known as rss to enable those who sign up to get automated web site updates without having to manually check the site in july instead of publishing its quarterly financial results as is standard through a news distribution service such as business wire sun put the information on its corporate web site and didnt use the paid distribution service until minutes later the move made some inside the company "uncomfortable" for being on the cutting edge according to a blog post written by the companys general counsel the sec says the company satisfied regulatory requirements because sun still filed earnings first with the sec gregory zuckerman in new york contributed to this article
