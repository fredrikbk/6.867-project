all in the family &# billion in india stock surge lifts ambanis riches to unfathomable high mumbai india shares of indias largest companies have been climbing sharply as the countrys stock market sizzles but the jump in prices of some companies controlled by what may now be the worlds richest family has been the most significant and the most puzzling the ambani brothers anil and mukesh control a group of companies that mostly use the reliance name the brothers had a falling out a few years ago so now each runs different parts of an empire that their father constructed one that includes everything from oil and supermarkets to real estate and telecommunications in recent months the ascent of some reliance companies stock has been so steep that together the two ambanis are now worth close to &# billion analysts say on paper the elder brother year old mukesh has more than &# billion most of it reflecting his stake in reliance industries ltd indias largest company according to a recent forbes magazines list of indias richest his year old brother anils wealth weighs in at more than &# billion partly through his holdings in reliance communications ltd his flagship concern the suddenness of the ambanis wealth tsunami has some analysts and investors scratching their heads consider this the bombay stock exchanges benchmark sensex index has spiked about in the past three months setting a record intraday high above on oct before losing some ground to end friday at but during the same period reliance petroleum ltd a refining company has climbed reliance energy ltd a power company has surged more than gas trading company reliance natural resources ltd has skyrocketed more than some market watchers wonder why while reliance companies shares have been surging amid market rumors of better profits and new expansion plans their rally has gone much further than fundamentals should allow analysts say "it stopped making sense after a while " says ashwani gujral head of ashwani gujral investment &amp portfolio management in gurgaon india even the biggest reliance companies have beaten the market despite already having gargantuan market values because they have attracted a slew of foreign investors in recent years shares of reliance communications have risen more than in the past three months lifting its market capitalization to about &# billion reliance industries stock price has jumped about over the period that makes reliance industries which is owned by foreign investors indias largest listed company with a market value of close to &# billion to some extent the rally in the reliance companies stock makes sense both ambani brothers control corporate stables that include some of indias most profitable and best managed blue chip stocks billions of dollars in foreign investment has poured into india in recent months and anyone building an indian portfolio has to hold reliance industries and reliance communications says john band president of investment consultancy zoom cortex "foreign investors are interested in the sort of things the reliance companies are doing and there is a shortage of other investment opportunities " mr band says "the reliance pack has consistently shown dramatic growth so they can potentially attract even more foreign money " the soaring prices of the smaller reliance companies are harder to explain however speculation abounds that the ambanis are using their many holding companies to buy shares in their listed concerns to solidify control of those companies or to lift their stock prices so they can raise more money through new share sales company founders and their families and friends called "promoters" are allowed to buy more of their own companies shares and are often blamed for sharp price movements under indian regulations this class of investors can buy shares in their own companies through the stock market spokesmen from both sides of the reliance empire denied that their own companies were behind the surge in the share prices in fact reliance industries announced friday that it has sold some of its reliance petroleum shares to profit from their high price whatever the case many analysts and investors say some of the reliance companies are now overvalued "compared to the kind of revenue numbers they are showing they look expensive but these stocks dont move on numbers anymore " says prayesh jain research analyst at india infoline in mumbai he says that the prices are spiking because of speculation reliance petroleum for instance has been rising amid expectations that chevron corp which currently owns of the company will boost its stake to chevron has an option to buy the larger stake from reliance industries but hasnt decided whether it will do so according to spokesmen for reliance and chevron even assuming that its new refinery begins operations well before its planned start at the end of next year reliance petroleum is trading at more than times earnings projected for the year ending march that is about twice the average price earnings ratio of similar refining companies trading around the globe nonetheless reliance petroleum formed just last year has now become one of indias biggest companies with a market value of more than &# billion even before refining its first drop of oil reliance energy a power company with a market value of about &# billion that is owned by anil ambani has been surging amid hopes that its plans to spin off part of its operations into a separate company reliance power will help both companies become more profitable however with a p e ratio of close to any benefits of the spinoff are already in the price analysts say the share rose to rupees &# friday reliance natural resources another company controlled by anil ambani has enjoyed the most puzzling rally of all the company holds the rights to buy natural gas from reliance industries at a fixed price well below that at which reliance is selling gas to other companies still the profits from that deal already are reflected in the stock price analysts say although reliance natural resources net income was only about &# million in the year ended march its market capitalization has ballooned to more than &# billion giving it a p e ratio of more than small investors "are getting overexcited about it " mr gujral of ashwani gujral investment says
