a little laptop with big ambitions how a computer for the poor got stomped by tech giants cambridge mass in nicholas negroponte unveiled an idea for bridging the technology divide between rich nations and the developing world it was captivating in its utter simplicity design a &# laptop and within four years get it into the hands of up to million of the worlds poorest schoolchildren world leaders and corporate benefactors jumped in to support the nonprofit project called one laptop per child mr negroponte a professor on leave from the massachusetts institute of technology hopscotched the world collecting pledges from developing nations to buy the laptops in bulk but nearly three years later only about students in pilot programs have received computers from the one laptop project an order from uruguay for machines appears to be the only solid deal to date with a country although mr negroponte says hes on the verge of sealing an order from peru for the first mass production run which began this month in china is for laptops tens of thousands of which are slated to go to u s consumers mr negropontes goal of million users by the end of looks unattainable mr negropontes ambitious plan has been derailed in part by the power of his idea for profit companies threatened by the projected &# price tag set off at a sprint to develop their own dirt cheap machines plunging mr negroponte into unexpected competition against well known brands such as intel corp and microsoft corp s windows operating system a version of mr negropontes vision is starting to come true impoverished countries are indeed snapping up cheap laptops for their schoolchildren just not anywhere near as many of his as he expected they now have several cut price models to choose from raising the possibility that one laptop per child or olpc will end up as a niche player "im not good at selling laptops " mr negroponte has told colleagues "im good at selling ideas " "from my point of view if the world were to have million" laptops made by competitors "in the hands of children at the end of next year that to me would be a great success " he said in a recent interview "my goal is not selling laptops olpc is not in the laptop business its in the education business " from its inception one laptop per child posed a threat to the personal computing dominance of software giant microsoft and chip maker intel mr negropontes team drawn from mit designed a machine that didnt use windows or intel chips it uses the linux operating system and other nonproprietary open source software which users are allowed to tinker with last year intel which normally doesnt sell computers introduced a small laptop for developing countries called the classmate which currently goes for between &# and &# it has marketed the computer aggressively although it stands to make little money on the initiative but it hopes to prevent rival advanced micro devices inc or amd whose chips are in mr negropontes competing computer from becoming a standard in the developing world by most accounts mr negroponte and his member team have created a rugged innovative laptop with good software for learning the small green and white device is designed to operate on very little power a small solar panel can keep it going and to resist rain and dust its unique high resolution screen stays bright even in direct sunlight the laptop has a built in video camera and connects wirelessly to the internet and to other laptops of its kind but the project has hit snags the &# price target is proving difficult to hit although mr negropontes team has succeeded in creating a device thats cheaper than other laptops it now sells for &# plus shipping potential buyers in the developing world have expressed concern about the availability of training for schoolteachers and after sales support mr negropontes plan is for the machines to be simple enough that students can train themselves and solve any glitches that arise some potential buyers are having second thoughts about one laptop per child officials in libya who had planned to buy up to million of the laptops became concerned that the machines lacked windows and that service teacher training and future upgrades might become a problem "the intel machine is a lot better than the olpc " says mohamed bani who chairs libyas technical advisory committee but doesnt have the final say on buying laptops "i dont want my country to be a junkyard for these machines " libya has decided buy at least intel classmates the future of the one laptop program there is now uncertain mr negroponte who is years old is a computer science expert and veteran technology investor he co founded and formerly directed the mit media laboratory and helped to found wired magazine he serves on the board of motorola inc recently he was selected by news corp to serve on a committee to protect the editorial integrity of dow jones &amp co the owner of the wall street journal following news corp s agreement to purchase the company his brother is u s deputy secretary of state john negroponte nicholas negroponte unveiled his &# laptop plan in january at the world economic forum in davos switzerland suggesting it would transform education for the worlds disadvantaged schoolchildren and help eliminate poverty later that year he predicted the project would sell million to million laptops in to developing countries google inc amd and news corp were among the companies that each kicked in &# million of funding in november then united nations secretary general kofi annan publicly endorsed the concept demonstrating an early prototype powered by a hand crank a feature that subsequently was scrapped at a presentation seven months ago mr negroponte expressed confidence that he had commitments from countries to purchase million laptops in but the taiwan based manufacturer quanta computer inc is producing only units this year he said in a recent interview at a conference this month he said that his new goal for is to produce one million laptops a month but he added that he cant say when that target will be reached because the initial production volume is smaller than expected the project hasnt benefited from anticipated economies of scale design upgrades more memory and a faster microprocessor the brains of the machine also added to the price apparently costing the project sales nigeria for example so far has failed to honor a pledge by its former president to purchase one million laptops thats partly because they no longer cost &# apiece says tomi davies a nigerian born technology entrepreneur who helped mr negroponte set up talks with nigerian officials the higher price also has made the laptop vulnerable to competition from sellers of more traditional windows based machines for many education ministries "its a no brainer you go with microsoft " says mr davies the one laptop initiative is facing competition from taiwanese indian and israeli sellers of inexpensive windows laptops who see the developing worlds more than one billion potential young customers as a big opportunity intel based in santa clara calif so far has proven the biggest competitive threat the introduction of the low cost classmate sparked accusations by mr negroponte that intel was trying to undermine his nonprofit initiative intel made a multimillion dollar contribution to the one laptop project and joined its board in july nevertheless intel has continued to compete with the nonprofit and it appears to be winning it recently inked deals to sell hundreds of thousands of classmates in nigeria libya and pakistan countries that mr negroponte had been counting on intel has launched a series of pilot projects in those countries and has said it will test the classmate in at least other nations donating thousands of machines in recent months mr negroponte has abandoned his initial strategy of trying to persuade a half dozen developing countries argentina brazil libya nigeria pakistan and thailand to buy one million laptops each the project has begun accepting much smaller orders and is attempting to persuade wealthier countries including italy and spain to finance laptops for poorer ones as sales problems mounted the project recently reversed course on its plan not to sell the device to american consumers on nov it began selling pairs of laptops to u s and canadian buyers for &# under the program called "give one get one " one goes to a student in a poor country like haiti the other to the buyer the program was supposed to last just two weeks but on thursday one laptop said it was extending the offer through dec because "people want more time to participate " mr negroponte says there were about two laptop orders in the first nine days with nearly half coming on the first day suppliers are grumbling about missed forecasts and lowered expectations "we wish they would ship more absolutely " says scott soong of chi mei group the taiwanese manufacturer of the laptops screen who also serves on one laptops board laptop maker quanta which was told early this year to expect initial orders of five million to eight million also is disappointed according to a person familiar with the matter "were all frustrated with each other " says mr negroponte of the friction with quanta and suppliers "everybodys got a short fuse " he seems most frustrated with intel whose overseas sales force has trumpeted the classmate over his laptop in nigeria and mongolia using marketing materials that claim the intel machine is superior "these are not isolated examples " he said in a recent interview "they are daily events " at a meeting this month in cambridge mass with representatives of macedonias government mr negroponte balked at authorizing a pilot project there after learning that officials also were considering testing the classmate he told them he didnt want to participate in a "bake off " mr negroponte says he communicated this month with intels chief executive paul otellini and demanded that intel stop selling the classmate intel which says there is room in the market for many machines has refused according to a spokeswoman mr negroponte says he got the idea for the initiative after working on educational projects in cambodia and other developing countries where he saw that computers could spur children to learn and explore outside the classroom in november he demonstrated a working prototype with mr annan at a u n technology conference in tunisia "it was the main highlight of the whole summit " says raul zambrano a senior technology adviser at the u n development program which provides assistance to developing countries and shared a booth with mr negroponte "people were coming up with cash saying i want to buy it now " mr zambrano recalls mr negroponte draws no salary from the nonprofit which only has about paid employees for most of the past three years he has promoted his idea around the world meeting with numerous heads of state in mid a one laptop official said the project had "commitments" from nigeria brazil argentina and thailand to purchase one million laptops each the organization later retracted the claim in october the new york times reported that libya had agreed to buy up to million of the laptops by june publicly intel and microsoft officials didnt hide their disdain for mr negropontes machine in december intel chairman craig r barrett called an early version a "&# gadget" that wasnt likely to succeed at a conference in march microsoft chairman bill gates said "geez get a decent computer where you can actually read the text and youre not sitting there cranking the thing while youre trying to type " this year mr gates announced in china that microsoft would offer developing countries a &# software package that includes windows a student version of microsoft office and educational programs mr negroponte said the move was a direct response to his project james utzschneider general manager of microsofts unlimited potential group a unit whose targets include young people in developing countries denies this libya and egypt plan to buy the &# software mr utzschneider says mr negroponte had hoped to sell his linux based laptops to both countries mr utzschneider says an organization in russia has signed an agreement to buy at least copies with an option to buy up to more the russians he says initially will load the software onto a low cost laptop made by asustek computer inc of taiwan another one laptop competitor by this spring many of mr negropontes informal agreements with world leaders to buy millions of laptops appeared to be unraveling the prime minister of thailand who backed the project was removed in a military coup nigeria was having second thoughts in part because of the rising cost of the machine according to tomi davies who is helping one laptop in nigeria last month intels mr barrett visited nigeria and announced that the company would donate classmates to schools there and would train teachers to use computers in the classroom "we cant compete " complains ayo kusamotu one laptops attorney in nigeria "the minute we started getting some traction they intel intensified their effort " nigeria recently agreed to purchase intel classmates in may mr negroponte appeared on cbss " minutes" and blasted intel suggesting it was trying to drive his nonprofit out of business intels mr barrett called that idea "crazy " two months later intel announced it was joining one laptops board the agreement included a "nondisparagement" clause under which intel and one laptop promised not to criticize each other according to mr negroponte john davies who oversees classmate sales at intel says that after the broadcast intel decided to "purge" any marketing material that directly compares the competing laptops but last month an intel representative gave a powerpoint presentation to a mongolian official that offered a "head to head comparison" between the classmate and the one laptop machine intel claimed the classmate prevailed in nine of categories including processor speed and support for different operating systems a copy of the presentation indicates intels mr davies says the presentation violated company policy "sometimes you get escapees " he says adding that he will be doing some "retraining" of the sales staff mr negroponte says he complained to intels chief executive two weeks ago then "made peace " intel and the one laptop project he says have agreed to work together to design by early january a new "intel based" one laptop device an intel spokeswoman confirmed mr negropontes account but said any comment would be "premature " amd whose chips are used in one laptops current machines declined to comment there are no signs that mr negropontes project is in danger of fading away robert fadel its director of finance and operations says the nonprofit has enough funding to last years its dozen corporate benefactors this year contributed &# million and it will be using &# from each computer sold to cover administrative costs last year it took in &# million in revenue mainly from donors and its budget this year is about &# million as of september it had &# million in cash on hand an internal document indicates but it continues to face skepticism from its target audience at a training conference it hosted this month in cambridge for a large group of educators and tech specialists from developing countries participants peppered mr negroponte and other project officials with questions about teacher training and software bugs "it will always have bugs in it and it will never be perfect " mr negroponte told them adding that he has a "royal battle" with his windows based computer nearly every morning later at a private meeting with a group from rwanda he announced that laptops courtesy of the "give one get one " program would soon be distributed carine umutesi who works for rwandas information technology authority questioned who would fix them if they break mr negroponte said some initial tech support would be provided by brightstar corp a miami based wireless equipment distributor just who would provide support a few years from now he said was "a frightening question " the students he said will need "to do as much maintenance as possible " jason dean in beijing contributed to this article
