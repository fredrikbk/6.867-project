weekend journal food &amp drink wine notes making the list my son is involved in the start up of a small restaurant in the los angeles area and would like to create a small wine list what would you recommend as a starting point i was thinking of no more than to different wines since they do not have unlimited storage michael b edwards berkeley calif wine lists do not have to be large to be good sure sometimes a telephone book sized wine list includes many unusual treasures anyone who has visited berns steak house in tampa fla or crabtrees kittle house in chappaqua n y knows this but we have been handed far too many big fat lists that included very little that was interesting and new its frustrating to go through page after page of a weighty wine list and keep saying "been there done that " on the other hand weve sometimes visited restaurants with small lists that offer all sorts of interesting new tastes just the other day we dropped into a restaurant in new york city called the mermaid inn that offered only wines by the bottle red white and three sparkling but the breadth of the selection was impressive and offered a fine sampling of tastes from around the world things like counoise from the rhone valley of france zweigelt from austria and pinot gris from oregon we had a white wine wed never seen before vina godeval from the valdeorras area of the galicia region of spain &# it was made from the godello grape and if youve never heard of the godello grape trust us youre not alone the wine was fragrant and crisp and great with seafood with so many interesting wines available at good prices from all over the world these days and with winemakers everywhere eager to see their products on restaurant wine lists theres no excuse for a boring list no matter how long or short it is our advice is to make sure that the list is highly international and includes a wide variety of grape types the mermaid inn by the bottle list for instance included only three wines from california we understand that many people think they only want a merlot or chardonnay from california but offer them something else at a good price and theyll try it make sure that the list changes regularly if its a short list it can get tired quickly so pricing the wine fairly is critical not only is this the right thing to do and not only does it mean that diners will enjoy their meals more because theyll be drinking wine but the restaurant will sell more wine and be able to change the list more frequently reusing plastic corks are plastic corks recyclable jeff hogan cambridge mass for such a simple question the answer is surprisingly complex the very basic answer is that plastic corks from the major u s manufacturers are recyclable in principle plastic products are numbered depending on various factors such as what they are made from and the corks made by the three biggest domestic players are no "low density polyethylene" or no "other" and they are recyclable but realistically the answer is probably no we called eugene ore and san francisco two cities with sophisticated recycling programs and they do not recycle plastic corks essentially because the corks are simply too small considering the tons of material they must sort every day the corks generally end up in a landfill its possible that your city has recycling that is so sophisticated that it will take plastic corks and recycle them but the only way to know is to call your local facility and ask otherwise consider reusing your corks wed heard of crafts slingshot ammo and fishing bobbers before and we recently found out that one brand of synthetic corks can even be used as a pencil eraser recyclable or not our problem with plastic corks is that we find some of them really difficult to extract from bottles and we and many readers we have heard from have sent broken corkscrews to the landfill as a result melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com
