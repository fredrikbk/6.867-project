weekend journal books the afterlife of a skeptic how the execution of a philosopher has been reinterpreted for every era the death of socrates by emily wilson harvard pages &# he was grotesquely ugly but suffered no dearth of admirers chattered all day but wrote nothing down drank heavily but never got drunk yet the name socrates recalls his death more than his bewilderingly eccentric life in an open air athenian courtroom in b c the worlds first democracy sentenced one of the worlds first public intellectuals to death for disrespecting the citys gods and leading its youth astray his disciples were prepared to help him escape but socrates baffled them when he cheerfully swigged his lethal cup of hemlock after praising the city that wanted him gone emily wilsons "the death of socrates" is an exceptionally lucid introduction to this famous trial and death even if the author comes to some tenuous conclusions not only does ms wilson carefully reconstruct the circumstances of the philosophers demise but she also asks rather refreshingly the implicitly obvious but mostly overlooked question of "why the death of socrates has mattered so much over such an enormously long period of time and to so many different people " the history of the interpretation of socrates death it turns out is in large part the history of philosophy itself it is tempting today to read socrates execution as a lamentable early chapter in the history of free speech socrates died for the right to speak his conscience that is the way socrates contemporary xenophon chose to understand the event but this view simplifies the much more complicated sense of socrates that we get from his most formidable pupil plato in platos account of the trial "the apology " socrates defends himself not as a victim of censorship but as a benefactor of athens a gadfly as he puts it who could prick the city into a higher state of self awareness by disturbing its settled worldview "the twenty first century seems to have seen a return to the xenophontic vision of socrates " ms wilson writes "our culture is making a move back to banality away from the terrifying charges of plato " just what was so terrifying about platos charges for the wealthy ruling classes of athens plato implies socrates was an unrestrained liability a teacher given to questioning anyone with pretensions to wisdom socrates enjoyed a popular following among the citys richest sons these young inquisitors roamed the streets accosting respectable citizens who claimed to know anything about art politics and power and disputing their most cherished assumptions in "the euthypro " for instance another platonic dialogue socrates effectively elevates virtue over the gods themselves whose approval was so central to athenian civic life we might like to think that in st century america we would tolerate even encourage this kind of dissent but imagine a small faction of current day intellectual elites led by a charismatic old codger dethroning canonized figures in our own history such as abraham lincoln and martin luther king jr or drumming up doubt about americas revered precepts such as the separation of powers or the right to vote tolerating such challenges even for citizens of a pluralistic republic like ours could prove daunting in a small fragile democracy like athens a provocateur inspiring a band of young devotees didnt merely get on parents nerves he got on politicians watch lists by flaunting his intellect in the agora socrates may well have been aiming to dramatize the tension that always exists between the philosopher and the city he certainly knew the stakes some years before the conservative comic playwright aristophanes had had a huge hit at the athenian box office with his play "the clouds " which satirized socrates tinkering about in his "thinkery " counting fleas on pins and prying drachma from wealthy men to educate their sons just as aristophanes was deeply suspicious of the innovative theater of euripides so he abhorred the new philosophy of socrates whose pervasive skepticism he saw destroying the fabric of everyday athenian life while "the clouds" was an exaggerated production to be sure no doubt it played on in the minds of the athenian jurors who had seen it ms wilson writes persuasively about the nuances of the trial but the bulk of "the death of socrates" reads like a fleshed out bibliographical essay on what everyone from the italian humanist marsilio ficino to the thriller writer walter mosley has made of socrates death by the renaissance ms wilson tells us socrates death "became a touchstone for those who hoped to find some way to incorporate elements of the pagan tradition into christianity " some philosophers even detected christian elements in socrates story claiming that because he followed his own "daimon" instead of the local gods he must have been an early monotheist "saint socrates pray for us " was how erasmus signed off his "religious symposium " a book that compared the philosopher to st paul socrates afterlife becomes even more dissected and more divisive in the th and th centuries when he is in turn a hero and a scourge for the best minds of their ages the victorian john stuart mill who read the platonic dialogues as a child in greek naturally famously outlined a liberal democratic order that would always have a place for eccentric citizens like socrates nietzsche took a less sanguine view seeing in socrates a deleterious species of cultural sickness for him socrates marked the beginning of the regrettable triumph of "naive rationalism" over the more visceral decisive way of life he associated with ancient greek tragedy socrates death was a hostile act that by championing a deadeningly abstract and unattainable notion of virtue precluded living authentically in the world ms wilson confesses that she shares some of nietzsches concerns "perhaps socrates has held sway over our culture too long " she writes noting that the sort of self scrutiny he advocated has won out over the tragic view of life in our time but instead of elaborating this critique ms wilson closes with a curiously banal argument against her subject not that socrates radical skepticism threatened the athenian democracy not that he ushered in an age of too much rational inquiry not even as i f stone and others have argued that athenians were actually punishing him for having collaborated with tyrants no the charge ms wilson levels is that socrates wasnt a good family man "it is hard to respect a man who neglected his wife and sons in order to spend his time drinking and chatting with his friends about the definitions of common words " she writes trivializing socrates like this is a bit like taking down al capone for tax evasion it is true that as death approaches socrates barely speaks of his family or his wife xanthippe in his prison cell he perfunctorily dismisses them in order to get on with his conversation with his male friends but even with examples like these which ms wilson draws from the dialogues it can hardly be said that for socrates family was an absent concern it seems fairer to say that he extends to the entire polis the sort of intimate interest in virtuous behavior that is usually confined to ones immediate family in the closing words of his speech to the jury socrates says "when my sons grow up punish them men and pain them in the very same way i pained you if they seem to you to care about money or anything else before virtue and if they are reputed to be something when they are nothing reproach them just as i did you tell them that they do not care for the things they should and that they suppose they are something when they are worth nothing " the man who has been condemned to death for corrupting the sons of the city ends by instructing his executioners about how to raise his own he goes to his death without the comfort of a christian afterlife or any promise of a posthumous reputation but only with faith in his own reason after years its still a resounding epitaph mr meaney is a writer in new york
