hot topic court sets its scope on handgun ban the supreme court agreed this past week to decide whether the constitution grants individuals the right to own firearms thrusting the court into a political thicket ahead of next years election the court will decide whether the district of columbias law that bans handguns generally considered to be the nations strictest violates the second amendment a federal appeals court struck down the handgun ban in march becoming the first federal court to overturn such a law on second amendment grounds the high court which is expected to hear arguments in the spring and to issue an opinion by july hasnt ruled on the issue in nearly years leaving plenty of uncertainty about its decision heres a closer look what will the court consider historians and legal scholars have long debated the exact meaning of the words of the second amendment which reads "a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed " the court will consider whether the amendment guarantees individuals rights to possess firearms as gun rights proponents have argued or if it guarantees only the collective right to own guns as part of an organized military force robert levy a fellow at the libertarian cato institute spent years planning a test case that would reach the court and recruited the lead plaintiff dick heller a district resident and security guard who had been denied a permit to keep a handgun at his home how have courts ruled in the past the supreme court last ruled on the matter in a case that upheld convictions of two men who had illegally transported sawed off shotguns the court ruled such weapons werent ordinary military equipment since then lower courts interpreted the second amendment to protect the right of a state to field a militia and not an individual right to possess firearms but over the past two decades a growing number of scholars have published research supporting the individual rights view the fifth u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans endorsed that interpretation in a case and the three judge panel of the district of columbia court of appeals followed in march with the split decision that struck down the districts handgun ban how could the court rule it is impossible to predict because the justices have ruled on very few second amendment cases four justices that dissented in a case invalidating parts of the federal brady gun control act in john paul stevens david souter ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer still are on the court meanwhile justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas have hinted at their openness to an individual rights argument and chief justice john roberts said the second amendment was still "very much an open issue" at his confirmation hearings two years ago one possible outcome could protect individuals rights while allowing states to set certain regulations on gun ownership said mark tushnet a harvard law professor and author of a new book on the gun control debate but the stakes are so high and the case is so wide open that players on both sides initially resisted efforts to bring the case forward the plaintiffs have charged that the national rifle association tried to prevent them from pursuing the case going so far as to push for a legislative repeal of the district of columbia handgun ban so the case wouldnt have standing "i myself was skeptical about the risk reward ratio of this test case " said nelson lund a constitutional law professor at george mason university who holds a professorship endowed by the nra the nras wayne lapierre acknowledges considerable "back and forth among lawyers" about the merits of bringing the case given uncertainties over how the court would rule and says the organization pushed for a repeal of the handgun ban long before the current court battle began the nra filed briefs supporting the plaintiffs before the lower courts meanwhile gun control supporters encouraged the district of columbia to relax its ban to forestall any unfavorable ruling that might open the door to more challenges against hard fought gun restrictions such as background checks or assault weapons bans "you get nervous any time youre looking at a split " said paul helmke president of the brady campaign to prevent gun violence how could the ruling influence the election over the past decade the democratic party has concluded that support for more gun restrictions has cost them votes particularly in rural areas and swing states such as tennessee ohio and nevada any ruling that threatens gun ownership could be especially troubling and the leading democratic candidates have remained quiet on the issue polls show that support for stricter gun laws has fallen considerably from highs of in to last year republican candidates have expressed support for the individual rights view including rudy giuliani who backed broad gun restrictions as mayor of new york nick timiraos points of view the supreme courts decision in this case may be the most important ever regarding the second amendment " paul helmke brady campaign to prevent gun violence "this case is about a lot more than gun control it is about fundamental visions of constitutional democracy " carl t bogus roger williams university school of law facts constitutions in states secure a right to bear arms and states have added or strengthened such rights since the third u s circuit court of appeals upheld the authority of congress to ban automatic machine guns in judge samuel alito cast the sole dissenting vote homicides in the district of columbia peaked at in up from in when the city banned handguns last year it recorded homicides and police
