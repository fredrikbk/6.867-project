weekend journal leisure &amp arts sightings the price of the ticket it costs a lot to see a broadway show is it worth the expense time for a pop quiz inspired by the stagehands strike that shut down most of broadway who said this and when did he say it "it is not for nothing that new york is the place where the critics are the most powerful and the toughest in the world it is the audience year after year that has been forced to elevate simple fallible men into highly priced experts because as when a collector buys an expensive work he cannot afford to take the risk alone the tradition of the expert valuers of works of art like duveen has reached the box office line so the circle is closed not only the artists but also the audience have to have their protection men and most of the curious intelligent nonconforming individuals stay away " that quotation is from "the empty space " an influential book about theater by peter brook the avant garde british director whose celebrated version of "a midsummer nights dream " set in an all white space and played by actors who walked on stilts and swung on trapezes was one of the most admired shakespeare productions of the s mr brook wrote "the empty space" years ago when the top ticket price on broadway was &# &# in todays dollars nowadays it will cost you anywhere between &# and &# to see "young frankenstein" unless youre prepared to fork out &# for a premium priced weekend seat speaking as one of the simple fallible new york critics mr brook had in mind i feel obliged to ask is broadway really twice as good today as it was in i recently looked up the theater listings in the "goings on about town" section of the nov issue of the new yorker zoe caldwell was starring in "the prime of miss jean brodie " lee j cobb in "king lear " dustin hoffman in "jimmy shine " james earl jones in "the great white hope " lotte lenya in "cabaret " donald pleasance in "the man in the glass booth" and maureen stapleton in "plaza suite " you could also see new plays by brian friel and arthur miller as well as the long running original productions of "fiddler on the roof " "hair " "hello dolly " "mame" and "man of la mancha " case closed well maybe not quite as i look back over my pre strike broadway reviews of the past year or so i find lurking amid the dross a fair number of memorable shows including tom stoppards "coast of utopia" trilogy and "rock n roll " the manhattan theatre clubs unforgettable revival of mr friels "translations " the roundabout theatre companys " in the shade" and "pygmalion " john doyles perception changing rethinking of stephen sondheims "company" and frank langellas sensational star turn in "frost nixon " i would gladly have paid a hundred bucks to see any one of these shows but would i have paid &# not including dinner to go to all of them with a date that last number came to mind as i read mr brooks discussion of the high cost of playgoing in even then the curious intelligent nonconforming middle class new yorkers celebrated in "the empty stage" could still afford just to visit broadway often enough to feel that they were keeping up with american theater now theyre more likely to go once or twice a year if that broadway is no longer a meaningful part of their cultural lives what are they missing both sides in the stagehands strike have had a lot to say about one another none of it nice and all of it understandably biased but local one of the international alliance of theatrical stage employees which is currently picketing broadway theaters has made one statement that seems to me incontestable "cuts in our jobs and wages will never result in a cut in ticket prices " yes it costs a whole lot more to do business on broadway now than it did in but producers have discovered that there are more than enough people willing to pay a whole lot more to see big dumb musicals like "young frankenstein" and "legally blonde " which is why such shows now dominate broadway no matter who prevails in the strike thats not going to change what has changed since is that americas regional theater companies took a huge leap forward in seriousness and significance without pricing themselves out of the reach of ordinary playgoers the top ticket price at most of the major big city regional houses is roughly &# which is what you would have paid last month to see primary stages wonderful off broadway production of horton footes "dividing the estate " thats not cheap but its doable and the further you venture off the beaten path the less youll pay to see shows for which no artistic apologies need be made triad stage of greensboro n c charged a top price of &# for the brilliant production of "tobacco road" i saw there in june as for the unforgettably fine revival of brian friels "aristocrats" mounted by chicagos strawdog theatre company that i reviewed six weeks ago it cost &# a ticket &# in dollars dont get me wrong i like musicals the same way i like ice cream sundaes but man cannot live by dessert alone and now that most of broadway is shuttered it has become clearer than ever before that there are better and cheaper places to get a steak mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and blogs about the arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com see related letter
