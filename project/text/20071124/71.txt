weekend journal leisure &amp arts masterpiece wrenched into modernity viscontis rocco and his brothers turns a clash of values within one family into a tragedy with universal resonance anatomy of a classic in the decades following world war ii millions of italians abandoned their countrys impoverished rural south and moved to its northern cities in search of work this great migration provided the manpower necessary for italys "economic miracle " which transformed it from a backward largely agricultural economy into one of the worlds major industrial powers the exodus also provided the subject for one of the finest works of italian cinemas postwar golden age "rocco and his brothers" directed by luchino visconti is far more than a portrait of italy at a particular moment of wrenching social change in dramatizing an encounter between traditional agrarian culture and modern industrial society visconti explores a phenomenon that is truly global in scope by casting the drama as a clash of values within a single family and finally within the heart of single man it becomes a tragedy with universal resonance it is the story of the five parondi brothers and their widowed mother who travel from the southern region of lucania to the thriving northern metropolis of milan the matriarch played by katina paxinou upholds an organic ideal of family "all my boys together at the same table united like the fingers of one hand " yet the ambition that inspires her to bring her sons north ultimately leads to the familys disintegration that disintegration begins almost immediately when the eldest son vincenzo spiros focas effectively renounces his role as head of the family to marry his fiancee claudia cardinale at the height of her feline allure by choosing to start a nuclear family of his own before fulfilling his traditional responsibilities to mother and brothers vincenzo espouses the individualistic ethos of modern society the focus then shifts to the next eldest brothers simone and rocco who share what seems the closest bond of any in the family but who are in most respects each others opposite simone renato salvatori is crudely handsome coarse in manner and governed by undisciplined appetites for alcohol gambling and sex alain delons rocco is scrupulous and hardworking with a natural grace reflected in his refined good looks most important rocco has an almost saintly control of his passions while simone avidly chases fast money as a professional boxer rocco dreams of returning to their hometown which he describes as a "village of olive trees of being moonstruck a village of rainbows " he has not forgotten the bestial conditions of life there but he believes that the city poses dangerous distractions from the most important values above all the familys cohesion it is in their love for the beautiful prostitute nadia annie girardot emanating vulnerability from beneath her characters bravado that the two brothers come into conflict drawn at first to simone nadia grows alarmed at his recklessness and leaves him after he begins stealing to pay for his extravagances later after a stint in prison nadia turns to rocco for whom she gives up prostitution and embraces a life of self respect at the same time rocco who has reluctantly taken up boxing begins to outshine his brother in the ring simone is overcome by a combination of professional and sexual jealousy in what is surely one of the most unbearable scenes of cruelty on film the spurned brother avenges his "cuckoldry" by raping nadia before roccos eyes here is the turning point of the story after which a tragic conclusion becomes almost inexorable rocco held back by two of his brothers henchmen and bellowing in anguish as he watches struggles to prevent the violation but afterward he refuses to comfort or even speak to nadia and though he is in every sense a stronger man than simone rocco refuses to strike back at him "you are my brother what can i do " he cries helplessly for the rest of the film rocco continues to protect and support his brother at the price of his own happiness and nadias he turns her away sending her back to simone later he mortgages his future in the form of a year contract with a boxing promoter in order to pay his dissolute brothers debts these sacrifices only bring catastrophe closer roccos tragedy is that he is bound by fraternal loyalty to defend the entire value system of the culture that he left behind noble and base tenets alike "you know what mama says if a man wants a woman and hes really a man he takes her " vincenzo explains to his outraged fiancee "he takes her without asking her permission or anyone elses " for vincenzo these words are mere rhetoric but simone lives out this savage code despite his finer instincts rocco must accept his brothers crime though it means giving up and ultimately destroying the woman he loves following a climax as terrible and pitiful as that of shakespeares "othello " the familys unity is shattered and roccos dream of returning to the ancestral soil more remote than ever yet it seems that roccos nostalgic hopes were futile all along as one of his younger brothers ciro explains at the end of the film "even in our village life will change for everyone " ciro says looking forward to the demise of peasant culture in favor of a "fairer and more honest" way of life ciro himself has demonstrated his sense of duty to wider society and the limits to fraternal loyalty by turning simone over to the police right after he delivers his speech ciro is seen among his fellow workers at a car factory no longer one of five "fingers of one hand " he is now one of hundreds in their uniform overalls obeying the siren that calls them back to the factory floor progress this may be but the human cost is unmistakable these sons of farmers have traded the constraints of one social system for those of another one that promises to be far less brutal yet inevitably more lonely mr rocca is a rome based correspondent for religion news service and the chronicle of higher education
