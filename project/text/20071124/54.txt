report about the use of performance enhancing drugs in major league baseball is expected any day now and the big question for fans and owners alike is will the document name names nobody knows but either way baseball will find itself in an unpleasant position former sen george mitchell the reports author has spent almost two years on the investigation if his report fails to mention specific players who have taken steroids human growth hormone or other drugs most followers of the game will likely see it as a toothless p r exercise if he does cite players that might set off a whole new battle about whether to punish them and if so how mr mitchell hasnt said whether his report will identify players but mlb executives are bracing for that they expect a mix of players whose names have already surfaced players under suspicion but never directly accused and those whose names will surprise outside observers the report might be released as soon as this week but no later than the years end under league drug policies beefed up between and players who fail a drug test receive a set punishment a day suspension for a first offense days for a second and a lifetime ban for a third those rules apply to anyone caught doping since by testing positive for a banned substance but mlb officials are planning to insist that current players accused in the report of doping receive stiff penalties even if the alleged cheating happened years ago and they never failed a drug test the union would fight this aggressively it agreed only grudgingly to the recently tightened drug policies after heavy external pressure including threats from congress the major league baseball players association has a long record of fighting to the end to shield its players from punishment regardless of their behavior it successfully reversed a lifetime ban of repeated cocaine user steve howe in arbitration and more recently prevented the colorado rockies from voiding the huge contract of pitcher denny neagle after he was caught soliciting a prostitute baseball is coming off a year of record attendance and by some other measures including what it says is a record &# billion in revenue this season the game appears healthy but testing the publics patience might be risky particularly given its disgust over the mounting reports of bad behavior by megamillionaire athletes with barry bondss

its investors why they should reject bhp billiton plcs &# billion all stock takeover offer and back rios own strategy for growth other than insist that the bid is too low a stance the market apparently agrees with given that rio tintos shares are trading well above the value of bhps offer rio tinto has said little the loudest critics have been big iron ore consumers chiefly steelmakers they are concerned that a combined bhp rio tinto would monopolize the market particularly in high consumption regions of the world such as asia and wield too much power over price using a previously scheduled investor meeting as their forum rio executives are expected to highlight the value of its sprawling portfolio of assets including the future value of mines and other investments that will soon begin producing returns for shareholders after years of expense according to people close to the matter in developing its defense to bhps unsolicited approach rios board is being careful to leave options open and would consider a takeover that took into account its future earnings these people said specifically rio is expected to show investors that its recent &# billion acquisition of alcan inc is worth more than the market has been wagering many investors say rio overpaid weighing down its shares while rio has been mum bhp executives have been meeting with shareholders in australia the u k europe asia and the u s bhp and rio have an unusually large number of shareholders in common at least making it easier to present its case alex vanselow bhps chief financial officer was in new york this week arguing that both companies are pursuing the same strategies for growth and going after the same assets which makes potential synergies greater for example both have mines in the same

division investors though are clearly waiting to hear more from both companies
