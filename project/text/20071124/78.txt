weekend journal sports golf journal a father son mulligan how a stormy round at carnoustie renewed a familys bond carnoustie scotland we went straight from the airport in edinburgh to carnoustie where the weather was so awful that we had the course to ourselves the wind and freezing rain were blowing sideways off the black north sea left to right at knots as we stood on the first tee my son jacks drive was swept yards off the fairway before it landed to avoid a slice i snap hooked my drive way out over the burn into the sea last winter jack turned but i kept seeing him when he was years old on the driveway skating rink id made we would stage marvelous bench clearing brawls at night before his bedtime wrestling each other to the ice beneath a sky swept with stars after ice hockey there was golf by the time jack was he and i had walked from our home in maine to washington d c and back on fairways always dreaming that he would one day earn the chance to play division i college golf when no colleges were interested in him by his senior year he began drifting away from me he had stopped believing in himself and i wondered then if fatherhood was just a long run of fixing things first its things like bikes and skateboards then its the stuff inside them stuff you cant fix in my fitful sleep one night i dreamed that jack and i had finally made it to scotland we were playing the championship course at carnoustie in the dead of winter the toughest challenge in all of golf so that whenever jack came to see me from wherever he would venture in the world as i turned into an old man i would ask him as he stepped through the door "well have you met anyone yet who played the championship course at carnoustie in the dead of winter " and he would always say "nobody but us daddy " a few days later i stopped him on the way to his room "do me a favor jack will you " "what " he asked "i want to play golf with you in scotland " i said "all right " he said we called it hysterical golf house of horrors golf the wind howling in our ears and blowing us back half a step for every step forward hands blue feet numb scorecard blown away into the sea and with it the only map we had of the course so we were blind on almost every shot the metal pins were bent so low that their flags swept the greens driver cover blown away into the thistle balls blown off the tees i loved every minute of it when we reached the tee for the third hole a yard par four all the wind off the sea was suddenly behind us i watched jack take his stance then he stepped away and repositioned himself with the ball closer to his back foot just before he swung he raised his eyes slowly and glared down the fairway as if everything that he had ever feared was out ahead of him i heard that marvelous cracking sound and then watched his ball ride low through the wind he played his wedge the same way with a low three quarter punch shot off his back foot and made birdie i had lost three balls and was strokes over par by the time we reached the sixth tee ahead of us lay the famous hole named "hogans alley " the legendary ben hogan had heard so much about how difficult carnoustie was that he arrived two weeks early for the british open and practiced every day i was reading the description of the hole to jack when the little brochure blew away too "out of bounds all the way down the left side " i yelled to him "bunkers in the middle and rough on the right " "how far are those bunkers " he yelled back as he walked up to his ball and glanced down the narrow fairway one last time "maybe yards " "im going over them " his drive carried the bunkers and landed safely all day i watched jack returning to himself some men take their children to church hoping to point the way for them through the darkness of the world i had brought my son here for the same reason on the tee box at the th that ruinous finishing hole jack surveyed the barry burn winding across the fairway just under yards from the championship tees then hit his drive over it into perfect position from there he danced a wedge close enough to make another birdie and to post a "sergio was over par after two days in the british open here " he said as we shook hands jack left home two days after his high school graduation to work at the fabled inverness club in toledo ohio where jack nicklaus played his first u s open when he was all summer my son worked hard at his game and competed in the collegiate series after one particularly tough tournament he called me and sounded like he might give up the next week i started wearing his old golf shoes to work for good luck even though they were four sizes too big he turned things around in his next tournament and called me as he was driving back to toledo "if i hadnt putted like an idiot i could have won " he said i heard the confidence in his voice ten minutes after we said goodbye he called again the coach at the university of toledo had just called him "what size shirt do you wear jack " hed asked "i want you on my team " before we hung up i remembered to ask jack if hed met anyone out in ohio who had played the championship course at carnoustie in the dead of winter "nobody but us daddy " he said mr snyder is a novelist in maine john paul newport will return next week email golfjournal wsj com
