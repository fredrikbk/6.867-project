aflac japan looks to fly again aflac inc is known in the u s mostly for its noisy duck and not much else the columbus ga supplemental insurance provider earns only around one fourth of its revenue in the states the aflac duck must be bilingual because he really stands for something in japan where aflac is the largest insurer in terms of individual policies aflac earns around of its revenue there but aflac japan was hit by a regulatory storm last year when regulators there decided to investigate how well insurers paid off on claims last month the japanese financial services authority sanctioned nonlife insurers for nonpayment of valid claims of the types of policies that aflac specializes in typically supplemental medical products initial results of the investigation released last week could further chill the japanese market as consumers digest how insurers handled paid claims on about one half of one percent of all claims paid in the past five years aflac customers received less money than they should have or aflac missed some payment triggers altogether the company says it will make good on about &# million in claims to affected customers which analyst andrew kligerman of ubs securities said could affect first quarter earnings by around one cent per share aflacs share price has been sluggish in recent months as the market tries to figure out how soon aflac will recover in japan and whether it will come through the regulatory examination unscathed aflacs new sales in japan dropped about in to &# billion the company expects the second half of the year to turn positive but no word on how positive last weeks report doesnt change that a company spokeswoman said optimism that the insurer will regain its old luster in the market even as the investigations continue had been growing up until friday aflac gained market share rapidly in japan by developing products that met the countrys need for something to fill the gap between what the national health plan covers and what patients must pay when they get sick co payments on japans national health insurance plan have tripled to as much as in the past several years one popular aflac policy pays customers cash when they get a cancer diagnosis cash that can be used to pay doctors bills or for more mundane expenses such as groceries other products allow customers to switch their policies from medical coverage to nursing care or annuities more than of the companies on the tokyo stock exchange offer aflac products to their employees ubss mr kligerman sees aflac coming to market in october with at least one new product that could prove a "sales catalyst" given the companys track record cooking up popular products but mr kligerman said he expects a slow recovery as well as a sales decline of around to in japan for the first quarter longer term mr kligerman said the regulatory investigation could end up being a positive so far it has turned up fewer problems for aflac than the other life insurers that were sanctioned which could earn aflac points with consumers he sees little in the latest report on underpayments that worries him an earlier report on nonpayments was more important he said "aflac could emerge as one of the cleaner companies" once the investigations wind up mr kligerman added there is no guarantee that aflac wont be further caught up in the investigations and there is some worry that japanese regulators are "keen to punish " mr kligerman said there has been no word on whether aflac will be punished for its claims shortfalls furthermore there is uncertainty about how japanese consumers will react to the continuing news coverage of insurers that skimped on paying claims and whether the market might be depressed longer than expected even so mr kligerman sets a one year price target of &# on aflacs stock about times his earnings per share estimate of &# aflacs peer group of life insurers typically trades at times to times forward year earnings mr kligerman said aflac should trade at a premium to that group because of its average compound annual earnings growth rate over the past several years other positive factors include aflacs continued push to train new sales agents in the country "if they get sales right the stock will be up substantially " mr kligerman said insurance rating agency a m best co has paid close attention to the regulatory atmosphere in japan and is relatively serene about the companys prospects the analyst team "does not expect regulatory findings to have an impact on any of aflacs ratings " assistant vice president carl austin said and once regulators finish reviewing company reports which began coming in friday consumer interest in the scandal may begin to wane banc of america securities analyst tamara kravec said though she sees aflac as the most "exposed" of all u s insurers to the problems in japan the company has advantages in being the market leader as well as being the low cost producer in the market banc of america securities has performed investment banking services for aflac in the last year and ubs securities has performed noninvestment banking services for aflac in the past year
