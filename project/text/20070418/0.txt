gun free zones the bucolic campus of virginia tech in blacksburg va would seem to have little in common with the trolley square shopping mall in salt lake city yet both share an important characteristic common to the site of almost every other notorious mass murder in recent years they are "gun free zones " forty american states now have "shall issue" or similar laws by which officials issue a pistol carry permit upon request to any adult who passes a background check and in most states a safety class research by carlisle moody of the college of william and mary and others suggests that these laws provide law abiding citizens some protection against violent crime but in many states there are certain places especially schools set aside as off limits for guns in virginia universities arent "gun free zones" by statute but college officials are allowed to impose anti gun rules the result is that mass murderers know where they can commit their crimes private property owners also have the right to prohibit lawful gun possession and some shopping malls have adopted anti gun rules trolley square was one as announced by an unequivocal sign "no weapons allowed on trolley square property " in february of this year a young man walked past the sign prohibiting him from carrying a gun on the premises and began shooting people who moments earlier were leisurely shopping at trolley square he killed five fortunately someone else off duty ogden utah police officer kenneth hammond also did not comply with the malls rules after hearing "popping" sounds mr hammond investigated and immediately opened fire on the gunman with his aggressive response mr hammond prevented other innocent bystanders from getting hurt he bought time for the local police to respond while stopping the gunman from hunting down other victims at virginia techs sprawling campus in southwestern va the local police arrived at the engineering building a few minutes after the start of the murder spree and after a few critical minutes broke through the doors that cho seung hui had apparently chained shut from what we know now cho committed suicide when he realized hed soon be confronted by the police but by then people had been murdered but lets take a step back in time last year the virginia legislature defeated a bill that would have ended the "gun free zones" in virginias public universities at the time a virginia tech associate vice president praised the general assemblys action "because this will help parents students faculty and visitors feel safe on our campus " in an august editorial for the roanoke times he declared "guns dont belong in classrooms they never will virginia tech has a very sound policy preventing same " actually virginia techs policy only made the killer safer for it was only the law abiding victims and not the criminal who were prevented from having guns virginia techs policy bans all guns on campus except for police and the universitys own security guards even faculty members are prohibited from keeping guns in their cars virginia tech thus went out of its way to prevent what happened at a pearl miss high school in where assistant principal joel myrick retrieved a handgun from his car and apprehended a school shooter or what happened at appalachian law school in grundy va in when a mass murder was stopped by two students with law enforcement experience one of whom retrieved his own gun from his vehicle or in edinboro pa a few days after the pearl event when a school attack ended after a nearby merchant used a shotgun to force the attacker to desist law abiding citizens routinely defend themselves with firearms annually americans drive off home invaders a half million times according to a study by the centers for disease control and prevention in utah there is no "gun free schools" exception to the licensed carry law in k schools and in universities teachers and other adults can and do legally carry concealed guns in utah there has never been a columbine style attack on a school nor has there been any of the incidents predicted by self defense opponents such as a teacher drawing a gun on a disrespectful student or a student stealing a teachers gun israel uses armed teachers as part of a successful program to deter terrorist attacks on schools buddhist teachers in southern thailand are following the israeli example because of islamist terrorism after the sept terrorist attacks in the u s long time gun control advocates including sen barbara boxer d calif agreed that making airplane cockpits into "gun free zones" had made airplanes much more dangerous for everyone except hijackers corrective legislation supported by large bipartisan majorities in both houses of congress allowed pilots to carry firearms while imposing rigorous gun safety training on pilots who want to carry in many states "gun free schools" legislation was enacted hastily in the late s or early s due to concerns about juvenile crime aimed at juvenile gangsters the poorly written and overbroad statutes had the disastrous consequence of rendering teachers unable to protect their students reasonable advocates of gun control can still press for a wide variety of items on their agenda while helping to reform the "gun free zones" that have become attractive havens for mass killers if legislators or administrators want to require extensive additional training for armed faculty and other adults thats fine better that some victims be armed than none at all the founder of the university of virginia thomas jefferson understood the harms resulting from the type of policy created at virginia tech in his "commonplace book " jefferson copied a passage from cesare beccaria the founder of criminology which was as true on monday as it always has been "laws that forbid the carrying of arms disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man " mr kopel is research director of the independence institute in golden colo and co author of the law school textbook "gun control and gun rights" nyu press
