sir robins latest solo circumnavigation has been less than smooth sailing in the same year neil armstrong landed on the moon robin knox johnston completed the first nonstop solo circumnavigation of planet earth now at age he is making another solo lap around the globe as part of the velux oceans race of the seven men who started two have dropped out and he is currently in fourth place unlike the circumnavigation that turned a young seaman into a maritime legend and earned him a knighthood this race which set out from bilbao spain on oct includes two scheduled stops first in fremantle western australia and then in norfolk va sir robin did reasonably well on the first leg finishing in third place but the second was as he puts it "a bit of a nightmare " first the automatic pilot malfunctioned shortly after he left fremantle forcing him to return to port for repairs then just as he was entering the southern ocean both of the satellite phone systems through which he received weather information failed finally the device that is supposed to hold the mainsail to the top of the foot mast came apart making it impossible for him to fully raise his most important sail despite all of this he was still holding onto third place as he neared cape horn but the accumulation of problems forced him to make another unscheduled pit stop in southern argentina and once he resumed racing he became mired in the doldrums on march when there were still nautical miles between him and norfolk there was so little wind that sir robin went swimming and used dish washing liquid to wash himself "i find it best not to think about the race its too depressing " he wrote in his daily blog by the time he reached norfolk on march he had fallen to fourth place almost two full days behind the third place finisher unai basurko a year old spaniard sir robin was bitterly disappointed "im not here just to finish " he told me a few days ago "i want to be up there i want to do well " sir robin did not come from a family of mariners but he knew that he wanted to go to sea from early childhood he became a merchant mariner after he failed the royal navys entrance examination he has always been a determined competitor until he completed his nonstop circumnavigation as part of a challenge sponsored by londons sunday times it was widely believed to be an impossible feat he was the only one of nine men who entered the contest to finish and he went on to chalk up a host of other victories and firsts in he teamed up with sir peter blake the late sailing great from new zealand to win the jules verne trophy by sailing around the world on a catamaran in just days "im a great believer in competitive sports " he says making it clear that he abhors the notion that children should be praised for their athletic performances irrespective of how well they do "you cant always win life is competitive but losing teaches you something too " he says he entered the velux oceans race to prove that he despite the passing of decades can continue to play his game and not just the seniors version he called his boat grey power until he renamed it saga insurance in recognition of his principal sponsor a company that specializes in selling financial products to britons who are or more years old "just because you turn doesnt mean your brain turns to porridge and you cant do anything anymore " he declares some have suggested that sir robins participation was financially driven because a company he runs owns the rights to the race but he says his motivation is rooted in more meaningful things and has a lot to do with the death of his wife suzanne four years ago his habit of "wandering off" for lengthy nautical adventures led her to divorce him many years ago resulting in a seven year separation but the couple friends since childhood remarried to have what he describes as a storybook marriage "the mourning process is a peculiar thing " he says "i needed to draw a line " the races final leg will begin today sir robin already knows he has no chance of winning the race but he desperately wants to earn back his third place position by the time he reaches spain it will not be easy he is hours behind the spaniard a sizable deficit to overcome during a trans atlantic crossing a short sprint by the standards of this contest the day to day reality of the race is a lot different from sir robins first trip around the world an odyssey that was more about survival than speed and that took days he was aboard suhaili a foot wooden ketch hed had built in bombay when he was based there as a merchant mariner suhaili and saga insurance both weigh about nine tons but the newer vessel thanks to the wonders of carbon fiber is twice as long and it carries sails four times as large it can maintain speeds of knots or more and hit when riding a wave suhaili averaged four knots and rarely did better than seven satellite communications is the other big change on suhaili sir robin had to spend two hours every day working with his sextant just to determine where he was because his radio broke down early in the race no one knew where he was for months at a time if something had gone wrong no one would have known this time a global positioning system effortlessly calculates his position distress beacons are ready to emit signals that would be heard around the world and he has access to satellite telephones and the internet the technological enhancements have done nothing to provide for a more comfortable ride the endless challenges of maximizing speed are both physical and strategic "chess with chin ups " sir robin frequently says there is never enough time for sleep when he does it is rarely longer than minutes at a stretch and it is usually on a narrow bench next to the navigational equipment there is no toilet only a bucket almost all of the food is freeze dried the main exception being several bottles of gentlemans relish a fish paste made mostly from anchovies which he spreads on crackers when he decides he has done something worthy of celebrating actually sir robin allows himself one other treat a cocktail hour unique among the competitors his yacht carries a supply of scotch and several two liter cartons of wine a mix of red and white when conditions allow he sits down between p m and p m glass in hand and reflects upon the days accomplishments mr knecht a journal reporter and the author of "the proving ground the inside story of the sydney to hobart race " raced across the atlantic in on the yacht that broke the year old trans atlantic race record
