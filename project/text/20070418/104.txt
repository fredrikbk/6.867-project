rethinking web traffic gauges the internet is vast the interest is immense and its effect is tangible but how to measure all that remains a multibillion dollar debate the two major firms that track internet traffic are playing down the significance of ranking web sites by "page views " the number of pages viewed on a given web property each month instead they are offering other metrics such as time spent or visits page views have been a major barometer of a web sites popularity and help set advertising rates but the measure is becoming less relevant online publishers and advertisers say page views dont capture consumer loyalty to a site or reflect the increasing popularity of online video and new technology that automatically refreshes web sites thereby depressing page views "page views as an indicator or consumption as an indicator of the vibrancy of the site becomes somewhat obsolete " said vivek shah president of digital publishing at time warner inc s time inc business and finance network "it seems a bit of a relic " peter daboll yahoo inc s head of global market research said last year that page views had outgrown their usefulness "we all need to help to wean the industry off the crutch of familiar metrics in favor of more accurate and representative ones " mr daboll wrote in a blog as the internet siphons advertising dollars from traditional media the lessened emphasis on page views is part of a broad debate over the accuracy and relevance of measurement methods in the industry at stake is the &# billion spent annually on online advertising in part because of the ability to measure the web audience and their activities in a more exact way than possible with television radio or newspapers but spats over the datas accuracy put pressure on the industry to create uniform and trusted standards for measuring web traffic since the early days of the internet page views in combination with "unique visitor" counts how many different people visited a web site at least once in a month have been used to gauge the popularity of online properties and give a rough idea of how many ads people see but the importance of the measure is changing one of the major interactive research companies netratings inc s nielsen netratings in june will release what it calls "time spent" data and stop issuing its rankings by page views the new york companys rival comscore inc said last month that it is emphasizing a measurement called "visits " which takes into account the time people return to surf a web site in a month "we dont expect it to go away " jack flanagan executive vice president of comscore said about the page view yardstick adding that "we really wanted to provide a measure that really gets towards the engagement of the user with the web sites " the catalyst for the change is new technology that automatically refreshes web sites ajax used by web sites hosted by yahoo cbs corp times sports illustrated and many others cuts the number of clicks needed to see the same amount of information at time warners cnnmoney ajax lets web surfers follow the ups and downs of stock prices without manually reloading the page the problem for publishers is that such ability translates into one page view leaving web publishers worried about their numbers that is the argument that was trotted out by yahoo when news corp s interactive sites including the social networking site myspace overtook yahoo last november as the top web site by pages viewed according to comscore of reston va yahoo responded that its page views had dropped because it uses ajax in its email service to refresh incoming messages "honestly page views have always had a hole " said scott ross senior product manager of nielsen netratingss netview service page views also dont measure instant messaging flash technology and online video publishers also can skew their page view numbers by for example spreading a long news story into three screens instead of one changing technology is one factor putting pressure on measurement methods web publishers talk about the importance of "engagement " or how loyal users are to a site rather than a sheer volume of web traffic the change could alter the ranking of top internet properties under comscores new "visits" measure for example facebook the social networking site would have ranked second among all u s web sites in february with average visits that month by unique visitors facebook was ranked th as advertisers ramp up spending on the internet the issue will increase in importance "data right now is the holy grail for online advertising " said chris portella associate media director with organic a digital marketing agency owned by omnicom group inc web companies complain about the data from nielsen netratings and comscore which can differ wildly from one another and the web publishers internal traffic numbers to ensure they are relevant the research firms are working with the industry to define the right measures and to ensure their methods are transparent to publishers and marketers "we want to make sure were giving the marketers good metrics against which to choose where theyre spending their money " said sheryl draizen senior vice president and general manager at the interactive advertising bureau "we will work to figure out measurement standards so marketers can feel confident " the bureau is pushing comscore and nielsen netratings to validate their numbers with the media ratings council the board that sanctions independent ratings for radio and television ms draizen said comscore and nielsen ratings are moving too slowly for an issue that "has a material impact on other peoples business " there is also recognition that the new web measures may soon become obsolete netratingss mr ross readily concedes the current page view successors arent the last word in metrics but rather the logical step in online evolution "the internet is always about inventing and reinventing " he said "in the interim page views have to be brought down in relevance "
