me &amp my car columnist jonathan welsh answers readers questions about automobiles q my wife was on the verge of buying an acura tsx when she learned it failed the insurance institute for highway safetys rear end crash test the dealer claimed the iihs isnt reliable as its only concern is saving insurance companies money your advice jon d levenson newton mass a the rear end crash test is relatively new and some auto makers who for years designed cars to perform well in frontal and side impact crashes havent fared well in the rear end tests some manufacturers however have quickly made changes in order to get a top rating of "good" on the tests the iihs a safety research and testing unit funded by the insurance industry does focus on how much its companies wind up paying as a result of traffic accidents however the groups crash test safety ratings dont appear to be skewed based on repair costs indeed it uses a different series of tests to rate cars on how well they resist damage in low speed collisions q my current cars dont get excellent gas mileage so im considering the new toyota camry and the new nissan altima hybrids both offer more functionality than smaller hybrids like the prius but i also like the toyota for its reputation for reliability and longevity and the nissan for its styling your thoughts jim sachs boston a having driven both cars i prefer the camry over the altima yes they use the same basic hybrid power system but the toyotas drive train operates more smoothly and is less intrusive the altima always seemed to be reminding us it was different and i noticed the often abrupt transitions the car makes from electric to gasoline i found both models have fuel economy that tops their gasoline only sibling cars q the choices are lexus sc or mercedes benz clk convertible based on cachet residual value fun of driving and reliability which one do you like louis d lerner houston a for a lot of people the clk will always win the cachet contest simply because it is a mercedes but for reliability the lexus certainly has the edge both cars are powerful and heavy with suspensions tuned more for highway cruising than for carving sharp bends on twisting back roads so i doubt either would be fun to drive in the manner of a sports car but during my last test drive of a lexus sc i did find it an extremely fun car to be seen in its rounded styling while not for everyone is more distinctive and interesting than the mercedes shape questions can be e mailed to mecar wsj com
