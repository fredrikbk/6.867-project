politics &amp economics lawmakers press lenders for subprime relief washington congressional lawmakers appear resistant to calls for a federal bailout of distressed subprime mortgage borrowers joining regulators instead in ratcheting up pressure on lenders and investors to cut vulnerable homeowners some slack but while a consensus is emerging on the need to aid delinquent borrowers particularly by convincing lenders to restructure troubled loans in an effort to reduce foreclosures the fact that most subprime mortgages are pooled together and sold as securities remains a major obstacle to providing widespread relief subprime loans are high cost loans and refinancing instruments made to borrowers who often have weak or shaky credit in recent days attention has focused on how the federal government can help the most vulnerable subprime borrowers particularly those who have taken out adjustable rate mortgages that are due to reset to significantly higher interest rates in the months ahead one proposal floated by consumer advocacy groups has been to place a temporary moratorium on foreclosures another line of thought being championed by sen charles schumer of new york chairman of the joint economic committee and democratic sen jack reed of rhode island is to channel funds to groups that help borrowers struggling to make payments escape foreclosure democrats and republicans have been careful to say they wont legislate a "bailout " which ostensibly would pay off the balance of delinquent loans to protect peoples credit while other legislative approaches are debated congress is pushing regulators and the industry into action sen christopher dodd d conn chairman of the senate banking committee lambasted regulatory inaction earlier this year banking overseers responded by proposing to improve underwriting standards on subprime loans now with so many subprime loans going bad and worries mounting that other credit markets will be affected the emphasis is pushing regulators to get lenders and the investors that buy most subprime mortgages that have been packaged into securities to modify individual mortgages risky adjustable rate mortgages for example could be restructured into the greater predictability of a year fixed rate loan testifying at a hearing in the house financial services committee yesterday federal deposit insurance corp chairman sheila bair said banks and investors contributed to the boom in subprime lending with exotic products and loose standards so they should be held accountable now that times are tougher "i think we should hold the servicers and investors feet to the fire on this " ms bair said "it was clear to investors that these were high risk i think everybody needs to share the pain now " ms bair said "unanimous agreement" was reached between regulators and banking executives at a forum she hosted monday on the need to be flexible with distressed subprime borrowers and restructure endangered loans she also noted that "a number of loan servicers are proactively contacting borrowers several months before their loans are due to reset to determine the prospect of repayment and modifying loan terms if necessary to avoid default " yesterday afternoon the federal reserve fdic and other banking regulators released a statement encouraging lenders to pursue "workout arrangements" or loan modifications with distressed borrowers mr dodd will hold a "homeownership preservation" summit with banking representatives and consumer groups today but roughly of subprime loans were packaged and sold as securities in so there are limits to how many troubled loans can be modified with subprime loans being purchased and sold in global securities markets it can be difficult to track down loans so they can be extracted and restructured moreover agreements governing the creation of mortgage backed securities can limit the ability of loan servicers to modify mortgages thus many subprime borrowers and lenders will be restricted in restructuring loans leading homeowners to seek relief from groups such as the neighborhood assistance corporation of america which has pledged &# billion to "rescue the victims of predatory lenders "
