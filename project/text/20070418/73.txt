marketing success of proactiv leads to new directions questions for greg renker and ben van de bunt company guthy renker corp title co chief executive officer &amp principal and executive vice president guthy renker is a fixture of the direct marketing world famous for filling the airwaves with infomercials for such products as videos of dean martins celebrity roasts and a skin care system from victoria principal in recent years though guthy renker has made a splash with infomercials for the proactiv acne skin care system entertainers such as kelly clarkson and jessica simpson appear in the half hour long ads talking about their struggles with acne sometimes the ads even show pictures of their famous faces with blemishes lately the firm has become more aggressive in its proactiv marketing guthy renker has already begun to employ two minute long ads for the product now it is mulling something heretical for a direct marketer running commercials on network television in prime time guthy renker has a lot at stake it has the exclusive license to market and distribute proactiv on behalf of the products dermatologist creators while proactiv is mainly available through a toll free number it is sold at a limited number of mall outlets where guthy renker has some control over kiosks where the product is available below greg renker the companys co chief executive officer and ben van de bunt a principal and executive vice president discuss the marketing of proactiv and why they limit its distribution channels the wall street journal celebrities including jessica simpson p diddy kelly clarkson and lindsay lohan have appeared in your commercials for a more mainstream advertiser such as a brand of soda or computer getting even one of them would be a coup how do you secure their services and what is the cost mr renker we usually hear first that the celebrities are using proactiv and have done so for years we pick up on it from magazines internet web sites basically we have a network thats constantly trying to ferret out or hear the information that will take us there if we hear that certain celebrities have an acne problem and are using our product we are sure to contact them if we think they are a good proponent of the brand and could attract a new audience we basically seek a meeting and do the best we can in terms of encouraging them to come aboard right now we have more celebrities than we do slots to put them in and thats partly because we pay well mr van de bunt our marketing method is a storytelling method so therefore the celebrity use of the product and their confidence in the product is really important to us which you dont always get with other consumer products and celebrities in terms of payment they usually put in one or two days a year and we will pay them as much as &# million wsj since launching proactiv in you have continued to try out new ad formats along with the traditional half hour infomercial you have also used direct response ads that are about two minutes long and take up an entire ad break now you are contemplating traditional second ads in prime time why after all you have done well without running traditional tv ads mr van de bunt we dont know for sure it will work but its certainly worth testing mr renker when vanessa williams is in an episode of ugly betty putting a commercial with her in there is better targeting than a random two minute spot at in the morning on an obscure cable channel our goal is to maximize the frequency of an ads impressions so that we can cause more intense excursions directly to our product web site wsj what would keep you from running ads in prime time shows such as "greys anatomy" or "americas next top model" mr van de bunt the main thing would be the price of the ads mr renker the only way we grow and survive is by causing viewership and causing them to take an action thats our specialty so the pitfall of the second commercial is if we dont have good measurement good measurement is going to be the most important thing and the ability to cause an action so if it didnt perform were not buying we measure our sales not our eyeballs mr van de bunt if we expected x response during prime time hours and all of a sudden we got x we would have a pretty good idea that it was worth it if we didnt see that lift shortly after we aired it it wouldnt matter if it were the super bowl the eyeballs wouldnt matter much to us wsj why not make proactiv available through different stores and multiple outlets mr van de bunt we sell proactiv in malls in kiosks which we control and we also sell them though other channels of distribution where we get to control the marketing message mr renker did ben mention the world control good because that consumer relationship is the secret sauce of our product and our brands we dont want to be diluted by clerks and or retail outlets who dont understand the significance of what they are representing wsj what has been the trend for sales over the years mr van de bunt for proactiv the first two years were us learning what the consumer wanted how to price the product even what quantities to deliver to maximize consumer responsiveness since then once we figured it out its grown in the early years at down to i think our sales last year were up between and wsj wouldnt more advertisers be better off using a model where they place ads according to the response they generate mr van de bunt you really have to have an appetite to do this many many times and fail a lot and figure out what works and moves and all the major brands that have come in to direct response seem to have done it as a one time toe in the water
