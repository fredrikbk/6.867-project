antidepressants get a boost for use in teens despite warnings on labels study says benefits outweigh risks of suicidal tendencies in findings that doctors say should reassure parents about the use of antidepressants in young people a new analysis concludes that the benefits of the drugs outweigh the risk of suicidal behavior the report published today in jama the journal of the american medical association analyzed studies of young people being treated with antidepressants for depression as well as obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety disorders and found that the risk of suicidal thinking or behavior is smaller than previously thought in particular the study found that for every patients being treated with the medications fewer than one or had an increased risk of suicidal thoughts there were no completed suicides in any of the studies the analysis also found that antidepressants were more effective than placebos in treating children and teens for major depression obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety these findings throw into question the mass of criticism that has been heaped on antidepressants in recent years over concerns that the drugs may cause an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in young people those concerns culminated in a major regulatory change in the food and drug administration began requiring drug companies to put tough "black box" warnings on the drugs labels to advise doctors and patients about the risks of suicidal behaviors in children and adolescents in december the fda proposed extending such warnings to patients up to age now given what researchers describe as the small risk compared with clear benefits some psychiatrists believe that the fda should consider modifying or removing the black box warnings "i definitely think the language should be balanced" with information about the risk of suicide associated with depression itself says jeff bridge an epidemiologist and investigator at columbus childrens research institute who was lead author on the study indeed some critics of the black box warnings have pointed out that suicidal tendencies are a risk of depression so it may be hard to identify whether behaviors are due to a drug or to the underlying disease and many psychiatrists have credited the availability of antidepressants with a drop in teen suicides the rates of teen suicide had decreased starting in the s after antidepressants such as prozac and paxil powerful selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors hit the market since the fda added the black box warnings there has been evidence of a drop in the use of antidepressants among kids an analysis by medco health solutions a pharmacy benefits manager showed an almost decline in the number of people age and younger using an antidepressant in compared with along with a further drop in the figures are based on a sample of about million people in medcos database the company manages benefits for about million americans some experts say that this drop in the use of antidepressants among young people led to a rise in teenage suicides from to the suicide rate for americans under age increased by according to the centers for disease control and prevention the new report a so called meta analysis of existing research was led by researchers at ohio state university it examined data on patients in the studies and found the risk of suicide behavior in young people to be half what the fda had determined before requiring its black box warning the fda had conducted its own analysis of studies and about patients which found that two out of patients had an increased risk of suicidal thoughts the researchers on the new report said they included additional studies that came out last year and used a different statistical method from the fda to compile the risk and benefit figures in a statement the fda said "the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior is essentially the same by their or our calculations " the agency said it planned to keep the black box warning on the drugs noting it urges doctors to carefully monitor patients starting antidepressant treatment and does not suggest avoiding the drugs like the fdas analysis the new study looked at several antidepressants including eli lilly &amp co s prozac pfizers zoloft wyeths effexor glaxosmithkline plcs paxil and forest laboratories inc s celexa a spokeswoman for wyeth said the company "welcomed" efforts like the jama analysis that look at the benefits and risks of antidepressants the other companies didnt return calls seeking comment late yesterday the analysis of benefits confirmed what doctors say has been their experience with these drugs among of the studies involving treatment for major depression of patients receiving antidepressants responded to the drugs compared with on placebo or fake pills six studies looked at obsessive compulsive disorder and found that of patients responded to antidepressants compared with in the placebo group an additional six studies involved treatment for anxiety disorders and found of patients on medication improved compared with in the placebo group the new analysis which was funded by the national institutes of health and the robert wood johnson foundation also looked at the effects of the drugs by age and found that only prozac was effective at treating children age and younger for major depression compared with placebo indeed prozac is the only antidepressant that is fda approved to treat major depression in children some drugs such as zoloft are approved for other uses in children such as treating obsessive compulsive disorder many experts believe that the tough fda warnings on the medications are discouraging families from getting needed treatment for children and adolescents "the take home question is what is the risk to your child of not taking the medicine " says harold s koplewicz founder and director of the new york university child study center he compared the risk of not giving a depressed child or teenager an antidepressant with not giving a child a vaccine "we know that measles and mumps are not always deadly but we dont want our children to have these diseases " he said "but with depression we absolutely know it can be lethal " and some parents say that antidepressants can make a huge difference in the health of a child sherri waltons daughter jordan suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder and had been taking an antidepressant luvox since she was years old but a few years ago when she was jordan became severely depressed and told her parents she no longer wanted to dance go to school or live mrs walton took her back to the child psychiatrist who tweaked her medications for several months eventually settling on prozac she gained about pounds but her depression lifted almost immediately and her ocd symptoms stayed in check mrs walton who took her daughter to washington to testify before the fda when the agency was holding its hearings on antidepressant use in children says "i wanted them to know that these antidepressants literally saved her life " psychiatrists are quick to point out however that drugs alone are not the answer "this study confirms the general consensus that these medications can be an effective component of treatment for children and adolescents with depression and other psychiatric disorders " says david fassler child and adolescent psychiatrist and clinical professor of psychiatry at the university of vermont in burlington vt but he cautioned "it should only be used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan that is individualized to the needs of the child and the family "
