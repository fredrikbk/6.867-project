dow industrials regain ground on buyout wave after february plunge market nears a record echoes of s froth less than two months after plunging points on feb the dow jones industrial average has quietly pushed its way back nearly matching its record yesterday the blue chip average ended just points short of its all time closing high of on feb rising points or to whats driving the run up it isnt the economy economic growth has been slowing instead its the ocean of cheap loans available to private investment funds thats permitting them to buy publicly traded companies and take them private bidding up share prices in the process the current wave of buyouts has swelled to a point that in many ways it now dwarfs the buyout frenzy of the s skeptics are worried that the growing fascination with such deals may be distracting investors from taking a hard look at the performance of the companies whose stocks they own injecting an element of froth into the market as happened in the s buyout firms known today by the more genteel label "private equity firms" are pulling off takeover deals of a size rarely before imagined the firms typically use a combination of funds they raise from big investors and lots of debt to buy public companies and retool them outside the public spotlight in hopes of cashing out later at a profit more than &# billion in buyouts were announced in according to thomson financial that figure includes the debt owed by the target companies when the deals were announced last years deals were three times the number announced in thomson says so far this year almost &# billion in buyouts have been announced putting the value of deals this year on pace to surpass &# billion that compares with &# billion in at the height of the s boom just this week student loan company slm corp known as sallie mae agreed to be taken private for &# billion and bce inc canadas largest telecommunications company said it is exploring the possibility of being taken private by a group led by big canadian pension funds wall street has embraced the trend most major brokerage firms now put together detailed lists of potential buyout targets whose stocks they often urge clients to buy analysts have begun rating a stocks value based not only on factors like the companys profit outlook but also on the chance that it might be bought out investors have begun to seek out potential buyout targets hoping for a takeover that would sharply boost the stocks price and in many cases companies are responding to the new climate by issuing debt and buying back their own stock to boost share prices and placate shareholders hungry for bigger returns "the enormous amount of money the buyout firms have puts a safety net under the market " says byron wien chief investment strategist at hedge fund pequot capital management theres an irony in the way the stock market is celebrating a process that removes companies from the publics reach on a simple supply and demand basis that decreases the overall supply of stock pushing up prices in each of the past three years more stock has been withdrawn from the market through buyouts and corporate share buybacks than has been issued last year a net &# billion in u s corporate stock was taken off the market up from &# billion in according to the federal reserve owning the shares of a company that becomes the target of a buyout can lead to instant gains last friday shares of sallie mae rose on reports that it was in buyout talks they rose another on monday when the deal was announced with investors hankering to benefit from the next leveraged buyout "screening" for companies that could be possible buyout targets has become commonplace on wall street the shares of such companies often singled out because they are laggards or are otherwise vulnerable have shot up so much that fewer and fewer of them fit the bill "the lbo lists have been picked over as the theme has caught on " says sanford c bernstein chief investment officer vadim zlotnikov in an attempt to keep up with buyout firms appetite for deals that seemed heretofore impossible mr zlotnikov late last year relaxed the criteria for his own lbo screening portfolio managers at minneapolis money management firm riversource investments an arm of ameriprise financial inc that oversees &# billion say buyout firms have become so influential that their actions have become an important factor for stock picking "it is simply an area that you cant ignore if you are going to assess the fair value of companies these days " says riversource portfolio manager paul stocking mr stocking likes to evaluate stock prices based on factors like the companies sales profits cash flow and breakup value since late or early he says his group has added buyout prospects to that equation when companies in fields such as real estate health care or manufacturing are taken private he asks the firms analysts to find similar companies that might be bought out in the future many other investors seem to be doing the same thing this week the shares of mortgage lender countrywide financial corp have risen more than in part because of takeover speculation spurred by the sallie mae deal until recently the stocks that benefited the most were small and medium size companies that were easier to take over which helps explain why those stocks have risen faster than larger stocks for the past several years but as lists of smaller buyout candidates have been picked over buyout firms have turned to larger targets asked whether there is an upper limit on the size of potential targets mr stocking pauses "we have had debates about that " he says "there is probably a ceiling but it is awfully high " the biggest buyout of the s boom was the purchase of rjr nabisco by kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co for &# billion before adjustment for inflation that number was surpassed this year by the proposed &# billion acquisition of txu corp by kkr and tpg inc formerly known as texas pacific group other giant deals have included last years purchase of hospital operator hca inc for &# billion by bain capital kkr and merrill lynch &amp co and the buyout of equity office properties trust plc by blackstone group for &# billion even the suggestion that an analyst thinks a company is a buyout candidate can move the stock when morgan stanley analyst brian mcgough raised his price target for shares of surf wear and ski maker quiksilver inc earlier this month he noted that the company was trading below his estimate of a potential buyout price quiksilver shares jumped after his report thats what happened in the buyout craze of the late s when fund managers were grabbing shares of companies whose stock prices were thought to be trading below potential buyout prices what were known as "private market value models" flourished until october when financing troubles in a planned buyout of united airlines parent ual corp helped send the dow down in one day some worry that the markets current preoccupation with buyouts could be setting it up for another bout of trouble if buyout demand fades larger companies are more difficult to take private thats one reason the dow industrials have lagged behind many broader indexes of late but many larger companies have been mimicking what buyout firms do by buying back their own shares and taking on more debt through buybacks last year for example dow component caterpillar inc reduced its shares outstanding by million at the same time its long term debt rose by &# billion mr wien of pequot worries about the long term consequences of the boom buyout firms often lay off workers or might cut research and investment spending to reduce costs and generate more cash but this process might also diminish the growth prospects of some companies private equity investors say they are making these companies more efficient but mr wien has his doubts "if youre an lbo buyer you dont have the same long term focus that you do if youre running a company for eternity " he says others worry that buyouts are distracting investors from critical fundamentals like growth and profit prospects "the annoying thing is nothing is cheap " says jeffrey bronchick chief investment officer at los angeles based money management firm reed conner &amp birdwell "the worse a company is performing the more attention it gets if it goes from mediocrity to disaster the stock goes up " at some point he thinks financing for a proposed deal will fall through like it fell through for ual in but with private equity firms awash in cash and credit easy to come by that might not happen soon "its like the internet bubble " he says "its so obvious it will end badly but you dont know when "
