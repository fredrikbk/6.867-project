china crimps hong kong ipos regulator steers new listings to mainland hong kong a push by chinas securities regulator to encourage more listings on mainland markets could affect the pipeline of initial public offerings in hong kong according to three people familiar with the situation in hong kong and beijing the china securities regulatory commission has held up approvals of listings for class h shares while encouraging companies to list as class a shares the move has claimed several hong kong listing casualties this year class h shares are stocks of chinese companies based on the mainland and listed in hong kong while class a shares denominated in yuan are listed on the mainland "the csrc has told several h share listing candidates that they should list in shanghai first " said a lawyer who worked with several companies on class h share offerings "the csrc says it has no such policy but it is open about building up the a share market and improving that markets quality unlike the central government which is committed to hong kongs status as a financial center the h share market isnt the csrcs concern " a banker at a u s brokerage firm said the new csrc stance isnt written policy but is imparted verbally to companies and listing sponsors working on class h share offerings the csrc didnt return repeated phone calls and a fax seeking comment chinese companies seeking to list in hong kong need the approval of the csrc first even before they get listing approval from the hong kong stock exchanges listing committee "this unofficial policy is already affecting the pipeline of h share issues " said a banker at a foreign investment bank "were finding a lot of companies we approach as potential clients are saying theyll opt for an a share listing because there will be a clearer timeline than if they go the h share route " that is bad news not just for hong kong exchanges &amp clearing ltd the operator of hong kongs exchange but also for the many international investment banks that rely on class h listings for underwriting income aside from wholly chinese owned investment banks only ubs ags ubs securities goldman sachs group inc s goldman sachs gao hua securities co and china international capital corp held in a passive investment by morgan stanley can underwrite class a share offerings last year companies raised &# billion in hong kong ipos of which &# billion was from chinese companies according to dealogic "so far this year id guess just of funds raised were from chinese firms " said pricewaterhousecoopers partner edmond chan traditionally the best chinese firms tended to list in hong kong because of that markets stronger reputation for corporate governance and its less volatile performance compared with mainland markets so far the casualties of the recent practice include a &# million hong kong listing by west mining co a zinc and nickel miner a &# million ipo by tianjin lishen battery co which makes lithium ion batteries and a &# million offering by chongqing city commercial bank a small lender in southwest china according to people familiar with the proposed deals all three are now planning to list in shanghai instead this year one way around the recent practice especially for megadeals of more than &# billion seems to be to add a domestic offering to an already planned h share ipo for example the originally planned &# billion h share ipo of china citic bank corp was given the go ahead after a class a portion was added just a few months ago according to a banker familiar with the deal still there are likely to be more casualties of the recent practice one banker at a u s bank said even chinese companies that already have hong kong listings are being encouraged to raise funds by seeking new listings in shanghai and shenzhen instead of staging follow on offerings in hong kong the banker said heavyweights listed in hong kong such as china mobile ltd the nations largest mobile phone service operator by subscribers petrochina co chinas largest listed producer of oil and gas by volume aluminum corp of china ltd or chalco and bank of communications co are just a few that have announced plans to list in shanghai indicating the csrcs new stance on encouraging domestic fund raising bank of communications had its a share ipo approved by the csrc on monday while the shanghai
