texting when theres trouble state of the art systems can blast mass warnings to cellphones and pcs the evening before an ice storm swept over the university of texas at austin in january administrators sent an urgent message to its students faculty and staff stay home tomorrow thanks to a state of the art emergency communications system students instantaneously received the alert as text messages on their cellphones and via email on their pcs building managers received a similar message on their pagers and the university issued the warning live on local radio and television stations the next day the campus was empty and there were no weather related incidents "it worked very well " said rhonda weldon a member of the universitys emergency communications team with administrators at virginia tech facing hard questions about how long it took them to notify students after the first killings in mondays shooting rampage there emergency communication is sure to become a pressing issue nationwide the ubiquity of relatively new technologies allows electronic alerts to reach more people faster than ever before in the aftermath of several recent disasters including the tsunami in south asia hurricane katrina on the gulf coast and the terrorist attacks in new york london and madrid a growing number of governments communities school systems and universities have begun using automated electronic alert systems that can send voice email or text messages to residents and students in addition to traditional broadcast emergency messages the services mean that people no longer need to be listening to radio watching tv logged on to their email or near a home phone to be warned of trouble "weve never had a culture that was more accessible to being informed " said gerard braud a louisiana based crisis communications consultant adding that "when you dont communicate rapidly either in advance of or during an event people get hurt " emergency systems that include text messages are easily available and generally arent very expensive some new pilot programs even are supported by advertising ms weldon says text messaging is particularly efficient because students carry their cellphones all the time "theyll see text messages before they open up their emails " she says not only do people need access to the internet she says email is also slowest to reach recipients it could take one hour to hours to send an email to all users more traditional systems feature automated callers that can blast a prerecorded message to thousands of people in a matter of seconds teleparent educational systems llc charges &# to &# per student per year for automated phone alert services school administrators can go online and record

pager and the internet hundreds of communities and schools already have electronic communications systems westchester county n y can send residents email text messages and phone messages in case of a serious emergency at virginia tech emergency communications on monday included email but not cellphone text messages amid questions about whether virginia tech administrators should have more quickly closed campus and canceled classes what is clear is that the university lacks any means of immediately alerting its roughly students faculty and staff to an emergency of course any system is only as good as the information officials have at any time at virginia tech authorities originally thought the shooting of the first two students was a "domestic" dispute that wouldnt require a more robust response two hours after the first two people were shot in a dormitory the university sent the first of four email blasts to students faculty and staff the first note sent at a m warned all "to be cautious" and encouraged people to report any suspicious activity a call about another shooting at a classroom building across campus arrived at a m prompting another university email sent five minutes later "a gunman is loose on campus stay in buildings until further notice stay away from all windows " no mention of the actual massacre or its location in norris hall was sent until more than an hour after it occurred according to reports the university also relied on its web site and the dormitory phone system but administrators have acknowledged that these methods cant reach the thousands who at any moment arent logged on to the internet while the dormitory phone system cant reach the students who live off campus the school began exploring the installation of an emergency alert system that issues text messages to mobile phones last semester after having trouble spreading an alert in august about the escape of a jail inmate who shot and killed two people and then hid on campus before being caught
