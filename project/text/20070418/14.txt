business bookshelf the importance of crunching the numbers competing on analytics by thomas h davenport and jeanne g harris harvard business school press pages &# the new york police department does it the harrahs casinos in las vegas do it and businesses like netflix are built entirely on the basis of it it in this case is using the sophisticated analysis of data or "analytics" to drive decisions as a concept analytics is neither new nor complicated any dieter standing on the bathroom scale can attest that numbers are a more reliable source of information than intuition or a spouses kind opinion you might feel fit but the numbers dont lie in "competing on analytics " thomas h davenport and jeanne g harris try to explain this "new science of winning" as their subtitle has it having data to analyze the authors explain is only a start you need the right data the people to analyze it properly a keen understanding of what you are trying to do with the findings and not least managers who have the guts to stick to decisions based on the results mr davenport and ms harris are at their best when they turn from broad generalizations to concrete examples these include the dvd rental company netflix its complex analytical model helps predict what films subscribers will want and how long they will keep them and the new york police department which has relied on the compstat computer statistics system since to map and track criminal activity and to guide the deployment of nypd forces in las vegas where numbers rule harrahs uses loyalty cards to track what customers get up to in its casinos the "total rewards" cards plugged into slot machines or gaming tables pile up points redeemable for "comps" such as free drinks and hotel rooms but in addition to rewarding gamblers for their spending the company also can use the information to intervene in real time to lure gamblers off the casino floor if they are losing too much money too fast the bait that harrahs deploys is a restaurant coupon that expires within the hour although any business with the right leadership and financial resources can head down the path of becoming an analytic competitor doing so doesnt guarantee success large u s airlines were "pioneers in adopting such analytical approaches as yield management for seat pricing " mr davenport and ms harris note but the companies have not been able to overcome other hurdles such as obsolete business models and lousy customer service much of what the authors refer to as analytics might sound like plain old fashioned number crunching but contemporary computer driven analytics is a much more complicated and expensive matter it allows companies to corral staggering amounts of information and to sift the numbers to a degree unimaginable years ago on wall street financial institutions have embraced so called trading algorithms or software programs that rely on reams of historical trading data to make buy or sell decisions if shares of a small semiconductor maker for example routinely follow moves made by its larger competitors the computers on wall street will know this and following a jump in intels stock price will make an instant decision on whether to buy or sell the smaller companys stock and know how many seconds to wait before doing so one of the key costs in developing an analytic program the authors emphasize is talent the software can be pricey as well but at least its readily available the statisticians mathematicians and engineers who understand how best to put the software to use "are a scarce ingredient in analytical competition " where jobs having to do with analytics are posted the salaries range from &# plus bonus to more than &# college students should take note for most of these positions mbas need not apply companies are looking for doctorates in statistics physics and operations research that said of course the outcome of analytics work has to be deployed by managers whose highest qualification is likely to be an mba a fact that highlights the importance of "spreading analytical orientations throughout the organization " as the management speak of that phrase might suggest mr davenport and ms harris are business consultants with roots in academia and think tanks they rely on flow charts with titles such as the "road map to becoming an analytical competitor " a typical illustration draws the "four pillars of analytical competition " fewer simplistic breakdowns and more details would have been welcome "competing on analytics" is hardly the last word on the matter but it is a useful primer for a business field that seems likely only to grow in importance mr hadi is a reporter covering options trading for dow jones newswires and often writes about technology on wall street
