medical quandary indias skewed sex ratio puts ge sales in spotlight are ultrasounds used to abort selectively a clinics violations indergarh india general electric co and other companies have sold so many ultrasound machines in india that tests are now available in small towns like this one theres no drinking water here electricity is infrequent and roads turn to mud after a march rain shower a scan typically costs &# or a weeks wages ge has waded into indias market as the country grapples with a difficult social issue the abortion of female fetuses by families who want boys campaigners against the practice and some government officials are linking the countrys widely reported skewed sex ratio with the spread of ultrasound machines thats putting ge the market leader in india under the spotlight it faces legal hurdles government scrutiny and thorny business problems in one of the worlds fastest growing economies "ultrasound is the main reason why the sex ratio is coming down " says kalpana bhavre who is in charge of women and child welfare for the datia district government which includes indergarh having a daughter is often viewed as incurring a lifetime of debt for parents because of the dowry payment at marriage compared to that the cost of an ultrasound "is nothing " she says for more than a decade the indian government has tried to stop ultrasound from being used as a tool to determine gender the devices use sound waves to produce images of fetuses or internal organs for a range of diagnostic purposes india has passed laws forbidding doctors from disclosing the sex of fetuses required official registrations of clinics and stiffened punishments for offenders nevertheless some estimate that hundreds of thousands of girl fetuses are aborted each year ge by far the largest seller of ultrasound machines here through a joint venture with indian outsourcing giant wipro ltd has introduced its own safeguards even though that means forsaking sales "we stress emphatically that the machines arent to be used for sex determination " says v raja chief executive of ge healthcare south asia "this is not the root cause of female feticide in india " but the efforts have failed to stop the problem as a growing economy has made the scans affordable to more people the skewed sex ratio is an example of how indias strong economy has in unpredictable ways exacerbated some nagging social problems such as the traditional preference for boys now some activists are accusing ge of not doing enough to prevent unlawful use of its machines to boost sales "there is a demand for a boy thats been completely exploited by multinationals " says puneet bedi a new delhi obstetrician he says ge and others market the machines as an essential pregnancy tool although the scans often arent necessary for mothers in low risk groups earlier this month prosecutors in the city of hyderabad brought a criminal case against the ge venture with wipro as well as erbis engineering co the medical equipment distributor in india for japans toshiba corp in the suits the district government alleges that the companies knowingly supplied ultrasound machines to clinics that werent registered with the government and were illegally performing sex selection tests the penalty is up to three months in prison and a fine of rupees both companies deny wrongdoing and say they comply with indian laws a ge spokesman said yesterday the company hadnt received court notification but its legal team would be looking into the charges vivek paul who helped build the early ultrasound business in india first as a senior executive at ge and then at wipro says blame should be pinned on unethical doctors not the machines suppliers "if someone drives a car through a crowded market and kills people do you blame the car maker " says mr paul who was wipros chief executive before he left the company in mr paul is now a managing director at private equity specialists tpg inc formerly known as texas pacific group india has been a critical market to ge its outsourcing operations have helped the fairfield conn giant cut costs the country also is a growing market for ges

sullivan which describes ge as the clear market leader other vendors include siemens ag philips electronics nv and mindray international medical ltd a new chinese entrant for indias price sensitive customers india has long struggled with an inordinate number of male births and female infanticide the killing of newborn baby girls remains a problem the abortion of female fetuses is a more recent trend but unless "urgent action is taken " its poised to escalate as the use of ultrasound services expands the united nations childrens fund said in a report this year indias "alarming decline in the child sex ratio" is likely to exacerbate child marriage trafficking of women for prostitution and other problems the report said the latest official indian census in showed a steep decline in the relative number of girls aged years from years earlier girls for every boys compared with in in much of northwest india the number of girls has fallen below for every boys in the northern state of punjab the figure is below only china today has a wider gender gap with girls born for every boys among infants aged years according to unicef ge sells about three times as many ultrasound machines in china as in india in january the chinese government pledged to improve the gender balance including tighter monitoring of ultrasounds some experts predict china will be more effective than india in enforcing its rules given its success at other population control measures boys in india are viewed as wealth earners during life and lighters of ones funeral pyre at death indias national family health survey released in february showed that of parents with two sons didnt want any more children of those with two daughters wanted to try again while there are restrictions on abortions in this hindu majority nation the rules offer enough leeway for most women to get around them ge took the lead in selling ultrasounds in the early s soon after it began manufacturing the devices in india it tapped wipros extensive distribution and service network to deliver its products to about of its customers for more remote locations and lower end machines it used sales agents the company also teamed with banks to help doctors finance the purchase of their machines ge now sells about different models ranging from machines costing &# that offer sophisticated color images to basic black and white scanners that retail for about &# to boost sales ge has targeted small town doctors the company has kept prices down by refurbishing old equipment and marketed laptop machines to doctors who traveled frequently including to rural areas ge also offered discounts to buyers inclined to boast about their new gadgets according to a former ge employee "strategically we focused on those customers who had big mouths " said manish vora who until sold ultrasounds in the western indian state of gujarat for the wipro ge joint venture without discussing specific sales tactics mr raja of ge healthcare south asia acknowledges the company is "aggressive" in pursuing its goals but he points out that ultrasound machines have broad benefits and make childbirth safer as the machines become more available women can avoid making long trips into cities where health care typically is more expensive he says indian authorities have tried to regulate sales in the government outlawed sex selection and empowered indian authorities to search clinics and seize anything that aided sex selection today any clinic that has an ultrasound machine must register with the local government and provide an affidavit that it wont conduct sex selection to date more than ultrasound clinics have been registered in india ge has taken a number of steps to ensure customers comply with the law it has educated its sales force about the regulatory regime demanded its own affidavits from customers that they wont use the machines for sex selection and followed up with periodic audits say executives they note that in the first full year it began implementing these new measures ges sales in india shrank by about from the year before the sales decline in the low end segment for black and white ultrasound machines was especially sharp executives say only last year did ge return to the sales level it had reached before the regulations were implemented according to mr raja complying with indian law is often tricky ge cant tell if doctors sell machines to others who fail to register them different states interpret registration rules differently ge also is under close scrutiny by activists battling the illegal abortion of female fetuses sabu george a year old activist who holds degrees from johns hopkins and cornell universities crisscrosses the country to spot illegal clinics the criminal case in hyderabad against wipro ge a company representative three doctors and an ultrasound technician followed an inspection in that found one clinic couldnt produce proper registration and hadnt kept complete records for two years a team of inspectors seized an ultrasound supplied by wipro ge the inspection teams report said it suspected the clinic was using the machines for illegal sex determination the owner sarawathi devi acknowledged in an interview that her clinic rite diagnostics wasnt officially registered at the time of the inspection she said the ultrasound machine was owned by a "free lance" radiologist who had obtained proper documentation for the wipro ge machine but wasnt there when the inspectors had arrived she denied the clinic has conducted sex determination tests later in dr devis records show she registered the clinic with the government and bought a wipro ge machine a sale the company confirms the court case was part of a wider dragnet spearheaded by hyderabads top civil servant district magistrate arvind kumar during an audit last year mr kumar demanded paperwork for local scan centers only could furnish complete address information for its patients making it almost impossible to track women to check if they had abortions following their scans mr kumar ordered the seizure of almost one third of the ultrasound machines in the district due to registration and paperwork problems a suit also was lodged against erbis the toshiba dealer ges mr raja says that in general if theres any doubt about the customers intent to comply with indias laws it doesnt make the sale "there is no winking or blinking " he says a wipro ge representative is scheduled to appear may at the hyderabad court an erbis spokesman said he was unaware of the case in hyderabad a court date for erbis hasnt been set a visit to the clinic in indergarh a town surrounded by fields of tawny wheat shows the challenges ge faces keeping tabs on its machines inside the clinic a dozen women wrapped in saris awaited tests on ges logiq ultrasound machine the line snaked along wooden benches and down into a darkened basement on the wall scrawled in white paint was the message "we dont do sex selection " manish gupta a year old doctor said he drives two hours each way every week to indergarh from much larger jhansi city where there are dozens of competing ultrasound clinics he said even when offered bribes he refuses to disclose the sex of the fetus "im just against that " dr gupta said but he is not complying with indian law although the law requires that clinics display their registration certificate in a conspicuous place dr guptas was nowhere to be seen when dr george the social activist asked for the registration he was shown a different document an application but the application was for a different clinic the sakshi x ray center dr gupta said the proper document wasnt with him adding "i must have forgotten it at home " asked by the wall street journal about the clinic the local chief magistrate of datia district called for dr guptas dossier later in the day when a local official arrived "sakshi x ray center" had been crossed out on the application in blue pen was written the correct name "sheetal nagar " the part of indergarh where the clinic is located its not clear how dr gupta procured the ge machine dr gupta said he bought it from a ge company representative but he declined to show documents of ownership ge says it doesnt comment on individual customers like the rest of india the datia district government has taken a number of steps to try to boost the number of girls in the district for girls of poor families the local government provides a place to live free school uniforms and books when they enter ninth grade the government buys bicycles for them yet the low ratio of girls born hasnt budged much over the past decade according to ms bhavre the district government official ultimately says mr raja head of ge healthcare in south asia its the job of the government not companies to change the prevailing preference for boys "whats really needed is a change in mindsets a lot of education has to happen and the government has to do it " he says indias ministry of health which is now pursuing different cases against doctors accused of using ultrasounds for sex selection agrees "mere legislation is not enough to deal with this problem " the ministry said in a statement "the situation could change only when the daughters are not treated as a burden and the sons as assets " binny sabharwal contributed to this article
