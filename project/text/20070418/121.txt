the daily fix phils manager loses his cool after another sleepwalking loss online edition jimmy rollins aside the philadelphia phillies havent shown much phight this year their manager thats a different story last night the phils anointed by mr rollins as the team to beat in the national league east were spanked by the new york mets and had to be waved into their dugout by the umpires after recording the third out of the sixth inning that was emblematic of a loss that dropped them to good for last place in the nl east games behind the division leading atlanta braves afterwards manager charlie manuel blew his stack at a radio host who was taunting him and wound up having to be led away from the confrontation by his coaches lots of blow by blow over at the terrific phillies blog beerleaguer including the intriguing note that the philadelphia daily news refused to print the radio hosts name it was howard eskin by the way in the daily news sam donnellon writes of mr manuel that "i once believed that his predecessor larry bowa rode this teams clutch too hard i was wrong truth is the gears to this team slip no matter how gentle or harsh the handler especially when going uphill an inning after their little problem with the outs after another unproductive inning what remained of the announced crowd of broke into an e a g l e s chant indeed with the wind blowing and people wrapped in parkas it looked like football weather out there with the braves revamped for another pennant drive and reports of the mets demise greatly exaggerated maybe in fact it was the nfl draft is days away and minicamp starts weeks after that its hard to imagine the phillies fixing all their faults by then its even harder to imagine charlie manuel surviving the process " in the philadelphia inquirer phil sheridan calls out two players who have received a free pass in the phils freefall so far "ryan howard and chase utley the heart of the phillies lineup are as responsible for the teams wretched start as anyone else in pinstripes " mr sheridan notes adding that the free pass is "understandable they represent the phillies best hope for a brighter future and no one wants to start putting undue pressure on them that seldom does any good and has been the first step in souring a lot of relationships between fans and players in this city the point here isnt to start that process far from it the problem is that in an effort to cushion howard and utley a lot of fans and reporters have aimed their anger and criticism at others " on sunday nba referee joey crawford a year veteran ejected tim duncan of the san antonio spurs from a game against the dallas mavericks for the high crime of laughing on the bench yesterday nba commissioner david stern ejected mr crawford suspending the official for the rest of the season citing prior actions mr stern said that "joey crawfords handling of this situation failed to meet the standards of professionalism and game management we expect of nba referees " mr duncan who said mr crawford challenged him to a fight was fined &# for a muttered obscenity during his departure in the washington post michael wilbon writes that "crawford isnt just another zebra hes probably the most well known nba referee among basketball fans the son of famous former baseball umpire shag crawford and the brother of current mlb umpire jerry crawford the crawfords are americas first family of officiating and joey isnt just good at officiating basketball games he might be the best hes been reffing nba games for years and has worked every nba finals since but sunday in dallas crawford crossed the line with duncan dont get me wrong duncan isnt innocent he seems almost devoid of personality but hes a whiner plain and simple even so do you want to fight isnt the response you want from a referee during a game " why isnt this just a weird story because its the nba the grassy knoll of sports conspiracy theorists "without duncan the spurs lost the game and a chance at the no seed " mr wilbon notes "this matters because the nba unlike mlb the nfl and the nhl constantly and with great resentment fights the perception that some larger force uh the referees league office and network partners tries to influence the outcome to get favorable playoff matchups already people in basketball circles have been openly rooting for a phoenix suns mavericks western conference finals because those teams have played the most entertaining basketball the nba has seen in the past two years the mavericks are almost a lock to get that far the suns however would have to go through the spurs a three time champion with star players widely perceived as utterly boring on and off the court so now if the spurs and suns are forced to a game to see which team advances to the conference final to play dallas guess where the game will be played phoenix " the new york rangers hadnt won a home playoff game since last night they erased that stat with aplomb administering a beatdown to the atlanta thrashers who perhaps ought to be renamed the thrashees the rangers now have a commanding lead in the eastern conference quarterfinals and the new york daily newss lisa olson wonders if blueshirts fans should dare to dream "they had to fight just to make the playoffs and now here they are giving the garden crowd a show it has craved since last spring when the rangers meekly waved goodbye to the season " she writes "while the knicks fade into summer the rangers are altering the gardens morose culture one shift and one star at a time its far too early to wonder if this squad can match the pedigree of graves and leetch of messier and richter but imagine the possibilities if the rangers keep turning it on like they did last night if lundqvist keeps standing on his head while barely breaking a sweat and jagr and shanahan and nylander continue to create magic " daisuke matsuzaka struck out toronto blue jays yesterday but it wasnt enough for the second straight start the boston red sox hurler wound up on the wrong side of a tough loss more amusing for red sox fans and for all the rest of us was a mini drama in the stands during mondays patriots day game after bostons j d drew hit a foul pop into the left field boxes jason sole a year old fan tried to catch the ball but wound up covered in beer after colliding with his friend and garret anderson the left fielder for the whatever angels of whatever insult to injury as mr sole tried to gather himself he got clocked in the shoulder and neck by a flying something which turned out to be a slice of cheese pizza as always when one guy chucks a slice of pizza at another guy theres some history involved in the boston herald john tomase deconstructs what inspired danny kelly to launch his triangular missile an act mr kelly called "just a stupid thing its not something to be proud of it was just stupidity all around " then theres the poor girlfriend caught in the middle and oh the fix just loves this story but wait it gets better watch the analysis by nesns announcers complete with mr sole being named the pepsi fan of the game "until he gets thrown out" and jerry remy dissolving into giggles as the pizza makes its slow motion entrance on a replay should "and here comes the pizza " become the next sports catchphrase mr remy deserves royalties tip of the fix cap to
