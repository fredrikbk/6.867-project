business buccaneers may be best at captaining governance daniel loeb is at it again the tightly wound manager of the hedge fund third point has found a new target for his poisonous pen mark mcdade chief executive of pdl biopharma "there is no better example of mcdades empire building philosophy pathological selfishness and poor business judgment than his decision to build out pdls absurdly large and unnecessary new corporate headquarters the taj mahal " mr loeb wrote in a public letter to the companys board last week after acquiring roughly of the companys shares "mr mcdade has from the beginning of the project apparently been fixated on when his boat slip in the marina adjacent to the new corporate headquarters will be ready " he continued particularly galling to mr loeb was mr mcdades "inexplicable insouciance" in responding to the hedge fund managers demand for four seats on the companys board in a new letter sent to the companys board last night mr loeb called on mr mcdade to resign and asked that the companys founder and board member laurence korn be made acting chief executive mr mcdade declined to be interviewed for this column a company spokeswoman refused to comment on mr loebs "personal" attacks she said mr mcdade owns a ski boat with a blown engine but has no plans to rent a slip in the marina near pdls new offices in redwood city calif she said the companys board "is unanimous in its support of mr mcdade " but shareholders are voting with their wallets pdls stock price has risen more than since mr loeb jumped in and given the hedge fund managers past successes mr mcdade will clearly have to fight to survive activist hedge funds are on the rise carl icahn is challenging the management of motorola relational investors ralph whitworth who brought down home depot ceo robert nardelli has now turned his sights on sprint nextels gary forsee former securities and exchange commission chairman richard breeden now a hedge fund manager is in a pitched battle with the ceo of applebees international while the activists today only account for about of all hedge fund money mr breeden predicts that could rise to over time to the folks like mr mcdade who are trying to run public corporations this is a frightening onslaught author tom wolfe writing in the inaugural issue of the business magazine portfolio compared hedge fund invaders to the pirate blackbeard "who took what he wanted and was accountable to no one " across the world government officials are studying whether they need to take action to rein in these buccaneers but swashbuckling and excessive compensation aside mr loeb and his peers look to me like the saviors of modern capitalism lets review recent history in the early years of this century scandals at enron worldcom parmalat tyco adelphia and elsewhere proved that the imperial ceo needed to be held accountable by someone numerous actors tried out for the part u s legislators like sen paul sarbanes and rep michael oxley eliot spitzer a host of trial lawyers labor leaders pension fund managers nongovernmental organizations and ultimately private equity funds yet all of them had serious shortcomings government regulation proved as always to be heavy handed lawsuits were costly slow and seldom did much for those they were supposed to benefit big mutual fund companies were unwilling to get tough with companies for fear of losing corporate business public employee pension funds were happy to fill the gap but they have close ties to labor unions that raise serious questions about conflicts of interests even the private equity funds while pure in their pursuit of profits had a vested interest in underpaying public shareholders so they could reap bigger gains for their private partners that leaves the activist buccaneers as the least conflicted and most effective players in the corporate governance game like private equity funds they are strongly motivated to make companies more profitable but unlike private equity when they succeed the benefits go to all shareholders and while critics complain they are short term in focus they can only win when they get other shareholders to go along with them i think sec chairman christopher cox is on to this although its sometimes hard to tell given his equivocal public statements he has pleased the business crowd by pushing to ease enforcement of the most burdensome parts of the sarbanes oxley law and he told this newspaper recently that the sec is studying the idea of letting companies settle shareholder disputes through arbitration rather than lawsuits but hes driving the business lobby nuts by clinging to the idea that shareholders should have more power to nominate directors on the corporate proxy ballot theres method in that madness someone needs to be keeping a close eye on the folks who run public companies regulators and trial lawyers are ill suited for the job that leaves motivated shareholders like messrs loeb icahn whitworth and breeden as the best alternatives more power to them
