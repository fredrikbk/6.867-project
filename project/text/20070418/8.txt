good enough job the first time " she says "hes complaining about his own mistakes " a beal appeal beal bank of plano texas recently lost a case before the high court of new york state how do we know because it took out a full page ad in the wall street journal castigating the decision the ad which ran last week asked lawyers and lenders to join the bank in asking the court to reconsider its ruling which concerns a contract question beal bank is named after its owner andrew beal an iconoclast in the often staid world of banking in a profile in this newspaper he railed against mainstream banking as stodgy and lethargic "if people say im doing something crazy " mr beal said "thats usually a good sign " some lawyers would certainly call the response to the court decision if not crazy then unconventional the ad also directed readers to a web site lawzq com that contains a word missive titled "banks comments on majority decision " the document which is separate from a draft motion for reargument also on the site said that "the following thoughts have been included at the insistence of the bank requesting this reconsideration " was that line meant to set up some distance between the outside law firms representing the bank schulte roth &amp zabel llp of new york and hawkins parnell &amp thackston llp of dallas and the banks comments adding to the intrigue the line was removed from the document online yesterday neither the banks general counsel nor the law firms would comment mining subprime for bankers and borrowers the implosion of the subprime mortgage market has been

jim rishwain in the release the firm also formed a "climate change group" last fall to "help clients negotiate the changing environmental and political landscape " do these "multidisciplinary" groups add value or are they merely marketing law blog readers saw both sides one said that mortgage related cases "involve many disciplines which few individual attorneys possess pooling experience on a firm wide basis could absolutely help a client sift through issues more quickly " but another said "the law firm ought to be drawing upon all its resources for its clients whether or not those resources exist in a practice group when the law firm calls attention to the extent of its relevant resources thats marketing " ashby jones contributed to this article
