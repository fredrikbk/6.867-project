reply all how safe is space tourism online edition the race to send tourists into space is heating up with billionaires from richard branson to amazon com inc founder jeff bezos funding their own companies to build and launch spaceships for nonastronauts earlier this month a russian rocket carried another billionaire former microsoft corp programmer charles simonyi to the international space station the fifth civilian to make the trip the ride was brokered by space adventures ltd a company that has announced plans to build spaceports in singapore and the united arab emirates mr bransons virgin galactic has begun accepting advance reservations &# a seat for suborbital trips from spaceports in california and new mexico mr bezoss secretive company blue origin llc has tested its low cost suborbital rocket in texas meanwhile hotel mogul robert bigelow recently unveiled the plans for his company bigelow aerospace he intends to launch a cluster of low earth orbit accommodations that scientists and others can visit but how safe is the space tourism business the wall street journal online invited patricia smith who heads the federal aviation administration office responsible for overseeing the nascent industry to discuss the topic with space entrepreneur peter diamandis a co founder of space adventures and chairman of the x prize foundation which awarded a &# million prize to burt rutans spaceshipone in their conversation carried out via email is below ms smith begins what a great question and one that is probably on a lot of peoples minds as we have expanded our role to include private human spaceflight i believe that to work with industry to ensure safety is an appropriate governmental role we are happy to play it given the fact that our industry is clearly on the same page in giving us responsibility for regulating and promoting private human spaceflight congress directed us to protect the uninvolved public the spaceflight participants or passengers travel at their own risk once they have been provided the safety record and data related to the vehicle they are flying on the spaceflight companies that we are working with are clearly focused on safety and believe strongly that safety leads to reliability leads to more business and sustainability so do we dr diamandis responds patti smith and her team play the unique role of both regulating and promoting this new industry and have been doing both extremely well interestingly the industry feels that they have a complementary role to regulate and promote in fact early on the industry created something called the personal spaceflight federation a sort of industry working group to coordinate closely with the faa the personal spaceflight industry is "being born" in a very different regulatory environment than aviation did years ago during the period of when aviation started there was no regulatory body and few lawyers so entrepreneurs and inventors experimented widely today the challenge that the faa has is "how do we allow for growth and experimentation without having over regulation hamper growth and breakthroughs " i do believe that the entrepreneurs know without any doubt that they cant afford to have a significant and visible failure that early loss of life would be devastating for their company and perhaps the industry ms smith safety guides everything that the industry does guides everything the faa does congress said in the commercial space launch amendments act our authorizing legislation that "the future of the commercial human spaceflight industry will depend on its ability to continually improve its safety performance " there is no one that i know that has to be convinced of this the fact that we and the industry are all focused on safety that we are talking about the ramifications of an accident should say that "we" and "they" both believe that safety is the key at our recent conference in february on a panel entitled "when is a launch vehicle ready to carry passengers " industry leaders alex tai virgin galactic jeff greason xcor george whiteside national space society and john herrington rocketplane kistler resoundingly stated that the "vehicle will fly when its safe to fly " what an exciting time we live in when it comes to space we have a real opportunity to create benefits for our country the world and to free space dreamers and businesspersons to realize their dreams by making a business out of this at the national level we have a national space transportation policy that supports the development of commercial space transportation to include private human spaceflight a vision from our president that supports and legislation from congress that gives us the authority to issue licenses and issue experimental permits for testing and development we have an faa administrator my boss marion blakey who really believes in this stuff and has said repeatedly to go forth and enable with the ansari x prize in which peter diamandis and the x prize foundation sponsored that burt rutan and his team won the country was ignited about space in the way it was in the s it is the genius of american private entrepreneurs that is making this happen they are the real drivers that are changing commercial space transportation into an industry that the public is fast beginning to recognize as commercial enterprise people all around the world are talking about space transportation private human spaceflight with real examples of things happening that make for them what were concepts ideas drawings on paper real we the collective we have got the job of keeping this momentum going as we lead the rest of the world in private human spaceflight weve really got something going on that we can be very proud of as a nation and we are dr diamandis i once gave congressional testimony about the ansari x prize and was asked the question "arent people going to die " i answered by saying that as americans we should remember that america was opened up years ago because thousands of people gave their lives to pursue their dreams dare to cross the oceans and explore then years ago thousands of explorers gave their lives again as they opened the american west we are on the brink of the greatest exploration humanity has ever undertaken and we need to be sure not to prevent this from happening through fear of what might happen i think one of the key points that patti smith brings up is that the faa must keep the "uninvolved public" safe we must remember that the first people flying on these suborbital spaceships are really explorers in their own right they will must understand the risk they will be taking these flights because of their own passion these early flights are not joy rides i would actually love to see some of these companies strive for larger breakthroughs but they will probably not do this in the early days because they need to strive for safety and a reliable revenue stream the more they fly the more they will learn today when we only have four to six human spaceflights per year shuttle &amp soyuz and to commercial satellite launches per year we cant really hope to innovate the cost of spaceflight today is arguably higher than it was years ago we need a vibrant marketplace that will allow for hundreds or thousands of flights per year this will only come as we develop and promote the personal spaceflight market ms smith i would say that we have an opportunity to draw from and benefit from the tremendous legacy of aviation where appropriate and we are and will however it is equally important to recognize that space is unique and that one to one comparisons are not appropriate congress determined that the faa would be the place in the government where people can go who are seeking information licenses permits for activities in the area of commercial space transportation we like to say that if the request has "rocket" in the name it comes to us first and then we engage the rest of our "corporate" partners in developing the most complete responsive and timely response to the request for example we backed a project some years ago in anticipation of what is happening today working with our air traffic partners that included the development of a concept of operations for space and air traffic management this partnership continues today and includes looking out some years to what approaches will be needed to separate aircraft from spacecraft when our launch manifests become more robust with spaceshipone we worked with our aviation safety partners to evolve the right approach to its hybrid vehicle air and spacecraft and blended the approaches into a launch system license that met the needs of spaceshipone and our safety regulations we will continue to work to enable this industry and to be responsive to our safety mandate i foresee that the time will come when we have many more vehicles flying in the national airspace system with far greater regularity launching from various launch sites with passengers going point to point that a regulatory approach that is a variant to the aviation certification process may be called for today we license the operations of the launch vehicle we do not certify the vehicles design we are preparing for the day when commercial space is as common as air travel dr diamandis spaceflight over the next five to years will resemble the early aviation days of "barnstorming" where people used to pay a weeks salary to get up into the air to experience the view i dont expect we will really end up with airplane like "care free" transport in space for another years we really need some fundamental technology breakthroughs these breakthroughs could come from artificial intelligent systems that increase safety and system reliability they might also come from nanotechnology materials e g carbon nanotube impregnated composites that increase the strength to weight ratio of the rocket structures by fold regarding the economics today the cost of operating a mature transportation system car train plane is typically three times the cost of the fuel so an airplane that burns about &# of fuel per hour will cost an airline about &# hour of all in cost leases personnel insurance etc these economics hold true for systems that are reusable and operate at high flight frequencies spend more time flying than in the hanger the cost of suborbital flight seats today are projected to be &# &# per person if you assume that the average craft will carry about six passengers then the revenue per vehicle will be about &# million the cost of the fuel on a suborbital system is probably on the order of &# max meaning the cost of operating the system can eventually get down to &# per flight for these reasons i expect that over the next decade well see the price of seats drop from &# k to &# k to &# k and perhaps as low as &# k per person however this all presumes we get up to a significant flight rate on the order of suborbital passengers per year ms smith a few final things this office opened its doors in it licensed its first launch in since we have licensed launches with zero accidents most of these licenses carried communications services we have not had one casualty or significant property damage as a result of a licensed commercial launch we are very proud of this record and work every day to maintain it our authority also extends to licensing the operations of launch sites currently we have licensed six commercial launch site with several other states expressing interest states see launch sites as an opportunity to build business and create jobs our work began in with the expendable launch business and has evolved to include suborbital reusable launch vehicles as well as launch sites for the first twenty years of the offices existence we were building the regulatory and policy underpinnings for an industry that we all believed would at some point evolve to full fledged transportation i believe that we are on that road now in we transitioned from great skepticism to believability on the part of many many more people for lots of people seeing still is believing people are now seeing and believing and more people are getting involved we have a real opportunity to carry our message into many more places with people who believe that the only business that is going on spacewise is at nasa we are having success in interesting young people some of the brightest out there to bring their genius to our office and add to the choir who could not be more tenacious more committed more capable when it comes to space just as several "dot coms" have grown excited enough about space to put their money where their mouths are i believe that there are other non space industries that are soon to engage one of the great things about working in this field is the realization that the future the future that imagination has taken us to so often before is closer now in a real way than it has ever been private citizens will fly in space on private vehicles maybe someone reading the wall street journal will be one of them dr diamandis concludes some time during the next three to five years there will be what i call a "netscape event" where one of the first personal spaceflight companies does an ipo initial public offering and makes its investors a lot of money once that occurs private capital from individual small investors to large hedge funds will begin to chase this market and the risk capital will flow everything we hold of value on earth metals minerals energy real estate is in infinite quantities in space and i truly believe the first trillionaires will be made on this frontier as we gain access to these resources our job is to incrementally step by step link our fledgling industry to those gigantic markets in the early years i think it is critical for nasa to be supportive of these entrepreneurs in the same way that the government no longer builds their own computers and instead buys laptops from dell or apple so too will nasa eventually buy spaceflight services from these young and innovative corporations nasa should be buying parabolic flight services suborbital flights and orbital flights from private companies the recent cots commercial orbital transportation services awards are a good step but they are a very small bet compared to the future returns that are possible what do you think how safe is the space tourism industry what is the future of private space travel share your thoughts and join the discussion write to the
