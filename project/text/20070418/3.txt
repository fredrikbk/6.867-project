an endangered dream what a difference a year makes just last spring newspapers and policy makers across the country were hugging the dream of homeownership closely to their collective breasts and touting what a marvel the financial services market was for making homeownership possible for every black latino female headed family in the country today the headlines scream about a "subprime crisis " bankruptcies and the discovery of loan products that are "predatory" and harming our citizens especially minorities in response congress is holding hearings regulators are investigating and the presss righteous indignation is at full fury before our solons get too far down the path of making decisions that they believe are in the best interests of those low and moderate income lmi families they should think about the consequences of their actions and please calm down the mortgage market is not in a meltdown people continue to buy and sell homes and mortgages continue to be originated what has changed is that people who should know better namely the financial services industry leadership and those who cover it in the press are in panic mode instead of directing a reasoned national conversation on fixing how america provides homeownership opportunities to minority and lmi families they are running for the exits and in the process rewriting history and telling the world that americas homeownership experiment of the past years was a failure for all but the rich recently i heard the following statement "these families would be better off just being renters they were forced into homeownership and were set up for failure " i can accept that some people will never be and do not want to be homeowners however the statement that lmi families are better off as renters astounds me many made the case that sharecroppers were much better off farming on some wealthy landowners plantation rather than being set up for failure by owning acres and a mule last month speaking to a reporter from this newspaper angelo mozilo of countrywide said that of his subprime borrowers are making their payments on time and are successful homeowners think about that for a moment in virtually any other context or industry a four out of five success ratio would be seen as a major victory but in the context of lending to borrowers who would otherwise be shut out of the market its a meltdown my nonprofits down payment assistance program the nehemiah program has given away over &# million in grants to working families resulting in the creation of more than new homeowners since most received mortgages insured by the federal housing administration the government agency formed during the great depression to regulate the mortgage industry and provide home loans to borrowers who might otherwise have little access to capital nehemiah has been criticized for default rates equal to countrywides even though our own analyses by experian showed default rates lower than the fhas nonetheless the important statistic is a study by the milken institute concluding that lmi homeowners who used nehemiah assistance on average gained &# in net equity wealth we have fallen into a dialogue of blame and paternalism imagine removing a cancer fighting drug from the market because it had a success rate of or ending access to college for low income students because only four out of five graduated with a degree if government regulators proposed such a thing there would be an uproar so loud that they would be transferred to some lonely outpost before congress could organize a hearing roasting the entire agency what strategies could support greater homeownership success for lmi families first we should reward the market for empowering and protecting lmi home buyers ratings agencies assign ratings for loans purchased by investors in the secondary market based on product and borrower characteristics lower the ratings for subprime loans that do not require completion of a standardized pre homeownership education and counseling program studies show that there are clear linkages between education and lower incidence of default post homeownership counseling and monitoring for months would also help second we need to provide month mortgage payment protection insurance divorce job loss illness and disability are among the biggest contributors to mortgage default quality mortgage payment protection is a low cost way of mitigating default associated with the above risks third we need to make the fha competitive subprime needs strong competitors to keep the market honest under commissioner brian montgomery the fha has taken several positive steps in reviving an agency that had nearly sunk into obscurity due to lack of leadership and neglect the fha has streamlined some of the processing burdens that made its financial products unattractive in the marketplace many families currently at risk of foreclosure because of bad products should have applied for and received an fha loan we can do better in short the following three obstacles must be addressed for the fha to regain impact player status in the lmi marketplace get rid of down payments down payments are unnecessary our success at nehemiah has proven that we exist only because there is no alternative currently nehemiah type down payment assistance represents almost of fhas single family portfolio without a down payment assistance answer the fha cannot fulfill its historic role and will continue to shrink raise the loan limits for fha to the conforming limit without this change fha is dead on arrival on both coasts and in other high cost areas send the inspector general of hud to charm school the market left fha for the reasons above plus one the office of inspector general the watchdog set up in to oversee housing and urban development funds and projects no one has the guts to say this publicly but going to the fha for financing too often means subjecting oneself to a famously public and potentially harmful investigation by the oig while the oig has a duty to vigorously protect the public this vigor should not be so strident that industry views its regulator as an oppressor ironically i am told that internally the fha feels equally oppressed by the oig and knows it is harming them in the marketplace if the oig problem is not fixed nothing mr montgomery does will matter finally i believe both government and private industry have roles in improving the success of low income home buyers government should act as convener and regulator in prodding industry to holistically support sustainable homeownership industry should continue innovating not only in new products but with new support systems if only to keep government from legislating solutions that frustrate homeownership however if industry is not willing to face its own shortcomings it deserves whatever government imposes ultimately everything comes back to risk the risk i fear is the risk of deferring the dreams of another generation of americans by cutting short their access to what i call the great american prosperity race where you enter and when are important to where you end up however if we as a nation lock out low income families from homeownership opportunity because we know better than they what is best for them not only have they lost the race but more sadly we never even let them on the track mr syphax is president and ceo of the nehemiah corp of america a nonprofit group that provides assistance to low income borrowers
