next debate should colleges ban firearms in when two students walked through the halls of their colorado high school killing a dozen classmates and a teacher before taking their own lives emailed statements began flowing from congress on the need for more gun control the response following mondays shooting at virginia tech where a gunman killed people before killing himself making it the deadliest such incident in the nations history has been more measured for one thing the gun control lobby has been significantly weakened politically since is heyday in the s for another unlike columbine where the shooters were minors possessing assault rifles illegally both pistols recovered in the virginia tech shootings a glock mm and a walther p were purchased legally according to a gun trace by the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the shooter cho seung hui years old was a legal resident whose family moved to the u s from south korea in he had no criminal record that would have prevented him from buying the firearms an fbi official said "we dont know in the end whether this episode is going to have any impact on efforts to enact laws restricting illegal gun use " said joshua horwitz executive director for the coalition to stop gun violence in washington "were realistic that even with this we have a tough road on capitol hill " the national rifle association took a muted stance too posting a notice on its web site saying it "joins the entire country in expressing our deepest condolences to the families of virginia tech university and everyone else affected by this horrible tragedy we will not have further comment until all the facts are known " but if the shootings wont stiffen national gun control legislation they are already reawakening a separate battle about whether students faculty and staff can carry firearms on campus an estimated states ban firearms on school grounds but only about states explicitly prohibit concealed weapons on college campuses many states that allow concealed weapons with permits let universities set their own policies which means that campuses can put in some exceptions such as for use by college rifle teams virginia tech university banned firearms from its campus decades ago in and again this year the virginia state legislature tried to overturn the ban but both bills were defeated leaving the prohibition in place now some gun rights groups are using the shooting to bolster their case philip van cleave president of the virginia citizens defense league a newington va gun rights group that sponsored the legislation against the ban says other students who might have been carrying guns could have prevented the carnage "the students were like sheep " he says "if you were in that room waiting to be executed what would you give to be able to stop that and save the lives of others " members of that group intend to talk to state lawmakers again "in the very near future " in hopes of advancing the proposal in the next legislative session says mr van cleave "virginia tech will become a rallying cry at the general assembly " he says kristen rand of the violence policy center a washington think tank that supports gun control says mr van cleaves suggestion is "ludicrous its insanity to say we should wait for this to happen and wait for a good guy with a gun to gun down the shooter " the member of the virginia assembly who championed the measure attempting to overturn the universitys ban mark cole wouldnt address the matter yesterday in a written statement he said it was "inappropriate to engage in discussions" about the measure at the moment "later this year when the investigation is completed and all the facts surrounding this unthinkable crime are known we will be in a far better position to have an informed discussion on what additional measures might be taken to deal with such unforeseen tragedies " on the national level gun control advocacy has weakened as gun rights groups have advanced in the last decade at the urging of the nra congress in allowed the ban on assault weapons to lapse even though president bush said he would sign such a measure in another reversal for gun control advocates the amount of time the federal bureau of investigation can hold records of gun sales has been reduced to hours from three days the nra has also succeeded in persuading lawmakers to put in place increasingly strict restrictions on the release of gun trace data the guns on campus debate flows out of a broader debate about whether citizens should be allowed to carry concealed weapons in public after winning a series of battles making that easier the gun lobby looked to build on its gains allowing permit holders to carry concealed weapons wherever they go campuses restaurants office buildings and even school board meetings gun advocates argue that the right to carry a concealed weapon supersedes a university ban currently utah is believed to be the only two states that allow faculty and students over age who have concealed carry permits to have guns on campus the university of utah sued arguing that it should be able to impose a complete ban but lost the case however a compromise was enacted this year allowing students to request roommates who dont have concealed carry permits in congress enacted the "gun free school zone" law making it a federal offense to posses a gun on the grounds of an elementary or high school or within yards of the school paul helmke president of the brady center to prevent gun violence said there still might be adjustments that can be made in the shootings wake such as limiting the size of ammunition clips "were talking reasonable common sense restrictions " he said "if a little more red tape is going to decrease the yellow tape of a crime scene thats an inconvenience" most people are willing to accept corrections &amp amplifications utah is the only state that allows faculty and students over age who have concealed carry permits to have guns on campus a marketplace article wednesday about firearms on campus incorrectly implied that utah is believed to be one of two such states wsj april
