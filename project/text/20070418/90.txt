politics &amp economics high court blocks state power over some lenders washington the supreme court blocked state oversight of a large swath of the mortgage lending market ruling state regulators have no authority over the business conducted by the subsidiaries of national banks the ruling marks a definitive turn in the u s s "dual" banking system in which banks can operate under either a state charter or one issued by the federal office of the comptroller of the currency in washington state regulators and the federal comptroller compete to win charters from banks which bring with them fees that pay for their budgets critics have argued the federal comptroller traditionally oriented toward serving the banking industry has fallen short in protecting consumers the ruling effectively ends state efforts to fight predatory lending or impose other consumer protections on national banks in whatever guise the banks take but it also raises the likelihood congress will step in with legislation directing the federal comptroller to take additional steps to protect consumers the comptroller has "succeeded in reducing and eliminating a lot of state consumer laws without putting anything in their place " said rep barney frank d mass the chairman of the house financial services committee "it means we have to act " john ryan executive vice president of the conference of state bank supervisors said the decision "stops the evolution of consumer protections at the state level " he said "thirty seven states have passed predatory lending laws and this pre empts those laws for national banks and their subsidiaries " comptroller of the currency john dugan said fears of lax oversight were a "red herring " only about of subprime loans made last year were issued by national banks he said "weve gone to a more national market for products like mortgages " he said and "it is difficult for institutions that operate on a national basis to have all sorts of different standards operating in different states " the comptroller acting under the national bank act historically has taken an aggressive view of its powers declaring that it can pre empt virtually any state law it determines interferes with the business of national banks in previous cases the supreme court largely has agreed and yesterday it extended the comptrollers pre emption authority to cover separate corporations owned by the bank known as operating subsidiaries in essence "an operating subsidiary is subject to state regulation only to the extent the parent bank would be if it performed the same functions " justice ruth bader ginsburg wrote in an opinion joined by justices anthony kennedy david souter stephen breyer and samuel alito "state regulators cannot interfere by subjecting national banks or their occ licensed operating subsidiaries to multiple audits and surveillance under rival oversight regimes " operating indirectly through a subsidiary can offer a bank several advantages such as shielding the parent from the subsidiarys liabilities and easing quick acquisition or sale of the subsidiary both state and federal regulators maintain they strictly supervise banking activities but a selling point for the national charter has been the federal power to set aside state regulation including consumer protection laws that banks could find burdensome yesterdays case originated in michigan where wachovia mortgage corp owned by the holding company wachovia corp of charlotte n c operated under supervision from the state commissioner of insurance and financial services in wachovia restructured itself to make wachovia mortgage a direct subsidiary of wachovia bank rather than of the holding company and declared it was no longer subject to state regulation the state commissioner told wachovia mortgage it could no longer do business in michigan and the bank sued prevailing before the sixth u s circuit court of appeals in cincinnati michigan on appeal to the supreme court raised an argument seemingly aimed at the courts newly buttressed conservative wing contending that the comptrollers actions infringed on the th amendment which reserves unspecified powers to the states but chief justice john roberts and justice alito the courts two new conservatives split on the issue chief justice roberts joined justice antonin scalia in a dissent written by justice john paul stevens who himself split from other liberals on the court the dissenters argued that the majority gave the comptroller far more authority to set aside state laws than congress had contemplated threatening the viability of the dual banking system
