common sense googles doubleclick play still makes it a good bet smartmoney talk about the pot calling the kettle black microsoft is asking the government to scrutinize googles proposed &# billion acquisition of doubleclick on antitrust grounds it probably was only a matter of time before someone rolled out the antitrust guns against google that it would be microsoft is ironic given the software giants own antitrust troubles no one knows better than microsoft what a wrench a huge antitrust case throws into the workings of a fast growing firm lets assume this isnt just sour grapes given that microsoft was a spurned suitor for doubleclick and that microsoft and its reported allies time warner and at&amp t are genuinely worried about competition do their complaints have merit how should investors react for starters google and doubleclick arent direct competitors google specializes in online search and accompanying text ads doubleclick specializes in web display advertising especially video to the extent the two are related it is more like vertical integration with doubleclick supplying more sophisticated ads than google it is hard to see how the combined company would damp competition when they dont compete to begin with another argument might be that google is trying to extend its dominance in search into display advertising it is no secret that google is targeting advertising as a prime growth area if it was so easy google would have imposed its own display business on customers the way microsoft added its own web browser to crush netscape but google has failed to make much headway on its own microsofts general counsel said that a combined google and doubleclick would handle more than of the ads that appear when a user pulls up a web page if true that sounds ominous but not when you consider a broader advertising market than web pages web advertising still constitutes a small percentage of the global advertising market im a neutral observer since i own both google and microsoft id consider these antitrust concerns nearly laughable except that google has been so successful as to attract powerful resentment and not just from competitors like microsoft but i dont think this deal will be the catalyst for an antitrust suit followers of my column will recognize that what is good for competition isnt necessarily good for investors the best deals are the ones that barely pass antitrust muster the oracle peoplesoft deal a merger of two direct competitors comes to mind so i dont see the doubleclick deal leading to higher profit margins for google especially given the high price google is paying doubleclick had just &# million in revenue and &# million in profit last year but i like the deal for other reasons i believe online advertising is still in its infancy and will continue to take share from traditional media it enables google to deploy some of its cash hoard in a high growth business investors seem to agree ordinarily shares in an acquiring company like google decline on the news google bucked the trend monday by rising about &# to just above &# a share microsoft meanwhile outbid by google seems increasingly stingy about using some of its own huge cash hoard is it merely being prudent or does it lack googles conviction stay tuned james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
