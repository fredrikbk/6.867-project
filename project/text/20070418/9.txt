blackstone tests fairness of using fair value rule buyout titan will book projected profit upfront regulators are watching blackstone groups planned initial public offering of shares is shaping up as a test case of controversial new accounting rules that could allow the buyout giant to book profits upfront on deals whose value could take years to realize at issue are rules adopted by accounting rule makers in february they allow companies to book income from their investments immediately using estimates of what management determines to be their "market " or fair value rather than to keep a static value of the investments on the books until the company cashes them out because most of blackstones investments are in private companies they are difficult to value some critics say blackstones accounting treatment could give its management too much leeway in valuing investments allowing it to provide overly rosy earnings if blackstone invested say &# billion in a buyout of a company it could determine that the fees it would generate when it sells the company to be &# million under such an assumption blackstone could book a portion of the &# million upfront and record higher fees later if it determines the value of the investment to have risen this method once was used by many companies most notably enron corp and led accounting rule makers a few years back to ban firms from booking immediate gains from certain transactions that didnt trade in active markets "the biggest problem with fair value accounting is management bias " says charles niemeier a member of the public company accounting oversight board the body that regulates accounting firms mr niemeier a former chief accountant for the enforcement division of the securities and exchange commission adds that he believes the accounting rule allowing management such leeway is "bad business" that will "come back to haunt" rule makers a blackstone spokesman declined to comment on its accounting choice in a regulatory filing blackstone cautions investors that its earnings might not be smooth indeed the firm would be required to book losses if it estimates that the value of its investments declined "our financial results will be significantly affected by the timing of new investments and realizations of gains " the filing says as a result the filing says blackstones earnings may be unpredictable from quarter to quarter blackstones accounting appears to conform to the accepted accounting principles and its accounting treatment is similar to that used by venture capital firms in the s but some specialists worry that blackstones use of the new accounting rule illustrates that the push for reforms following the accounting scandals of has weakened "i have no idea why people are forgetting the lessons of so quickly " says edward ketz an accounting professor at pennsylvania state university members of the financial accounting standards board which adopted the new rule believe the change will provide investors with better information investors "would rather have a current estimate with adequate disclosure of the subjectivity than no new information about how the value of an investment has changed " says leslie seidman fasb board member " yet even supporters of fair value accounting wonder if blackstone is pushing the envelope too far in some of its planned uses of the accounting method that is especially the case when it comes to blackstones plan to apply market value accounting to the management and performance fees it will receive for being general partner of its investment funds determining a fair market value for future management and performance fees is particularly nettlesome accounting specialists say that is because blackstone will be estimating its own future investing prowess and layering a market value estimate of performance fees on top of the already subjective market value estimate of the underlying investment "this is a black box if ever there was one " says jack ciesielski editor of the analysts accounting observer newsletter in its prospectus a tell all document to investors blackstone provided a glimpse of how such accounting might work using fair market accounting blackstones pro forma net income was boosted by &# million or to &# billion the filing says the accounting method increased the value of blackstones investments in by roughly &# billion or to &# billion the blackstone ipo is a test of the new rules because so much of its value will be affected accounting specialists say fortress investment group a private equity and hedge fund firm that launched its own ipo in february also said in its prospectus that it used fair value accounting in deriving the value of its assets a fortress spokeswoman said the firm isnt using the fair value option to recognize immediate gains or losses through its fees related to its private equity investments some critics worry that the blackstone ipo provides its existing investors with an unfair advantage over investors who buy shares in the ipo the blackstone prospectus provides scant disclosure about the operations blackstone has invested in making it difficult for investors to intelligently question managements assumptions about their values how blackstone applies the new rules will be watched partly because some specialists believe the ipo could signal a peak in the private equity industry blackstones use of the new rules will also be watched by the fasb and sec as a way of gauging whether the new rules are serving investors accounting rule makers say a question facing those bodies will be whether blackstone provides adequate disclosure about the fair value judgments it is making and how it is coming up with them accounting specialists say if disclosures are adequate the accounting observers mr ciesielski says "i think theres enough information for people to work with to assess whether something was jerked around to come up with a favorable value " blackstone set plans for a roughly &# billion ipo several weeks ago which will lead to multimillion dollar paydays for the co founder of the firm steve schwarzman and his partners mr schwarzman has become a symbol of the growing clout of private equity firms and has become known for his lavish spending including a recent birthday celebration which featured singer rod stewart in recent months blackstone has been on a buying spree and owns properties from madame tussauds wax museums and mrs pauls fish sticks to the countrys largest office landlord equity office properties trust the firm has separate arms that invest in hedge funds and advise clients on mergers and restructurings
