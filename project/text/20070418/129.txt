the wirtz curse why chicago fans trash blackhawks hockey teams owner is butt of abuse as players sit out the stanley cup chicago sitting in &# seats just behind the net at a recent chicago blackhawks hockey game anthony molinaro and his girlfriend could see the sweat roll down the goalies neck and hear the grunts of the skaters as they battled for the puck along the boards the seats were freebies courtesy of owner bill wirtz as part of a "fan appreciation" program so was mr molinaro a year old community college employee and lifelong fan grateful not quite "he should be giving the seats away " said mr molinaro "theres no way id pay for them " the boston red sox suffered for decades under the curse of the bambino and the chicago cubs have long been hexed by the owner of a billy goat supposedly ejected at a world series game similarly fans of the national hockey leagues blackhawks feel afflicted by mr wirtz a year old real estate tycoon the stanley cup playoffs have begun and for the eighth season in the last nine mr wirtzs blackhawks are watching not playing the hawks finished the regular season ahead of just four teams out of and scored fewer goals in games than all but the edmonton oilers the team one of the six early members of the nhl hasnt won a league championship in years hawks fans blame mr wirtz on the web loyalists lambaste the barrel chested former amateur boxer for being too cheap to pay for talent for being too loyal to people around him who have made a string of bad hockey decisions and perhaps most bitterly for refusing to allow most hawks home games to be televised mr wirtzs financial success is all the more irksome to fans who believe he should use his wealth to build a perennial contender "he holds a public trust a responsibility and hes failed to live up to it " says mark weinberg a chicago attorney who spent two years researching and writing a self published book called "career misconduct the story of bill wirtzs greed corruption and the betrayal of blackhawks fans " in a recent espn survey of sports fans the blackhawks ranked th out of professional sports franchises under the category of ownership defined as honesty and loyalty to players and city the fans ranked mr wirtz second lowest above only jeffrey loria of major league baseballs florida marlins mr wirtz who rarely speaks publicly declined through a spokesman to be interviewed for this story but he has been quoted in the past saying that public scorn is part of owning a professional sports team his team biography describes him as a "natural leader " "a man of his word " "a model humanitarian" and an inductee into the hockey hall of fame in toronto hawks general manager dale tallon who has worked for mr wirtz for years as a player coach and announcer says he cant understand why fans dislike his boss "hes a great guy " mr tallon says "it doesnt make any sense to me " mr wirtzs father arthur wirtz made a fortune in real estate before turning to buying stadiums around the country he bought the hawks in led by legendary winger bobby hull the team defeated the detroit red wings to win the stanley cup bill wirtz who graduated from brown university and worked in an accounting firm before joining the family business became club president in six years later the younger mr wirtz courted fans wrath by failing to re sign mr hull mr hull has said in past interviews that he had made it clear he wanted to stay in chicago but the blackhawks didnt approach him with a contract until he had already reached a deal with the winnipeg jets of the now defunct world hockey association mr hull couldnt be reached for comment in published accounts mr wirtz has said he wanted to keep mr hull in chicago his failure to do so is widely considered only slightly less a blunder than the red soxs decision to trade babe ruth to the yankees in still the blackhawks remained competitive through the s and s and supporters stayed loyal standing room only crowds of nearly routinely packed the steep seating and red brick corridors of the hawks former home chicago stadium "that place was electrifying " says jack davenport a lifelong fan "the national anthem would start and you couldnt hear a word the screaming was so loud " as nhl player salaries escalated in the s and in this decade even as the leagues losses mounted mr wirtz refused to participate in bidding wars several star players left the hawks for bigger paychecks prompting fans to howl that "dollar bill" was gutting the team sports marketer marc ganis of sportscorp ltd in chicago says mr wirtz "decided the economic structure of the nhl was lunacy long before the other owners he was the sane man in an insane crowd " by the time owners locked out players resulting in the cancellation of the season player salaries accounted for an unsustainable of team revenue mr ganis says mr wirtz is widely credited or blamed for leading the lockout a settlement contract installed a cap on salaries and helped stabilize the leagues finances leading up to the lockout hockey news quoted mr wirtz as saying "the players keep wanting more and more pretty soon theyll want the key to my door i love them all but i love my door even more " in the two seasons since the lockout attendance has increased across the league and twice set records for the regular season says frank brown spokesman for the nhl players salaries are now down to of team revenue he says this year the blackhawks average attendance in an arena that holds was second worst in the nhl and down from last year mr wirtz has claimed the blackhawks organization itself is a money loser critics doubt that but say he more than makes up for any losses through his half ownership in the united center home to the blackhawks and pro basketballs chicago bulls and cuts of concessions and parking revenue several published accounts have estimated his familys net worth at more than &# billion family holdings include banks liquor distributorships and prime chicago real estate while the hawks have generally shied away from the priciest free agents they won a bidding war for goaltender nikolai khabibulin paying him &# million over four years mr tallon says the teams real problems stem from poor draft choices and free agent acquisitions "we let things lapse and we have to rebuild " he says "but were going to do it "
