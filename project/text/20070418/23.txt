cme cbot merger would kill competition your april editorial "the future of futures" highlights many of the important public policy issues at stake in the pending merger of the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange the two largest futures exchanges in the u s however we question your suggestion that the review by the justice departments antitrust division constitutes "meddling" with this merger if combined these two exchanges will control at least of all futures trading in the u s surely that is sufficient reason for justice to inquire whether the merger or any similar merger would substantially lessen competition your editorial asserts that technology is making it easier for new entrants into the derivatives business to challenge the dominant exchanges and you cite as an example the success of international securities exchange in capturing part of the equity options market from the chicago board options exchange you fail to recognize however a crucial difference in market structure the ise is an options exchange operating under a system of product fungibility and common clearing in plain english this means that every exchange is linked into a single clearinghouse and an option bought on one exchange can be easily sold on another in contrast futures exchanges function as closed systems and a futures contract bought on one exchange cannot be sold on another in the options world more exchanges means more competition in the same products resulting in a dramatic reduction in the cost of trading for customers but in the futures world it is extremely difficult for a new exchange to challenge a dominant one because the absence of fungibility creates high barriers to entry the futures competition you cite in your editorial is more illusory than real your editorial also claims that the relevant competitive market is international in scope we respectfully disagree just consider how the cbot responded when it was faced with competition from eurex the leading futures exchange in europe eurex existed for years without any competitive response from the cbot but when it set up a u s futures exchange to challenge directly the cbots treasury complex that got the cbots attention like any good competitor the cbot faced that challenge by lowering fees and embracing innovations once that u s challenge was defeated however the cbot raised its fees and has continued to raise them this experience is strong evidence that the chicago exchanges themselves view the u s futures market as the relevant market and their principal arena of competition the fia has long espoused more direct competition in the u s futures markets because we believe as you do that competition is the lifeblood of the free enterprise system the cme and the cbot have been competing with each other for many years and this competition has spurred innovation in product development trading technology and processing efficiencies this merger would end that competition and eliminate any potential for future competition between these organizations and this is one more reason why we believe the repercussions should be carefully considered john m damgard president futures industry association washington the letter was also signed by todd e petzel and robert e fink public directors of the futures industry association see related letter "letters to the editor in futures trade new york battles chicago" wsj may
