the afternoon report an abortion milepost online edition handing a major victory to abortion opponents a divided supreme court ruled that a nationwide ban on so called partial birth abortions doesnt violate the constitutional rights of women justice anthony kennedy wrote in the courts majority opinion that opponents of the partial birth abortion ban act of "have not demonstrated that the act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases " the ruling broke neatly along the courts ideological faultlines as president bushs two appointees chief justice john roberts and justice samuel alito joined justices kennedy antonin scalia and clarence thomas the ruling was the first time that the high court had upheld a ban on a specific abortion procedure other abortion battles before the supreme court including the landmark roe v wade case have centered on the question of whether not how a woman should have the right to terminate a pregnancy three federal appeals courts struck down the partial birth abortion ban act finding that it violated a supreme court opinion in that invalidated a similar nebraska law because it made no exception to preserve a womans health the ban was signed by president bush after two previous bills passed by a republican controlled congress were vetoed by president clinton government lawyers had argued that the federal ban had avoided the flaws of the nebraska law by officially finding that the procedure which involves removing the fetus intact was never medically necessary and by defining the procedure itself in a precise fashion solicitor general paul clement maintained that the law renders a clear distinction between legal abortions where the fetal demise is induced in the uterus and those where the procedure takes place "when the living fetus is over halfway outside of the womb " he argued that since safer alternatives were in place the ban wouldnt deter abortion merely end what opponents call a grisly practice but advocates say the procedure is sometimes the safest for a woman seeking to end a pregnancy and that upholding the ban would effectively threaten most abortions after weeks of pregnancy of the more than one million abortions that are performed in the u s each year more than nine in take place in the first weeks justice ruth bader ginsburg writing in dissent called the decision "alarming" and said that it "refuses to take seriously" previous supreme court decisions on the abortion issue she wrote that the decision "tolerates indeed applauds federal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary and proper in certain cases by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists " before the ruling proponents on both sides of the issue appeared to agree that even though the procedure accounts for only a small proportion of abortions it may lead to broader curbs but voters have recently rebuffed other measures to limit abortion arguments in the case last november took place just days after voters in three states rejected ballot measures to restrict abortions voters in california and oregon rejected measures requiring parental notification before pregnant minors could obtain abortions while south dakotans repealed a law that banned all abortions except when the womans life is in jeopardy wave of bombings kill in iraq four explosions killed at
