where shes from classical music is a growth industry hong kong anyone who frets that classical music audiences are dwindling in the worlds most celebrated concert venues might ask the young associate conductor of the new york philharmonic whether the art form has a vibrant future xian zhang grew up in dandong china a small port city that brushes the border of north korea before moving at age to beijing where she lived in a student dorm and studied music full time at the central conservatory she came to the u s in to pursue a doctoral degree in music at the university of cincinnati ms zhang won a major conducting competition in where she so impressed the new york philharmonics music director lorin maazel that he invited her to join the orchestra in with sweeping exuberance ms zhang performed tchaikovskys fifth symphony that summer before revelers in central park this friday and saturday the bright eyed year old will appear as guest conductor of the hong kong philharmonic orchestra in an all american program that includes works by leonard bernstein aaron copland and george gershwin ms zhang belongs to a new generation of musicians from china where rapid economic development is fueling demand for western goods and culture today an estimated million children on the mainland are learning to play the violin or the piano some musicians such as ms zhang are achieving careers dreamed of by their parents whose own musical ambitions were thwarted decades earlier ms zhangs parents began teaching her piano exercises at age three it was and the cultural revolution had just ended lifting a brutal decade long ban on western culture that had driven artists into the countryside to work as farmhands or face imprisonment her mother a pianist and singer had been forced to abandon classical music as a student "i never had a choice about studying piano " says ms zhang "i also didnt wish for anything else because i loved it too " unable to afford a new piano her father an instrument maker by trade purchased spare parts from a nearby piano factory and built one for her she progressed quickly then when ms zhang was her teacher lamented that her hands were too small to perform big repertoire "he didnt think i would be able to get enough sound for a concert hall " ms zhang says laughing conducting became a convenient way to prove the man wrong a female professor guided her transformation from soloist to conductor "she became a strong influence " says ms zhang this mentor made her see that the path to conducting was wide open to her as a woman entrenched musical traditions in the west have kept many women from reaching the podium and from playing with some venerable institutions such as the vienna philharmonic which has only one female musician in the ensemble in china no such long standing bias exists in a classroom ms zhang started off by leading two piano renditions of the major western symphonies advancing later to a choir an opera and gradually larger ensembles her new mentor required that she commit all the works to memory "teachers in china are most focused on technique " says ms zhang which allows young performers to execute the most taxing works in the repertoire with astonishing ease compared with some of their western counterparts the downside she says is that chinese musicians are sometimes too engrossed in mechanical detail sacrificing the main idea studying at the university of cincinnati ms zhang says pushed her to develop her own understanding of a musical work rather than obsess over specific hurdles often approaching the music broadly helps solve smaller technical problems she says by taking the focus off them stereotyping of asian musicians as mere technicians remains a problem she acknowledges perhaps its a jealous reaction to their prevalence at top notch music conservatories and to prizes theyve garnered at prestigious competitions she says although instruction in china still heavily emphasizes technical skill she says "it wouldnt be fair to say asian musicians are inexpressive " music critics often take time to contrast the playing styles of pianists yundi li and lang lang for instance to counter the cliche as much as to demonstrate the rising popularity of chinese musicians messrs li and lang are among the most widely recognized young pianists in the world today with busy concert schedules and recording contracts with label deutsche grammphon chinas burgeoning music lovers have helped fuel the careers of both especially mr li who shot to fame after becoming the youngest person ever to win first prize at the frederic chopin international piano competition in warsaw poland in different styles of child rearing in asian and western cultures ms zhang says may also underlie the differences in acquisition of musical skills as a girl in china ms zhang spent hours every day learning keyboard studies designed to perfect piano playing technique "american kids have a really good life here " she says school finishes early in the day theres not much homework and lots of time for play "in asia parents are really demanding " she says explaining that chinas one child policy heightens pressure on children to become all around high achievers but while chinas crack players generally venture abroad performances on the mainland and in hong kong are still far below western standards quality is improving however ms zhang says noting the more robust playing she observed last year at performances of the seven year old china philharmonic and of the guangzhou symphony orchestra one of the nations oldest ensembles established in the s one problem she says is the lack of good brass and woodwind players "china doesnt have high school bands " she says chinese musicians usually discover their affinity for brass and woodwind instruments later in life the quality of teaching on these instruments and the instruments themselves also fall short of western standards on the other hand chinese musicians excel on strings she says transferring their skill on chinas traditional stringed instruments to the violin and cello the hong kong philharmonics music director edo de waart who formerly led orchestras in san francisco the netherlands and in sydney has upset some players by requiring them to reaudition for their seats mr de waart is also aggressively recruiting chinese and western players from overseas and pushing the group to take on more challenging works the scene in hong kong a wealthy enclave of financiers and business owners doesnt reflect the enthusiasm for classical music on the mainland where young chinese are gaining access to music lessons and homegrown ensembles are sprouting up hong kong by contrast prefers playing host to brand name musicians from around the world at schmoozy events that cater to the citys richest for example the american soprano renee fleming recently joined the hong kong philharmonic in an all richard strauss program ms fleming sang several of the composers most popular songs before the orchestra delivered a rousing performance of the "rosencavalier" suite for the finale by this time unfortunately more than a dozen audience members had left deciding there was no reason to stick around once ms fleming had finished her star turn even if a clamor for sophistication by chinas new elite is stoking interest in classical music ms zhang is hopeful that her country will make a lasting contribution to the art form children who are taking lessons now are likely as adults to support the arts by attending concerts and buying recordings she says in the west concert organizers worry about aging audiences while in china parents eagerly bring young children to performances which they hope will inspire them to practice hard more significantly ms zhang says a new crop of contemporary composers is creating a new style of music that blends western forms with harmonies that evoke traditional chinese music last year ms zhang commissioned an orchestral work by huang ruo a young chinese composer who lives in new york mr ruos piece called "shattered steps " relies heavily on western atonality ms zhang says but also draws on melodies and rhythms from chinese folk songs and american hip hop "some of the composers are trying to go back and mine the old folk song for material " she says ms zhang compares chinas influence on music today to the development of american music in the th century for example gershwin whose "porgy and bess" suite shell be performing in hong kong combined jazz with the classical techniques imported from europe "the jazz factor its something you dont see elsewhere " outside the walls of her practice room in beijing ms zhang recalls she was surrounded by chinese music "its a language that feels natural to me " she says ms santini is a hong kong based reporter for the wall street journal
