abortions doesnt violate the constitutional rights of women justice anthony kennedy wrote for the majority that opponents of the partial birth abortion ban act of "have not demonstrated that the act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases " the ruling broke along the courts ideological faultlines as chief justice john roberts and justice samuel alito joined with justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas justice kennedy was seen as the swing vote most other abortion battles before the court including the landmark roe v wade case have centered on whether a woman has the right to terminate a pregnancy todays ruling was the first in which the high court had upheld a prohibition on a specific abortion procedure three federal appeals courts struck down the partial birth abortion ban finding it flouted a supreme court ruling that invalidated a similar nebraska law because it made no exception to protect a womans health the partial birth ban was signed by president bush after two similar measures passed by a republican controlled congress were vetoed by president clinton justice ruth bader ginsburg writing in dissent called the decision "alarming" and said that it "refuses to take seriously" previous supreme court decisions on the abortion issue she wrote that the decision "tolerates indeed applauds federal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary and proper in certain cases by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists " before the ruling proponents on both sides of the issue appeared to agree that even though the procedure accounts for only a small proportion of abortions it may lead to broader curbs but voters have recently rebuffed other measures to limit abortion arguments in the case last
