suddenly the web is giving eggheads something to watch it was bound to happen just as the internet was settling into its role as haven for videos about car crashes britney spears and teenage confessions people had to come along to ruin it all by trying to be serious a number of web efforts are under way to provide for more cerebral alternatives to television on the web call them youtubes for wonks one is called fora tv its an ambitious for profit effort based in san francisco and funded by angel backers including will hearst the publishing heir and frequent tech investor foras intent is to establish relations with all of the lecture series from the nations scores of think tanks civic groups bookstores and the like and then put tapes of their speeches and panel discussions online in an easily searchable fashion c span the cable public affairs network that focuses mostly on washington politics and policy is an obvious model brian gruber fora tvs founder and chief executive is a cable tv executive who worked at c span during its early years he said though that fora tv will be casting a much wider net than c span including business technology and the arts happily for folks with broadband connections other outfits have similar ideas one example is the research channel a year old consortium of some of the countrys best universities that is based at the university of washington seattle it started life as a public access tv channel dedicated to presentations by college researchers but it too now has a thriving web presence with more than programs in business the sciences and the humanities these shows arent for viewers with short attention spans or who come expecting glossy but dumbed down packages like those increasingly found on the commercial cable channels that profess interests in history science and the like the typical fora tv offering is someone giving a speech and then taking questions at the end with one or two cameras to record the scene the topics are the sort that ought to interest anyone with a passing familiarity with the front page of a newspaper one program last week featured speeches and panels on developments in the middle east and on the conservative christian movement in america among fora tvs channels are those for business environment and religion mr gruber said fora tv aims to span the spectrum in its politics it already has relationships with the rightist hoover institution and the center left brookings institution of course the unbounded horizons of the web offer opportunities for niche players anyone who wants to create a tv channel just needs a computer and a web address as a business model mr gruber cites the profitable weather channel saying it never would have been possible in the limited channel world of broadcast television on tv in fact new niches continue to crop up link tv for example is an international oriented channel available on most cable and satellite systems its best known for its nightly "mosaic" show which features newscasts from the middle east there is also the recently launched documentary channel which hopes to the tap the countrys growing interest in the genre the documentary channel is currently available on dish but would love subscribers to other services to write in to their provider and request it sites like fora tv are still in their early stages and havent yet attracted enough attention to be considered even niche players timothy lorang director of programming at the research channel said an average show might attract viewers their goals are ambitious fora tvs is to be for ideas what espn is to sports in some areas like the upcoming presidential election it will have a lot of competition including from big players such as google and yahoo which are themselves trying to connect with an interested public mr gruber says fora tv is mindful that it cant just dump a bunch of videos on a server and expect the public to be entranced instead for each presentation viewers can see a list of chapters like those on a dvd movie showing what the speaker is discussing at any particular point you can skip to the section that interests you you can also download sections and whole presentations for later listening as a podcast in fact sitting in the car or panting on the stairmaster may be the best way to experience many of these visually plain offerings in an ideal world so called serious programming on the web wouldnt be limited to this species of plain vanilla videos of academics and authors giving speeches many of them are to be frank rather dull great gripping documentaries such as the pbs "nova" series or some of the latest bbc imports are expensive to produce which is why we see them so infrequently on television and not at all online at least not as original programming but the web is supposed to be all about boundless choice for folks who get tired of short clips of dogs chasing their tale their choices are beginning to multiply email me at lee gomes wsj com
