buying last year ahead of more stringent engine emission standards added to truck supplies shipments on the nations railroads which surged in the past few years dropped nearly in the first quarter reflecting a downturn in demand for a wide variety of freight the slowdown comes after a three year freight boom that in turn followed a two decade period when shippers such as retailers and manufacturers became accustomed to abundant rail and truck capacity falling freight rates and declining freight costs the freight market "isnt where it was five or years ago when it dramatically favored shippers but the pendulum is swinging back slightly in our favor " said donald biggs director of customer logistics at welch foods inc a concord mass grape grower cooperative that makes juice jam and jelly products a couple of years ago some welch foods products sat for days until the company found trucks to move them mr biggs said there are now "more than enough trucks" to haul its goods
