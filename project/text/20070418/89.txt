politics &amp economics clean energy firms make pitch to asia u s trade mission aims to capitalize on growing commitment in china india hong kong as india and china pledge to spend billions of dollars on renewable energy the u s government is hoping to help american companies cash in on the cleanup of asias smoggy skies representatives of more than a dozen u s companies including general electric co and dupont co will touch down today in the southern indian city of chennai to kick off a one week trade mission to india and china aimed at drumming up new business for americas burgeoning clean energy industry the companies are selling technology including solar power energy efficient building materials clean coal wind power and more experimental power sources such as a gasification technology developed by utah based emery energy co that creates fuel from the organic matter in trash the demand for energy alternatives in asia is creating a substantial business opportunity the trade mission aims to capitalize on a growing commitment to renewable energy by india and china as the regions dependence on coal fired power plants fuels concern about global warming and air pollution the chinese government recently pledged to spend &# billion on renewable energy and to make renewable energy account for of the countrys total supply by though such allotments are subject to change the indian government has made fewer concrete commitments but the market for renewable energy in india is estimated at &# million a year and is growing by annually the government already provides substantial tax breaks for wind energy and a wave of proposed state legislation would encourage other "clean tech" industries to make inroads there "either we have a complete environmental collapse or we have to quickly evolve the entire global economy to a much more energy efficient resource efficient and environmentally conservative model " says andrew pidden who co manages a &# million investment fund focused on the asian clean tech sector for clsa asia pacific markets the commerce department mission aims to address some of the roadblocks that have made it difficult for u s clean energy companies to crack markets in asia including concern over intellectual property rights some american clean energy companies are reluctant to deploy their most cutting edge technologies in asia for fear their know how will be copied "its a concern for anybody trying to export advanced and novel technology to markets where they dont have strong regulatory systems around patent issues " says benjamin phillips president of emery energy the salt lake city start up that is marketing a proprietary system that can create a biofuel from the organic waste in municipal garbage the company aims to help cities in the developing world tackle waste disposal and polluting power sources intellectual property issues have become a growing source of friction between china and the u s which last week said it was filing a complaint with the world trade organization over chinas level of copyright enforcement "we need to make people understand that this is an environmental issue too " says david bohigian assistant commerce secretary who is meeting with officials in beijing during the week long mission "its affecting chinas ability to clean up coal plants because u s companies dont want to export their best technology there " companies participating in the mission also hope to gauge the depth of the indian and chinese governments commitments to renewable resources to make sure promised support for clean energy materializes "renewable energies tend to prosper in markets where the government provides strong support " says martin wenzel senior vice president of sales and marketing for miasole a santa clara california solar power company "if india and china want to turn these programs on theyve got to make commitments in terms of resources and money " the participating companies reflect a wide range of industries dupont will be showcasing technology such as cellulosic ethanol which is made from nonfood sources and tyvek building wrap a synthetic textile that can improve the energy efficiency of buildings the clean energy mission is part of a wave of initiatives developed by the u s government that seek to harness the forces of the free market to address asias environmental problems creating business opportunities while dealing with global pollution problems the projects are part of the asia pacific partnership on clean development and climate an agreement among six countries the u s china india japan australia and south korea that was organized as an alternative to the kyoto protocol commerce department officials are promoting some novel financing structures to encourage faster adoption of the technologies department officials in hong kong for example have developed a program dubbed pollution prevention and energy efficiency or pe to be fully rolled out later this year pe aims to help companies in hong kong turn profits while cleaning up heavily polluting factories in china it will ultimately be backed by &# billion in funding from the asian development bank and other sources that will grease the wheels by eliminating capital costs for the companies involved the basic idea is to match environmental service companies based in hong kong with individual factories in chinas pearl river delta region one of the most heavily industrialized and most intensely polluting places on the planet the service companies will conduct environmental audits at the factories and then install new energy efficient technology and machinery to cut both costs and pollution at the factories in effect the chinese factories will outsource their cleanup to the hong kong environmental service companies the trick is that neither party will face any upfront costs or capital investment the hong kong companies will finance their work with loans from the asian development bank and other sources the factories get the technology free and later pay the environmental service companies a cut of the cost savings generated by the new technology over a period of years the hong kong companies then pay off the loans and pocket the remainder as profits the commerce department officials in hong kong hope the program will help generate new markets for u s clean tech companies in china "we cant fund enough regulators or prosecutors to solve asias environmental crisis " says stewart ballard chief commercial consul for the u s commercial service at the american consulate general hong kong and macau "we need to start looking at the environment as business opportunity "
