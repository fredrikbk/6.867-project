guarded health covering the uninsured but only up to &# tennessee experiment goes against the grain as states remake care tullahoma tenn in late dot smith gave up offering health insurance to her employees at pepper patch inc which makes jellies and cakes in this middle tennessee town at &# a month per employee the premiums were just too high now five people who work at pepper patch have insurance again thanks to a new state program that kicked off this month it costs ms smith only around &# a month per employee "it gives me a sense of security knowing i have this insurance card in my purse " says year old ashley robinson whos still paying off a &# bill for an emergency room visit she made when she was uninsured the program engineered by tennessee gov phil bredesen has won national attention as states try to develop plans for universal health care president bush during a recent speech in chattanooga commended the governor a democrat for being "on the leading edge" of health care reform theres just one catch ms robinson and others in the program only get coverage up to &# for health expenses annually and only &# of that can go to hospital bills if she becomes seriously ill or has a major accident shell be just as vulnerable as she was before shell have to either pay the bills herself or ask the hospital for charity care the limits put tennessee in sharp contrast with massachusetts and california two other states that are part of the u s trend toward reconsidering universal coverage plans in the two states envision people paying more of their own medical bills at first in exchange for protection against catastrophic costs gov bredesen isnt the only one casting an eye toward limited benefit or "minimedical" plans employers such as avon products inc international business machines corp and sears holdings corp offer them typically to part time or entry level workers ibm says temporary workers at the company up to a year are eligible insurers say more than a million people are in such plans aetna inc and cigna corp have acquired two of the biggest players in the minimedical business insurers see the plans as low risk and good for squeezing revenue from an untapped market the industry faces pressure to find new customers because the proportion of u s firms offering health insurance coverage dropped to last year from in alan sager a professor of health policy at boston university calls the tennessee plan "flimsy insurance" that will merely "provide cover for employers to save money " adds university of tennessee medical school professor david mirvis "it may be better than nothing but its not real insurance " in an interview gov bredesen says he listened to focus groups and queried blue collar folks such as a waitress at a waffle restaurant to devise his plan "they werent interested in buying insurance for catastrophic events they wanted access to the emergency room next month access to the pharmacy next month " he says "lets give people what they want instead of what some advocate says they want " the governor says the working poor cant afford &# deductibles and he questions whether massachusetts and california can pay for their more ambitious plans gov bredesen who founded and sold a managed care company before getting into politics has already experienced turmoil in dealing with the uninsured tenncare the states version of medicaid was once praised for expanding coverage to a broader range of the uninsured but by the time gov bredesen was first elected in it was overwhelming the state budget in he axed adults from tenncares rolls despite heavy criticism at the end of that year the governor suffered a family tragedy his younger brother dean was uninsured and couldnt get medical treatment for alcohol related liver disease without a large cash deposit dean bredesen refused to ask family members for the money and died says the governor he says health coverage might not have saved his brothers life but he deserved a chance those experiences shaped the "covertn" program that the governor announced and the state legislature approved last year it offers coverage to some of the uninsured without making them pay a significant amount upfront at the same time it and several other related programs make only a small dent in the state budget tennessee kicks in around &# a month to help cover people like ms robinson at pepper patch the state expects those contributions will add up to &# million over three years tennessee had uninsured people in according to the u s census bureau or of the states million population covertn is open initially to businesses that havent offered health benefits for at least six months and have fewer than workers at least half of the firms workers must earn &# or less annually the nonprofit insurer bluecross blueshield of tennessee won state bidding to administer the plan participants must receive care at a network of doctors and hospitals assembled by bluecross blueshield the governor wants to expand the program eventually to more businesses and uninsured individuals more than businesses have applied so far such plans are popular among some employers who say even restricted benefits can help attract and retain workers while taking little or no bite out of the bottom line while a typical comprehensive health policy might cost an employer &# a month per employee according to the kaiser family foundation the narrower plans often cost employers nothing because employees pay the entire premium of &# to &# per month some of the plans are significantly less generous than covertn lowes cos the large home improvement retailer says about part time employees are enrolled in limited benefit policies capped at &# or &# a year bob ihrie vice president of compensation and benefits says the policies are good for covering pregnancies which account for more than a third of the retailers medical claims "we have had great word of mouth with employees saying my wife had a baby and look how little i had to pay " mr ihrie says bluecross blueshield of tennessee says many people in the state cant afford comprehensive coverage and dont seem interested in high deductible policies that offer protection against catastrophic expenses for as little as &# a month ron harr senior vice president of government programs says insurers need to be more like hotel companies that offer a wide variety of amenities and rates under different brand names bluecross expects to break even initially on covertn to make sure consumers dont confuse covertn with comprehensive insurance bluecross puts the words "limited benefits" in bright red on insurance cards benefit forms mailed to members will show how close they are to hitting their limits "it is very important people understand this is not your typical bluecross plan " says mr harr for those who would otherwise go uninsured a big advantage of covertn is the steep discounts that bluecross can extract from doctors and hospitals that will stretch the &# further says stan roberts health practice director at milliman inc a seattle consulting and actuarial firm mr roberts estimates less than of enrollees will exceed the &# annual cap but those people could account for a third of overall medical spending among enrollees he says "some of those are massive million dollar claims that is the reason we need insurance " mr roberts says in practice people with a claim of that size would count on the hospital for charity care or if they tried to pay themselves it might wipe out their assets and make them eligible for medicaid gov bredesen says hospitals already receive substantial government help and must do their part for citizens "i dont have a problem with hospitals holding the bag " he says covertn offers two similar plans both have no deductible and keep co payments modest &# to &# for a doctors visit and &# for a hospital stay one plan covers hospital stays up to &# a year but will only pay &# every three months for drugs the other covers up to &# a quarter in drugs but only &# a year in hospital costs the average hospital stay in the u s cost &# in according to the most recent federal data not including doctors fees that could add thousands of dollars also covertn doesnt cover pre existing conditions for the first months ms smith owner of the pepper patch business assumed at first that covertn was offering many of the same generous benefits she once received through the bluecross policy of her husband a retired physician at vanderbilt university but even after learning about the limits she remained enthusiastic "the big problem is finding insurance that is affordable to the employees and the company " she says ms smith started pepper patch out of her nashville home in thirty years later her company still has a family atmosphere and she regularly refers to her work force as the "girls " her company has nearly &# million in sales and is best known for her "tipsy cakes " which include jack daniels tennessee whiskey inside a kitchen and warehouse in tullahoma about a half dozen workers in hairnets t shirts and jeans make pepper jellies spirit laced cakes fudge sauce and other treats ms smith offered health insurance for more than a decade until late she grew frustrated at times with employees signing up for coverage and then dropping out because they didnt want to pay their share of the premiums kitchen workers on hourly wages get around &# to &# per hour as enrollment dwindled to older sicker workers premiums soared after ms smith dropped coverage some workers with young children left for jobs with health benefits when covertn began five of seven workers in tullahoma signed up premiums are split three ways between the employee employer and the state each party must pay between &# and &# a month with smokers and obese people paying more sherry slatton a nine year veteran in the pepper patch kitchen dropped her comprehensive health insurance through her husbands employer the couple enrolled in the covertn plan and their monthly cost will drop to about &# from &# ms slatton wasnt happy with the old coverage which she says stuck her with &# in charges when she underwent surgery to remove a benign cyst though state officials see covertn as a program to help the uninsured another pepper patch employee is also switching to it from existing coverage operations manager judy knight was paying &# a month for individual coverage from bluecross that carried a &# deductible now shell pay &# a month for the no deductible covertn plan "the difference in cost is unreal " says ms knight ms knight is taking a chance she currently takes six prescription drugs and gets quarterly checkups and blood work for a connective tissue disease and for high blood pressure the coverage cap "is a concern but hopefully i will never have to use the &# " she says "there is always bad with the good " ms robinson the year old kitchen worker figures it cant get any worse than being uninsured a nonprofit clinic recently told her she couldnt get an appointment for a sinus problem for three weeks last summer she went to a hospital emergency room for an infection she says she was treated rudely never saw a doctor and couldnt get a prescription for an antibiotic from a nurse now shes paying &# a month to the hospital to pay off her &# debt her covertn premium is &# a month "you walk in the hospital without insurance its like you dont even matter " says ms robinson some small businesses and employees are disappointed once they discover how limited the benefits are "i think its unacceptable to have that alone " says teresa manning who runs a landscaping business in chattanooga with her husband doctors and hospitals have balked in some cases at participating in the covertn network figuring theyll end up with lots of patients who are effectively uninsured eighty nine of tennessees hospitals have signed up and about of the states doctors are in the covertn network franke elliott regional vice president for managed care at hospital chain hca inc says his tennessee hospitals arent participating yet in covertn out of fear it could "worsen our bad debt issues" when patients rack up big bills both gov bredesen and mr harr of bluecross say enrollment is aimed at the uninsured and hospitals should benefit overall "we know its not perfect and not as comprehensive as we would like " says the governor "but it gets people into the system "
