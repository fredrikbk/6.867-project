chos madness the mass murder at virginia tech is the kind of traumatic event that unleashes a torrent of pop sociology and national psychoanalysis so allow us to weigh in with a more fundamental explanation there are evil and psychotic people in this world willing to do great harm to others if they arent stopped the dilemma in a free society is how to stop them cho seung hui seems to fit the profile of a social misfit who snapped like many other mass killers the year old is being described by acquaintances as a "loner " given to bursts of hostility and other antisocial behavior we will learn more in the coming days but our guess is that those who knew him will conclude that they saw the warning signs the calculation of his murder spree also suggests some deeper evil at work if we can use that word in liberal company cho used chain locks to bar students from escaping lined some up against a wall and emptied his clips with brutal resolve "there wasnt a shooting victim that didnt have less than three bullet wounds in them " one of the doctors on the scene told cnn this was a malevolent soul how can a society that wants to maintain its own individual freedoms stop such a man the reflexive answer in some quarters especially overseas is to blame any killing on americas "lax" guns laws reading a summary of european editorials yesterday we couldnt help but wonder if they all got the same new york times memo so uniform was their cultural disdain and their demand for new gun restrictions yet virginia tech had banned guns on campus using a provision in virginia law allowing universities to become exceptions to the states concealed carry pistol permits virginia is also known for its strict enforcement of gun violations having implemented a program known as project exile that has imposed stiffer penalties and expedited gun cases in any case there is no connection between recent mass murder events and gun restrictions as quebec economist pierre lemieux noted yesterday "mass killings were rare when guns were easily available while they have been increasing as guns have become more controlled " the murders in the scottish town of dunblane killed occurred despite far more restrictive gun laws than americas you could more persuasively argue as david kopel does nearby that the presence of more guns on campus might have stopped cho sooner but as a general rule we are not among those who think college students of all people should be advised to add guns to the books in their backpacks any gun control crusade is doomed to fail anyway in a country like the u s with some million weapons already in private hands while new york mayor mike bloomberg seems ready to stump for gun restrictions we doubt many democrats will join him they did so after columbine in only to lose the election in part because of the cultural backlash in americas rural and hunting counties well concede that this political reality has changed only when new york senators chuck schumer and hillary clinton decide once again to pick up the gun control cause a better response than gun control would be to restore some of the cultural taboos that once served as restraints on antisocial behavior these columns long ago noted the collapse of such social and moral restraints in a widely debated editorial called "no guardrails " instead after columbine there was a rush to blame violent videogames but videogames or other larger media influences dont inspire mass murder when there are countervailing restraints and values instilled by families teachers coaches and pastors two generations ago colleges felt an obligation to act in loco parentis today the concept is considered as archaic as the latin and would probably inspire a lawsuit however even those benevolent influences were it possible to restore them might not have made a difference in the case of cho seung hui whose madness cant be explained by reason see related article "gun free zones" wsj april see related letters "letters to the editor privacy laws guns and the university as protective parent" wsj april
