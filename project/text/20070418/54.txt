hollywood interrogates al qaeda cbss hit series "criminal minds" recently aired an episode entitled "lessons learned " where fbi agents traveled to guantanamo bay and coaxed a confession from a known terrorist detainee that led to the prevention of an anthrax attack on a northern virginia shopping mall the point of the story was that the regular interrogation tactics pictured as brutal assaults on the prisoner were not working and that the military should adopt the enlightened methods of the crack interrogators from "criminal minds " having served as an army judge advocate generals corps officer in gitmo a legal adviser to criminal investigators pursuing leads in the war on terror and a military commissions prosecutor i have first hand knowledge and experience about what happens there and here is the ironic truth the military has outlawed some of the "criminal minds" interrogators tactics in response to pressure by the international community on tv an analyst observed the detainees behavior from an adjoining room behind two way glass for revealing body movements and language subtle movements and body language signaled which statements were true and which were false leading to a breakthrough that saved lives in reality when such a tactic was used at gitmo the international committee of the red cross icrc called it "torture " gitmo authorities used to employ behavior science consultation teams bscts pronounced "biscuits" trained psychologists psychiatrists who did exactly what the tv analyst did used psychology to help interrogators learn the truth but the icrc considered their role in planning and assisting with interrogations "a flagrant violation of medical ethics " the military responded by curtailing the role of bscts on tv cia and fbi interrogators used the detainees religion to gain leverage the cia interrogators refused to allow the detainee to pray then the fbi allowed the prayers but adjusted them to manipulate the detainees sense of time because of the manipulation the detainee admitted responsibility for an attack that he incorrectly believed had already occurred allowing the attack to be thwarted in reality the u s does not manipulate detainees religious practices in gitmo everything stops including interrogations so detainees can pray the islamic call to prayer is broadcast several times a day over loudspeakers everyone in and around the detention camp is forced to listen on tv the interrogators give the detainee a prayer mat and point out the direction to mecca to win his gratitude in reality the u s gives religious items such as prayer mats prayer caps prayer oil prayer beads and qurans to all detainees they dont need anyone to point out the direction of mecca because the u s paints black arrows on the ground pointing toward mecca in every cell and around the camp in fact at camp bucca a u s run detention camp in iraq the u s erected a tent as a makeshift mosque and designated it off limits to prison guards so that detainees could pray in solitude the detainees used their privacy to turn the "mosque" into a weapons cache and then attacked the prison guards this led to a battle for control of the camp that lasted four days despite the debacle at camp bucca the military still designates some items such as the quran as "off limits" to prison guards even though detainees misuse the quran to conceal illegal contraband including prescription pills u s forces in gitmo go to these great lengths despite the fact that the geneva conventions provide for pows to practice their religion only "on condition that they comply with the disciplinary routine prescribed by military authorities " on "criminal minds " the detainee glanced toward bottles of water lining a table and said "they line it up to show what i cannot have " in reality detainees at gitmo receive ample food and water including halal meals and imported seasonal fruits and nuts from their native countries for special occasions while the crime shows creators must resort to fiction to depict interrogations they dont have to fictionalize the contempt that most detainees show for americans hollywood gets that part right on tv the fictional detainee said of killing innocent americans "there is no such thing they were infidels they hurt me by existing the infidels will fall at the hands of the righteous and that is when the jihad will end " in reality according to gitmos web site one detainee said "the people who died on were not innocent my group will shake up the u s and the countries who follow the u s " another told military police officers that he would "come to their homes and cut their throats like sheep " yet another detainee threatened "i will arrange for the kidnapping and execution of u s citizens living in saudi arabia small groups of four of five u s citizens will be kidnapped held and executed they will have their heads cut off " these real statements make one thing clear life in gitmo has not broken the detainees spirits hollywood sets unrealistic expectations for many things the "criminal minds" episode represents one instance where truth is tamer and many would argue stranger than fiction ms rotunda teaches at george mason school of law and is director of the law schools clinic that provides pro bono legal assistance to military families she is currently writing a book about legal issues in the war on terror
