has sallie deal put banks in play for private equity the message that some investors are taking away from the &# billion buyout of sallie mae is that anyone is fair game even as the coffers of private equity firms have bulged in recent years wall street has always assumed that buyout specialists would be wary of certain industries such as financial services these companies usually have heavy capital requirements and already are loaded with borrowed money adding more debt as part of a leveraged buyout or lbo could cripple their credit ratings and make it too expensive to raise money to run their businesses according to conventional wisdom these kinds of companies also are often heavily regulated and buyout specialists usually are wary of any tussles with government bodies but the slated purchase of slm corp commonly known as sallie mae by two private equity firms jc flowers &amp co and friedman fleischer &amp lowe llc and by banks j p morgan chase &amp co and bank of america corp has investors searching for other financial stocks that might be targets in fact investment bankers say other buyout shops are discussing acquisitions of undervalued financial companies even including some banks among those that could be takeover bait are countrywide financial corp cit group inc and istar financial inc according to some traders and analysts the fact that blackstone group also vied for sallie mae suggests that other private equity firms could be eager for these kinds of deals keycorp which provided a disappointing earnings forecast saw its share price fall almost in p m composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange possibly making it attractive to a deep pocketed private equity firm one investment banker said the banker who said keycorp might see some improvement with a buyout partner argued that private equity firms are getting so big and diversified that regulators might be more comfortable with those firms owning a bank "its more challenging to do a deal for a mortgage player or a credit card or auto lender than with sallie mae " which primarily makes government guaranteed loans to students says richard hofmann an analyst at creditsights a research firm "but theyre increasingly likely to be lbo targets now that sallie mae has received such a large premium " some were surprised by the sallie mae deal because the company already had debt of about times equity at the end of last year according to analysts and it had a low equity to assets ratio but since sallie mae can bundle its student loans into bonds to sell to eager investors as part of "asset securitizations " the company doesnt have to rely on raising money in the credit markets like others so the looming prospect of a sharp downgrade of slms credit rating is unlikely to hurt the company as it would another financial player since of sallies loans receive a government guarantee it is easier to securitize these loans it also helps that the companys bank owners are providing a line of financing similarly countrywide can raise money selling its loans in the mortgage backed bond market so its credit rating isnt as crucial countrywide also is cheap though the shares rose yesterday the stock is down almost since late january amid concern over its exposure to the struggling subprime mortgage market anyone with an interest in countrywide would have to be convinced that the company can withstand the weakness in the housing market at years end about of countrywides loan portfolio was made up of option adjustable rate mortgages or those that give borrowers multiple payment options including a minimum payment that might not cover all of the monthly interest cost according to standard &amp poors countrywide has been cutting back on these loans lately and executives have expressed confidence about their position meanwhile student loans represent of cits managed loans according to mr hofmann of creditsights and the company also does some mortgage lending but cit focuses on commercial loans which can be harder to securitize not everyone is convinced that a wave of financial buyouts is in the offing for one thing a financial company with a low credit rating might not always be able to raise cheap capital as in the past few years brian powers chief executive of hellman &amp friedman a san francisco buyout firm that has bought financial companies including united kingdom money manager gartmore investment management plc and lpl holdings inc a seller of investment products to financial advisers says the sallie mae deal could end up being an isolated event in part because of the difficulty that buyout firms will have loading these firms with debt "whether this is a trend or a one off event isnt clear yet " he said some buyout specialists might be tempted to buy regional or smaller banks to help consolidate the business there have been a few such deals goldbanc for example was purchased by silver acquisition corp in a leveraged buyout of a bank or insurance company however could be harder to pull off banks are heavily regulated deposit franchises that hold the savings of individuals so regulators might be unwilling to allow a buyout firm to make a leveraged purchase and an insurance company owned by an lbo firm may fail to generate the same confidence among potential policyholders to be competitive another sign that few industries are likely to escape the roaming eyes of buyout artists the recent interest in the downtrodden automotive sector cerberus capital management lp which last year bought a controlling stake in general motors corp s financial lending arm now is bidding for daimlerchrysler ags chrysler dana cimilluca contributed to this article
