conspicuous charity you might remember the fact reported ad nauseam in the mainstream press last year that vice president dick cheneys tax return showed he had a family income of &# million this was due in no small part from stock options from a variety of companies including the much vilified halliburton corp this fact provoked howls of outrage from many of mr cheneys critics who claimed it was evidence of what one syndicated columnist has called an "autocratic plutocratic regime " significantly less frequently reported last year was this datum mr and mrs cheney gave of their income to charity thats not a typo the couple donated &# million including the proceeds from stock options and book royalties that mrs cheney routinely gives away their giving went to three nonprofit causes in health higher education and services for inner city youth while the cheneys might look like elite philanthropists mr and mrs bush were no charitable slouches either foursquare tithers they gave away of their adjusted gross income in and similar percentages in past years their giving tends to go to more middle class causes including their church the american red cross and the salvation army how does the current administration compare with the previous one in the clintons gave away a solid of their income while the gores gave two years earlier however the former vice presidents giving had earned some special attention in the gores only gave away &# of their income of &# or mr gores spokesman deflected criticism by pointing out that "to truly judge a persons commitment to helping others you need to consider what they have done with their lives and how they have spent their time and by that standard the gores are extraordinarily committed " in other words mr gores life was his charity despite this defense the revelation clearly was embarrassing to the vice president and the next year the gores recovered by giving away a far more respectable why did mr gore feel the need to defend himself when his non giving came to light and raise his donations the following year indeed why is it that americas leaders always feel compelled to release their tax returns which they do voluntarily and show that they give generously are we a nation of scolds ready to condemn our leaders for insufficient displays of selflessness and altruism there is a better explanation for why we look for our leaders to give recent research suggests that giving is one way that we identify qualities of leadership in others for example in two british researchers conducted an experiment on human subjects in which participants were given money and asked if they wanted to share it voluntarily with a larger group some did and some did not this kind of experiment is quite common and many economists have used it to understand our tendency to cooperate with each other in this particular experiment however there was an ingenious twist without announcing it beforehand the researchers followed up the cooperation exercise by asking the participants to vote for a leader eighty percent of the time the person who had contributed the most to the other members of the group was elected the biggest givers were also the most popularly chosen partners in follow up tasks while selfish participants were shunned in other words when mr gore failed to give americans probably didnt see mere selfishness we perceived a lack of leadership maybe he seemed slightly less presidential there are many ways to give besides tax deductible contributions to nonprofits of course and there is no doubt the gores gave in many ways not captured on their tax return the problem for him was that we couldnt see them this raises an interesting ethical problem isnt it somehow less than altruistic to give publicly especially when our giving benefits us by winning the approbation of others perhaps but it is worth keeping in mind that giving openly also provokes mimicry by others and thus a public gift can multiply itself in this way giving abundantly and openly giving like a leader benefits everyone mr brooks teaches at syracuse universitys maxwell school of public affairs and is the author of "who really cares the surprising truth about compassionate conservatism" basic books
