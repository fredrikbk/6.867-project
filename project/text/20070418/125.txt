the mossberg solution photo frame comes armed with wi fi feature wirelessly connects to pcs link can waver one of the most engaging decorations in a home is a generous display of personal photographs whether framed and tastefully arranged on the piano or affixed to the refrigerator in a haphazard fashion these images offer an intimate peek into the homeowners life reflecting whether he gets his smile from mom or dad capturing a memory from a recent vacation or reaffirming a fans loyalty to her favorite college football team but over time the photographs displayed in your own home become less noticeable to you causing your eye to pass over scenes you once saw as fresh and new a terrific solution to this syndrome is found in digital picture frames these gadgets have been around for years and can load your photographs displaying them in slideshows so that one frame houses an ever changing collection of images basic digital frames have built in memory card slots and usb ports allowing you to transfer photos to the frame directly from your camera or computer but uploading photos can be a hassle and a frame equipped with wi fi giving it the ability to wirelessly connect to a computer or the internet seems like the ideal solution this week i tested eastman kodak co s first entry into the wi fi frame category the &# kodak easyshare ex digital frame this frame which will be available next week can wirelessly tap into photos stored on kodaks popular photo sharing web site easyshare gallery and can also discover photos videos and music stored on networked computers i found many of the ex s features enjoyable to use and it became the focal point in my house for me and for guests the changing images were just as much a surprise to them as they were to me but the ex s wi fi capabilities were limited while it consistently connected to and displayed photos from my kodak easyshare gallery account it didnt always find my networked computer when it did the connection wavered stopping in mid slideshow and playing videos in a choppy manner also you must download a third party software program to get the ex to find and display your computers content the ex s screen measures inches diagonally and a slightly larger inch model is also available the &# ex for simply displaying digital photos plenty of companies including kodak offer basic digital frames but i wanted to focus on a frame with built in wi fi setting up the kodak easyshare ex was straightforward an on off switch and memory card slots are hidden behind the frame and it plugs into a standard ac adapter for power a tiny included remote control facilitates navigating through photos and adjusting settings but the frame also has a few basic buttons the frame is divided into four categories on the home screen my frame content stored on the frames megabytes of internal memory kodak gallery network computer and settings after using an on screen keyboard to enter my wi fi networks password and my kodak easyshare gallery username and password i opened the kodak gallery section like the web site of the same name the frame version of kodak gallery is divided into my albums and my friends albums i opened photos from both categories and watched as images from each appeared in slideshows to get my ex to display content from my windows xp laptop i had to first install microsofts free windows media player which filled up with my computers videos photos and some music during installation per kodaks instructions i turned on the players media sharing capabilities most people arent even aware that wmp can load and share photos and even if they are its frustrating that kodak doesnt offer its own program for this procedure your laptop must be also on and out of sleep mode in order to communicate with your frame which can be a real downside for a while my frame wasnt able to discover my computer long enough to select it from my home screen finally i was able to see my computers content on the frame and i sorted through various folders of photos to find one filled with memorable shots from a visit to see my sister in boston but just a few minutes into a slideshow of these photos the frames connection to my laptop was lost stopping the slides i had even more trouble while watching a video from my computer each time it started the footage stuttered and stopped not playing long enough to even hear its accompanying audio kodak says its wi fi frames can also view music pictures and videos on apple computers with help from a &# software program called the twonkyvision mediaserver though i didnt test this photos from kodak gallery didnt fill the entire screen because they arent of a high enough resolution full resolution images including those from my computer the frames internal memory and from memory cards filled the screen entirely and looked great twelve different transitions can be chosen for moving from one photo to the next and photos can appear on screen for as little as three seconds or as long as an hour each currently kodak gallery images must stay on for at least a minute each but kodak is working on a fix if youd rather show one photograph in your frame without changing thats also an option you can opt to display all of your computers photos at once in a giant slideshow but kodak gallery images can only be shown one folder at a time i watched as videos and photos that were loaded on my frames memory played in succession photos changed into video footage and vice versa without any problems i also played a few songs during this slideshow and the music automatically stopped playing when a video started so i could hear the videos sound you cant email from the frame nor can you use the on screen keyboard to add captions to images that will be shared through kodak gallery but you can load photos onto your frame from a memory card or a camera and can then wirelessly copy the images over onto your windows pc kodak says this option wont work on macs the kodak easyshare ex digital frame isnt perfect by a long shot but its wireless capability is a step in the right direction for digital frames and if you use kodak easyshare gallery youll find using the frame to be an even richer experience where discovering and playing computer content on your frame is concerned the ex has work left to do edited by walter s mossberg
