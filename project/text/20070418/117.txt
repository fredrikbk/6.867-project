the abcs of dealing with the amt as dreaded tax ensnares more people advisers suggest ways to avoid it next year ouch as of this weeks filing deadline some four million people wound up owing more in taxes sometimes several thousand dollars more for than they would have otherwise thanks to the federal alternative minimum tax among them alex hopwood a vice president of finance at american express in new york who had to fork over an extra &# under the amt a parallel tax system that forces many people to figure their taxes twice and pay the higher amount last year mr hopwood paid an extra &# but this year after exercising some stock options he says "it really stung me " the amt originally was designed to hit very wealthy people but if congress does nothing this year the number of households hit by the amt will soar to about million according to the latest treasury department estimates affecting many families with five figure incomes "i believe i make a good living but i thought this was something that only affected the higher higher income people " says stephen payne a certified public accountant who lives in longmeadow mass and says his familys adjusted gross income last year was about &# "it seems unfair " mr payne says he paid about &# in additional tax for thanks to the amt while there isnt much people can do about their tax bills some advisers are already helping clients devise strategies to avoid the tax for or at least reduce the pain some suggestions for starters take a fresh look at your holdings of state and local bonds as well as your portfolio of municipal bond mutual funds some types of munis known as private activity bonds typically pay interest that is taxable under the amt that can greatly reduce their attractiveness to taxpayers affected by the amt a spokeswoman for the securities industry and financial markets association a trade group estimates there are about &# billion of private activity bonds outstanding or nearly of the overall muni bond market some fund companies try to help investors steer clear of the amt by offering what are known as amt free funds these funds generally avoid private activity bonds among the fund groups offering amt free funds are fidelity investments oppenheimerfunds and t rowe price group inc since amt free funds arent always clearly labeled investors need to read the prospectus carefully or contact the fund company to determine a funds possible amt exposure conversely if you arent subject to the amt consider buying amt bonds and pocket the extra yield many popular deductions available under the regular system such as state and local taxes the standard deduction and personal exemptions arent allowed under the amt the origins of the tax date back to when congress learned that a small number of high income people had managed to avoid paying any federal income tax through the legitimate use of deductions credits and other items in response lawmakers approved an "add on minimum tax " which was replaced many years later by the amt yet the new tax wasnt indexed for inflation which helps explain why it keeps ensnaring more people as recently as just million taxpayers paid the amt in the number was around says len burman director of the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and the brookings institution in washington suppose youre pretty sure youll be caught by the amt for but probably not for because your tax situation will change significantly you might be planning to move from a high tax area to a low tax one for example in that case dont prepay state and local taxes late this year that are due early next year instead wait until to pay those taxes also if you get hefty bills for tax preparation fees or investment advice late this year see if you can defer paying them until early next year if youre thinking of timing your income in order to avoid the amt though see a tax pro this could be a very complicated strategy especially in view of the uncertainty about what congress will do among those most likely to be affected by the amt this tax season were people with income between &# and &# and who live in high tax areas such as new york city washington d c california connecticut and new jersey says mr burman of the tax policy center mr hopwood the american express executive who works in manhattan but lives in fair lawn n j took a big hit when he realized he could no longer deduct his state and local taxes "im kind of being punished for working in a high tax state " he says people with large families also may be affected because they lose personal exemptions for if congress does nothing more than of filers with income between &# and &# will be subject to the amt says mr burman in addition more than one third of those with income between &# and &# will be caught in the amts web investors hit by the amt can also wind up paying significantly higher tax rates on capital gains and dividends than they expected for long term gains on stocks and other securities the top capital gains rate officially is so is the top rate on most types of dividends but for investors in the amt the top effective rate on long term capital gains and dividends can be or says greg leiserson a research assistant at the urban institute and tax policy center nobody knows what if anything congress will do about the amt this year one possibility is that congress will overhaul the law but that seems unlikely in view of the political bickering in washington a better bet is that congress will enact another temporary fix such as a one or two year "patch " that leaves the number of people caught by the amt close to its current level despite the amts rapid expansion it still hasnt completely eliminated the problem that led to its birth for of the
