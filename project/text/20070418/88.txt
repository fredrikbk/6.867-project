politics &amp economics brazils economy lumbers on hopes dim for overhaul that would speed up lackluster growth rate rio de janeiro when he was sworn in for his second term in january president luiz inacio lula da silva promised to put some juice in brazils chronically slow growing economy but economists are increasingly skeptical that he ever will attack the structural roots of brazils lackluster growth so far mr da silvas second term has been marred by delays in getting a team in place and a crippling strike by air traffic controllers that has kept him from focusing on the sweeping pension labor and tax overhauls investors long for instead he has put forth a grab bag of investment programs and legislative measures dubbed the accelerated growth program their aim is to stimulate the economy in part by channeling investment into important sectors like energy and infrastructure brazils economy which grew at a rate in based upon the governments revised calculation has long underperformed peers in latin america to say nothing of emerging market stars like china and india many economists say that to grow faster brazil needs to reduce its tax rate shrink the size of government and eliminate bureaucratic impediments that make doing business costly but even mr da silvas modest proposals to accelerate growth have run headlong into daunting political challenges in the past two years his workers party has been decimated by a series of scandals that scuttled the political careers of a number of top leaders and cost the party several seats in congress consequently mr da silva has had to broaden his governing coalition to incorporate political parties and engage in constant horse trading to keep them all happy he also is operating without some of his closest economic and political operators who had accompanied him since his days as a union leader in the s but were ousted amid the first term scandals "he has to make decisions and handle negotiations by himself and it takes more time " says cristiano noronha a political analyst at arko advice consultants in brasilia one sign of the governments day to day management problems has been its ineffectual response to months of unrest among air traffic controllers which culminated in a strike on march congress has been caught up in debating who is to blame for the disruption in brazils air travel which has further slowed action on mr da silvas economic program mr da silva also waited until the end of march to fill out his member cabinet a task usually finished in the first weeks of a new administration and he only recently turned his attention to making second tier appointments in posts that oversee hundreds of thousands of public servants and control billions of dollars the presidents supporters argue that the go slow approach could be a blessing in disguise in the first term the workers party tried steamrolling legislation through congress and at times overreached several of the partys former leaders face federal indictment over an alleged scheme to buy congressional votes now in the second term mr da silvas backers say that whatever measures congress passes will be the fruit of a genuine consensus congressman jose mucio monteiro a leader of the governing coalition predicts that measures still outstanding in the legislative package will pass the lower house by the end of the month though many of the proposals must also win senate approval others are less sanguine about the administrations prospects "the team that the president put together in his first term was for competing in the first division despite its mistakes and personal failings " said onyx lorenzoni an opposition leader in congress "the current team is for the third division " even with the political troubles brazils economy can coast along with modest growth because external conditions are so favorable thanks to strong chinese demand for brazils agricultural and mineral commodities and ample liquidity on global capital markets brazils hard currency reserves have hit a record of more than &# billion the central bank is easing interest rates and economists are projecting growth this year of to moderate growth and low inflation combined with heavy social spending is proving a winning political combination for mr da silva whose popularity rating is above feeling little pressure from markets or voters mr da silva has eschewed bold overhauls in favor of economic fine tuning including tweaking the tax code to stimulate favored industries like electronics and construction on the spending side the government envisions total investment over the next four years of billion reals &# billion with energy and infrastructure the priorities the projected investment amounts to around of brazils gross domestic product the federal government and public companies are projected to commit just over half of those funds the government is counting on the private sector to take the lead in putting up the rest before they invest however many business leaders say they want more sweeping economic changes than mr da silva has so far proposed one area business wants overhauled is brazils ponderous labor law which imposes benefits and nonwage costs that are sharply higher than the regional average according to the world bank some members of mr da silvas cabinet who would be counted on to take a leading role in overseeing labor law changes are openly opposed to them "im not going to defend reforms that take away rights from the worker " carlos lupi the labor minister appointed by mr da silva said recently mr lupi said he would stick to his guns even though "they may call me antiquated and backward saying that im out of step with the modern world " likewise rather than proposing strong measures to address the loss ridden social security system mr da silva has moved to finesse the issue by creating a blue ribbon committee to study the system
