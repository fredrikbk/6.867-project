fiscally fit when it makes sense to pay pmi terri helps her sister make a decision mortgage insurance or piggyback loan online edition my sister melissa and her husband joe have finally pulled the trigger and made an offer to buy a house after years of struggling to find something affordable near my jersey shore town melissa and joe have enough in savings to make a down payment on the &# home but doing so would leave them with no financial cushion instead they want to put just down and save the rest for financial emergencies and to pay other expenses such as moving costs and making minor improvements to their new home so the couple is considering two options one would be to take out a traditional year fixed rate mortgage for of the cost of the home and pay the remaining out of their savings because theyd be financing more than of the home price theyd be required to pay private mortgage insurance pmi coverage that protects a lender in the event the homeowner defaults on the loan how much youll pay for pmi depends on many factors says glen corso group senior vice president of public policy at california mortgage insurer pmi group "someone paying of the loan is going to pay more for insurance than someone paying with or down " he says youll also pay more if you borrow with an adjustable rate loan instead of a fixed rate he says your credit score is also factored in "people with a credit score below are going to pay more than people with a higher credit score " and anyone who borrows with a loan that requires little documentation will also pay more in general he says the average premium is between &# and &# a month to avoid paying pmi melissa and joe could borrow with a so called piggyback mortgage the option theyre considering consists of one year fixed rate mortgage that covers of the cost of the home and a second year fixed rate balloon loan to cover of the down payment theyd pay the remaining from their savings to help melissa and joe make the right choice for them ill run through the potential benefits and drawbacks of each loan piggyback mortgages grew in popularity when mortgage and interest rates were low mortgage rates track the movements of the treasury market while second mortgages or home equity loans move in line with the federal reserves fed funds target rate but after the fed began incrementally raising short term rates to today from in june piggyback loans began to lose their luster the problem the second mortgage payment became too expensive for some borrowers says keith gumbinger spokesman for new jersey mortgage data publisher hsh associates this year homebuyers such as melissa and joe have another reason to avoid non traditional loans such as piggybacks piggybacks used to be more attractive than traditional loans because mortgage interest on the second loan was tax deductible while pmi premiums werent but under a new federal law passed late last year pmi premiums are tax deductible for borrowers who buy or refinance a home in there are eligibility requirements a homeowner must have an adjusted gross income of &# or less to get the full deduction above &# the deduction begins to phase out borrowers with agis of &# &# for married people filing separately or more get nothing the deduction also doesnt apply to mortgage insurance contracts issued before jan higher rates and the new tax break appear to be prompting more borrowers to choose loans with pmi the number of home buyers opting for such loans rose to in february up from a year earlier according to the trade group mortgage insurance companies of america so does it make sense for my sister to pay pmi i asked mr gumbinger of hsh to run the numbers to see how the two loans compare at todays rates on a piggyback loan financed with first loan down payment financed with second loan down payment from savings no pmi melissa and joe would pay &# in principal and interest on a &# year fixed rate mortgage at on the second loan a &# year loan at theyd pay &# a month in principal and interest so their total monthly payment would be &# on a &# fixed rate year mortgage with pmi financed down at their monthly payment would be &# and pmi would cost an additional &# for a total estimated monthly payment of &# or about &# more a month than the traditional loan now factor in the pmi tax deduction &# a month assuming a tax bracket according to this calculator from pmi group inc so melissa and joe would save just &# a month for the remainder of this year by going with the piggyback loan but there are other reasons to pay pmi with a piggyback mortgage the only way to lower the monthly payment is to pay off the second loan or to refinance when mortgage rates fall refinancing costs average between and of the outstanding principal with the highest rate being paid by homeowners with bad credit according to loan quote web site lendingtree com pmi premiums on the other hand will eventually go away borrowers have the right to ask lenders to end the premiums once the loans balance falls to of the homes fair market value but there is a cost involved homeowners must hire an appraiser which can cost between &# to &# depending on where you live the iffy housing market also may mean melissa and joes home will appreciate in value much more slowly than in recent years or may even decline forcing them to make premium payments for much longer than the five to seven years homeowners typically pay for pmi "with the position the housing markets are in today its much more of a crapshoot than it was before " says hshs mr gumbinger while traditional loans are looking more appealing these days theres also no guarantee that pmi premiums will remain tax deductible the law is set to expire in melissa and joe are likely to begin making mortgage payments in august so the tax benefits would be relatively small and if they took the standard deduction when they filed rather than itemizing they wouldnt be able to deduct pmi premiums at all because piggyback loans generate a larger tax deduction than single loans theyre generally best for borrowers in the highest tax bracket according to jack guttentag professor emeritus at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school piggybacks are least attractive for low income borrowers the bigger the house the bigger the mortgage and the bigger the tax deduction melissa and joe plan on living in the home for five to seven years mr guttentag says that under those circumstances it makes more sense to choose a loan with pmi "the borrower might be able to get rid of mortgage insurance after six or seven years not so with a big second mortgage " in the end melissa and joe decided to go with the piggyback loan largely due to the flexibility of the lower monthly payment and their doubts that the tax break for pmi will be extended for purchases and refinancings after because the short term second loan pays down principal more quickly than a long term first mortgage would theyll save on interest by making additional principal payments to pay down the second mortgage since theyll likely receive a much larger refund thanks to mortgage interest and property tax deductions they plan on reducing their tax withholding so theres more income to make those payments this irs withholding calculator can help you determine how much to withhold how did you decide between paying mortgage insurance with a traditional loan or avoiding it by borrowing with a piggyback loan are you happy with your decision or would you choose a different loan if you could do it all over again
