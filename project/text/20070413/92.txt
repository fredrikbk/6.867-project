weekend journal hollywoods repeat offenders when universal pictures set out to make a sequel to its blockbuster "bruce almighty " it faced a big problem jim carrey wasnt interested in reprising his signature role as bruce a tv reporter endowed with gods powers the hoped for franchise appeared to stall after one movie universals response no star no problem it recast the film with steve carell in the title role of the now renamed "evan almighty" and steamed ahead with a &# million project that is likely to rank as the most costly comedy ever made gearing up for the summer of major movie studios arent letting anything stop them from putting their biggest brands on display hollywood is heading into what may be its biggest summer ever both in potential ticket sales and what it spent to create an unprecedented crush of new titles and big name sequels media analysts project that domestic box office revenue could reach &# billion for the first time may kicks off with a brutal smackdown featuring the third installments of three of the biggest franchises in movie history "spider man " "shrek the third" and "pirates of the caribbean at worlds end " and thats just the start studios plan to roll out a dozen more sequels over the course of the summer theres a fifth "harry potter " a third "rush hour" and "oceans " a second "fantastic four" and a follow up to a series that started years ago "die hard " the list extends all the way down to a "daddy day care" sequel "daddy day camp " originally intended as a direct to dvd title and a ninth take on "halloween " on top of that are new titles all of them would be franchises built on well known brands including the transformers toys and "the simpsons" tv series plus the latest animated offering from disneys pixar "ratatouille " while summers gone by have usually offered up about five mega budget "event" movies this season the industry will roll out at least twice that many soaring movie costs that once made headlines the &# million budget of "titanic" drew gasps in the late s have become part of the landscape a handful of this years films will easily top &# million in production costs and when tens of millions of dollars in global marketing are added in the new "spider man" and "pirates" may in fact be the first &# million plus movies with the megabudgets putting so much on the line hollywood is seeking risk aversion in its familiar brand names and it is choosing to release these films in the summer not just because kids are out of school but because it neatly sets up a title for a dvd release at the year end holidays something that is increasingly important to big studios under pressure to deliver timely results to their corporate overlords "pirates of the caribbean dead mans chest " for instance was the biggest box office and dvd hit of walt disney co s response rush out another "pirates" movie the very next summer but in choosing what seems to be the safest path the studios are also opening themselves up to ever louder accusations of creative bankruptcy one of hollywoods most profitable studios twentieth century fox is also one of the biggest culprits this summer its big releases are sequels to "fantastic four " " days later" and "die hard " as well as "the simpsons movie " the predominance of the tried and true is bound to upset filmgoers who are hungry for something more adventurous in a neat trick the big studios themselves will try to take advantage of that by counterprogramming smaller original fare against their own giant sequels two new comedies from "the year old virgin" team are set to hit screens "knocked up" and "superbad " paramount pictures meanwhile has shifted "hot rod " a low budget comedy in the vein of "napoleon dynamite " to the same august weekend that universal releases "the bourne ultimatum " for the older art house crowd that weekend also will see "becoming jane " a romance about jane austen from disneys miramax still having so many high budget high hype movies on the schedule has some in hollywood worried "everyone is going to see spider man pirates and shrek once " says jeffrey katzenberg chief executive of dreamworks animation

evan mr carell with orders to build an ark the filmmakers built an actual ark to near biblical specifications feet long and five stories tall they also employed more animals than almost any film in
