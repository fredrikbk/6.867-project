radio show one day earlier msnbc had canceled its broadcast of the show on cable tv cbs had originally suspended mr imus for two weeks but succumbed amid an escalating national outcry and an exodus of big advertisers "all of us have been deeply upset and revulsed by the statements that were made on our air " cbs corp ceo leslie moonves said yesterday in a written statement mr imus who didnt respond to repeated calls seeking comment had for years been making outrageous and frequently crude remarks about risky subjects such as race sex and gender a style that millions of listeners had embraced the media executives and advertisers profiting from mr imuss popularity stood by him as protests occasionally surfaced they usually subsided after a few days this time it was different the target was a sympathetic team of young athletes in the ensuing furor the lucrative and often vulgar business of talk radio found itself running into new limits as the internet sent mr imus to millions of pc screens driving executives advertisers and employees to distance themselves from his racist words on the morning of the original broadcast there was little response to mr imuss slur media matters

to mr imus in chicago bryan monroe president of the national association of black journalists saw an email sent by one of his executive board members at p m "fyi do we need to address" read the subject line it was the media matters post mr monroe editorial director of johnson publishing co in charge of ebony and jet magazines wasnt a regular reader of media matters or an imus listener he looked at the email "my first reaction was oh no he didnt " he says then he watched the clip "i heard the words come out of his mouth and thought has he lost his mind " mr monroe picked up the phone and started calling other board members he had guests over for dinner that night who also were african american they talked about the controversy during dinner later that night he was back on the phone with nabj members and pulled an all nighter to draft a statement it said that the member organization was "outraged and disgusted" by the comments and called for "an immediate and sincere apology " mr monroe posted the statement to the nabj web site at a m friday morning there was again scant mention of mr imuss travails in the newspapers although tv stations were beginning to pick up the story mr imus began his program at a m with an on air apology people close to mr imus say he felt pressured to apologize by nbc and cbs executives he also realized he needed to try to defuse the brewing storm "want to take a moment to apologize for an insensitive and ill conceived remark " he said "our characterization was thoughtless and stupid and were sorry " it was good friday and many people already were off for the holiday weekend news was supposed to slow to a crawl for several days instead the apology made the story explode it hit the wires that day and reporters began to contact cbs and msnbc it quickly became clear an apology wasnt going to suffice and that the weekend wouldnt douse the fire david carr who writes a monday media column for the new york times business section decided to scrap his planned subject and write about mr imus instead he called the remark "the kind of unalloyed racial insult that might not have passed muster on a low watt am station in the jim crow south " mr imuss problems were compounded by a power vacuum at cbs radio which produced his show two weeks earlier ceo joel hollander a longtime supporter of mr imus and his various charities had resigned the company had been underperforming lately and was still reeling from the loss of shock jock howard stern to satellite radio mr hollanders successor mr mason wasnt due to start until april he consulted with cbs executives by phone and email from his home outside washington d c mr imuss show is on just one cbs station wfan but the media giant also earns revenue from syndicating the

dietl discussed the possibility of mr imus appearing on mr sharptons radio show on monday mr dietl says he advised against it saying mr sharpton would use mr imus only to advance his own agenda but mr imus told his friend he wanted to use the show to apologize again cbs managers checked in with each other by phone according to a spokesman and nbc news executives gathered for a lengthy conference call on sunday to map strategy says allison gollust head of communications for nbc news ms gollust hosted people at her home for easter dinner but never saw them both cbs and nbc realized on monday that critics were focusing their energy on msnbc the channel critics strategized was more likely to pull the plug because it had less to lose mr imus generates about &# million a year for cbs but only about &# million for msnbc and although mr imus reached over two million radio listeners every morning and only about television viewers tv was a more visible platform to attack mr dietl offered to appear on mr sharptons show with mr imus "he said no bo i want to go on myself i want to show im not afraid to face the music " mr dietl recalls saying mr imus was convinced the controversy would die down after an apology but the appearance seemed to make matters worse with critics latching on to mr imuss use of the phrase "you people " in what they said was a bungled apology cbs and nbc faced new problems the rutgers basketball team called a news conference for tuesday morning another issue a two day charity "radio athon" scheduled for mr imuss show on thursday and friday at p m msnbc issued a harsh statement announcing it was suspending the show for two weeks calling mr imuss comments "racist" and "abhorrent " cbs minutes later released its own statement saying it also would suspend the show the rutgers news conference the next day was devastating carried live on cable tv it went on for more than an hour the coach gave a lengthy speech before the young women on the team eight of whom are black were introduced they looked uncomfortable in the media glare without a hint of professional polish their remarks came across as heartfelt for years mr imus had been somewhat inoculated from criticism because along with the edgy shtick he addressed serious issues with guests from the political and media establishment presidential candidates john kerry john mccain joseph biden top journalists nbcs tim russert david gregory and andrea mitchell and writers with a book to sell made stops on the show mr imus also pushed worthy charities including his new mexico ranch which hosted
