weekend journal the drivers seat hondas alt fuel twist natural gas when even an old line oilman like president bush is willing to endorse alternative fuel vehicles as he did in a recent news conference with the big threes chief executives its pretty safe to say that the idea of a car running on something other than gasoline has gone mainstream or at least talking about it has consumers looking to put their money where the alliance of automobile manufacturers has put its mouthpieces are likely to be disappointed thats because theres a paucity of options there are six commonly accepted nongasoline alternatives biodiesel electricity ethanol hydrogen natural gas and propane but the only widely obtainable model year cars and trucks that can use any of them are "flex fuel" vehicles equipped with engines and fuel systems that can use e a blend of ethanol and gasoline though flex fuel vehicles make for mom and apple pie images of cornfields solving our energy problems by feeding ethanol plants instead of families the "flex" means they can also run on old fashioned persian gulf gasoline as the odds of finding an e pump are just slightly better than winning the powerball lottery many flex fuel vehicles will never see a single tank of ethanol despite their owners good intentions that makes flex fuel vehicles similar to hybrids in that their merits tend to be overrated hybrids may get better fuel economy than similarly sized nonhybrid vehicles because their electric motors and batteries pick up some of the power generating task but their engines still burn gasoline natural gas on the other hand creates less pollution than gasoline when burned in an internal combustion engine that natural gas sold in the u s is primarily produced domestically means such vehicles could potentially delight blue and red staters alike alas that doesnt seem to be the case while several car makers used to build natural gas vehicles including chrysler ford and general motors the sole one left is honda it makes a natural gas version of its civic called the gx that is offered at dealers in california and new york nothing prevents customers in other states from special ordering one from a local honda retailer but honda says it will build only about of the civics this year compare that with the civic hybrids that honda sold in out of its total u s civic sales still the gx is a car you can buy today for &# before a &# federal tax credit for alternative fuel vehicles vs &# for the equivalent gasoline powered civic thats more than can be said for most other alternative fuel ideas a brief summary no auto maker has yet certified the use of pure biodiesel in any of the handful of diesel models sold in the united states hydrogen is limited to research and development vehicles which is fine because a national hydrogen infrastructure is still the stuff of sci fi propane powered vehicles tend to be more of the heavy duty fleet variety think buses electric cars been there done that seen the movie if someday they make the sequel "who killed the natural gas car " it wont be because the civic gx isnt trying like the hybrid civic the gx is based on the award winning compact honda sedan even more so than the hybrid the gx looks and drives like its gasoline powered sibling it does have some special equipment starting with the big fuel tank that takes up half the trunk resulting in the gxs trunk having just six cubic feet of capacity on the outside the only notable differences from a regular civic are a big diamond cng for compressed natural gas decal on the trunk and a gas line coupling where the gasoline filler neck usually resides underneath they share the same mechanicals including a liter inline four cylinder engine and five speed automatic transmission but the natural gas version makes horsepower and pound feet of torque compared to and for the gasoline engines this and the gxs extra pounds that natural gas tank isnt light translate into a more sluggish driving experience but the cars performance is acceptable among the downsides is that storing enough fuel to have a typical plus mile driving range is a sisyphean challenge the bigger the tank the heavier the vehicle the worse the fuel economy the fewer miles it will go honda states a mile range for the gx but the fuel warning light illuminated during my test drive after only miles i pushed my luck for more before refueling at the pump i paid less than i would have for gasoline the national average for the cng equivalent of a gallon of gasoline in late february was &# or cents less than the &# average for regular unleaded overall i got the equivalent of miles per gallon over miles of driving if youre thinking the gxs range makes it a poor candidate for long distance travel youre right natural gas filling stations are indeed scarce though ironically natural gas isnt its infrastructure is well established and even in areas without commercial filling stations theres the option of tapping a residential gas line honda has a deal with fuelmaker corp to market its phill home refueling appliance to gx buyers the phill which costs &# to &# plus installation can fill a bone dry gx in hours though gx owners can easily top off their tanks in the garage each night because at the end of the day the gx is designed to be a commuter car and it does work perfectly well for that purpose contact me at jeff sabatini wsj com
