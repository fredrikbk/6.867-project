officials fired at dow chemical for secret talks two accused of seeking outside buyout deal a tip from j p morgan the tip came from a phone call dow chemical co chairman and chief executive andrew liveris was surprised to hear what the caller someone he trusted implicitly had to report two dow veterans one a board member and the other a top executive had been talking to investors from oman about purchasing the year old company and taking it private in a leveraged buyout according to a person with knowledge of the call there was one big problem the companys board hadnt authorized any such discussions dow says yesterday dow the nations biggest chemical company with revenue of almost &# billion acted swiftly it fired the duo senior adviser j pedro reinhard a director and former chief financial officer and romeo kreinberg an executive vice president from their jobs at the company the company said it took the move "with full support of the board " mr reinhard remains a company director for now dow got confirmation of the pairs alleged initiative from someone at j p morgan chase &amp co according to people familiar with the matter discussions between dow and j p morgan over the issue included a conversation between mr liveris and j p morgan chief executive james dimon these people said both messrs reinhard and kreinberg had earlier been passed over for top jobs at dow but until this week by all appearances they remained in the companys good graces biographies of both men on the companys web site recounted their decades long rise to increasingly important jobs their dismissals follow a history of management turmoil at dow and come amid an aggressive drive by the company to remake itself to boost long term profitability that effort rests squarely on deal making though dow says it has no interest in selling itself it is pushing hard to ink a series of joint ventures in its commodity oriented basic chemicals business particularly in asia and the middle east this weeks drama at dow lays bare the tensions rippling through a growing number of corporate boardrooms leveraged buyout firms and other private investors are sitting on an estimated &# trillion of spending power cash that they are increasingly willing to train on business icons around the globe from radio giant clear channel communications inc to french retailer carrefour sa to alinta ltd a leading australian utility as gatekeepers for these deals managements and boards are thrust into increasingly fraught positions top executives often are recruited by would be buyers who want to exploit the expertise and connections of existing management and suitors sometimes promise big paydays which typically come in the form of an ownership stake potentially to for a company of dows size but these inducements carry a big danger for the companies involved warns james woolery an attorney at cravath swaine &amp moore in new york "its the absolute worst way to negotiate as a public company " he said "divided boards lose in negotiations and become poisoned its like having someone from an opposing team in your locker room during half time " rumors about an effort to take dow private had been circulating for weeks on sunday a london newspaper reported word of a possible buyout proposal on monday dows stock jumped sending company executives scrambling for answers that afternoon dow issued a news release denying the rumors and on tuesday mr liveris the companys ceo ducked out of a management meeting to do a round of interviews amplifying those denials "these rumors i dont know where theyre coming from " he said "there are no discussions going on " behind the scenes and unbeknownst to mr liveris however messrs reinhard and kreinberg had been trying to arrange an acquisition of the company said chris huntley a dow spokesman the buyout discussions occurred in "multiple meetings in multiple months in multiple locations " and "with a number of different parties " including more than one investment bank mr huntley said mr reinhard didnt respond to a message left on his cellphone the drama unfolded so quickly that even mr reinhards wife was in the dark "to tell you the truth i found out on the tv " she said when reached at her home in key biscayne fla she said she hadnt yet talked to her husband about his dismissal but that the behavior that was cited for it didnt sound like him mr kreinberg contacted at his home by telephone told the associated press there was no truth to the companys allegations and that he has sought the advice of legal counsel "the behavior of the company is very unusual and the accusations have absolutely no substance and are highly damaging to my reputation after years of employment " he said several governance experts said it was highly unusual for a major u s company to fire officials so swiftly for pursuing a sale without permission on the other hand says paul lapides director of the corporate governance center at kennesaw state university in kennesaw ga "theres no better way to send a clear message that certain behavior is unacceptable " for years dow based in midland mich was regarded as a sleepy company from a sleepy town led by a collegial executive team throughout the late s under chief executive william stavropoulos dows financial performance was relatively stable on wall street mr stavropouloss three executive vice presidents were better known than he was "i look at it as the four musketeers one for all and all for one " mr stavropoulos said of himself and that trio in a interview one of the three was mr reinhard the companys chief financial officer mr reinhard by then already had spent a quarter century at dow having joined the company in brazil in and risen through a succession of financial posts in mr stavropoulos turned years old and retired as is traditional for a dow ceo he stayed on as chairman he was replaced as ceo not by mr reinhard who associates say wanted the top job but by another member of mr stavropouloss triumvirate michael parker mr reinhard "was one of the leading candidates" for ceo in but lost the succession race because mr parker had more operational experience a reinhard acquaintance recollected mr reinhard "gritted his teeth" and stayed put because he felt so loyal to dow this person said in and dows earnings plummeted in december mr parker was pushed out as ceo mr reinhard was too close to retirement age to raise his hand for the job a second time mr stavropoulos again assumed the ceo post two years later mr stavropoulos retired again as ceo and mr liveris won the job among others passed over during mr liveriss rise was mr kreinberg who had been in the running for the job of chief operating officer when mr liveris got that post in mr kreinberg joined the company in and spent much of the next years in jobs throughout europe on monday as buyout rumors sent dows stock higher the companys board and top executives including mr liveris were already in midland for a previously scheduled round of meetings mr liveris and geoffery e merszei dows chief financial officer began making phone calls "to contacts they have" to determine whether there was "any fragment of fact" behind the rumblings said mr huntley the dow spokesman that afternoon dow issued a news release denying the rumors buyout giant kohlberg kravis roberts &amp co one of the firms named in the london press reports had at no point been in discussions with dow said one person close to the new york based firm the group had in fact been approached by a bank this person said but quickly decided against any involvement in a takeover on tuesday in interviews mr liveris repeated dows denials of any buyout plan but later tuesday dow executives received a call from a person at j p morgan which had been consulted in the alleged buyout discussions involving messrs reinhard and kreinberg according to people familiar with the situation on wednesday dow directors still in midland met to discuss the situation board members also discussed whether to withdraw mr reinhards proposed re election at the companys may annual meeting dows proxy issued late last month lists him among the nominees as of wednesday night the board still hadnt agreed to pull the reinhard nomination that action seems likely though it might require a revised proxy "you cant have a director going off without full authorization from the company and negotiate the sale of the company " said another person familiar with the matter the board decided to fire mr kreinberg it also fired mr reinhard from his job as dow senior adviser but mr reinhard hadnt resigned his board post as of yesterday afternoon dows mr huntley said unless mr reinhard resigns before dows coming annual meeting mr huntley said the company will recommend then that shareholders replace him susan warren and robin sidel contributed to this article
