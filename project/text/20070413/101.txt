weekend journal tastings on the menu wines not in stores restaurants offer hidden treasures the refosco lesson have you had a refosco recently we hadnt either refosco is an italian red wine we used to drink from time to time when we were younger we remember it being fun and slightly rustic but we rarely see refosco anymore and pretty much forgot about it so you can imagine our surprise when we visited a restaurant recently that was serving a wine made predominantly of refosco from california it was called mattia from palmina winery and it was refosco cabernet franc and merlot the refosco grape is so rare in california that the state doesnt report how many acres are planted but the number is very small we ordered it of course and it was outstanding with lusty earthiness and real vibrancy we had never seen this wine before and theres a good reason for that the winery made only cases and most went to restaurants only a small percentage found its way to retailers over the past couple of months weve written about some of the small annoyances of wine service at restaurants readers have suggested quite a few more but all of this helpful criticism shouldnt obscure something very important there are all sorts of terrific wines that you will usually find only at restaurants if you are going to expand your palate and taste some really unusual and interesting stuff restaurants are key we have written in the past about how to decode a wine list but no point is more important than this look for the unusual quite a few good wineries focus their sales on restaurants not retail stores not only that but ordering a wine that youve never seen before makes the whole issue of markup far less relevant whenever someone says to us "why should i pay three times what id pay for a wine at the corner store " we want to say "why are you ordering a wine you see at the corner store " sure there are some restaurants where the wine list is so lackluster that you have no choice but increasingly restaurants do offer something special if you spend a little time with the wine list consider navarro vineyards gewurztraminer we love the spicy unique taste of gewurz and navarro routinely makes one of americas best we celebrated our daughter medias th birthday at new yorks le cirque restaurant last month the wine list was huge and filled with some reasonably priced wines and a lot of famous wines that cost thousands of dollars amid all of these dottie spied navarros gewurz for &# the best buy on the list we ordered it to go with the seafood heavy tasting menu media selected and it was excellent dry spicy and filled with personality we felt so lucky to have it because we knew that wed rarely see it in a store deborah cahn who owns navarro with her husband ted bennett says the winery makes about cases of the gewurz most is sold directly from the winery to consumers and about cases go to restaurants the winery doesnt sell to retailers except a tiny amount to a few old friends why "i think all of our wines show better with food they are meant to have with a meal so for us selling to restaurants that we like to eat in is almost a form of advertising because it introduces the wine to people who otherwise wouldnt have a chance to come to the anderson valley to try our wines " by the way the gewurz sells for &# at the winery which means the markup at le cirque was about three times retail but were not complaining its sure cheaper than a plane ticket to california steve clifton the owner winemaker at palmina says small wineries that make unusual wines such as his mattia count on restaurants to showcase their wines "because were sort of different than the norm it takes sommeliers who are willing to hand sell this type of wine " he told us "italian varietals from california need a lot of education for people to get behind them " his wines he said "are purchased by and sold by really excited sommeliers " in our experience an excited sommelier makes for a fun dinner we recently visited a restaurant because we saw on its wine list online that it had littorai one of californias sought after chardonnays the winerys total production is about cases a third of that goes to the winerys mailing list and the other two thirds to restaurants ted lemon the owner winemaker says he doesnt have any bias against retailers but thats how the winery has always done it and with so little supply it works fine besides he says "its important that each bottle be an ambassador we want to get the word out there as far and wide as we can " and getting the wine into restaurants does that in addition he said at restaurants "its going to get treated with the respect and attention it deserves "its the magic of food and wine " he told us "when you sit down to eat there youre not only the captive of the chefs food but youre the captive of whats in the glass if its interesting and complex enough to reveal itself during that meal youre going to have a really good time " mr lemon said that especially winemakers who "make wine thats a little bit more elegant or subtle" really appreciate their wines being enjoyed over a long period of time with a fine meal at a restaurant one of the advantages of fine restaurants with good wine cellars is that you can often have bottles with some age on them that you couldnt find in stores and you can have some confidence that theyve been kept well we recently had dinner at a restaurant in new york called the modern at the museum of modern art we did our homework beforehand considering the ease of the internet these days and how many restaurants have sites wed really recommend this and discovered that the chef and wine director were both from alsace our advice is always to order a wine that seems to be the passion of the restaurant so when we got there we told the sommelier to wow us with an alsatian wine that cost around &# or less it was a special occasion he did not know we are wine writers from the cellar he brought a alsatian pinot gris from leon beyer thats right a year old white it was golden colored and smelled of fruit earth and wisdom and it was in a word spectacular with the kind of complexity and depth that only age can bring this is simply not an experience we could have had by dropping in to the local wine store these experiences are not available only at big city restaurants in tallahassee fla recently we dropped into a cute little place called alberts provence and dottie noticed a wine wed never seen before "threesome" rhone style blend from leal vineyards in the san benito region of california the wine from the vintage was a blend of syrah grenache and mourvedre we enjoy trying californias rhone blends but we often find them overly aggressive and somewhat harsh this one was smooth and winning the winery made cases of this wine of the winerys case total production almost all is sold directly to consumers or to restaurants why the focus on restaurants "the ambiance the food the wine our wine shines a lot better in that situation " the owner of the winery frank leal told us "and we get the loyal fan they taste it in the restaurant they join our wine club they look for our wine " its also not just fancy places that offer unusual wines more mexican restaurants these days offer mexican wines a little indian place we visited recently was pouring a white beaujolais by the glass we dont often see white beaujolais and were not generally big fans of it anyway often finding it thin but this one from jean paul brun was excellent with ripe chardonnay fruit and good acidity that was perfect with our indian food our favorite little italian place a cash only family spot has an owner who cares about wine so he always features a wine special that he found himself its written in chalk on a blackboard its that kind of place recently it was truchard cabernet from napa valley for &# it was earthy and broad and interestingly reminded us very much of a good italian wine having a bottle with any age at a restaurant is always a treat and was a very good year good wineries work very hard to get their wines into restaurants and many restaurants work very hard to offer interesting different wines you are the third part of that equation if you see something new and different on the list take a chance and order it you can contact us at wine wsj com
