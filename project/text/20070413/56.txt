notice to tribune employees read this first i feel compelled to respond to holman jenkinss april satirical opinion piece "lucky me" business world ostensibly an unsent email to tribune employees from sam zell first his characterization of the transaction as forcing employees to "double down" is simply wrong our employees currently own about million shares of tribune stock million of which reside in k accounts along with all other shareholders they will benefit from this transaction receiving &# per share in cash for a total of &# million they are not required to reinvest this money in tribune and can diversify it any way they wish furthermore existing employee retirement and pension benefits are entirely secure tribunes esop will not require employees to make any investment in the company the esop will be funded entirely by new company contributions in addition in the company will provide employees with a new package of retirement benefits with three components a cash balance plan funded entirely by the company with an annual contribution equal to of an employees eligible compensation effectively providing a "floor" retirement benefit annual allocations from the esop with an initial target of of an employees eligible compensation a k plan to which employees can contribute up to the maximum allowed by the irs with regard to the description of sam zells &# million "option" to buy of tribune its important to understand that he will have an option to buy of what will then be a highly leveraged company not the &# billion company tribune is today the day after the transaction closes of the equity in the company will be worth far less than the &# million mr zell would have to pay for his stock his option has value only if the company performs and pays down its debt that success will similarly increase the value of the esop in which case our employees benefit along with mr zell finally the column implies that the esop trustee failed to get a "fairness opinion" prior to the transaction that too is wrong the esop trustee did in fact obtain a fairness opinion on both the price of the shares purchased by the esop and the relative price mr zell will have to pay to obtain his stake in the company like all media companies tribune faces risks and challenges in the days ahead we will need to be aggressive in transforming the company to thrive well into the future and to deliver returns for employees and mr zell to be clear if this deal is good for sam zell it will be even better for tribunes employees dennis fitzsimons chairman president and ceo tribune co chicago
