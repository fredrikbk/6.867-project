weekend journal sports by the numbers marathon men whats the greatest modern sports dynasty while the new york yankees new england patriots and chicago bulls would all certainly merit consideration the top contender is a bit off the beaten path entering mondays boston marathon kenya has supplied the winner of the mens race of the past years a kenyan woman has won in six of the past seven years as well that includes robert cheruiyots course record win in two hours seven minutes seconds the success of kenyan runners isnt limited to their patriots day outings in boston theyve also done extremely well in the four other races that make up the new world marathon majors series kenyan men have won five of the past six races in chicago six of the past nine in new york eight of the past in berlin and the past three in london in the wmm standings which encompass and races kenyan runners led by mr cheruiyot and felix limo hold six of the top nine spots why are these kenyan runners so fast experts have credited everything from high altitude training to the nations running culture its easier to figure out why they win so often thats a matter of strength in numbers and how that strength translates into preparation for todays ever more competitive marathons those boston wins were the efforts of nine different runners in there were marathon times of or under of those or were run by kenyans and those times were posted by different men to put that in perspective look at how many sub times u s runners posted in three ethiopias haile gebrselassie had last years best time but there were only nine sub times by ethiopians including three by mr gebrselassie remember kenya is a nation of about million people roughly the population of california and less than half that of ethiopia that depth is the secret to kenyan marathon victories obviously the more elite runners a country has in a race the more likely it is that someone from that country will win but more importantly kenyas large number of elite marathoners gives each of them a leg up in training for races that have become increasingly competitive over the last several years of the boston marathons decided by seconds or less eight of them were won by a kenyan runner including elijah lagats photo finish win in and in races decided in the final meters the winner isnt always the fastest runner but the smart competitor who has managed to size up his rivals and make the right strategic moves through the race so while top runners from other countries often train by racing against the clock kenyas marathoners can practice against the same kind of competition theyll find in the race itself thats the way that dynasties are forged
