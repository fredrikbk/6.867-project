how to turn trash into treasure smaller firms hone ways to revive orphan brands cast off by large companies when martin franklin chief executive of jarden corp acquired coleman camping goods two years ago he knew he was taking on a tired business coleman though still selling its familiar coolers and lanterns at discounters such as wal mart stores inc and target corp had few new products in development after its previous owner had filed for bankruptcy protection whats more it was caught in a waning interest in outdoor recreation as young people increasingly turned to digital adventures rather than the wild coleman was also trapped in a classic squeeze play as a mass market brand it had to fend off competition from low price store brand products on the high end nimble competitors were selling high tech alternatives and despite many outdoor enthusiasts harboring nostalgia for a brand theyd known since childhood they had doubts about colemans quality mr franklin saw opportunity nonetheless "we look for brands that are market leaders but havent been innovative " he says of his acquisition choices which include other niche products with famous names such as ball canning jars bicycle playing cards and crock pot cookers "we had to make coleman the innovator again " mr franklin is in the vanguard of executives who are refining ways to turn one companys trash into anothers treasure under pressure to deliver growth a number of consumer products titans including procter &amp gamble co unilever and colgate palmolive inc have been selling well known but underperforming brands to better focus on those with more potential smaller firms trying to play dr frankenstein have bought such familiar castoff brands as sure and right guard deodorants comet cleaner aqua net styling products pert plus shampoo and rit dye as the pace of deals has quickened it has become clearer just what works and what doesnt in nursing a so called orphan brand back to health acquire prominent brands dominate niches reinvigorate marketing and develop new products bearing the old trusted name picking the right brand in a clearly defined niche is critical "sometimes brands have been orphaned because theyre in too small a category for their big owners " says bill chappell a suntrust robinson humphrey analyst citing prestige brands holdings inc s dominance in wart removers where it owns two brands including compound w small niches can be carved out of bigger categories too mr chappell says noting prestige owned comet which is a leading brand among abrasive household cleaners that sell for about &# "its simply a matter of focus " says rick milenthal chairman of tenunited a columbus ohio based marketing agency that specializes in campaigns to revive old brands including chloraseptic sore throat treatment prell shampoo and comet in recent years and is now working on boosting pert plus and sure deodorant "if you can fund marketing and fund distribution youre going to have success " he says with chloraseptic mr milenthal says focusing on how consumers hate staying home when theyre ill helped to inspire new products developing new medications that can be taken on the go including dissolvable strips in compact boxes helped to distinguish chloraseptic from competitors he says pitfalls abound though as major retailers narrow their inventories to just a few leading brands and their own private labels smaller players often get nudged aside "companies run into the biggest problems when they acquire a no or brand in a very large market " says mr chappell even when operating in niche categories success can be elusive prestige which also owns prell cutex nail polish remover and spic and span cleaner this week gave notice that its fourth quarter results would be lower than the year before blaming declining revenue in its personal care business and a weaker than anticipated cold and cough season at a conference this week chairman and chief executive mark pettie kept an optimistic tone outlining a number of growth strategies under way those include plans to broaden retail distribution better focus research and development on fewer and bigger ideas as well as reduce the number of suppliers in order to gain purchasing efficiencies and scale providing better service to retailers can also win advantages for smaller brands says jahm najafi ceo of najafi cos a private investment firm whose portfolio company innovative brands llc last year bought sure and pert plus from p&amp g "there is opportunity to focus on them in more of a small entrepreneurial company " he says of the brands early efforts to revive sure and pert plus have focused on giving retailers more choices including customized fragrances he anticipates his company will be acquiring more brands in the near future to resurrect the coleman brand mr franklin decided he needed to develop more points of distribution and a fresh ad campaign he hired a new division leader gary kiedaisch an avid outdoorsman who first focused on rallying employees many of whom had become disillusioned with the neglect it got from its string of former owners mr kiedaisch was also waging a bigger campaign trying to convince more consumers to enjoy nature "when they see colemans in store merchandising it should inspire them to go outdoors " he says to bring the brand back upscale and win over more serious campers coleman offered specialty retailers several new products unavailable in mass market chains "coleman three years ago wouldnt have gotten into our stores " says jim potts co founder of lewis &amp clark outdoors inc a chain of outdoors stores in arkansas "they werent well respected by outdoor enthusiasts and there were questions about the quality of the product " but after hearing about colemans new products targeting more serious campers and hikers mr potts reconsidered last month his stores launched a large display of coleman products that cant be found at the wal mart stores nearby including high quality folding chairs and compact gas stoves now that hes in the peak selling presummer season he says sales of coleman products have been strong coleman sales last year grew to &# million and operating income rose nearly to &# million this week jarden acquired another outdoor goods company pure fishing inc a maker of fishing tackle lures rods and reels with brands including berkley abu garcia and trilene these brands will keep their names but will be placed under the coleman umbrella and be promoted along with those products german firm henkel kgaa is banking on similar success last year it snapped up deodorant brands right guard soft &amp dri and dry idea from p&amp g which had to divest itself of some of its deodorant brands when it acquired gillette plagued by mediocre sales in the slow growing deodorant category right guard didnt measure up to the growth potential of p&amp gs other deodorants which include old spice one of the market leaders nevertheless henkel marketers smelled opportunity "it wasnt a hard thing to learn that this brand had strong equity " says ruediger vetter a vice president of marketing "right guard has been known as an underarm protector par excellence for a long time " instead of trying to immediately relaunch the right guard deodorant last month the company introduced a brand extension its first body spray dubbed rgx with the tagline "powered by right guard " henkel executives hope the new product line will reinvigorate the overall right guard brand and carve out a new niche in the highly competitive but lucrative body spray category henkel executives say they are focusing on differentiating rgx from more established competitors as unilevers axe and p&amp gs tag are locked in a battle over adolescent boys henkels rgx targets slightly older men "some men are too mature for the axe tag concept do they want to have an overpowering fragrance their girlfriend can smell from far away no " says mr vetter
