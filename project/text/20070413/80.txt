the incumbent party well its over congress is in recess budget season has come and mostly gone and one party emerged a clear winner the incumbent party the economic platform of this strong political caucus is designed to prevent any bad news from reaching voters despite their public disputes both the democratic and republican wings of the incumbent party adhere to the same fundamental principles pretend to budget for the next five years while offering instead a one year political fix whether the issue is funding the war on terrorism or preventing the alternative minimum tax from punishing the middle class neither wing of the incumbent party offers any lasting solutions only budgetary gimmicks nod gravely when americas long term fiscal problems are mentioned but argue that todays budgets have almost nothing to do with the unsustainability of medicare medicaid and social security after all most of todays elected officials will be safely retired and some buried before these entitlement programs collapse when pressed bemoan the fact that every americans share of the national debt is &# and growing forget that a more accurate audited figure is &# each or &# per household people dont owe uncle sam the equivalent of a car loan they owe a home mortgage and thats on top of their current taxes pledge to protect social security and medicare "trust funds" without hinting that those trust funds do not exist todays social security surpluses are invested in u s treasury bonds which enable government spending on everything except future social security benefits future beneficiaries have no real security other than the hope that future workers will pay more payroll taxes promise social security and medicare benefits that the social security actuary says are not even promises much less vested benefits they are only "scheduled benefits " which can be rescheduled or eliminated at any time by any congress rescheduling is even easier to do when congress refuses to record todays benefit levels on any federal balance sheet ignore the fact that the federal budget deficit would be at least twice as large if you were not using the social security "surplus" to hide its true size the use of this fig leaf is particularly ironic when if social security and medicare were properly accounted for the annual federal fiscal gap would be roughly &# trillion or times larger than any politician will admit this annual gap is larger than the entire federal budget of &# trillion shamelessly exempt the federal government from normal generally accepted accounting principles gaap making it the only large entity in america private or public able to flout the rules although the republicans contract with america in pledged that congress should abide by the laws it passes federal accounting hypocrisy is stronger than ever even state and local governments now have to properly report their retirement and health liabilities subsidize employer sponsored health insurance by offering the biggest federal income tax breaks to the people who need it least high wage employees of large companies oppose any redistribution of those tax breaks even when president bush called for such reforms in his state of the union address keep median cash incomes stagnant for decades while fringe benefits particularly for health insurance consume most employee productivity and profitability increases deny that any tax vacuum exists that sucks up every workers pay raise and transfers it to the health sector of the economy never even whisper that standard &amp poors has projected that by when the budgets of both wings of the incumbent party claim to be producing surpluses the u s treasury bond will lose its aaa rating even worse s&amp p is also projecting that treasuries will become junk debt by is america living up to its potential or falling below investment grade democrats have a rare opportunity to buck the bad habits of incumbency with our new majorities in congress if we choose to enact the stale economic platform of our predecessors we do so at our own peril and our childrens if on the other hand we begin to speak honestly about the large problems facing the u s economy perhaps voters will keep us around long enough to fix them mr cooper is a democratic congressman from tennessee
