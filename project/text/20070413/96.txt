weekend journal review theater monkey business inherit the wind lyceum theatre  w th st &# &# closes july a moon for the misbegotten brooks atkinson theatre  w th st &# &# closes june new york most people know what they think they know about the scopes "monkey trial" from having seen "inherit the wind " the play by jerome lawrence and robert e lee that ran on broadway for two years was made into a movie in and has since been performed by every professional semi professional and unprofessional theater company in the english speaking world but "inherit the wind " which has just been revived on broadway in a big budget production starring christopher plummer and brian dennehy isnt what it appears to be far from being a fact based docudrama about what happened when the state of tennessee outlawed the teaching of evolution in its public schools its a fictionalized account of the trial that plays fast and loose with the facts in the case of tennessee v scopes you dont have to be a holy roller to be exasperated by its cartoonish absurdity or disgusted by its repulsive smugness if youre unfamiliar with the scopes trial heres what really happened john scopes was tried in for breaking tennessees newly passed anti evolution law by teaching charles darwins theory of evolution to the students of a small town high school the trial was a put up job the american civil liberties union had offered to defend any teacher willing to break the law and the city fathers of dayton seeing an opportunity to win publicity for their impoverished community took the aclu up on its offer when william jennings bryan a devout christian who was also one of americas most famous progressive politicians offered his services to the prosecution the aclu persuaded clarence darrow a militant atheist who was also one of americas most famous criminal lawyers to join scopess defense team the clash of these two celebrities put dayton on the front pages of every newspaper in the country and many of the stories were written by h l mencken a longtime bryan hater who covered the trial for the baltimore sun while secretly acting as an unpaid consultant to the aclu acting at menckens behest darrow put bryan on the stand and sneeringly quizzed him about his fundamentalist beliefs but the jury convicted scopes anyway after which the judge fined him &# and turned him loose many of the facts included in the preceding two paragraphs are nowhere to be found in "inherit the wind " in which bryan is turned into an oafish opportunist scopes into a secular saint the citizens of dayton into a slack jawed gaggle of mouth breathing morons and darrow into a homespun cracker barrel agnostic with a heart of gold and a weakness for noble curtain speeches "you dont suppose this kind of thing is ever finished do you tomorrow sure as hell somebody elsell have to stand up and youve helped give him the guts to do it " to paraphrase oscar wilde one must have a heart of stone to listen to such tripe without snickering i dont and i didnt its impossible to stage "inherit the wind" in anything like a dramatically serious way and doug hughes the director hasnt even tried nothing that happens in this production bears any obvious relationship to recognizable human behavior each performance is a caricature starting with that of mr plummer who plays henry drummond the character based on darrow everyone in "inherit the wind" is given a transparent pseudonym he oozes the kind of charm that makes you want to go straight home and scrub yourself with a pumice stone as for denis ohare cast as a smart alecky reporter bearing the suspiciously familiar sounding name of e k hornbeck ill say only that in the course of researching my biography of h l mencken it somehow escaped my notice that he bore any resemblance whatsoever to pee wee herman i cant help but wonder what contemporary audiences will make of this old fashioned slice of cultural agitprop many new yorkers are notoriously inclined to assume that anyone living elsewhere is a bit on the primitive side so some of them will doubtless imagine "inherit the wind" to be a courageous portrayal of life south of manhattan where all the men chew tobacco and all the women sleep with their cousins that appears to be what mr hughes thinks he needs to get out more how bad can a good play be pretty awful actually eugene oneills "a moon for the misbegotten" opens with an hour and a half of exposition so superfluous that you itch to trim it with a meat ax all delivered in the kind of stage irish accents that should have gone out with john ford but just when youre thinking your watch has stopped the play gets started and soon you forget about everything but the tragedy of jim tyrone and josie hogan kevin spacey and eve best two sinfully proud irreparably damaged people who cant bring themselves to let down their guard and love one another no its not as good as "long days journey into night " "ah wilderness " or "the iceman cometh " but "a moon for the misbegotten" definitely works even in so ill conceived a staging as the old vic production that just arrived from london for a two month run on broadway the main thing wrong with this revival is mr spacey an interesting actor who is famously good at playing self hating characters but has a habit of infusing his performances with campy touches that dont always make sense jim tyrone definitely hates himself hes well on the way to drinking himself to death but theres nothing remotely campy about him and i cant see what makes mr spacey think there is once he finally stops acting in "drunk on a hot tin roof" and engages with the play oneill wrote though mr spacey shifts into high gear and gives a performance that is both exciting and mostly convincing howard davies the director must have ordered his cast to play the first act for excruciatingly obvious laughs while bob crowleys set which is dominated by a surrealistic looking farmhouse apparently located somewhere in the dust bowl looks as though it had been intended for a german production of "the grapes of wrath" rather than a play set in rural connecticut circa ignore all that and concentrate on ms best shes miscast josie is supposed to be big and ugly but so magnetic that it doesnt matter its worth sitting through the first half of "a moon for the misbegotten" just to watch her hold mr spaceys head to her breast at evenings end and try to lull him to sleep this is ms bests broadway debut and its a major one the finest of the current season may we see much more of her mr
