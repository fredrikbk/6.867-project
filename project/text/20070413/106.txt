relations but can it also be good television two recent british reality shows are taking big money charity to the small screen by featuring rich patrons who give their money to various causes the shows which could make their way to the u s have given rise to a new genre of what might be called philanthrotainment turning charitable giving into a spectator sport on itvs "fortune million pound giveaway " needy and sometimes not so needy supplicants have seconds to persuade a panel of five wealthy panelists to give them money the other show "the secret millionaire" on channel features self made millionaires who go undercover and spend days in a poor neighborhood looking for people who could use their charity at the end of the show the millionaire reveals him or herself and writes checks to the winners both programs have garnered decent ratings "fortune" drew about four million viewers during its seven week run starting in january even though it was up against "holby city " britains hit hospital drama series "secret millionaire" drew an audience of millions and is in production for a second series that will probably run later this year says a spokeswoman the united kingdom was
