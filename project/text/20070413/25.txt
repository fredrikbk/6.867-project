experiments suggest birds may be capable of planning ahead birds arent so bird brained after all in one recent experiment scrub jays appeared to be able to plan ahead in ways indicating forethought in another ravens seemed capable of using logic these findings add fuel to the debate in the field of animal cognition the study of whether and how creatures think over exactly what goes on in animals brains some scientists claim the experiments show how some animals can have the higher mental abilities such as logic and the ability to plan for the future associated with humans but others maintain these studies merely demonstrate natural evolved behavior the wide array of scientists in this field biologists psychologists anthropologists zoologists and philosophers are attempting to extrapolate from observations based on some agreed upon criteria which of these is true there has been a big change in this field in recent years "people are asking questions that are based on the natural behavior and natural history of the species at hand not having them run mazes or learn different tasks that have little to do with real behavior " says marc bekoff professor emeritus university of colorado boulder interestingly he says birds make tools "better than primates have been observed to do " he cited a study in which a crow formed a wire into a hook to grab food "the first time any animal has been found to make a new tool for a specific task " the authors wrote in the journal science an experiment based on the habit of scrub jays of caching or storing food provides evidence that they are able to plan for the future in ways not shown possible in nonhumans before and different from season induced animal behavior according to a study led by nicky clayton of the university of cambridge u k published in the journal nature birds migrating south bears hibernating and squirrels storing food for the winter could be seen as preparing for the future but those suggest instinct or programming in the species as it evolved so they generally arent considered actual "planning " and some animals take action for a future reward such as pushing a lever to receive a treat but it can be argued that the action is a response to hunger more than planning what is unusual in the scrub jay study is that the birds actions werent triggered by an immediate need such as to alleviate hunger the cambridge study consisted of two experiments in the first the jays learned where food was available they were placed into one of two compartments of their cage each morning in one they would be fed breakfast in the other they went without food subsequently once the birds were allowed to store food at night they stashed away significantly more in the area where they had learned there would be no morning treat in the second experiment the jays were repeatedly shown that they would get dog kibble in one spot in the morning and peanuts in another spot when the jays were given the chance to store food the night before they stored much more of the food they knew wasnt available than the food that was in the april edition of scientific american researchers bernd heinrich and thomas bugnyar detail studies of ravens that appear to be using logic to get food in one example ravens were put on a perch with a food treat suspended on a string tied to the perch to get the treat the ravens had to pull up the string then step on it then pull up more and step on it several times to bring the treat within reach some birds examined the situation then performed the whole procedure on their very first try the authors say "the simplest suggestion is that they imagined possibilities and figured out what steps to take " critics of such research say there is too much emphasis in the field of animal cognition on viewing the actions of animals from a human perspective "its very very very clear that the way into the journal nature is to say that this is the first demonstration of x in nonhumans " says clive wynne associate professor of psychology at the university of florida gainesville he says the research should simply present observed phenomena and calls it "distracting" to be talking about things like logic or planning "id rather ask questions like what kind of conditions cause scrub jays to store food and where do they store food " he says as with many good experiments there are more questions than answers could the birds do more complex planning assuming what they are already doing is planning is there a way to do brain imaging to find brain signals in animals that correspond to those in humans thus linking the types of thoughts of each species perhaps most important can these experiments teach us about ourselves dr clayton suggests this type of work could be useful in studying human childhood development researchers trying to work around communications limitations in babies even adults may be able to use birds to design experiments see related letter
