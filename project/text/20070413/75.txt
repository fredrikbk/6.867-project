the daily fix eastern conference teams clash in a trio of game s online edition last night was a night for first blood in the nhls eastern conference playoffs in new jersey the devils fought off a tampa bay lightning comeback for a win in the tampa tribune joe henderson laments a game that got away and a rough playoff baptism for the bolts young goalie "if you were looking for something from johan holmqvist to ease your mind about how these playoffs will go uh that wasnt it " he writes "not when new jerseys first goal from feet away went trickling off his pads and dribbled into the net and certainly not when the devils second goal scraped holmqvists glove and when the score was tied in the third period and he needed to make a heroic save against zach parise that didnt happen either the bolts lost a winnable game the kind of game you cant let slip away in a playoff i mean teams dont often score three times against martin brodeur " in atlanta the new york rangers beat the thrashers marking the rangers first postseason win since and the thrashers first ever playoff game "it took the franchise regular season games to get here " jeff schultz writes in the atlanta journal constitution "maybe you cant expect everybody to get it right the first night not the defense which fumbled too many pucks early not the offensive stars who went pointless certainly not the goalie kari lehtonen made saves thursday night statistically that would seem like a good first playoff game but he gave up one goal that was at least as ugly as his recently dyed and bleached then buzzed hair one bad goal in shots hardly makes for a bad night but it was one bad goal more than the new rangers henrik lundqvist allowed and that was the difference" with the buffalo sabres having rolled over the new york islanders the buffalo newss bucky gleason focuses on defenseman brian campbell whose accidental flipping of a puck into the stands in game of last years eastern conference finals set up a win for the carolina hurricanes "just like that the stanley cup was gone " mr gleason recalls "uggh campbell never saw the replay quickly deleted it from his memory bank such blunders can eat away at a player but it did nothing to shake his confidence he knew more opportunities would come in the playoffs this season and he certainly didnt need to wait very long " one western conference game was on thursdays slate in detroit the red wings rolled over the calgary flames the fourth eastern conference matchup began wednesday with the ottawa senators beating the pittsburgh penguins the red wings set the tone early when detroit defenseman mathieu schneider landed a big hit on calgarys matthew lombardi followed by goals from valtteri fippula and nicklas lidstrom in the detroit free press michael rosenberg writes about another goal one he calls "the most important red wings goal of the night before thursday night pavel datsyuk had gone games without a playoff goal and we media folks could not go seconds without asking about it there were all sorts of explanations for datsyuks streak some of the games were when he was very young others were last year when he had a charley horse even though he didnt score he created plenty of opportunities opposing goalies were great datsyuks zodiac sign is cancer and cancers have notoriously streaky wrist shots etc the problem with all the explanations is that there were too many they just reinforced the fact that games is a long time too long for a player of datsyuks talent " its not really a surprise that nothing in last nights nhl playoffs could compete with wednesday nights four overtime thriller a vancouver canucks win over the dallas stars games like that are just what hockey needs if its once again to be considered among the major sports but not everybody got to see the end of that game versus is investigating reports that fans in some markets got switched to an infomercial during the last overtime ouch in this corner lisa kuronya a pound welterweight whose titles include the usa boxing womens national championship and the national golden gloves championship and in this corner us amateur boxing ms kuronya is

at their own expense in the boston globe stan grossfeld examines a suit that seems to be every bit as much about olympic politics as it is about gender the philadelphia phillies return home tonight after a six game trip that saw them drop two out of three to the florida marlins then two out of three to the new york mets the phils famously appointed the team to beat in the national league east by shortstop jimmy rollins who shook off a humiliating undressing in the first game of the mets series to play very well in the next two are their worst start in years and now theyre home to face their famously lacerating fans "there is little to say seeing as how the aroma is currently traveling faster than the speed of sound " rich hofmann writes in the philadelphia daily news "the phils are just playing lousy they are squandering what has been excellent starting pitching they should have about six wins by now based on how good the starters have been including jamie moyer who gave up three earned runs in six busy innings last night but they have two wins only two it will be interesting to see the reception they receive tonight in the little ballpark at lake hopebegone where the feelings are strong the history isnt good looking and the frustrations are above average " durham county district attorney mike nifong has apologized to three former duke lacrosse players well sort of mr nifongs apology was every bit as weaselly and grudging as the subjunctive mea sorta culpas offered by athletes after being locked in with front office guys for the better part of a day to the extent that i made judgments that ultimately proved to be incorrect i apologize to the three students that were wrongly accused it is my sincere desire that the actions of attorney general roy cooper will serve to remedy any remaining injury that has resulted from these cases the fix smells a lawyer in that which is understandable given that mr nifong faces ethics violations but doesnt make his semi apology any less smarmy and useless for an apology done better heres espn coms jemele hill "if there is anything to be learned from don imus fall its that real apologies are never accompanied by rationalizations " she writes "so to reade seligmann collin finnerty and david evans the three duke lacrosse players whose lives were mangled by an unsupported rape accusation i say two of the hardest words in the english language im sorry its not enough and i wont pretend that it is for the last year your lives and those of your families have been more difficult than any of us can possibly imagine ill never know what it was like walking around normal society labeled a rapist ill never know what its like to lose everything your school your program and your life because of one unproven accusation you deserve all of that back and then some but unfortunately you wont get it you have every right to not trust anyone and think less of people duke university abandoned you an overzealous prosecutor tormented you a community a nation didnt believe you journalists everywhere sensing ratings and salivating over the salaciousness of black strippers and white athletes chose to keep you under attack " mr imus was fired by cbs yesterday for insulting rutgers womens basketball team as "nappy headed hos " the fix was happy to hear a note of grace from deirdre imus who took over on air duties for her husbands radio fundraiser ms imus noted this morning that the rutgers players have been receiving hate email and demanded it stop "if you want to send hate mail send it to my husband " found a good
