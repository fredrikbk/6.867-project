politics &amp economics chirac leaves lackluster legacy candidates keep distance from failed pieces of presidents big dreams paris in september french president jacques chirac made a hour layover in new york to proffer an ambitious idea to the united nations an international tax to help raise &# billion a year to fight global poverty as u s delegates expressed skepticism the french president said "strong as the u s may be they cant eternally oppose and derail a proposal that has been endorsed by governments " nearly three years later only a few countries have implemented mr chiracs idea of a tax on airline tickets they include chile which contributed &# million in and gabon whose flagship carrier is now defunct "this is mr chirac at his best " said charles amedee de courson a french centrist lawmaker who opposed the tax when it was adopted by the french parliament last year "great generous ideas and sloppy execution " during his years as french president mr chirac years old has been a prominent figure on the global stage and maintained a firm grip on political power within france yet as he prepares his exit he leaves a dubious legacy he has often been unable to follow through on issues he identified as priorities mr chiracs lackluster legacy on crucial social and economic issues is now shaping the campaign to succeed him socialist candidate segolene royal centrist francois bayrou and conservative rival nicolas sarkozy who served as finance and interior minister under mr chirac are all promising a break with the departing presidents policies "were about to turn a page of history " ms royal said on french television last month when mr chirac announced he wouldnt seek a third term his successor she said will have to meet "a desperate expectation" for change during a year political career mr chirac has deployed great energy in climbing the ladder a graduate of the ecole nationale dadministration frances elite school for civil servants mr chirac spent most of his life in grand state owned houses and apartments as he scaled the ranks minister prime minister leader of the conservative gaullist movement paris mayor prime minister again and in after two failed attempts president once in the job he didnt meet expectations he had set "mr chirac has been through cyclical ups and downs " said jean francois probst a chirac aide between and "only when he was at the bottom would he heave himself up " mr chirac has tried to take bold steps on the international stage he is widely credited for breaking frances silence over its role in the deportation of jews during world war ii for example and for paying tribute to victims of slave trade four years ago mr chirac warned the u s of what he considered to be the dangers of using force against iraq he faced a deluge of france bashing in the u s media and pressure from french businessmen who feared their exports to the u s would suffer mr chirac insisted he wasnt anti u s and stuck firmly to his position yet mr chirac failed to capitalize on popular support for his anti war stance and irked some neighbors in february when poland and other candidates for european union membership said they would support a u s invasion of iraq mr chirac said these countries have "lost a good opportunity to keep their mouth shut " he said mr chirac now says he regretted his approach "i should have watched my own words " he told a french reporter on the national level mr chirac is credited with halving the number of traffic fatalities in france in the past five years for boosting cancer research and establishing a celebrated museum of primitive arts in paris but his successor will inherit trillion euros &# trillion in public debt almost double what mr chirac faced when he took office in and an unemployment rate of france is isolated within europe after it rejected a proposed eu constitution in frances main trading partner germany is annoyed because of mr chiracs interventions in the management of european plane maker airbus which is jointly owned by french and german interests moreover the next president will have to deal with a challenge mr chirac predicted during the presidential campaign but didnt tackle a fracture sociale or social rift between the poor and rich between affluent city centers and impoverished suburban ghettos "france no longer works for all the french " mr chirac said in a speech during the campaign at the time he proposed re engineering frances labor laws and social welfare system mr chiracs concern about frances social divide was prescient as the massive street riots in frances mostly muslim suburbs in november would attest once he got into office the idea lost steam mr chirac devoted his first term to issues like nuclear testing and trimming the budget rather than raising spending on social welfare a spokesman for mr chirac said the president had to put france on a diet because he inherited a huge budget gap and wanted his country to lower its deficit to qualify for the planned single euro currency "if mr chirac had opted for a loose budget policy france wouldnt have qualified and the euro wouldnt have existed " the fracture sociale was still open when mr chirac was elected to a second term in yet again once in office the president set other goals fighting global poverty hunger and pandemics in the president set up a working group to study the feasibility of international taxes on global corporations or cross border financial transactions he went before the u n in september to announce his plan back in paris however the working group suggested he begin with a more modest european levy mr chirac embraced the idea despite early signs of support after mr chiracs u n speech frances traditional european allies notably germany and italy dropped out the french president received only timid support from united kingdom prime minister tony blair who had already given his backing to a competing british fund raising initiative mr chirac scaled back his ambitions opting instead for a more limited tax on airline tickets to help buy medications against malaria tuberculosis and the aids virus "i think he was genuinely convinced of the need to increase the support of the north for the south " said jacques cossart a member of the antiglobalization movement attac who was part of mr chiracs tax panel "but he was keen to leave his name in history even if it was with a much much smaller project than what he had initially hoped for " in a book published last month mr chirac said that although his tax remains experimental it is an essential tool to promote the idea of "controlling and humanizing globalization " despite the protests of air france which said its business would suffer from the tax france introduced the levy in july to pool the revenue france set up unitaid a geneva based fund which acts like a medicine purchasing agent for the world health organization though some countries are making periodic contributions to unitaid france is by far the main contributor the million euros the french state hopes to collect through its airline tax in will account for more than two thirds of unitaids budget this year during the last months of his tenure mr chirac has tried hard to convince china to adopt his airline tax but beijing has so far rejected the invitation mr chiracs tax failed to fly because he lacked the foot soldiers in the trenches after the grand speech " said mr probst the long time chirac aide with no legacy of a french political machine capable of tackling big problems mr chiracs successor may find it just as hard as he did to push through changes in france even without devoting time to fighting global poverty unfinished business french president jacques chirac will leave office after years without achieving some key goals target eradicate unemployment in in february target cut public debt in oe billion in oe trillion target raise french development aid in of gdp
