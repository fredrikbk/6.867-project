did revolving door lead to student loan mess critics blame lax oversight resulting from close ties of industry government four years ago sally stroup then an assistant secretary at the u s education department got a memo from the agencys inspector general urging her to curb any "illegal inducements" lenders might be using to win college loan business ms stroup who had previously worked for a pennsylvania loan company and a for profit education concern dependent on student loans didnt take the memos advice at least eight top officials in the education department during the bush administration either came from student loan or related organizations or have taken lucrative jobs in that arena since leaving the agency former education department staffers say a revolving door between the department and industry has led to lax oversight of federal financial aid members of congress including the democrats who head committees overseeing education sen edward kennedy of massachusetts and rep george miller of california say they are concerned about the industry ties mr miller plans to hold a hearing on student loan abuses this month some republicans are critical as well including rep tom petri of wisconsin "its hard for a program staffed mainly by folks in the industry to impartially conduct oversight of the industry " says thomas culligan mr petris aide for education policy in recent years department officials monitoring financial aid were informed about several questionable practices by lenders yet they were slow to crack down in addition to the current scandal over loan companies grants of stock and other payments to college officials lenders also breached a government database of student borrowers and made hundreds of millions of dollars in excess payments through a controversial loophole "i saw too much in the department that indicated that many of the people were too close to the lending industry and were making decisions that werent in the public interest " says jon oberg a former education department researcher ms stroup says that until now no one knew the extent of student loan abuses and she says she took action when allegations could be proved "we always wanted to run the agency right for students families and schools " says ms stroup now a senior republican aide on capitol hill katherine mclane a spokeswoman for education secretary margaret spellings defends the departments record saying that it taps private sector experience to improve efficiency and provide "better service to students and families " she notes that student loan default rates have plummeted on the republicans watch and that in the government accountability office removed the departments student aid office from a list of government programs at high risk for "fraud waste abuse and mismanagement " last week the education department put matteo fontana a senior financial aid official on leave after it was disclosed that in he held &# of stock in the parent company of student loan xpress inc that firm a unit of financial services company cit group inc has been at the center of a widening investigation by new york attorney general andrew cuomo before joining the education department mr fontana worked at the nations biggest student lender slm corp better known as sallie mae one of mr fontanas early responsibilities at the education department was safeguarding the national student loan data system which has detailed information about borrowers that isnt supposed to be used for commercial purposes in cathy lewis the departments assistant inspector general sent a memo to theresa s shaw chief operating officer of the departments student aid office about security problems with the database which was being tapped by lenders to get customers ms shaw who previously worked for sallie mae rising to chief information officer and mr fontana couldnt be reached to comment ms mclane says the department has "rigorous" database monitoring and has spent &# since to improve information security in another example of close industry ties william hansen a former deputy secretary worked for an industry trade group before taking the department post when he left in he joined affiliated computer services inc an information technology company that won a contract that year with a value of at least &# billion to administer student loans mr hansen says he recused himself at the education department when the project came up and didnt work on higher education matters while he was at acs mr cuomos investigation has already led eight colleges including the university of pennsylvania new york university and syracuse university to settle allegations concerning payments from lenders that the state considers kickbacks six financial aid officials including those at columbia university johns hopkins university and the university of texas are under scrutiny for accepting stock or other payments from student loan xpress sallie mae and citigroup inc s citibank have reached agreements with mr cuomo over allegedly deceptive practices in ms lewiss memo to ms stroup in about improper inducements she said the inspector generals office had found evidence that sallie mae had negotiated with a school to offer private loans to students there if that school placed sallie mae on its preferred lender list ms lewis was concerned that the agreement might have constituted an improper inducement by sallie mae for preferred status sallie mae notes that the government never took action against the company ms lewis also complained in her memo that the department had done nothing since to update its interpretation of agency rules for lenders despite a student loan marketplace that had changed "significantly " also in mr oberg wrote an internal widely distributed memo warning that lenders were exploiting a legal provision that guaranteed lenders a minimum rate of return no matter how low the prevailing rate might be the guarantee was supposed to apply only to loans funded by tax exempt bonds congress eliminated the guarantee in but grandfathered in the existing arrangement thinking the high rate guarantees would disappear mr oberg warned that the proliferation of these loans could cost taxpayers billions of dollars in excess subsidies a later report by the inspector general confirmed mr obergs findings it focused on student loan company nelnet inc which figured out a complicated strategy to collect about &# million in what the report said were excessive payments from the government from january through june the report recommended that the department require nelnet to "return the overpayments received and exclude ineligible loans from future billings " in securities filings addressing the issue nelnet said it had received verbal approval from the department to collect the higher rate despite the inspector generals report the education department announced this past january that it would let nelnet keep the bonanza though not future payments in a statement nelnet spokesman ben kiser said the companys receipt of those payments conformed to department regulations ms mclane says the settlement was in "the best interests of taxpayers and students" because seeking repayment could have jeopardized a source of aid in some markets jeffrey r andrade former deputy assistant secretary for postsecondary education until says he opposed the lucrative loans at a time when the department was examining the issue but that the department couldnt stop the practice because it was hamstrung by pre existing rules "i wanted to call" nelnet "and say if you guys do this were going to audit you to death and in hindsight that would have been the better strategy " says mr andrade he is now an executive vice president of u s education finance group a student loan company see related letter "letters to the editor university shenanigans" wsj april
