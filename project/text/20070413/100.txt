weekend journal taste charity by proxy when you think about all the exercise equipment diet aids and thin attractive people featured on television its amazing how many fat people there are walking around in real life whats wrong with those people television is supposed to be a pretty powerful medium actually its supposed to be the most powerful medium so youd think that they would get the message and stop it with the bread but they dont america keeps getting fatter while television keeps getting fitter call it the "thighmaster paradox" watching people do things on tv fight it out on a desert island say or sweat themselves into shapelier thighs often replaces the need to do those things ourselves after a few hours vegetating in slack jawed stupor in front of the food network do we really end up in the kitchen whipping up a wholesome meal or do we drag the family to outback steakhouse the thighmaster paradox as it will come to be known is never more apparent than when it comes to reality television right now one of the biggest reality shows is "dancing with the stars " but its popularity hasnt ushered in a ballroom dancing craze if the past few weddings ive attended are any indication and for all of the creepy aggressive ambition on display in an episode of "the apprentice " do people really watch that show and suddenly get all fired up to outperform their co workers or do they waste a lot of time the next day rehashing the previous nights episode and laughing around the water cooler as the phone rings and the work piles up and the invoices dont get mailed there is reason to believe the thighmaster paradox will apply just as much to a new round of shows in which were supposed to watch nice people doing nice things it started with abcs "extreme makeover home edition" in which a family often parentless struck hard by bad luck weather medical bills or something else suitably dickensian is suddenly beset by remodeling do gooders who swarm around their house fixing it up upgrading the appliances and showering the family with gifts and cash and the cameras attention basically its the last scene in "a christmas carol" but just the spray of food stuff and good cheer without all of the tiresome character development and fear of damnation in the "extreme makeover" universe ebenezer scrooge has been replaced by generous product placement sponsors such as home depot and sears and the rest of us are blubbery tiny tims its a hugely affecting show of course theres something riveting about watching people who deserve stuff get it in abundance and its hard not to watch a whole hour of "extreme makeover" without getting a slightly lumpy throat nascars syndicated reality offering "nascar angels " doesnt bring on tears but its done in a similar spirit racing legend rusty wallace travels the country looking for people who really really need to have their cars fixed sometimes its a family in trouble with a family car in trouble too but at other times its a person who needs a car to help others a teacher a nurse creating a kind of two fer situation its a charity reality show about helping a charitable person be more charitable though it lacks the sheer operatic scope of "extreme makeover " "nascar angels" connects to an american bedrock truth to do anything useful you absolutely need a car all these shows in fact reinforce another bedrock truth which were all supposed to deny but we all secretly acknowledge money and objects really can make you happier it follows then that the happiest woman in the world must be oprah winfrey who floats above the tv landscape like a benevolent sun shining her light on everyone below oprah who once gave every member of her studio audience a new car knows a thing or two about ostentatious generosity recently she presented her audience with &# gift cards and a mission to use the cards to help as many people as possible now she is developing two primetime reality series for abc the first one "oprah winfreys the big give " is a lightly competitive show in which contestants vie for the chance to do something really big for others sort of "survivor" meets "touched by an angel " in the second series tentatively titled "your money or your life " a family in trouble is swarmed with help therapy help decorator help skin care help money help you name it help in a crash course of positive do gooder meddling that will result it is hoped in a happier healthier family and a share its sort of "dr phil" meets "extreme makeover " with a little bit of the iraq surge mentality mixed in when oprah does something she does it big only a fool would bet against the success of these shows oprah did not get immensely rich by accident she knows what people like to watch more important she knows what people like to feel when they watch we want to feel good about ourselves and our neighbors we want to feel good about the power of a remodeled kitchen mostly though we want to watch actual real charity work as opposed to actual reality television charity work involves a certain amount of bleakness the risk of an unhappy ending an occasional lack of gratitude from the recipient uncomfortable encounters with poor hygiene and a lot of guilt in other words a lot of things that would make for a really terrible television show watching tv is so splendidly idle and so marvelously anesthetizing ask any advertiser that its the wrong place to issue a call to action but a great place to issue a call to dominos oprah has publicly declared that what she wants to do is inspire people to give more of their money and time but thats a tough thing to accomplish in order to pick up a hammer you first have to put down the universal remote mr long is a television producer and
