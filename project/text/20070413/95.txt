weekend journal review television entourage returns its a compliment to hbos "entourage" sundays p m et to say that in the fourth season new viewers will find it difficult to fully appreciate whats happening this is because some of the characters are as they say growing and the changing whether its normal human maturation or spurts of conscience may be imperceptible without a reference to seasons past on the surface "entourage" is still what it always was a behind the scenes in hollywood comedy built around four queens boys living the highlife in l a where one has become a major movie star and the others are satelliting around him sharing the wealth and all the other perks of fame the affection between the four is a crucial element because without it the sight of four guys buying expensive toys and the sound of their crude banter about women would have become repellent or at least boring by now but weve gotten to know each of them so well by this point that we cant help rooting for them whether theyre trying to find girls by taking a beloved rottweiler to a city park famous for its dog walking babes consoling each other over a movie project gone bad or in the depths of humiliation showing unexpected grace at the end of last season star vince adrian grenier fired his hyperkinetic foul mouthed agent ari jeremy piven and now has a new one amanda carla gugino shes found vince a serious script for a movie based on an edith wharton novel and vince eager to show what he can really do after the popcorn blockbuster "aquaman " is interested although as a jealous ari accurately quips there are no surprises in edith wharton plots where its always "guy cant make love to the girl for five years because those were the times " in a desperate bid to get his client back ari is tempting vince with the script of a colombian cartel movie that seemed out of reach last season but may be back in play for the rest of the season one suspects vince and his ex agent ari will be wrestling with the demons of their fractured relationship like any old broken up couple with new agent amanda is she a tough cookie or a possible casualty in the middle this week the focus is more on ari hes cracking up under the strain of his own awful personality yet in the process he does possibly the first true good deed of the entire series before reverting to ruthless type it would be cruel to fans of the show to say more suffice it to say that in this weeks episode all that was crass becomes beautiful and deeply moving for a brief moment a tiny payoff in the big scheme of things but more powerful because it is so rare and unexpected "entourage" has always been a funny show mostly about superficial things but through that mist something much finer may be emerging how best to describe "drive " foxs new series about dozens of people who are compelled to race across the country by sinister puppet masters the easy answer might be that "drive" which starts sunday p m et before settling into its regular monday p m time slot is a modern hybrid of "they shoot horses dont they " and "its a mad mad mad mad world " without the heft of the former or the zaniness of the latter as the series opens sunday we meet several desperate people including a man whose wife has just disappeared and presumably was kidnapped a new mother with an abusive husband and a guy just out of prison whose rich father wont take his calls those three and dozens of others it turns out all receive a cellphone and instructions to report to key west fla in a car they are not to notify the police a mystery caller tells them although as it turns out some may wish they had many viewers may also want to summon authorities of some sort this is because as the dozens of characters set out to race across the u s in pursuit of a promised &# million or for personal reasons that will be explained along the way they necessarily drive very fast a narrator irritatingly jokes about this at the beginning suggesting that we get out of the way in the future in case some speedster behind us is on a desperate cross country race teenage boys in the coveted youth demographic may love the recklessness of the stunts although it must be said that for all the pr hype about "drive" using fantastic new special effects technology some of the driving looks totally fake like animation on an arcade game even so after just one episode i was interested enough to make a mental note to watch the final one someday just to see who won and what the race was all about people with more time on their hands and a tolerance for utter implausibility may choose to make the whole journey mature and sensible folks of all ages will be fascinated by "a man among wolves " the national geographic channels film about shaun ellis who has answered the call of the wild in a literal way monday p m et in this film we see him living full time on all fours in a nature preserve south of london where he is raising three american timber wolves whose mother abandoned them at birth its a rare opportunity to see these elusive animals up close even rarer is the sight of their human pack leader mr ellis howling growling and gamboling beside them experts tell us that mr ellis whose own family has left him is learning a great deal about wolves even as he endeavors to teach the growing orphans how to survive in the wild some adult park visitors who see mr ellis crawling about with the wolves his teeth bared in a snarl are impressed by his dedication to his research however as we watch him snuffling inside the body of a dead deer to extract and eat its liver as a true alpha wolf must to maintain his leadership of the pack our thoughts cant help straying to the succinct observation of one young visitor to the park its very interesting the child says but i think "hes kind of a bit mad "
