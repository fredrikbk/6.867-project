weekend journal catalog critic a wrinkle in springtime its wrinkled its rumpled its back with the spring summer fashion season upon us menswear retailers are again stocking up on the white linen shirt cool relaxed and elegant since time immemorial still if youve had one hanging in the closet since time immemorial you might want to replace it to see how the latest offerings hold up we ordered five and recruited one tester alberto a literature professor who came of age in s spain at that time spanish designer adolfo dominguez was making linen garments chic with an iconic advertising slogan la arruga es bella essentially "wrinkles are beautiful" albertos been mad for linen ever since we also sought practical advice from andy gilchrist author of "the encyclopedia of mens clothes " despite those wrinkles the fabric is appropriate for the office he said though these days its more popular for social occasions two companies j crew and brooks brothers make a point that their shirts are of irish linen but mr gilchrist said theres little difference between linen from that country and anywhere else a j crew spokeswoman says ireland produces the best quality linen fabrics only the brooks brothers shirt seemed right for work its button down collar could accommodate a tie the paul fredrick menstyle shirt had a straight across hem that indicated it was meant to be worn untucked some of

overall from j crew had the slimmest fit best value from paul fredrick menstyle had a retro s collar he felt echoed though perhaps not deliberately some high end designers spring styles for the more

but alberto thought it looked surprisingly fashion forward when buttoned without a tie with some tailoring and a jacket "you could look like a jil sander model " he said made in china the bad its two large chest pockets were fashion backward hence the jacket the placket showed through the lightweight fabric the shopping this style comes in nine colors the site also sells button down and banded collar versions we ordered a large per the size chart a medium would have fit better linen solid sport shirt brooks brothers brooksbrothers com &# standard shipping is &# the good a good looking choice for a more classic dresser the slightly sheer fabric had a nice weave and the button down collar works open or with a tie made in hong kong of irish linen the bad the price was a bit steep we
