the evening wrap jitters about the joneses online edition consumers are once again finding higher gasoline prices every time they pull up to the pump darkening their moods but economists claim whats really keeping people up at night is wondering how the neighbors are doing the university of michigans measure of consumer sentiment fell sharply to a midmonth reading of which would make it the flimsiest showing since last summer the biggest parallel between whats going on now and what was going on then is the fact that the cost of fueling the car is once again getting uncomfortably high thanks to a big surge in energy prices stoked by middle east geopolitical jitters consumers now find themselves dishing out a lot more to drive to work school or the mall than they were a month ago economists point out that consumer moods often wriggle in tandem with fuel prices and they can be volatile while demand is largely inelastic that is because just about everyone has to drive people have to fill up whether or not they like the price of gas that means that what consumer mood rings really reveal about spending plans is questionable at best indeed at much the same time that consumers were telling the researchers how tremulous they were feeling over the outlook robust retail sales results for last month suggest they were also loading up on easter gifts and spring clothes all the turmoil in the subprime mortgage business also seems to be dragging on consumers though perhaps not necessarily in the way that might be expected it appears that consumers may be fretting that the neighbors will get sucked into a subprime vortex economists say stephen stanley the chief economist at rbs greenwich capital noted that though consumers broader attitudes have taken a turn for the bleak the proportion of households in the michigan poll girding for their own fortunes to deteriorate fell to the lowest point in months "people are generally enjoying strong finances " mr stanley wrote "but they hear all of the gloom and doom in the media and figure that everyone else must be having a tougher time than they are " drew matus senior financial markets economist at lehman brothers also thinks consumers have gotten themselves all lathered up worrying whether the joneses will make their mortgage payment this month "it may reflect the level of news coverage around housing weakness " he wrote other more direct signs of the subprime fallout are beginning to turn up in the earnings reports of major corporations general electric which posted a modest increase in earnings for the

golden west financial last year it reports on monday more on energys economic imprint the labor department said its producer price index which measures inflation at the wholesale level increased by in march soaring prices for food and fuel were wholly responsible for the jump indeed the so called core index of prices that strips out those two troublesomely volatile components was flat the subdued reading on core prices pleased the financial markets since it means that the federal reserve while keeping a careful watch over prices is nonetheless unlikely to tinker with interest rates in the near future "producer inflation is just high enough to keep the fed on edge " wrote economist steven wood of insight economics "its not high enough to encourage them to tighten but it is also not low enough or receding fast enough to encourage them to ease any time soon " others said the producer prices data arent a really reliable compass when tracking inflation trends most economists say consumer prices data are more valuable as an inflation indicator the march consumer price index is due tuesday and forecasters expect an increase of on average energy price swings were also on view in
