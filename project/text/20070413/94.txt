weekend journal review film halles bad pick stranger is stale smirking thriller precocious teen propels hitchcockian disturbia tv set skewers tube life is full of choices and halle berry has made another bad one with "perfect stranger " a perfectly off putting thriller directed by james foley that co stars bruce willis mr willis doesnt have to worry so much about choices since hes able to swing between remunerative stinkers like this one and small but interesting roles that balance the schlock ms berry on the other hand has undermined her once promising career with a consistency thats come to resemble perverse purpose her latest role is rowena an unprincipled investigative journalist for a disreputable rag called the new york courier the plot plucked from hollywoods recycle bin by todd komarnicki and jon bokenkamp is prodded into sluggish action when one of rowenas childhood friends turns up dead not just no longer among the living but murdered in a way that provides a grisly sequence in the morgue we get the dubious privilege of meeting the victim grace shortly before she meets her fate and she is one deeply dislikable dame to the degree that our involvement in the film depends on our distress at her demise all is lost in the first few minutes its lost again in the last few minutes of a surprise ending yet grace is no more dislikable than anyone else on screen mr williss advertising mogul harrison hill is smirkily insufferable and not only because theres reason to think he had grace killed rowenas research assistant miles giovanni ribisi has all the earmarks of a psycho killer his manifest character flaws are punched up further by creepy lighting what a team ro and miles turn out to be to get the goods on hill she acquires a new name a new identity and above all new clothes then gets herself hired as a temp at his ad agency ro also types seductive nothings to her boss during interminable chats on the internet which the screenwriters seem to have taken for a brand new invention meanwhile back at the newspapers city room miles works away as a happy hacker breaking into every computer system he can find to mine telltale data maybe this is how people think reporters operate these days still it isnt clear that ro knows how unprincipled she is or that the courier knows how disreputable it is for the movie itself has a smarmy tabloid soul disturbia the most disturbious part of "disturbia" is how engaging this teenage thriller manages to be even though its a shameless rip off of "rear window " instead of jimmy stewart in a wheelchair we have shia labeouf as kale a troubled suburban teen under house arrest the suspense plot resembles hitchcocks classic kales idle voyeurism suddenly leads him to believe a next door neighbor may be a serial killer the specific differences though are both silly and felicitous the silly part which will sell the picture involves kales emergence as the inspector gadget of junior detectives the kid presses into surveillance service every gizmo known to kiddom computer digital camera camcorder cellphone ipod the felicitous part involves the young star himself shia labeoufs widely touted appeal justifies the touts and his co star sarah roemer who plays ashley the girl next door no gadgetry is needed when theyre together at quiet moments coming of age with timeless tenderness the tv set most horror films these days are haplessly synthetic but "the tv set" is the real deal smart funny and authentically terrifying its a comedy that explains how network television succeeds in being so horribly awful the writer director jake kasdan has directed a number of tv shows including the pilot for and several episodes of the well received but prematurely dispatched "freaks and geeks " for this smallish scale feature film the running time is minutes he has chosen to tell his hilariously baleful tale in a microcosm one thats inhabited mostly by pod people with microspirits "the tv set" tracks the evolution of a single pilot "the wexler chronicles " during pilot season at the fictional panda network did someone say "pander" the network is run by lenny sigourney weaver triumphant a woman who suffers from acid reflux while those around her suffer from flux nothing that she touches ever stays the same because she has no emotional artistic intellectual or moral moorings lenny is connected to the real world only by ratings which is why a near death experience on a plane has strengthened her religious belief that "theres no reason we cant win thursday night " david duchovny plays mike klein the borderline mournful creator of the pilot mike hopes to put his personal stamp on the series a dramedy inspired by his brothers suicide but suicide is a downer the concept tests badly and personal stamps are what tv writers use to mail personal letters by the time "the wexler chronicles" gets picked up for a first season it has been transformed for the worse in almost every imaginable way and not only at lennys devious insistence the show has suffered the thousand cuts of the network process a crazy actor a craven director a hostile cinematographer a bifocal focus group asked to choose between two radically different tellings of mikes tale his version and the networks version "the tv set" isnt in the same league with "network" or "the player " but its very good and its cast is accomplished i particularly liked judy greer as alice mikes manager a bright young woman who bends the truth with blithe abandon alice comes up blank when mike makes a reference to "taxi driver " then admits that shes never seen it and promises with pretend contrition to check it out you know she never will dvd tip shia labeouf shines in another coming of age story dito montiels autobiographical debut feature "a guide to recognizing your saints" he plays the young dito a kid yearning to flee the mean streets of his astoria queens neighborhood in the s the cast includes chazz
