supply side those april blues americans are natural procrastinators when it comes to unpleasant tasks so it should be no surprise that surveys show half of all tax filers wait until this last week before the april deadline to do their taxes no wonder this year there are a record pages of mostly incomprehensible tax laws to comply with and for those with really complicated returns separate forms that may need to be filled out in an astonishing six out of every taxpayers needed the help of a trained professional to complete their returns tax preparation is now one of americas fastest growth industries a cato institute study finds that million workers are employed as tax accountants lawyers and h&amp r block employees even so to make sense of their taxes american workers and businesses devote billion hours a year about hours per return there are now separate tax breaks for college education and several dozen for energy conservation including write offs for such things as purchasing electricity saving refrigerators about two thirds of americans say they cant figure out basic irs regulations or the tax laws on the sale of a home yet congress says that it has passed laws to "simplify the tax code" over the past years the income tax has not always been such a burden or labyrinth when the th amendment was under debate nearly a century ago the proponents including republican presidents theodore roosevelt and william h taft assured americans that the tax on income would be small and nonintrusive the amendment was ratified in rep cordell hull who drafted the first income tax promised that it would apply only to "the carnegies the vanderbilts the morgans and the rockefellers with their aggregated billions of hoarded wealth " in the beginning the return was indeed simple resembling the postcard flat tax that steve forbes and dick armey have advocated in recent years the original form in was so compact the new york times printed it on the front page there were a grand total of four instruction forms now there are tax rates were modest too ranging from to with most income under the equivalent of a half million dollars today exempt the opponents of the income tax urged that at least there should be a provision to the th amendment capping the tax rate at no more than advocates claimed this was unnecessary because the tax rate would never exceed by when the government wanted money to fight world war i the rate was nevertheless in its early days the income tax really was only the "rich mans burden" of americans or about people had to fill out a tax form today million americans or nearly every worker must do so the same bait and switch tactic suckered the country into swallowing the alternative minimum tax in originally the amt was passed to force wealthy individuals who had escaped the income tax to pay their "fair share " this year six million filers are subject to the amt if congress does not intervene next year it will be million in the total income tax collections were &# billion in todays dollars now the income tax gathers in roughly &# trillion and gathering that stash requires a massive collection machine the original irs enforcement office had employees now the irs has tax agents more employees than the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration and the food and drug administration combined yet congressional democrats want to hire thousands more tax agents to audit more americans and close the &# billion "tax gap " before hiring more tax snoops we might want to heed the warning of historian charles adams who notes in his book "for good and evil the impact of taxes on the course of civilization" "from the earliest records of civilization tax laws have taken away liberty more often than foreign invaders " the complexity of the tax code the cost it imposes on the economy simply to comply with it and the civilian army of agents needed to enforce it continues to grow like cancer cells attacking the healthy ones at the same time common sense reforms like the flat tax or the national sales tax remain politically stalled perhaps because there are so many vested interests in keeping it complicated even conservative republican presidential candidate mitt romney of massachusetts recently came out against a flat tax arguing that it might be unfair to whom tax accountants and lawyers meanwhile just last week the czech republic announced plans to become the next former communist nation of eastern europe to adopt a flat tax everywhere this idea is catching hold except in washington looking back years theres a case to be made that the th amendment was an even greater failure than that other progressive era experiment prohibition we should have listened to the advice rendered by the new york times which while editorializing against the income tax in warned "when men get in the habit of helping themselves to the property of others they cannot be easily cured of it " mr moore is senior economics writer for the the wall street journals editorial page see related letters "letters to the editor congress should kill the monster it created in "
