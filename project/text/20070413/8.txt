arctic eagles bid mud hens farewell at alaska airlines these pilots will miss their banged up boeings landing on the th try anchorage alaska they called themselves the arctic eagles for years they flew alaska airlines passengers on the lonely routes from here to remote outposts across the nations largest state with limited instruments and little air traffic control they faced blizzards bear heads gravel runways and volcanic eruptions but after years the eagles are being disbanded alaska air two weeks ago retired the last of its dedicated fleet of banged up old boeing s affectionately known as "mud hens " as the airline expands its routes it is sending the roughly pilots onto newer aircraft that theyll have to fly to california mexico and the east coast as well as the alaskan destinations alaska is no longer their exclusive fief either some of the airlines other pilots will be able to fly the arctic routes as long as theyre "checked out" on some of the most demanding airports jet crews usually cheer the arrival of new equipment but the arctic eagles lament the idea of manning aircraft that can land on automatic pilot and many are not crazy about the prospect of flying to cities in the lower where air traffic controllers dictate their every move they wax nostalgic about the stubby noisy planes and the challenge and wonder of flying them up here in the frozen north "we were just a different breed of cat in anchorage " says capt kevin earp a year veteran once capt steve rhodes years old was heading south from deadhorse above the arctic circle when he inadvertently flew into ash spewing from a volcano down below "the cockpit smelled like rotten eggs and it got dark " he recalls volcanic dust can shut down jet engines so he changed course and avoided trouble in nome and kotzebue both located on alaskas northwestern coast high winds and snow squalls roll in from the bering sea conditions that are difficult even for the most experienced pilots "when you get into nome on the third shot after going to kotzebue to gas up and try again people say thank you " says capt terry smith a year veteran of alaska air and chief pilot of the anchorage base years ago capt malcolm af uhr co piloted a flight headed for juneau in a snow storm he and his pilot he recalls aborted four attempts to land because they couldnt see the runway at the critical moment after refueling back in sitka miles away they returned to juneau and tried to land five more times without success as local fliers dozed or read the paper a passenger from california stood and demanded "whats wrong with you people " the plane finally landed on the th try way out in the aleutian island chain sits dutch harbor a former u s navy base with one of the trickiest airstrips anywhere the short runway is surrounded on three sides by water and on the fourth by a mountain a plane overshooting it could plummet straight into the drink an outcome the pilots call the " fathom overrun " over a decade alaska air says it operated more than mud hen flights to dutch harbor and never had any reportable incidents yet because of the difficulty landing there service was unpredictable so the airline stopped serving dutch harbor in alaska air still flies to other aleutian locations just the other day anita davis a flight attendant for alaska air for years and married to a pilot found herself and the crew grounded by nasty winds at red dog an isolated zinc mine northwest of kotzebue the crew and passengers stayed at the mine dorm sleeping while miners worked and clearing out when they returned it wasnt at all awkward ms davis says because "these people are some of my best friends " alaska air was founded in anchorage in and now based in seattle is the nations ninth largest airline by traffic but it still devotes more than of its seats to its namesake state and its jets are emblazoned with the carriers navy and teal logo of a smiling eskimo connecting towns that are inaccessible by road the flights ferry groceries plasma tvs high school teams musher dogs walrus meat and whale blubber as well as prisoners itinerant priests dentists and oil workers once alaska air hauled a plane full of frozen chicken mcnuggets to anchorage after local mcdonalds stores ran out jeff munro manager of cargo operations in anchorage says communities awaiting goods know what they want most "two things they ask us to prioritize beer and toilet paper " he jokes "the groceries can wait " several years ago capt rhodes was flying a woman with a high risk pregnancy from nome when a flight attendant announced the babys arrival "just this side of galena " capt rhodes recalls galena has a runway but no hospital so he flew on to anchorage where an ambulance waited first though cargo containers carried in the mud hens passenger cabins had to be unloaded so the mother and baby both fine could be lifted out through the freight door pilots liked to tease out of state tourists by announcing the imminent crossing of the arctic circle just as the plane passed over the line pilots goosed the controls to make the plane wobble producing the "arctic bump " the airline banned the practice after a passenger complained but many pilots smile coyly when asked if they still do the bump recently a passenger boarded in dillingham toting the head of a freshly killed black bear in a plastic grocery bag flight attendant mary jane bridwell hid the memento "about the size of a large st bernard head" in a galley cupboard when another attendant asked about an odor ms bridwell showed her the source "she got very pale " says ms bridwell a year alaska air veteran the mud hens were designed to land on short runways and on gravel and ice they guzzle gas and trail black smoke from their engines their cockpits lack the digital controls advanced navigation aids and computerized maps that guide newer planes around mountains and other hazards passengers disembark from the rear on fold out stairs because of the tough conditions they faced mud hen pilots had to endure rigorous training to learn to spot local landmarks understand extreme weather conditions and perform landings with rudimentary airport beacons "you pass that training program you had a lot to be proud of " says capt earp the newer s that the airline uses in the rest of its network and now is bringing to the th state have all the modern cockpit and passenger conveniences and will make flying in rugged weather safer the carrier says because the newer jets arent designed to land on gravel the landing strip at red dog had to be paved although new route assignments will take the anchorage based pilots to sunny destinations like cancun mexico and palm springs calif the pilots say theyll miss the old challenges and the camaraderie with crew members and local passengers capt af uhr who co piloted that approach flight to juneau says flying planes that get "food on the table in nome" will always be more rewarding than "getting a bunch of irate people to newark "
