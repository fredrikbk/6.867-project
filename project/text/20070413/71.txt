rudys big apple baggage heres a little nugget from the past a tale that may offer some insights into the next stage of the gop presidential race and the fortunes of front runner rudy giuliani the date is the mid s and republicans have swept congress with their contract with america a top promise is greater fiscal responsibility and a crucial element of that is a vow to pass a line item veto and give the president the power to weed out pork in republicans are as good as their word and grant the oppositions bill clinton a broad new power to strip wasteful spending mr clinton is enthusiastic and in august uses his tool for the first time to strike down a special interest provision tucked in a bill that provision gives new york hospitals a unique right to bilk extra medicaid money and the veto is expected to save federal taxpayers at least &# million quicker than a big apple pol can say "pork " new york officials sue challenging the line item vetos constitutionality that suit clinton v city of new york goes all the way to the supremes which in put the kibosh on veto authority the kicker the guy who brought the suit and won or rather the guy who helped stall one of the more powerful tools for reining in government spending was none other than former new york city mayor rudy giuliani thats a story largely lost to history but dont be surprised if it and other giuliani in the city financial tales start to figure more prominently in this race the former mayor is leading the field in part because he has kept the emphasis on his terror fighting credentials and more recently his "fiscally conservative governance " its smart strategy designed to deflect attention from mr giulianis bigger weaknesses on abortion or domestic partnerships the question is whether the same new york political culture that shaped and defined the mayor and left him vulnerable to attack for his social views will also cause him heartburn on the economic front especially since the question of just which gop candidate can claim the title of biggest tightwad is a growing one republicans had to pack their congressional bags last november in no small part because of voter disgust over their spending largess and earmark abuse primary voters want a leader wholl revive the gop reform agenda wield the veto pen cut discretionary spending enact budget reform slice programs and reform ballooning entitlements mr giuliani isnt alone in wanting to give cultural conservatives something else to think about john mccain never really got past his attack on christian conservatives and many of those same folks are suspicious of mitt romneys commitment to their religious causes better to change the subject which is why all the candidates are focusing increasingly on economics enter rudy who has elevated "fiscal discipline" to a top promise claiming "the strongest record" of any candidate "republican or democrat" on that issue his op ed this week in the financial times led with the line "washington needs a hefty dose of fiscal discipline " the phrase tops his list of issues on his web site where he notes that he cut the size of nyc funded government by and got rid of wasteful programs hes promised his own vetoes yet if this is music to many american ears its semi swahili to new yorkers whove seen the mayor at work in the aggregate mr giuliani did some remarkable things particularly in his first term he inherited a city in decline and his fix was to curtail the growth in government his initial budget slashed spending by &# million cut taxes slash the payroll and privatize state entities he did this while beating down crime and facing an entrenched political machine yet no one should forget mr giuliani came up through the big city system its tough to be principled in a town defined by crushing social costs all powerful unions and party machines harder still when you are the only republican in miles for all of mr giulianis initial reform fervor it eventually waned he was a master at parochial politics at throwing idealism under the double decker tour bus if it meant getting more for the big apple no matter who paid for it take the line item veto for decades new york had taken advantage of a special program that allowed it alone to reap extra federal medicaid dollars the citys broken health system was dependent on this booty and its loss would have required painful change mr giuliani instead sued portraying the issue as us against them when he won his press release declared it a "great victory" for "the people of the city the state and the constitution of the u s " no mention of the other americans who got to float nycs bills heres another one out of city residents had long complained about new yorks onerous commuter tax and in the state legislature moved for repeal rightfully so since it was unprincipled and bad economic policy yet it gave new york city &# million a year which is why mr giuliani fought unsuccessfully against its end or take nafta which mr giuliani complained would be bad for new york mr giulianis campaign doesnt deny this record but notes this is what politicians do "as mayor he made his decisions based on what was in the best interest of new york as president hed make his decisions based on whats best interest of the entire country " says michael boskin mr giulianis top economic adviser but you can bet mr giulianis competitors will have fun with it and hes got competition mr mccains campaign is struggling but the arizona senator wont be shy about comparing his fiscal discipline bona fides with the rest of the field this is a guy who first authored line item veto legislation in is notorious for publicly humiliating even his gop colleagues over their earmark pork and who in the past few years alone has voted against the farm bill the highway bill and the medicare drug bill mr romney too is out there plumping his anti spending credentials recently unveiling tv ads in iowa and new hampshire entitled "i like vetoes " he gets specific promising to cap non defense discretionary spending at inflation minus and to veto any bill congress sends that exceeds the limit his campaign has noted that as massachusetts chief mighty mitt used his line item veto power more than times nasty as this may get whenever gop candidates are duking it out over who is most responsible with money
