in singapore a question of interest potential conflict of exchange chief underscores lax rules singapore a company owned in part by singapore exchange ltd chief executive hsieh fu hua has begun competing with the exchange for chinese listings creating a potential conflict that underlines how governance standards in asia still lag behind those in other markets last month prime partners corporate finance announced a joint venture to lure chinese companies to list on londons aim market putting it in direct competition with the sgx which gets half of its new listings from china about two thirds of the corporate finance business is owned by prime founders inc a holding company for prime partners group co founded by mr hsieh in mr hsieh said he owns about a third of prime founders which is registered in the british virgin islands prime partners corporate finance has received mandates for initial public offerings from two chinese companies that are targeting a total of us&# million in fund raising and it has others in the pipeline it also has a cooperative relationship with the sgx the exchange and other data vendors distribute an index of singapore listed chinese stocks that prime partners corporate finance has been compiling since september mr hsieh who remains a nonexecutive director of prime founders said there are sufficient safeguards in place to prevent a conflict of interest and sgx echoed that in a statement yesterday he also said he has given a written pledge to not vote his shares in prime founders and doesnt participate in running the business he publicly disclosed his interest in the company when he became sgx chief in march "i am clearly operating within a chinese wall " he said "i am walled off from what they do the fact that i am an owner is disclosed this is the world of business today where there are all kinds of different interests the issue is whether its fully disclosed and there is a chinese wall " prime founders forms a significant portion of mr hsiehs net worth he described it as not being the majority but he said he believes his pay at the exchange is sufficient for his financial interests to be aligned with his role as chief executive mr hsieh was paid million singapore dollars us&# million for the financial year ended june including an ex gratia payment of s&# according to the annual report he owned sgx shares valued at nearly s&# million at the current share price and had four million share options "i think they have given me enough incentives to be aligned both in terms of my options as well my own personal investment in the shares of sgx " mr hsieh said but attracting chinese companies listings that in some cases would go to london instead of the singapore exchange would likely boost the value of mr hsiehs holdings in unlisted prime partners david gerald chief executive of shareholder watchdog securities investors association singapore said mr hsiehs disclosure and undertakings dont change the fact that prime partners competes with sgx "it would be better if he divests his interest in prime partners because even though you are not involved in the day to day management or in any way involved in the process the fact is you are a shareholder you would like to see the value of your shares going up and this particular business is in competition with the sgx " mr gerald said in a telephone interview mr gerald who described mr hsieh as a "friend" and a "nice man " said in a later email that to avoid any misunderstanding he wanted the following to be his statement "i agree that the fact that he holds equity in prime partners which is also involved in listings in london does give the perception of conflict in his current role as ceo of sgx but as far as i know he has relinquished his management role and has nothing to do with the running of the companys business he did disclose i remember his shareholding in pp when he took office at sgx " the singapore exchange is backing its chief executive saying that "sgx does not believe that its ceo mr hsieh fu hua is in a conflict of interest situation " some market participants and corporate governance experts dont share this view "that wouldnt be possible in the canadian market " richard nesbitt chief executive of tsx group inc parent of the toronto stock exchange said when told of mr hsiehs interest in prime partners mr nesbitt said exchanges have to be careful about dealing with potential conflicts of interest given the highly visible role they play in the markets the corporate governance and financial reporting centre at the national university of singapore said mr hsiehs ownership of prime founders may raise concerns because of the exchanges standards setting role as the market regulator new
