politics &amp economics courting allies to fight counterfeiters u s chamber of commerce aims to teach governments the benefits of curbing piracy washington even as washington toughens its trade stance in response to chinese counterfeiting of american goods the u s chamber of commerce is taking a softer approach by working on the ground against piracy in a number of countries instead of pushing for sanctions or talking up the losses incurred by u s companies from counterfeiting the washington based business group is conducting studies and compiling evidence in brazil india and elsewhere to show them how much tax revenue their state and local governments are losing to counterfeiters the group is also bringing in representatives from u s companies such as mattel inc nike inc time warner inc gillette co and microsoft corp to train local law enforcement authorities to recognize the difference between pirated and legitimate goods the effort is designed to address a major hurdle in antipiracy campaigns abroad persuading local leaders that they stand to gain from pressing for street level enforcement even when central authorities in foreign countries commit to increased enforcement local officials often dont follow through as counterfeiting businesses may generate jobs and other benefits for their economies "if we were going to be effective overseas we had to take a slightly different tack than what we would do here in washington " said myron brilliant vice president for asia at the chamber the group thinks it can make more headway than with its traditional more confrontational approach which involved seeking redress through official channels such as the u s trade representatives office or the world trade organization the trade in pirated goods remains a significant problem even in countries where the chamber is trying its new approach efforts may squeeze counterfeiters in some locales but the sellers often pop up elsewhere in brazil the first country where the intellectual property rights initiative was implemented the chamber hired local polling companies to conduct surveys on consumer buying trends for counterfeit and pirated goods in and the surveys found high levels of conscious purchasing of such items across all income levels not just among the poorer classes as many brazilian officials believed chamber studies also estimated the brazilian government lost &# billion of potential tax revenue last year because of counterfeiting chamber officials sat down with brazils vice minister of justice finance officials and a congressional committee on piracy to discuss early findings there was a noticeable change in their views of piracys potential impact as a result said mark smith the chambers managing director for western hemisphere affairs however many brazilian law enforcement personnel didnt know how to spot counterfeit products which are often hard to distinguish from the real thing so the chamber brought in u s toy electronics and apparel industry representatives to teach them how to spot telltale signs of fakes after the training brazilian port agents used techniques they learned to conduct seizures at three ports confiscating counterfeit items that included pairs of fake nike shoes three containers of bogus m duct tape and one container of computer hardware components the chamber said "its not yet perfect but they are taking the whole issue seriously " said cori hartje director of microsofts genuine software initiative antonio de oliveira santos a brazilian street vendor selling pirated software and computer games in the santa efigenia black market in sao paolo said sales have dropped because of increased police inspections "about a month ago i would sell five to six cds a day now i sell two or three cds a day " chamber officials point to a rise in the price of illegal knock offs in brazil from to as a sign that increased enforcement by local authorities was having an impact on the local counterfeit business but survey figures released last month show counterfeit sales are up again with profiteers apparently having moved to other parts of the country where law enforcement has less of a hold "our main task is to have this spread all over brazil " said carlos teixeira minister counselor for economic affairs at brazils u s embassy during a recent panel discussion on intellectual property rights in washington the chamber has expanded its campaign elsewhere in central and south america including argentina el salvador guatemala and costa rica it is also taking its initiative to india with a hollywood bollywood campaign to crack down on movie piracy gallup india is expected to release by months end the results of a poll commissioned by the chamber looking at

the help of the federal bureau of investigation department of justice and u s industry representatives india already has some specialized police units for antipiracy enforcement but law enforcement in the country is largely a local matter and results can vary widely there has been some progress chamber officials said the indian music industry has put resources into legal cases against piracy of their own products increasing general awareness of intellectual property theft and showing how greater attention to the issue can produce tangible results meanwhile the chamber is pushing a bill that would tighten regulation and oversight of dvd manufacturers in india in china where counterfeiting is rampant but public polling is restricted the chamber co hosted a global intellectual property
