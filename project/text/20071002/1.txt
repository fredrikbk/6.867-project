sorry wrong number ebay says on skype a &# billion write down shows the pitfalls plaguing some internet phone services when ebay inc purchased skype for &# billion in wall street wondered how the internet calling company could be worth so much the skeptics appear to be proven right acknowledging that its largest ever acquisition hasnt lived up to expectations ebay yesterday said it would take a &# billion third quarter charge related to skype it also announced a management reshuffle with skype co founder niklas zennstrom stepping down as chief executive of the unit mr zennstrom will be succeeded by michael van swaaij ebays chief strategy officer until a permanent successor is found to run the service which lets consumers call other users via computer free the skype write down highlights the difficulty of making money from a stand alone internet phone service while companies such as skype and vonage holdings corp that are built on making free or cheap computer based phone calls generate tremendous consumer loyalty they cant always turn users into profits its just the latest of many innovative technologies such as social networking online music and digital video that inspire legions of followers but dont necessarily turn into a profitable and sustainable business vonage for one made a splash when it went public months ago and its brash co founder jeffrey citron liked to talk about how the company would one day become larger than the incumbent telecom providers but the holmdel n j company now trades at below &# per share after opening at its initial public offering at &# for its most recent quarter vonage reported a loss of &# million its latest in a string of losses analysts were so uniformly negative at the time of ebays acquisition of skype that the news yesterday was greeted with shrugs ebay shares rose cents to &# in nasdaq market trading yesterday "we had concerns at the time of the acquisition that ebay was overpaying for an unproven technology and expecting a lot of synergy that didnt seem plausible " says derek brown an analyst at cantor fitzgerald &amp co "relative to the value that the deal has delivered the price may have been unjustified " the skype charge says sucharita mulpuru an analyst at forrester research inc is "an admission of error its a mea culpa " its also a setback for ebay chief executive meg whitman and her strategy to rev up the san jose calif companys growth through acquisitions while ebay has recently bought into different businesses such as online ticketing and comparison shopping it remains unclear whether those deals will deliver the necessary growth to offset the maturing business of its flagship auction site ebays second quarter listings of products for sale on the site fell its first ever decline and while its second quarter revenue rose helped by businesses other than its auction site the companys gross merchandise volume which is the total value of goods sold on all its sites increased just its slowest growth rate over the past year ebays &# billion write down for skype based in luxembourg consists of two parts one is a charge of million euros or about &# million as part of the companys third quarter financial earnings to better reflect skypes current market value the other is a payment of million euros or about &# million founders and skype shareholders who elected for a performance based option that payment gets ebay out from under an agreement that could have cost it up to &# billion if the service hit certain performance targets ebay acknowledged that skype has been disappointing with spokesman hani durzy noting that the business "hasnt performed as well as wed expected " but he added that skype remains an "extremely valuable asset " ebay bought skype two years ago knowing that internet calls made from one computer user to another would generate little or no revenue but it hoped to entice more people to join the skype network and eventually make money through other services such as conference calls or click to call services connecting prospective buyers with sellers on the ebay site under ebay skype has rolled out services such as skype find a user generated yellow pages and skype prime which lets callers charge for services such as tutoring services but finding paying customers for them has proved elusive skype has contributed just &# million of ebays overall &# billion in revenue in the most recent quarter the relatively anemic showing came despite skypes growing customer usage with registered users totaling million in the most recent quarter up from about million registered users in ebay often installs its own managers to run acquired companies but skype was an exception mr zennstrom skypes co founder remained as head of the unit and says that ebay was "hands off" with the business still ebay appointed a succession of its executives as skypes president including paypal president rajiv dutta and henry gomez in an interview yesterday mr zennstrom years old says he always planned to leave skype at some point adding that hes better suited to the role of entrepreneur than manager while he will remain skypes nonexecutive chairman mr zennstrom says he will be spending more time on joost an online video technology company that he started with skype co founder janus friis in joost lets tv shows and other online video be distributed using so called peer to peer technology which played a key role in the other startups the pair founded such as music sharing site kazaa and skype mr zennstrom defends ebays vision for skype calling the dozen or so services that skype has introduced "seed services " but he acknowledges "its going to be difficult to make money" from such services especially since they dont generate as much revenue as the fees skype users are charged for calls to mobile phones landline phones and voicemail many of the stand alone services such as skype and vonage which use the public internet have had a tough time making money vonage has million subscribers but its marketing costs have been high and the company has been wracked by successful patent lawsuits filed by major phone companies like verizon communications inc and sprint nextel corp cable companies on the other hand have been more successful charging for internet calling services over private networks where they can bundle them with other services such as tv and internet access cable companies also say they offer a higher quality of service and greater reliability because they control the network overall internet telephone usage is growing rising to million users in from million in according to research firm idc despite the growth internet telephone services make up only of the retail phone market according to forrester and the average monthly revenue per user has declined the average revenue per internet phone subscriber has dropped to &# a month from &# two years ago skype will likely remain an add on phone service for most users rather than a replacement of fixed lines analysts say in august skype experienced a two day outage which the company was slow to explain that helped reinforce user views that such a service can be ancillary says forrester analyst sally cohen "the growth in the market doesnt match the hype " says ms cohen on the whole "consumers have been very slow to catch on "
