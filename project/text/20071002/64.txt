investing in funds a quarterly analysis mutual funds get mad they say too many management buyouts treat public shareholders unfairly and they arent going to take it anymore early this year mutual fund manager brian berghuis learned that a company in his portfolio was targeted for takeover normally this would be good news but when the t rowe price manager examined the offer he came to a different conclusion the price for laureate education inc was so low it was "laughable " he says the chief executive of laureate working with private equity firms was proposing buying up public shares and taking the company private in a deal that valued laureate at &# billion mr berghuis believed the university operator could be worth perhaps more representing as much as &# million in lost gains for t rowe prices mutual funds in past years mr berghuis says he would have lodged his displeasure with the company and then just cashed in his shares but this time he and other t rowe price managers mounted a public fight better known for retirement accounts than rabble rousing t rowe price is among a handful of mutual fund firms that have loudly complained that some of the many recent management buyouts in which a public companys managers team up with private investors to buy out shareholders havent been fair in a traditional takeover by an outside buyer they say managements goal is usually to win the highest price for their company but when managers buy their own operation there can be an incentive to pay as little as possible in opposing the laureate deal baltimore based t rowe price lobbied fellow shareholders to join the battle it agreed to cover its legal costs out of its own pocket rather than asking clients to foot the bill should the battle go to court the company also registered with the securities and exchange commission as an activist investor a step required for t rowe price to oppose the takeover it was only the second such filing in the companys year history laureate strongly defends the deal and its terms ceo doug becker who led the buyout says laureate had "only the interests of the companys stockholders at heart " the effort involved a roster of big name private equity firms including kolberg kravis roberts &amp co kkr which was represented in the deal by the same public relations agent as mr becker declined to comment after a record &# billion in management led buyouts announced in a much slower pace of deals is expected in coming months amid turmoil in debt markets but it could be tough to put newly aggressive mutual funds back in the box "theyve tasted blood " says henry hu a corporate and securities law professor at the university of texas school of law early this year fidelity investments took a stand against a private equity buyout of radio broadcaster clear channel communications inc and helped win improved terms that shareholders approved last week after lord abbett inc and other shareholders opposed a proposed private equity buyout of osi restaurant partners inc which operates the outback steakhouse chain the offer was sweetened the enhanced pact won shareholder approval in june in july new york fund manager pzena investment management helped thwart financier carl icahns takeover of auto parts supplier lear corp rejecting the argument of mr icahn and lears management that the price was fair in light of the challenges facing the big u s auto makers and their suppliers "eventually you just say youre not going to take it anymore " says richard pzena the firms founder traditionally shareholder activism was the province of financiers who have taken stakes in companies to push for strategic shifts pension funds for unions or public employees such as the california public employees retirement system also long have agitated for executive pay caps or other corporate governance changes more recently hedge funds have pocketed big profits by taking positions in troubled companies and pressing for change critics say mutual fund companies have dodged these fights in part to avoid offending companies that could be potential customers for investment services mutual funds deny that charge fund companies say theyve skirted confrontation for other reasons there are regulatory hurdles to monitor possible collusion the sec requires investors who own more than of a company to register as either "passive" or "active " a passive investor isnt permitted to lobby other investors on matters that affect how a company operates or on votes in corporate elections an active investor can seek to influence other investors but those registering as activists are restricted from trading a companys stock for days after filing additionally portfolio managers seen as troublemakers could find resistance from company officials as they seek information about current or prospective investments and because the typical fund family invests in dozens or hundreds of companies while aiming to keep fees low managers say it makes little sense to spend time or money fighting t rowe price for example hadnt filed as an activist investor since when it opposed the proposed purchase price of publicly traded shares of a unit of a swiss insurance company for year old mr berghuis who joined t rowe price in the path to activism began in january that is when one of his holdings fairmont hotels &amp resorts inc announced a buyout involving a private equity group the group offered to buy back shares at &# apiece a level that valued the company at &# billion mr berghuis felt fairmonts valuable real estate holdings which included the room scottsdale princess resort in arizona would make it worth &# or more per share t rowe price went by its traditional playbook it complained privately to the company then voted its shares against the deal the buyout was approved a few months later in july fairmonts new owners sold the scottsdale property for &# million while continuing to operate the resort a few months later it sold seven other properties roughly one quarter of its portfolio for &# billion mr berghuis took the sales to mean his &# a share estimate had actually been low "this was a heist " he says a fairmont spokeswoman said the buyout offer was the result of a "thorough and dynamic" bidding process in march a second company in mr berghuiss portfolio received a buyout offer he thought the &# a share bid for education management corp a university operator undervalued the company by at least &# a share he voted against it the buyout sailed through education management declined to comment for this article mr berghuis says voting against the buyout "didnt get me one red cent more nobody even noticed " as progressed he and others at t rowe price wrestled with their options often in weekly strategy meetings in the firms conference room overlooking baltimores inner harbor t rowe price is the nations sixth largest mutual fund company with &# billion under management much of it in k retirement plans in late january laureate announced its buyout agreement the company which operates two dozen schools in countries said it would be acquired by a group of investors led by the ceo mr becker t rowe price owned of laureate making it the companys third largest shareholder but laureate represented a small slice of the fund giants own holdings it accounted for of mr berghuiss &# billion mid cap growth fund making it his portfolios th largest position laureate shares accounted for a bigger chunk of the &# billion new horizons fund run by fellow manager john laporte mr berghuis was skeptical of the offer by laureates management &# a share about &# above the stocks previous closing price he recalled that mr becker had repeatedly made forecasts that suggested to t rowe price the stock could hit &# by "its ridiculous " mr berghuis recalls telling mr laporte kara cheseby the t rowe price analyst following laureate tried to arrange a discussion with mr becker laureate told her it would take several weeks this irritated the team at t rowe price which had been an investor in laureate and its predecessor sylvan learning systems inc for more than a decade on top of that the headquarters of baltimore based laureate are less than a mile from t rowe prices home office mr laporte and other t rowe price executives knew mr becker from social and fund raising events and would run into him at restaurants around the city "hes hiding behind the lawyers " mr laporte recalls saying in february ms cheseby began drafting a letter to laureates management and other shareholders when mr laporte saw an early draft he asked ms cheseby to make it stronger "the message should be just say no " he told her on march the firm took its opposition public in the letter messrs laporte and berghuis accused laureates board of failing to do its job citing "defects in the bidding process" and declaring the entire process "unfair to current shareholders " the letter was filed with the sec to win t rowe price had to persuade others to join its side it lobbied institutional shareholder services a rockville md unit of riskmetrics group inc that advises investors on how to vote in mergers and other corporate matters mr laporte also contacted chicago based money manager william blair &amp co which held of laureate making it the largest shareholder at that time the firm indicated that it didnt support the deal but preferred to keep quiet mr laporte says william blair &amp co declined to comment for this article on april t rowe prices managers got their meeting with laureate management mr becker was accompanied by laureates chief investment officer and two independent directors overseeing the buyout bid t rowe price chairman brian rogers attended t rowe price argued the deal was unfair to long term shareholders "what i want is for this transaction to go away " mr laporte says he told mr becker laureate officials countered that t rowe prices forecasts were high because the educator faced increased competition potential delays in expanding outside the u s and other challenges they also argued that it was a better deal for shareholders than the education management buyout which t rowe price had opposed the meeting ended in a standoff still the t rowe price team felt they were making progress blackrock inc a new york money manager and major shareholder told laureates board that it opposed the deal there were indications that others would vote against it as well then on the morning of june mr berghuis got a surprise laureates management raised the takeover offer to &# a share the slight increase seemed insignificant to the money managers other education stocks had jumped nearly since laureate announced its deal but in the fine print was something the fund managers didnt initially grasp the buyout had been changed to a tender offer they ran the new offer past their lawyers and got bad news this unusual move made the deal tougher to stop in a normal buyout a shareholder vote is held and the deal goes through if more than vote in favor in a tender offer by contrast shareholders who back the offer first pledge their shares to the buyout group once the deal has enough backing a shareholder vote is held there was an important technicality laureates board said that it would let executives such as mr becker vote shares held as options the move effectively lowered its threshold for victory to from in addition institutional shareholder services doesnt make recommendations on tender offers dashing t rowe prices hopes that iss would influence other shareholders and in a surprise to the t rowe price managers one of the other investors they had courted came out in favor of the buyout william blair which had reduced its stake in laureate to since january issued a statement on the day of the revised offer it called &# a "fair price " on july laureate announced that of shareholders had offered to cash in their shares t rowe price had lost the deal was accomplished through a "perfectly democratic process " says laureates mr becker "i am proud to know that investors made significant profits from their investment " mr berghuis figures he and others at t rowe price spent dozens of hours apiece organizing their opposition "maybe we got an extra &# but that certainly didnt compensate for the efforts " he says since then as mounting homeowner defaults have caused a collapse in subprime mortgage markets credit markets overall have tightened and become much less favorable to buyout deals the tougher financing environment also may dent the resolve of some institutional rebels as buyers may be far less able to be pushed around going forward says chris young head of merger and acquisitions research for riskmetrics "its going to be a much more dangerous game of chicken for shareholders to oppose a transaction just for a sweetener " still he says "weve opened a pandoras box a little bit and shareholders are simply more vocal " t rowe price is weighing action on other buyouts messrs berghuis and laporte say it is seeking a full time employee to handle corporate governance issues at companies in its portfolios an unusual post at a mainstream fund company "we will never be out there on the aggressive edge of activism " says mr berghuis "but well be better prepared " shira ovide
