business technology its creators call internet outdated offer remedies in at the pentagons advanced research projects agency larry roberts oversaw a program of connected research computers called arpanet that became the foundation for the internet four decades later he has spent nearly &# million trying to redo that same technology which he now believes is far behind the times "we can no longer rely on last generation technology which has essentially remained unchanged for years to power internet performance " says mr roberts who is years old last month his start up anagran inc introduced a piece of gear called the flow router that he says can help modernize the internet the equipment analyzes web traffic to discern whether it is an email a movie or a phone call and then carves out the bandwidth needed for transmission mr roberts isnt the only networking pioneer dissatisfied with earlier achievements len bosack the year old co founder and former chief technology officer of networking giant cisco systems inc helped commercialize routers the core piece of networking equipment that allows computers to communicate with one another yet he now terms such gear "less and less adequate" for todays internet needs last month his company xkl llc unveiled a system that allows businesses to connect to underground cables that have nearly times the capacity of current telecommunications pipes the actions of messrs bosack and roberts fuel the growing debate over whether the internets current infrastructure is sufficient to handle the explosion of bandwidth hungry services such as internet telephony and video in a recent report cisco calculated that monthly internet traffic in north america will increase by to more than million terabytes or the equivalent of trillion email messages if such internet traffic continues increasing many believe networks could crash or at least slow to a crawl "the increasing bandwidth demands on cable operators will soon reach crisis stage " wrote stan schatt research director at abi research in a recent report others disagree cisco even with its forecast of great traffic growth concludes internet service providers will be able to cope today information travels the web by being broken into tiny bits called packets which are routed through the least congested pipes to their destination once the packets arrive they are reassembled into their original form the problem is that the increasing size of files such as video has begun overwhelming some equipment handling the traffic resulting in errant or lost packets to tackle the problem a slew of start ups are producing gear and software to accelerate internet traffic or to increase the networks capacity these include companies run by messrs roberts and bosack as well as riverbed technology inc and big band networks inc other companies such as bitgravity inc and limelight networks inc are creating "parallel networks" essentially scaled down versions of the internet to escape the glut of traffic on current networks the target buyers for these start up services are internet service providers and big companies with large networks of satellite offices a business for instance can affect how quickly emails and other files flow to their branch offices depending on the equipment they use in their network but many of the new start ups aiming to cater to these needs arent likely to survive in the late s start ups such as celox networks inc chiaro networks inc and centerpoint broadband technologies inc also emerged to grapple with the growth in internet traffic all of those companies have since filed for bankruptcy or shut down casualties of the telecom bust todays web traffic control start ups "really have their work cut out for them " says michael kennedy a networking consultant with network strategy partners llc "technology doesnt always win the race " mr robertss concern over the internets infrastructure stretches back years even while at arpanet he says he was unsure how long the technology could work especially since the system didnt ensure that information packets would arrive at their destination his fears crystallized in the late s when he saw companies begin to use the internet to make phone calls and consumers begin to dabble in online video "the internet wasnt designed for people to watch television " he says "i know because i designed it " in mr roberts who worked at several networking start ups in the s and s after leaving the defense department in founded a start up called caspian networks inc he raised &# million from venture capitalists for caspian to manufacture the flow based routers that could analyze internet traffic and improve how that traffic moved but the equipment priced at about &# per router was too expensive for many customers mr roberts resigned in from caspian the company closed its doors last year but the scientists desire to improve the webs infrastructure didnt abate two months after leaving caspian mr roberts founded anagran in redwood city calif and raised &# million in venture funding to continue his work this time around he says anagrans product is cheaper costing just &# and there is a more urgent need for such equipment "larry wants to get it right " says dan brown a venture capitalist at arrowpath venture partners in redwood shores calif which has invested in anagran anagran has already picked up customers such as merit networks inc of ann arbor mich a nonprofit organization that builds networks for universities and the international center for advanced internet research at northwestern university "larrys equipment is built for the more complex traffic like internet television " says jim chen assistant director of networking at northwestern "its a perfect fit for us " the xkl story began in seattle in a year after mr bosack and his former wife cisco co founder sandy lersner were ousted from cisco at the time cisco had just gone public and the companys venture capitalists figured the duo could no longer run the growing enterprise mr bosack soon sold most of his cisco stock and concentrated on xkl there he focused on increasing the internets capacity through fiber optics which are strands of glass capable of carrying times more data than traditional wires for more than a decade mr bosack worked in stealth mode on his technology at the same time he began noticing how businesses and consumers were finding unintended uses for the internet such as videoconferencing "some of this stuff was putting a heavy burden on the network " he says that led to xkls introduction of the dmx optical transport system last month the &# system allows businesses and service providers rather than telecommunication companies to manage and connect to fiber lines xkl has only just begun to sign up customers says mr bosack messrs roberts and bosack havent met but know of each other through industry circles and say they have been following one anothers progress "were pushing for the same thing " says mr bosack "the public needs something better than whats currently available "
