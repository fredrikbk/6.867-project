immigration losers many conservatives believe that "enforcement first" of existing immigration law must precede any form of guest worker or earned legalization legislation to normalize the status of some million undocumented workers iterations of this opinion fill the airwaves of talk radio the speeches of republican presidential contenders and the opinion pages of conservative publications the formula alleviates or at least postpones the antagonism between those who want to deport illegal workers and those who want them to stay the language of comprehensive immigration reform a combination of strict border enforcement and a path to legalization has been abandoned even by many who hope eventually to revive it this rhetorical consensus is unserious deportation advocates understand full well that existing civil penalties will not overcome the economic incentives that drive these immigrants and their employers that is why republican rep jim sensenbrenner of wisconsin the primary sponsor of the border protection antiterrorism and illegal immigration control act of added criminal penalties to the common frauds perpetrated by illegal workers and those who employ them the illegals themselves the group most directly affected understand "enforcement first" for what it really is a step toward mass deportation that is why thousands of undocumented brazilians exited riverside n j when the town council sanctioned their landlords and employers to these two groups that reject "enforcement first" as a rhetorical euphemism we may now add a third hispanic citizens who vote undocumented latinos constitute of the american work force but these million workers are a mere fraction of the million latino citizens years or older of these million are themselves foreign born how does "enforcement first" or "enforcement only" play among these voters polling has offered rationales for conflicting projections some contend that hispanics strong support for border security signals a negligible partisan impact others citing latino endorsement of guest worker and earned legalization programs predict electoral disaster for the party that abandons a comprehensive framework in my recent study for the americas majority foundation entitled "border wars the impact of immigration on the latino vote " i document not what hispanics opined but how they actually voted given a clear choice between advocates of "enforcement first" and comprehensive immigration reform the results based on returns from heavily hispanic precincts and over tabulated votes indicate this immigration policies that induce mass fear among illegal residents will induce mass anger among the legal residents who share their heritage the congressional election of provided a unique opportunity to gauge hispanic voter behavior in three congressional districts of the southwest two of them on the border republican candidates ran on an "enforcement only" platform in each case this constituted a departure from previous congressional representation and in each case hispanic support for the republican candidate collapsed from levels former republican rep jim kolbe of arizona was an architect of comprehensive immigration reform his retirement in precipitated a five way primary in which randy graff prevailed with of the vote mr graff supported by the deportationist minutemen civil defense corps pac lost to democrat gabrielle giffords ms giffords aligned herself with the comprehensive reform positions of sens jon kyl and john mccain among the heavily hispanic precincts of cochise county rep kolbe carried of the vote in mr graffs share of the vote in those precincts shrank to in texas former republican rep henry bonilla chairman of the powerful house agriculture appropriations subcommittee was the paradigm of republican hispanic success until he voted for rep sensenbrenners "enforcement only" bill in the heavily hispanic counties of dimmit presidio val verde maverick and zavala mr bonillas support dropped to in from in he lost the district to democrat ciro rodriguez in republican rep j d hayworth the flamboyant incumbent of arizonas fifth district defeated his democratic rival his book "by any means" described his conversion from advocacy of comprehensive immigration reform to a deportationist viewpoint campaigning on enforcement only mr hayworth was defeated by his democratic challenger tempe mayor harry mitchell mr hayworths majority white district provided a test of whether a deportationist platform would attract a strong backlash vote among non hispanic whites it did not in the hispanic influenced majority white precincts of maricopa county mr hayworths vote share declined to in from in in these three races republicans vote share in heavily latino precincts dropped percentage points what does this mean nationwide republicans presidential hispanic vote share increased to in from in in latinos comprised of the electorate but of the voter qualified citizenry with the partisan margin shrinking the incentive for major hispanic registration efforts by either party was scant that changed in when the gops hispanic vote share declined by and as we have seen the drop was twice as precipitous where republicans disavowed comprehensive immigration reform with the huge wedge in vote share that "enforcement only" opened the cost effectiveness of voter registration efforts improved dramatically for democrats in recent years democratic party operatives have conducted registration drives in urban communities that boosted african american turnout to from republicans should their national ticket adopt "enforcement only " can expect democrats to wage similar hispanic campaigns in the most hotly contested political real estate of such standard political operations will more than erase republican majorities in new mexico nevada colorado florida and iowa and may endanger the gop electoral hold on arizona as well that is the short term fallout republicans may suffer from "enforcement only " but the election of marks the beginning of the political attrition not its end one half of u s population growth this decade occurred among latinos were the border hermetically sealed today the children of latino citizens will yet vote moreover there are currently million american born minors with one or both parents who are illegal aliens these young americans share the same citizenship status as those seeking their parents removal it is folly to believe they will not remember who sought to deport their parents when they eventually go to the polls the pending catastrophe is not inevitable republicans have campaigned effectively among hispanics on the basis of entrepreneurship school choice tax cuts and right to life and as the re election of republicans heather wilson and steve pearce of new mexico and jeff flake of arizona demonstrated the gop agenda can include national security as well in latinos helped re elect candidates who advocated the border fence electronic surveillance expedited deportation of violent criminals and biometric worker identification the next proposal for comprehensive immigration reform can contain all of this to retain their hispanic gains republicans need to repudiate only the immoral uneconomical goal of mass deportation mr nadler is the president of americas majority
