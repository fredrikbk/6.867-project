seeking sweet savings as ethanol boosts corn price heinz develops new tomatoes to reduce syrup in its ketchup stockton calif the plump oval tomato rich ozminkowski held in his hand here at h j heinzs experimental farm resembled the common roma variety yet it was anything but the tomato whose very name is proprietary information is to sweeter than the variety now used in heinz ketchup and it is a weapon in the companys war on spiraling costs with prices for corn syrup and other ketchup ingredients going up faster than heinz can raise its own prices the pittsburgh based condiment king is overhauling its breeding operations to help compensate heinz is developing sweeter tomatoes that could cut down on its need for corn syrup as well as varieties that resist disease stay fresh longer and produce a thicker consistency "the new seed work is all about creating the perfect tomato " says mr ozminkowski the companys manager of agriculture research the ethanol industrys consumption of corn is just one factor driving up its price rising global demand for meat is also boosting prices since corn is a key ingredient of animal feed the cost of a bushel of corn has risen to around &# about higher than it was a year ago putting pressure on many food companies meats producer tyson foods inc recently lowered its fiscal year earnings forecast due in part to high corn prices at heinz overall costs for ingredients rose in the quarter ending aug the company responded by raising prices on average during that time and it expects to hike prices further as commodity costs continue to rise the soaring price of high fructose corn syrup is particularly troubling for heinz the syrup accounts for about of the cost of producing a bottle of ketchup heinz is now paying more for corn syrup than it did two years ago tomatoes which account for a third of the cost of making the bottle of ketchup have also become more expensive the recently buoyant real estate market in california where heinz gets all of the tomatoes used in its u s ketchup increased the cost of farmland and higher petroleum prices boosted the costs of cultivating the crops between and the price of california tomatoes used in ketchup tomato paste and tomato sauce hovered around &# per ton in it shot up to &# per ton and this year reached &# hal robertson a third generation grower of tomatoes for heinz at a farm a few miles from stockton recently installed an underground irrigation system to save water "it used to cost &# an acre to grow tomatoes " he says "now it costs &# to &# an acre " to help keep its own costs down heinz one of the few food producers that breeds its own crop varieties is stepping up efforts to develop new tomato varieties it plans to sell them to its contract growers who will be required to use the seeds to grow tomatoes for heinz these growers wont be allowed to sell the tomatoes to other companies over the past three years heinz increased its budget for seed research by the company wont disclose the size of the budget but says the added funding has allowed it to purchase more land adjacent to its stockton research farm and to double the size of its seed research team to people including breeders agronomists and a plant pathologist company officials predict the investment will pay off as new breeds of tomatoes help lower their ingredient costs by millions of dollars a year the company had long focused on increasing yields seeking varieties that grow more tomatoes per plant but two years ago as corn prices began rising the company began putting an emphasis on developing sweeter tomatoes mr ozminkowski says he spends much of his time shuttling among heinzs research fields in californias central and sacramento valleys his car has become his office for his frequent travels along the mile stretch carrying a clipboard to log information he walks the fields to determine which hybrids to advance into further stages of testing for two weeks each winter he goes to australia to study how the tomatoes grown for use in the ketchup and sauces heinz sells overseas perform in a more rainy and humid climate heinz also has research fields in poland where the tomatoes tend to contain more sugar mr ozminkowski who has a doctorate in plant breeding and horticulture isnt yet sure why that is but surmises it could have something to do with the areas cooler nights squatting in a row of tomato plants at heinzs stockton farm mr ozminkowski scraped pollen from one plant with a knife and rubbed it onto another demonstrating how a breeder creates a hybrid he emphasizes that heinz uses traditional breeding techniques to create tomatoes with the desired traits not genetic modification which involves introducing dna from another species into the seed "we select a parent tomato with high sugar content and then breed until we get the right hybrid " he explained in an effort to speed up the process heinz scientists are testing seedlings for the presence of certain dna segments or markers that are associated with particular traits such as sweetness the seedlings with the right markers are then cultivated improving the odds of producing tomatoes with the desired characteristics heinz began breeding tomatoes in and about years later began selling its seeds to competitors including del monte foods co and conagra foods inc but two years ago heinz decided to keep certain varieties to itself "we are holding back those that we think offer us a competitive advantage " says reuben peterson heinzs director of global tomato supply chain the sweeter tomato varieties heinz has already developed could be used in its ketchup in another year or two the company is in the early stages of developing tomatoes even to sweeter than those the company wont be broadcasting the new ingredient heinz faces risks any time it changes the tomatoes in its ketchup which could affect the balance of flavors customers are used to ketchup that is too tomatoey for instance could come out tasting like tomato sauce heinz officials say their ketchup undergoes rigorous testing before being introduced to the marketplace and that consumers wont be able to detect any difference as the company gradually uses sweeter tomatoes and less corn syrup in its ketchup but heinz hopes consumers will notice efforts to make its ketchup thicker ever since the s heinz has been marketing its ketchup as "thick and rich " its counting on other tomato varieties with a denser texture to help differentiate its ketchup from that of rivals some of last years tomatoes were so thick they jammed the machines that grind them into a pulp mr peterson says heinz says it is working to modify the machines so they can handle thicker tomatoes
