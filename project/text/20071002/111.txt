the afternoon report murky waters online edition the shadowy world of private military contractors got a large dose of public scrutiny today as the head of blackwater usa faced critics in congress in remarks prepared for a house hearing erik prince blackwaters founder vigorously defended his firm against recent accusations from both iraqi officials and some u s lawmakers that the company is a reckless outfit with a cavalier attitude toward iraqi civilian deaths mr prince said that of the north carolina firms contractors have died while protecting u s diplomats while no americans have been killed on its watch "there is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men " said mr prince a former navy seal and member of a wealthy michigan family with connections in republican political circles rep henry waxman d calif who is chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee questioned the role of contractors saying that "privatizing is working exceptionally well for blackwater " and adding that "the question for this hearing is whether outsourcing to blackwater is a good deal to the american taxpayer " the hearing is the latest manifestation of concern over the role in iraq of private security contractors whose presence first gained attention with the grisly deaths of four blackwater security guards in fallujah in march more recently a sept shooting in baghdad where at least iraqi citizens were killed put the conduct of contractors into the spotlight the gunfight erupted after a car bomb was detonated near a u s diplomatic convoy which blackwater contractors were guarding some iraqi officials reacted furiously to the iraqi death toll which they said is the latest example of reckless disregard for civilians by blackwaters contractors and some are threatening to eliminate protections that have made contractors such as blackwater immune from iraqi prosecution blackwater has defended the actions of its employees saying they were acting defensively to protect their client but the controversy isnt likely to burn out quickly in advance of todays hearings the democrat controlled house oversight and government reform committee also issued a scathing report on blackwater which said the firm has fired dozens of guards over the past three years for problems ranging from misuse of weapons alcohol and drug violations inappropriate conduct and violent behavior also last week defense secretary robert gates said he is concerned about oversight of security contractors and has sent a team there to investigate yesterday the fbi opened its own probe at the state departments request and of course todays hearing takes place against the broader backdrop of frustration in the democratic controlled congress over its inability to change the direction of iraq war policy on that note house democrats today spelled out a strategy that would stall action on the administrations war budget and rely on incremental funding to sustain troop operations until next spring defense secretary robert gates outlined an almost &# billion request last week for the military in iraq and afghanistan over the coming year instead democrats appear likely to provide short term funding in the range of &# billion to &# billion to sustain overseas operations the move would represent a significant escalation of congressional democrats conflict with
