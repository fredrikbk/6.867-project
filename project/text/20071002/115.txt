the future of bioenergy with oil close to &# per barrel a series of businesses ranging from chemicals and textiles through agriculture and utilities are already facing heavy cost pressure hundred dollar oil could be catastrophic for some but despite opecs promises supplies are so tight that we may be one hurricane political crisis pipeline explosion or major refinery accident away from some very grim earnings reports the best case is that other large energy sources such as nuclear solar wind tide or cellulosic ethanol are a decade or more out this leads to one obvious conclusion we have to do better with the oil gas and coal we have in part this depends on improving efficiency but a large part also depends on getting more energy out of existing and new deposits this will require not just chemical and mechanical solutions but understanding hydrocarbons as a biological system it is easy to forget why biology and energy are symbiotic hydrocarbons are in essence sunlight concentrated in plant animal or bacterial matter be it coal gas or oil what we are extracting and burning is bioenergy concentrated in carbon this is not the way we have approached hydrocarbons for the past years instead of considering energy as a biological process we have regarded it as a matter of chemical engineering when we have thought about how to get more energy out of the ground or to process it more efficiently we turned to chemical and mechanical engineers these means and methods are no longer sufficient much less efficient we have to change how we approach energy production that approach must begin with biology for example coal is concentrated life debris that rotted under pressure for millions of years where there is little gas the only way to get the energy out is to mine the coal but where there is a lot of gas one can extract coal bed methane a far cleaner alternative if we were able to generate more gas from coal instead of the dirty dangerous and destructive mechanical alternative of mining and then burning it we could have a significant positive impact on the environment particularly since coal fired electric plants are one of the single greatest sources of carbon gases what is interesting and promising is that the amount of gas generated by various coal seams varies tremendously and often the reason has to do more with biology than with chemistry if i may be prosaic as bacteria eat old vegetable matter they produce gas just like a kid after eating beans more bacteria equal more gas too much gas with no outlet and the mine can explode biology often determines output because there is a wide variance one can change the conditions in a given coal seam to increase or decrease gas production initial lab results show one might be able to increase coal gas to the point where it might be unnecessary to mine the coal itself future u s energy security and competitiveness i maintain will depend on biology and not just chemistry which is why new disciplines like genomics and proteomics are becoming critical components of any energy bill bp recently partnered with synthetic genomics to explore various hydrocarbon applications these technologies become ever more valuable as oil is processed into advanced plastics textiles or high end fuels dupont sold off its traditional petroleum based polyester and nylon plants and is now manufacturing its new fabrics using large bacterial reactors toyota is developing plants that grow the plastics for use in car dashboards the disposable transparent water cup or lunchtime salad container that you used today could well have been grown in bacteria through a cargill joint venture companies like greenfuel technologies are using algae as a substitute fuel for power plants at the same time that they capture greenhouse gases understanding microbial processes will be the key to increasing output and achieving greater energy independence while reducing carbon emissions in a sense energy is just about to go through the same transition as agriculture did the first centuries of intensive agriculture depended mostly on better mechanics and chemistry bigger tractors and harvesters more powerful pesticides herbicides and fertilizers generated rapid improvements in output this began to change as we began to apply more gregor mendel and less henry ford plant geneticists like nobel prize winner norman borlaug found that altering plants biologically was even more powerful and efficient than brute force mechanical solutions by altering seeds harvest cycles and climate range mr borlaug and his colleagues launched the green revolution poor farmers in china and india who could never afford a mechanical solution became net exporters using a biological solution over the next decade improvements in energy production will likely come to depend far more on understanding the biology of energy than its chemistry as we grow bugs that like to eat sulfur it will be a lot easier and cheaper to turn heavy crude into sweet crude as we understand the microbial communities that lead to differential pressures in wells we can become far better at extracting oil than by finding one more drilling fluid or learning new ways to fracture wells we have barely begun to scratch the surface todays efforts to use plants to power our suvs are primitive at best plants are not programmed to make gasoline nor are bacteria ethanol is simply a complex and expensive byproduct but then again yesterdays corn and wheat were not programmed to grow fast large and golden that change required biologists the same will be true of todays primitive biofuels last month science magazine reported the first full transplant of dna from one cell to another that is the first step in being able to program cells specifically for energy production on a massive and efficient scale it is the birth of a new and potentially very large industry one comparable in scale to biotechnology long term we might be able to solve the energy crisis by using combinations of solar nuclear and wind but short term of our energy remains hydrocarbons and the key is how to get more from what we have in hand using our rapidly accumulating knowledge of gene and protein data we are beginning to program cells in enclosed environments specifically for energy production and processing this will likely increase energy production and efficiency on a massive scale it could allow developing nations to become energy producers and exporters on a competitive basis by beginning to apply bio knowledge to hydrocarbons we can align economic social security energy climate and political agendas the future of energy is biology whats surprising is it took so long to discover something so obvious mr enriquez is a managing director of excel medical ventures cofounder of synthetic genomics and was the founding director of the harvard business school life science project
