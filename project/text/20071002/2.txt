a tango opera loses its edge cavalleria rusticana pagliacci new york city opera through oct new york the gotham chamber opera missed the point of astor piazzollas "maria de buenos aires" the production presented recently at nyus skirball center had an ingenious concept using a choreographer david parsons to stage the minute poetic and musical meditation on the life death and resurrection of the prostitute maria but it came off like a suburban high schools version of a dark and complex piece "maria" is a tango opera scored for two singers a narrator a chanting chorus and instruments most critically the violin and the bandoneon piazzollas own expressive concertina like instrument horacio ferrers libretto by turns gentle and nightmarishly baroque is a full partner reflecting the sensuality and violence of piazzollas tangos the score requires careful balancing piazzolla saw his sophisticated "nuevo tango" writing as high art removed from the world of popular music and smoke filled tango bars but the roots of "maria" are planted deep in that savage landscape and it is perilous to ignore them gothams production went classical and in doing so lost much of the edgy astringent nature of the score mezzo nicole piccolomini tried to give maria an abandoned quality but she sounded like an opera singer straying uncomfortably off the reservation ricardo herrera who sang the solo mens roles there are three but this production made them one identified as porteno did better his gentle lyricism was well suited to the music the orchestra led by neil goren at the piano sounded under rehearsed its rhythms slack and its tone bland rather than fierce the violin and the bandoneon are almost vocal parts of this score neither was sufficiently assertive david parsons choreography handled the physicality of the tangos nicely using an ensemble as well as individual dancers who shadowed the singing characters yet the production with scenic design by carol bailey costumes by fabio toblini lighting by howell binkley and projections by jerome sirlin was oddly nonspecific and hard to follow except on a most general level gotham dispensed with supertitles so that the audience would concentrate on the music and the dancing as a result those unfamiliar with the piece could have no idea of what was going on beyond a schematic outline in the program all the gritty details and atmosphere a black mass the underworld a choir of psychoanalysts the association of the prostitute with the virgin mary were lost this made the work of the narrator diego arciniegas especially difficult and he compensated with exaggerated delivery that did not really help the non spanish speakers in the audience a much more persuasive experience of the opera is to be had on the teldec recording led by the violinist gidon kremer with tango vocalists in the singing roles and ferrer himself as the narrator it is virtuosic the playing of per arne glovigen on bandoneon and of mr kremer are extraordinary and as a result vital earthy and heartbreaking new york city operas new double bill production of "cavalleria rusticana" and "pagliacci " directed by stephen lawless and designed by ashley martin davis with lighting by wolfgang goebbel did a nice job of connecting this pair of verismo shockers through design the show curtain was a scrim with a painting of a crowd somberly facing the audience with two stoic men and a gesticulating woman in front to open both operas the scrim became transparent and revealed the chorus standing behind it in similar attitudes illustrating the weight of the community censorious in "cavalleria" and hungry for entertainment in "pagliacci" and its effect on personal passions and their tragic results the production also referenced the shabby realism of mid th century italian films so there were s era costumes a belching motor scooter for alfio the itinerant trader now also a cocaine smuggler with some scary enforcers and a row of gas pumps in "cavalleria" and a battered pink trailer for the players troupe in "pagliacci " the updating gave a new immediacy to these stories of infidelity and murder lola in "cavalleria" and nedda in "pagliacci" both objects of desire and catalysts of tragedy were floozy like chewing gum and smoking cigarettes their bright colored clothes set against a monochromatic landscape and their macho suitors paraded around in wife beater undershirts mr lawless kept the directing clear though having the on stage audience applaud the conclusion of the "play" in "pagliacci" after the jealous canio has murdered his wife nedda and her lover during the performance might have taken the concept a bit beyond believability the singers were a mixed group anna maria chiuri making her debut as the rejected santuzza of "cavalleria " sang unevenly her potent mezzo displaying interesting colors but lacking control the star of that opera was tenor brandon jovanovich as santuzzas faithless boyfriend turridu he used his dark tenor and skillful acting to vividly portray an undisciplined fellow driven by lust and easily overcome by alcohol susan nicely was a little wobbly as his mother mamma lucia but the idea of giving her a blond wig and a fashionable outfit rather than the usual italian widow look was brilliant rebecca ringle made a sultry lola andrew oakden who lost energy as alfio in "cavalleria " was more solid as a smarmy tonio in "pagliacci " in another clever directorial touch he came onstage in his alfio costume wiping the knife with which he had stabbed turridu and changed into his tonio clown outfit while singing the prologue carl tanner an imposing blustery canio sang the famous "vesti la giubba" with real ferocity and no sobs maria kanyova was a bright voiced passionate nedda if a little light in timbre acrobats including a trapeze artist and a fire eater also enlivened "pagliacci " conductor george manahan led a vigorous performance and gave the big orchestral preludes and interludes weight and style ms waleson writes about opera for the journal
