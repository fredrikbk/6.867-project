palestinian propaganda coup last month a french court heard an appeals case whose forthcoming verdict will have far reaching ramifications for all who value truth and accuracy in middle east news reporting the case involves philippe karsenty a french journalist and media commentator who was found guilty of defamation after he called for the firing of two france television journalists responsible for the sept news report on the alleged killing of a year old palestinian boy mohammed al dura by the israel defense forces idf it has been seven years since france television broadcast the excruciating footage of mohammed and his father jamal crouching in terror behind a barrel in gazas netzarim junction while according to the report under relentless fire from idf soldiers the second clip which ends with the boy apparently shot dead was presented around the world as an unambiguous case of israeli savagery the tape fanned the flames of what became known as the second intifada the boy mohammed was the iconic martyr his name and face gracing streets parks and postage stamps across the arab world his memory was invoked by osama bin laden in a jihadist screed against america and in the ghastly video of the beheading of american jewish journalist daniel pearl shortly following the al dura incident however a series of inquiries cast grave doubt on the accuracy of the original france report the official idf investigation concluded that based on the position of idf forces vis a vis the duras it was highly improbable if not impossible that an israeli bullet hit the boy research by the atlantic monthly the new republic and commentary magazine concurred then a german documentary revealed inconsistencies and probable manipulations in the account of france s lone journalist on the scene that day palestinian cameraman talal abu rahmeh and yet france refused to release abu rahmehs full minutes of raw footage it did however agree to let three prominent french journalists view the footage all three concluded that it comprised blatantly staged scenes of palestinians being shot by israeli forces and that france s jerusalem bureau chief charles enderlin had lied to conceal that fact subsequently alleging gross malfeasance mr karsenty called for the firings of mr enderlin and france news director arlette chabot but france stood defiant suing mr karsenty for defamation the defamation trial passed almost unnoticed in israel to the apparent detriment of mr karsentys case in his ruling in favor of france judge joel boyer five times cited the absence of any official israeli support for mr karsentys claims as indication of their speciousness israels decision to stay on the sidelines was unfortunate because the truth always matters the al dura incident wasnt the only media report to inflame passions against israel in recent years but it was the one with the highest profile moreover if as mr karsenty and others have claimed persuasively the al dura incident is part of the insidious trend in which western media outlets allow themselves to be manipulated by dishonest and politically motivated sources recall the jenin "massacre" that never was or the doctored reuters photos from israels war against hezbollah in then france must be held accountable it is important to note that the al dura news report profoundly influenced western public opinion when i served in the israeli government as minister of diaspora affairs from to i traveled frequently to north american college campuses i heard first hand how mohammed al dura had shaped the perceptions of young people just beginning to follow events in the middle east for many jewish students the incident was a stain of dishonor that called into question their support for israel for anti israel students the story reaffirmed their sense of zionisms innately "racist" nature and became a tool for recruiting campus peers to the cause to its credit israel has come to recognize that it must play an active role in uncovering the truth the idf recently sent a letter to france demanding the release of talal abu rahmehs minutes of raw footage asserting the implausibility of idf guilt for the death of mohammad al dura and raising the possibility that the entire affair may have been staged tragically there is no way to repair the damage inflicted on israels international image by the france report much less restore the israeli and jewish victims whose lives were exacted as vengeance it is possible however to deter slanderous news reporting and the violence that often accompanies it by setting a precedent for media accountability via the handover of talal abu rahmehs full minutes of raw footage encouragingly the judge presiding over mr karsentys appeal has now requested the tapes france must make a full public disclosure if there is nothing to hide why should it refuse mr sharansky is chairman of the adelson institute for strategic studies at the shalem center in jerusalem see related letter "letters to the editor a lie fanned flames of anti israel hatred" wsj oct
