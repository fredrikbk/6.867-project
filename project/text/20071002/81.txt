not ready for prime time season finale by susanne daniels and cynthia littleton harper pages &# after two fledgling television networks called upn and the wb launched in a pattern began to set in during the spring and fall "upfronts " as the industry refers to the lavish productions where networks try to dazzle advertisers with clips of their new series the wbs presentations were reliably ultra slick affairs touting a slate of shows adorned with beautiful young people guaranteed to transfix tweens teens and twentysomethings and indeed the network established itself in the s as the home of youth zeitgeist programming with such shows as "dawsons creek" and "buffy the vampire slayer " by contrast upn seemed like a network in perpetual identity crisis and its upfront presentations reflected the disarray one season upn would announce that it was targeting young males with action shows the next that it was featuring a "love boat" remake or introducing an array of shows targeted at african americans but when i attended the wbs upfront at madison square garden in may it was clear that the old distinction between the wb and upn had disappeared the wbs forthcoming schedule was an unfocused mess including a detective show starring the grizzled lothario don johnson in an ill advised attempt to expand its audience the wb had sacrificed its core of young adult fans the demographic coveted by advertisers a year later the wb and upn had both vanished from television after having cost their respective corporate owners time warner and viacom tens of millions of dollars they were folded into a new network called the cw the story of how the wb and upn tried and ultimately failed to gain a foothold in the television business is recounted in "season finale " a melancholy tale though leavened with hollywood loopiness by susanne daniels the former president of entertainment at the wb and cynthia littleton deputy editor of news development at variety the story flips back and forth between ms danielss first hand account of the wbs roller coaster existence and ms littletons reportage of upns struggles the result is part memoir part corporate history above all it is a deft depiction of the crazy state of the television business a venture that from the start had too many chiefs with competing interests upn never could sustain any momentum ms littleton has done her homework and demonstrates that what little success upn ever had was usually born out of desperation dean valentine the upn chief executive from to was a university of chicago graduate who collected avant garde art including "a foot papier mache rendition of a can of raid bug spray" that he kept in his office he prided himself on his aesthetic judgment but found himself cutting a deal with the world wrestling federation later world wrestling entertainment for what would become one of upns few hits "wwf smackdown " desperation led to missed opportunities too mr valentine longed to sign up a little show called "survivor" but had to pass on it because despite his lobbying he couldnt squeeze an extra couple of million out of his corporate overseers at viacom instead it was a bigger viacom entity cbs that went on to air the show that altered the television landscape ms littletons depiction of the upn saga offers plenty of colorful touches but it inevitably has a certain journalistic distance from the action that is not the case with ms danielss sections on the wb which offer gossipy details and brim with the passion that the wbs senior management team felt in the networks heady early years but ms danielss closeness to her subject also makes the parts of "season finale" that focus on the wb problematic currently the president of entertainment at lifetime networks she is careful not to offend the higher ups she toiled for at the wb many of whom are still in senior positions in hollywood and could be future employers or business partners still some of ms danielss behind the scenes stories are a hoot when an agent insists that "buffy the vampire slayer" will fail because the lead a then unknown sarah michelle gellar has no star potential ms danielss no jordan levin throws a videocassette at him to his bosss delight the cassette misses the agent leaving a dent in the wall that remains a mark of honor long after "buffy" has become a hit but a self serving note surfaces late in "season finale" when ms daniels suggests that it was only after her exit in "i was ready for a change" that the wb lost its way her opinion of mr levin seems ready for a change too once he is elevated to the top programming slot after her departure what few barbs she offers in the book are directed at him ms daniels would have readers believe that mr levin who lasted two years in the position ran afoul of warner bros executives because of his "penchant for partying " his "taste for the high life and costly executive perks" and his often shoot from the hip style this is hogwash i know mr levin and by tv executive standards where outsize behavior is not only tolerated but in many instances expected he is pretty tame what is more mr levin had showed during most of his decade long rise at the wb that he had a genuine programmers gut for picking shows and he nurtured many of the networks biggest hits including "felicity" and "everwood " the wbs woes are more accurately laid at the feet of time warner which pressured the network to buy more programming from warner bros instead of from outside suppliers and to jettison the teen dream stuff for shows that might interest somebody north of it was a flawed overly ambitious plan at a time when abc cbs nbc and fox were already having a tough enough go of it in the mass audience business when mr levin finally got the reins at the wb as even ms daniels acknowledges budgets were being slashed mercilessly which put him in the position of trying to play major league ball with minor league pitching folks in the entertainment business after checking the index of "season finale" for their own names will recognize it as a cautionary tale of how quickly corporate machinations can derail a network once it becomes clear that profitability is nowhere on the horizon other readers will come away with a better understanding of how the prime time sausage is made and they might well wonder how in a field so beset by egomania log rolling and a lack of business savvy the wb and upn survived as long as they did mr robins the former editor in chief of broadcasting &amp cable magazine has covered the media industry for more than two decades
