silence is golden rule for resumes of people who have broken it joanne jester has an impressive resume it describes her many duties as office manager for cdm ecycling a small baltimore company she also lists prior employers including state use industries from to but theres a catch state use industries was the prison industry arm of marylands correctional system ms jester worked as a telemarketing office assistant there while serving a four year sentence for theft and related charges her resume reveals nothing about her imprisonment ms jester took the right approach according to several career coaches and legal specialists facing huge barriers to re employment former prisoners should craft resumes focused on their marketable skills training work and life experiences not their troubled pasts "you never address the fact that you were incarcerated in your resume " says wendy enelow an author and career consultant in coleman falls va "youre giving them a reason to exclude you " she believes this strategy could apply to anyone with gaps in employment from cancer patients to recovering alcoholics and individuals fired for cause "its not just ex offenders who have challenges returning to work its a problem for lots of people " says ms enelow co author with louise kursmark of "expert resumes for people returning to work " their book offers discreet ways to account for work performed behind bars one sample resume calls the gigs "temporary assignments " although they lasted eight years another identifies the prison employer as "state of california " federal and state institutions released nearly inmates in about more than in the justice department reported hoping to curb recidivism certain states such as maryland prepare prisoners to rejoin the work force long before their release ms jester for instance took office skills courses throughout her incarceration she revised her resume with help from tricia hopkins a transition coordinator who counsels on job hunting the revamped document identified "maryland state department of education" as the training provider it also stated that she "graduated with recommendations" from her final course ms jester says she informed potential employers that she broke the law to survive marriage to an abusive heroin addict you must "sell yourself and be proud of what youve become " she explains "you have to learn to admit your mistakes " she joined cdm as a data entry clerk in december after ms hopkins persuaded the computer recycling company to consider hiring an ex con for the first time other former offenders avoid discussing their crimes with hiring managers thanks to carefully worded resumes and employers limited probes of applicants personal records consider a year old computer technician whom comcast hired soon after he completed a year sentence for reckless endangerment and handgun use last spring the charges arose from his fight with another youth in which a stray bullet seriously hurt a bystander the eighth grade dropout completed community college and earned certification in several building trades during his prison stay he prepared a "functional" resume which emphasizes qualifications and competencies but plays down a job seekers work history in such resumes a section typically labeled "areas of accomplishment" can cite transferable talents such as the ability to communicate well and meet deadlines his functional resume highlights his educational achievements the top portion states that he graduated magna cum laude from his community college next is his long catalog of skills including certifications problem solving ability and a "strong hands on approach to get the job done " but he doesnt mention that he attended college from prison and omits dates for his limited work experience there during his comcast interview the technician says he vaguely alluded to "something in my past " a recruiter for the nations largest cable tv provider replied that he had nothing to worry about if the misdeed occurred more than seven years ago "we conduct background checks as far back as state law permits up to a maximum of years " a comcast spokeswoman says if the check uncovers a conviction she continues officials weigh the nature of the crime evidence of rehabilitation and other factors about of employers in some industries refrain from asking would be staffers about convictions more than seven years ago estimates kevin lindsey an employment lawyer at halleland lewis nilan &amp johnson in minneapolis the growing trend reflects "enlightened self interest in expanding the applicant pool rather than fear of violating a specific state law " he observes what about criminals without meaningful jobs behind bars they could minimize attention to their work force absence by describing the duration of prior positions career consultants suggest for instance a resume might read "gap store manager years " followed by a detailed description of the duties involved "are we fooling anybody no " ms enelow concedes "resumes dont get you jobs they just open doors " e mail me at joann lublin wsj com to see past managing your career columns please go
