putin may keep power as premier post could skirt term limit facing russian president upgrading jobs authority moscow signaling that he could remain russias most powerful politician for years to come vladimir putin said yesterday he might come back as prime minister when his presidential term expires next year the comments are the clearest indication that mr putin who said he has no plans to change the constitution to allow him to run for a third term as president has come up with a mechanism to retain power after presidential elections in march mr putin told a congress of the pro kremlin united russia party that becoming prime minister after his term ends next spring "is an entirely realistic proposal " but he said "its early to think about that " at least until the party wins the december parliamentary elections and a new president is elected "with whom it would be possible to work as a pair " both those conditions are almost certain to be met given mr putins support of united russia and his pledge to endorse a candidate to succeed him since becoming president in mr putin has taken control of russia main national television networks sidelined political opponents and turned the federal assembly into a body that largely rubber stamps his decisions "theres no need for a third term" if mr putin takes over as prime minister said alexei makarkin analyst at the center for political technologies a moscow political consultancy by installing a loyal ally to the presidency mr putin could easily turn the prime ministers job now largely administrative into the center of authority mr makarkin said there isnt any law barring the next president from appointing mr putin as prime minister and united russias parliamentary majority is expected to be sufficient to pass any legal changes needed to upgrade the status of the job some observers said mr putins announcement raises the chances that viktor zubkov the little known bureaucrat whom mr putin named as prime minister last month would get mr putins endorsement for the presidency at and with no independent political base of his own mr zubkov wouldnt likely pose a challenge to mr putin who is and has said he might consider running again for the presidency in "this is just an operation to keep putin in power " said boris nemtsov a former deputy prime minister and leader of the opposition union of right forces party "its clear that they are planning to have a marionette as president zubkov and putin as a strong prime minister " with mr putin as prime minister just whom he endorses to succeed him "means less because putin will remain on the political scene " said sergei markov a political analyst who has frequently worked for the kremlin and recently joined united russia "it will be putin as it always was " mr putin also agreed to take the top spot on the partys electoral list going into the december elections though he wouldnt actually take a seat in the federal assembly where seats are awarded in proportion to a partys share of the vote polls show about half of russians would like mr putin to stay on as president despite the constitutional ban on a third term under mr putin russia has enjoyed eight straight years of economic growth pulling tens of millions out of poverty "the citizens of russia would confirm your status as the national leader for many years to come " said gennady kotelnikov the united russia member who proposed the prime minister post to mr putin in a speech to the carefully choreographed party congress nikolai kovalyov a united russia parliamentary leader told the interfax news agency "mr putin found a wonderful way to both observe the constitution and respect the expectations of probably the majority in our country that he not abandon it " given mr putins plus approval ratings his move practically guarantees a commanding majority in parliament for the united russia party which mr putin helped set up six years ago kremlin officials have talked about united russias role as being similar to that of ruling parties such as japans liberal democratic party which dominated politics for decades critics charge the system is more authoritarian closer to the single party rule seen in latin america through much of the past century investors who have profited hugely from the tenfold increase in the value of russias stock market since mr putin took office have welcomed signs in recent days that he would retain an active role once his term ends but analysts said the systems heavy reliance on one individual underlines the weakness of russias political institutions and highlights the risk of instability in the future
