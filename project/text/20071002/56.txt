in the fray david beckhams injury hurts more than just the soccer star at times following the latest news on english born soccer star david beckham one has been reminded of that great piece of esquire journalism by gay talese "frank sinatra has a cold " so valuable is mr beckham to his new major league soccer club the la galaxy and evidently to american soccer as a whole that his every fluctuation in health has been subject to close media scrutiny normally hardy sports journalists have adopted the tone of solicitous royal physicians when writing about him witness recent headlines "beckham ankle still ailing " "beckham waits on scan " "beckham ankle injury perks up " "tired beckham sits out " and so on the latest news is the most significant yet mr beckham was diagnosed with a sprained right knee suffered in the galaxys aug superliga final loss to pachuca and will be out of action for as long as weeks the rest of the galaxys season make no mistake his injury is indeed disastrous news for the galaxy a nightmare for mls and extreme ill fortune for american soccer to put the matter in perspective one must go back to january of this year when the galaxy signed mr beckham from spanish club real madrid to a blockbuster five year contract estimated by sports illustrated writer grant wahl to be &# million over five years plus to of jersey sales and an undisclosed share of ticket revenues a dazzling coup for the generally conservatively run second rate mls buzz ensued u k magazine world soccer hailed the beckham signing as the sports "biggest deal yet " by implication elevating it above such massive past transfers as zinedine zidanes move from juventus to real madrid and peles move from santos to nasl club cosmos disney photographed mr beckham astride a white horse fighting a fire breathing dragon in a "sleeping beauty" ad campaign an image suggestive of the general feeling that mr beckham would be the messiah of american soccer raising awareness of the game in a land where few know the difference between corner and free kick top soccer journalist paul gardner writing in world soccer magazine threw his weight behind the deal "beckham is the answer it could be that pro soccer in the usa has reached one of the famous tipping points that a major event such as beckham is all that is needed to launch it onwards and giddily upwards he has the looks the glamour the personality " and mls and the galaxy ran with the buzz reportedly selling more than of his no jersey and hyping his arrival "summer beckham comes to america be a part of history " nobody seemed to ask mr beckham whether he could live up to such grand expectations he is years old not yet past his prime but aging in a young mans game having spent more than years as a top footballer at prestigious clubs manchester united of england and real madrid of spain he has been captain of the english national team and has scored memorable goals for his country including a majestic free kick versus greece that secured englands qualification to the world cup nonetheless mr beckham has never been the best player in the world unusual for a winger he lacks the ability to beat defenders with pace and dribbling relying instead on fine passing and deadly accuracy from set pieces to notch assists and goals he is in fact something of a specialist using his mastery of the dead ball to influence the game rather than carving up opposing defenses with dribbling improvisation and quick linking play the dynamic wiles of world class talents like kaka ronaldinho and francesco totti but mr beckhams good looks fashion sense relentless self promoting and high profile marriage to victoria beckham aka "posh spice" have elevated him to icon status mr beckhams american adventure began with high hopes but exhausted after a long season serving both spanish champions real madrid and the english national team he was quickly overused by the galaxy over traveled wearied injured and sidelined in the end mr beckham who will be paid &# million by the galaxy for the first year of his contract played a total of minutes in six summer games for his new club scoring one goal and notching three assists the galaxy thus paid &# per beckham minute &# per assist or &# million per goal illustrating the law of power one must always overspend to attract attention and plaudits so now the fallout from the knee sprain suffered by the worlds most famous soccer player mr beckhams absence will be a blow to the ailing galaxy which is and sitting in place in the western division of mls seemingly without hope of making the playoffs mr beckhams absence will be a headache for clubs around the mls which have sold tickets for future galaxy away games based on mr beckhams presence and will now have to deal with furious fans demanding refunds real salt lake and the kansas city wizards decided not to offer them business will be affected attendance ticket sales merchandising network ratings buzz with no beckham on the field there will be no tom cruise and katie holmes in the stands no los angeles where the hot ticket is to a galaxy game meantime there are disturbing trends in american soccer such promising young talents as carlos bocanegra freddy adu and clint dempsey are going abroad to europe to ply their trade and with the notable exception of mexican player cuauhtemoc blanco the signing of mr beckham has not caused a string of new marquee arrivals to mls its still possible to envision that future america where kids dream of scoring wicked free kick goals at the world cup in the image of their hero david beckham but there are obstacles when mr beckham does return to action he will have to stay healthy and he will have to lift his new club to the top of the league to grab the publics attention again and perhaps more stars will be needed to build on the excitement mr beckham creates still with the midfielder out of action for the rest of this season we may be seeing more of wife victoria beckham who is slated to make an appearance on abcs "ugly betty" this season america is the land of opportunity after all mr barbara writes about sports for the journal
