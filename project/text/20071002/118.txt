with its own profit warning and yet as the financial times notes the banking sector rallied with investors apparently hoping the banks admission of pain meant the worst might be over treating the august market plunges as a nightmare thats fading away investors were betting that "the global credit crunch had passed and with it the threat of recession " the los angeles times says "theres an overriding feeling that we will keep the problems in the credit markets and the residential real estate sector from spilling over to the broader economy " art hogan chief market analyst at brokerage jefferies tells the paper the new york times also credits the banking giants divulgence of "their problems which began in the mortgage lending business and led to a summer of wild stock market swings

respond to the outlook for weakening growth in the wider economy and the outlook for inflation or to use the cliche main street rather than wall street the whopping half point reduction in their benchmark rate lowering the cost of borrowed money wasnt aimed at bolstering the banks or the markets which were sharing the pain of the housing market rather the fed seemed to be responding to fears that the housing downturn including a lack of home equity available to consumers who want to spend was causing much more than a momentary liquidity problem the half point cut did indeed pump liquidity into the banking system as the journal notes creating more available money than the credit markets can use at once and that too seems responsible for the current market run up but the fed seemed to be looking out for economic problems that arent yet obvious and fed policy makers have shown a lot more uncertainty about whats coming than investors seemed to do yesterday musharraf names army successor

keeping the shootings quiet " the threat of remote control toys among the failures attributed to the u s intelligence community ahead of was what some critics saw as a systemic inability to think

checkpoints the transportation security administration yesterday stepped up its scrutiny of such toys citing "credible specific information " the new york times reports earlier this week federal authorities arrested a college student who made a youtube video showing how to use remote control toys as detonators and kip hawley the assistant secretary at the department of homeland security in charge of aviation security says tightened vigilance isnt motivated by a specific terror plot but by a realization in the u s and abroad that such devices can be used to detonate a bomb "a lot of that

should take direct action on it " also of note new york times the deadly attack on an african union peacekeeping base by rebels in darfur over the weekend brought the credibility of the rebel forces
