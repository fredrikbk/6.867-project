japans auto makers get subsidy via weak yen your sept editorial "auto epiphany" about the plight of the american auto industry disregarded the weak yen as a non problem made up by protectionists in congress i have voted for every free trade agreement that has come before me during my years in congress but the japanese governments policy of maintaining a weak yen is a real issue that deserves scrutiny since the japanese government has intervened repeatedly in currency markets to artificially devalue the yen by upward of as a result toyota and the other japanese automakers receive a &# to &# subsidy on every vehicle they export to the u s japans currency manipulation is fueling the market share gains of toyota honda and nissan in the u s and putting downward pressure on uaw wages and benefits as long standing proponents of free and open financial markets this is not something the journal should celebrate in editorials especially since the profit edge toyota has over the big three is roughly &# per vehicle or about the same edge it derives from the yen subsidized toyota prius the unfair yen subsidy is particularly egregious considering that toyota will earn of its profits this year in the u s while gm ford and chrysler will sell less than vehicles in japan rep joe knollenberg r mich washington
