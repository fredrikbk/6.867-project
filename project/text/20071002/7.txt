attention shoppers global scramble for goods gives corporate buyers a lift purchasing managers are prized commodity mr wards tire hunt lyon france once lowly bureaucrats purchasing managers are shifting onto the front lines robert ward is one of them he is in charge of purchasing for manitowoc co one of the worlds biggest crane makers his job is to ensure an unbroken flow of parts and materials from around the globe hunting industrial tires in china and scouring the midwest for giant bearings and he has broad discretion over manitowocs operations to make sure critical supplies arent held up "buyers are the ones with the checkbook and theres a huge power in that " says mr ward recently he was in france agitated and meeting with two polish suppliers who werent delivering all of the metal chassis they had promised to manitowocs big crane factory in germany no chassis mean no cranes the president of one of the suppliers who had just driven hours from poland to meet with mr ward and other managers announced unexpectedly that deliveries could actually slow further in coming months "i have a lot of angry customers because i have not been able to deliver cranes " said mr ward gazing at the pole over the top of his half glasses his interpreter began translating then stopped and asked "did you say angry or hungry " "both " snapped mr ward mr ward is one of a new breed of purchasing gurus who have become a hot commodity in recent years as more companies globalize and outsource production they need a top level point person who can manage these complex relationships navigate various foreign cultures and be willing to travel constantly purchasing offices were once corporate backwaters filled with people who didnt dream of advancing to the top rungs of their organizations many buyers saw themselves as industrial bureaucrats filing purchase orders with the same short list of familiar mostly nearby suppliers when possible they avoided the complex process of assessing potential new suppliers especially those overseas top buyers today need different skills and often have higher aspirations sometimes theyre engineers or others with operating experience that gives them more intimate knowledge of how their companys products are made tim kelly for instance is now chief operating officer at sermatech international co in pottstown pa a maker of industrial coatings he got his start in manufacturing at general motors corp and eventually worked his way into purchasing at gm and elsewhere mr kellys approach is iconoclastic he often moves buyers out onto the shop floor where parts are being used so they get a first hand sense of what is important to the people who use those items or assigns them to suppliers to help the suppliers improve their own processes and thereby reduce costs "when were sourcing a part we want to know the process of making it as well or better than the person were going to see " he says alcoa inc international business machines corp and sara lee corp have all created chief purchasing officer positions often reporting directly to the chief executive or chief operating officers todays transformation in buying was made possible by a technological breakthrough more than a decade ago when companies began installing computer systems that record their every transaction this often revealed startling weaknesses for instance many companies found that different divisions or even different offices down the hall from one another were sometimes paying different prices for the same product bought from outside suppliers purchasing managers play a role as highly effective cost cutters though that part of their job has some surprising nuance to be sure buyers save companies huge amounts by trolling the world for new lower cost sources and this is certainly a big reason for their growing stature at many multinationals but in an era of scarce commodities and the risks of disruptions to supply lines posed by terrorist attacks or striking dockworkers they also have to make sure they pick dependable sources which might mean choosing the more expensive source just to assure no disruptions nothing is worse for a buyers reputation than throwing business to a low ball supplier who then has trouble delivering mr ward has had his share of problems for example he has been working recently with a new supplier in china to develop it as a low cost alternative for a u s made part used in manitowocs refrigeration equipment called a "copper accumulator " "the supplier told us he was ul qualified " says mr ward referring to the underwriters laboratories certification that is often required on manufactured goods manitowoc did its own due diligence conducting engineering and quality studies of samples sent by the chinese outfit and visiting the suppliers factory in china but on a recent trip the supplier admitted to mr ward he wasnt ul approved after all "so now were back to square one " in another case he thought he had found a good low cost chinese supplier for the electric horns used on cranes horns are a very basic item and finding a cheaper source than the companys current u s supplier seemed like it would be a no brainer he says but he has tested two shipments of samples thus far and the horns keep failing manitowocs quality tests "this is another case where the project has to start all over again well go out to a list of suppliers and see who was next best on the list " he says "this has gone on for six or seven months and i hate to think about what it cost us in engineering time testing " mr ward says he wound up in purchasing almost by accident his first job out of college as a management trainee at mobil oil corp involved some aspects of purchasing he then worked in purchasing at a series of defense contractors including the big bath iron works shipyard in maine and most recently at spx corp a maker of industrial gear based in charlotte n c along the way he spent years in the marine reserves "being in the military teaches you a heck of a lot about how to get the right stuff to the right place so you can do your business " says mr ward who served as a company commander in the first gulf war before mr ward came to manitowoc the company had purchasing bosses for each of its three divisions refrigeration equipment shipbuilding and cranes but nobody responsible for the overall strategic direction of their buying buying small lots of materials for myriad divisions of the company meant missing out on the leverage it could have gained with large purchases meaning it wasnt getting the best prices or service as the company began outsourcing more of its parts from all over the world it realized it needed someone in charge of buying who could roam the companys facilities in countries trouble shoot the most daunting problems and help train buyers in the various locations on how to do strategic buying "the thing you have to realize is that if youre going to buy so much from outside the company youd better be very good at it " says glen tellock manitowocs chief executive noting that in the crane business alone the percentage of the total cost of products made up of outsourced components has doubled to in the past decade "if youre not good at buying in todays world its a big competitive disadvantage " mr tellock says its crucial to have someone like mr ward who reports to him guiding the system and it helps he adds that he comes from outside the company and the industry since he brings new ideas that was critical because the crane business is manitowocs most global and also the one that has faced the biggest problems with suppliers with a global construction and infrastructure boom under way manitowoc with annual sales of about &# billion has been rushing to expand output recently though the pace of this buildup has been slowed because of a bottleneck in europe mr ward has to break it his recent trip to the companys european headquarters nestled in a leafy suburb of the french city of lyon was prompted in large part by continuing delays in deliveries of key chassis parts to its german factory from suppliers in poland the parts are built to manitowocs precise specifications and cant be easily bought somewhere else sitting in a conference room with a half dozen of manitowocs europe based purchasing managers and one of the polish chassis suppliers mr ward listened as they aired their respective frustrations andrzej lewandowski president of the polish company gliwice based zaklady mechaniczne bumar labedy sa complained that the manitowoc people werent telling him far enough in advance which parts manitowocs german plant needed on a weekly basis as a result he sent other parts that werent the ones expected on the production line mr ward turned to his buying colleagues and forged a plan one of manitowocs top european managers was going to germany the next day and agreed to buttonhole the manager at the german plant who was responsible for visiting polish suppliers every week he would instruct the manager to communicate better with his polish suppliers or someone else would get the task but even if the communication problem is fixed mr ward knows its not going to solve a more fundamental problem the polish supplier cant get enough steel to make the chassis mr lewandowski told the group that a steel mill in scandinavia that supplies much of the metal is behind on shipments and the mill is actually planning substantial temporary cutbacks in what theyll be shipping in the fourth quarter moreover his own polish plant a former tank factory is struggling with a growing labor shortage since the start of the year when western european countries made it easier for polish workers to migrate in for jobs theres been an exodus of skilled workers from factories in poland mr ward listened politely but could do little about the countrys labor problems and sensed it is a pretext for trying to get more money from manitowoc mr wards meeting with the other polish supplier didnt go much better piotr majcherczyk president of the other supplier also said he isnt getting enough steel in addition he demanded a price increase to keep his workers from migrating west mr ward said he would entertain a price increase if the supplier not only guaranteed shipments but could also expand capacity mr ward also promised his suppliers he would help with their steel shortage but said it would take time he has already visited with one big european steel mill aiming to use the huge steel purchases manitowoc makes across all its divisions as leverage mr ward has been through this situation before and finds that power is constantly shifting from buyers to sellers and back again last year it was tires manitowocs factories kept running short of the large sizes of tires used on mobile cranes but no matter how many times mr ward pressed his longtime suppliers they refused to produce more for him so he called an outside consulting firm which sent him a list of tire factories from brazil to bulgaria that could potentially make the tires he eventually found one in china "and now wouldnt you know it my old tire suppliers are saying they can make more for me after all " says mr ward "its amazing what a little competition can do " as for poland manitowoc has hired a consultant to go into one of the polish factories to help them streamline their systems hopefully allowing them to increase output without adding more workers or machines in the meantime mr ward is looking around the world for stocks of steel plate held by distributors that might be snapped up and diverted to eastern europe for use in those polish plants "were out scavenging to make up for some of what we need " he says its more expensive than buying the steel directly from the mills he says but in his business the gauge of success is keeping supplies flowing
