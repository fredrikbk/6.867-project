for ubs and citi its crunch time a vote of confidence for ceo charles prince in year of no excuses under pressure from critics citigroup inc chief executive officer charles prince had been calling a "year of no excuses " but when citigroup announced yesterday that third quarter earnings would fall from a year earlier the company offered a laundry list of reasons from the turmoil in global markets to consumer credit woes the news prompted new cries for mr princes resignation yet mr prince kept the support of his companys biggest individual shareholder saudi prince alwaleed bin talal "no financial institution is immune from the financial turmoil in global markets " said prince alwaleed "its a hiccup in our journey to reach normalization at citibank " the prince has been tough on citigroups ceo in the past last year he took mr prince to task for the companys stagnant stock price telling barrons that citigroup had "run out of excuses " "this was obviously a very disappointing quarter for us " mr prince said in a recorded message made available by the company "i know we can do much better " the bank reported net income of &# billion or &# a share in the third quarter of in p m new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday citigroup shares rose &# or to &# as investors hoped the worst of the credit market woes may be past although other wall street firms have also suffered from an august rout in credit markets that sent investors to the sidelines the situation is taking a particularly big toll on citigroup the nations largest financial institution based on assets and market value has been struggling to show a consistent rebound in its core businesses as it battles bloated costs and sluggish growth in its core capital markets and consumer operations the anticipated earnings shortfall which was larger than had been expected by analysts and observers drew a fresh round of criticism and calls for change earlier this year a number of investors suggested that citigroup could create more shareholder value by breaking into pieces "the plan that mr prince came up with sounded good and it looked good on paper but its not playing out i think he has had his run and we need a new plan " said steve scruggs a portfolio manager at bragg financial advisors inc the charlotte n c money management firm owns about shares of citigroup that view was echoed by banking analyst michael mayo who previously had stopped short of suggesting that mr prince give up his post "i have gone from thinking that maybe there should be changes in management to thinking there should be a change in the ceo at citigroup " said mr mayo an analyst at deutsche bank but the saudi prince who frequently declines to comment on citigroup said he continues to back mr prince "im backing the management of citi and chuck prince they have my full support " he said in a telephone interview the citigroup ceo called him yesterday to discuss the developments he said and they also met in paris last month along with chief financial officer gary crittenden mr prince also continues to receive backing from citigroups board of directors according to a person familiar with the boards thinking "they are supportive of chuck and the strategy " this person said mr prince wasnt available for comment citigroup said the hit to earnings includes a &# billion write down in the value of loans that helped finance the leveraged buyout boom and &# billion tied to loans and subprime mortgages that were to be repackaged and sold to investors as collateralized loan obligations the bank also expects to post &# million in trading losses lastly the bank said credit costs in its global consumer business would increase by &# billion citigroup attributed the bulk of that to significant additions to its loan loss reserves against future losses a quarter of the total reflects rising costs of soured loans in key consumer businesses such as mortgages and credit cards like other firms citigroup has found itself saddled with a slew of loans that it had expected to sell off to other investors the banks massive balance sheet it has &# trillion in assets can easily absorb the hit without creating a threat to its financial well being however the situation has called into question citigroups ability to manage its risk appropriately last month for example goldman sachs group inc reported unexpectedly strong results despite the market unrest in part because of savvy bets that the value of home loans and related securities would fall "while we expect that citigroups peers also had difficult quarters and will be pressured by asset mark downs and increased credit costs we suspect the magnitude of losses may be more a citi specific event " jeff harte an analyst at sandler oneill &amp partners said in a research report citigroup moved up its third quarter earnings report to oct from oct j p morgan chase &amp co which competes with citigroup is slated to report earnings on oct despite the bad news mr prince sought to assure investors that the bank is still making progress in other areas "our growth strategy continues to generate momentum " he said see related article
