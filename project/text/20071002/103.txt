seeing opportunity in mpeg the migration of broadcasters and cable providers to a new method of video encoding creates a short and long term opportunity for the makers of television set top boxes broadcasters are increasingly moving to a standard known as mpeg which compresses video into smaller files allowing more high definition channels to be sent at the same time satellite and telecommunications companies are better prepared for the switch while most cable companies have to upgrade their equipment in the short term cable companies can add a device made by either of the top set top box makers motorola inc and cisco systems inc s scientific atlanta to convert mpeg to the older mpeg format experts project that to be a &# million market "the infrastructure is preparing to accommodate mpeg when the cable providers decide to upgrade " said james mcquivey an analyst at forrester research in the long term to fully appreciate the benefits of mpeg cable will have to replace the set top box for each subscriber given the boxes lengthy lifecycle this could take years meanwhile because europe is further along with this process than the u s overseas set top box makers may see this shift as an opportunity to break motorolas and scientific atlantas stranglehold on the domestic market broadcasters offering network shows or sports leagues have traditionally taken their video and uploaded it via satellite to the central offices of the cable companies the satellite tv players and more recently the telecommunications companies with consumer demand for high definition channels rising broadcasters such as time warner inc s hbo are moving toward mpeg to stream more feeds at once an mpeg stream takes up roughly half the bandwidth that the older mpeg stream does so broadcasters can transmit more streams at once that is important as the different content providers scramble to get ahead of one another in the high definition race satellite companies and at&amp t inc already deal with mpeg encoding but motorola and cisco are making sure the cable companies are ready for the standard last week motorola unveiled its dsr box which can take mpeg signals and convert them into mpeg used by the cable companies by having the device sit in the central office the cable companies wouldnt have to replace every cable set top box in their customers homes "it allows for single format distribution " said mark schaffer director of product marketing for motorola "theres a lot of interest from programmers " scientific atlanta meanwhile is preparing its own device which essentially does the same thing its d which can turn mpeg signals into the mpeg format and turn high definition streams into standard definition ones is expected to come out early next year brian morris head of the americas region for scientific atlantas digital media networks group said the market for these devices is potentially worth more than &# million but it isnt expected to take off until early next year mpeg compression involves a series of "tricks" that fool the human eye into thinking it is seeing a complete video file despite eliminating a large chunk of the stream one technique involves eliminating a lot of static images in the background and reusing the image from the initial frame in subsequent scenes video runs at to frames a second so the human brain cant pick up on the changes another trick involves computations that scan for blocky images and smoothes them out bob wilson who ran mpeg encoding company modulus video inc before it was acquired by motorola said its software can distinguish between different programs such as basketball and football games and use algorithms specifically geared for each "we have a very rich set of tools that allow us to significantly reduce the bits we need " said mr wilson who runs the mpeg operations at motorola "we dont just look at a whole picture we look at pixels inside of pictures " in compressing and decompressing files the key is to maintain the quality of the video "its something were concerned about and working on " scientific atlantas mr morris said "we have proprietary techniques to ensure quality levels at the conversion level are extremely good " mr morris added that the company had filed for several patents on technology that would ensure a smooth video conversion process "if you do the conversion and you dont get the right quality level the model doesnt work " he said u s cable companies are slow to move toward the mpeg standard because it would require replacing all of the existing set top boxes which run on mpeg "a wholesale swap out is not a practical alternative " said ralph brown chief technology officer of cablelabs a research and development group for the cable industry "you cant flip the switch overnight and replace tens of thousands of boxes " as more consumers go to an on demand model of viewing television where different streams of movies or shows get sent to individual households the cable companies will start feeling the pressure to replace older set top boxes with ones that use the mpeg format to ease the burden on their network but the transition will last many years mr brown said even though the lifecycle for set top boxes has shortened with new technology the boxes still last for years the slow migration in the u s contrasts with europe where cable companies are more aggressively embracing the mpeg format set top box makers such as frances thomson and the united kingdoms amino technologies plc are gaining more experience in the technology than their u s counterparts mr mcquivey said while there is a chance that the international set top box makers can breach into the u s scientific atlanta and motorola essentially own the market here the analyst said
