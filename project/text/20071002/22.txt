such practices as encoding customer data on the magnetic stripes of credit cards which are vulnerable to attack while the standards have been around for several years the payment card industry began more aggressively pushing companies toward compliance late last year in december visa usa inc announced a "compliance acceleration program" under which it would start fining the banks of the biggest
