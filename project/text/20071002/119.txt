the queerest denial the islamic republic of iran has been doing a brisk business in harassing entrapping lashing imprisoning and executing homosexuals since nearly the moment it came to power in with little notice in the west beyond the occasional human rights report so when mahmoud ahmadinejad made the startling claim at columbia university last week that "we do not have homosexuals in iran like you do in your country " it offered what could have been a learning opportunity to those who think iran is just another misunderstood regime with an equally misunderstood president such wishful thinking the democratic partys presidential hopefuls spent a fair bit of time wednesday night debating what to do about iran without once mentioning ahmadinejads peculiar world view these are the same debaters who in august went before a gay audience to denounce bush administration policies as "demeaning" and "degrading" toward gays in the nation a magazine that excoriated ronald reagan upon his passing for his "inaction and bigotry against gays" editor katrina vanden heuvel has nothing to say about the subject either instead she devotes her latest column to denouncing last weeks symbolic senate vote to designate irans revolutionary guards corps as a terrorist organization in the guardian another crusading voice from the left on gay rights foreign affairs columnist martin woollacott lambastes columbias president lee bollinger for his "mean spirited" remarks to the iranian president which he takes as an indication that "it is still difficult to suggest that iran has arguments and interests worth considering on their merits " but again no mention of mr ahmadinejads attitude toward gays much less its "merits " and on "progressive" web sites like democratic underground there are earnest debates about exactly what mr ahmadinejad meant by the word "like " as if he were merely making an academic cultural comparison rather than denying the existence of an entire category of his own citizens long gone are the days when people spoke of the love that dare not speak its name we are now living in the era of the hate that dare not be spoken about lest disingenuous neocons use mr ahmadinejads unfortunate pronouncements to cut off dialogue and beat the drums for war but if one side of the political spectrum is not to be trusted to discuss the subject and the other side simply wont who will for that turn to a revealing and moving documentary by indian born journalist parvez sharma called "a jihad for love " which he describes as a "discussion about islam through its most unlikely storytellers " mr sharma who is very far from being a conservative of any kind spent six years filming his subjects on four continents they include a gay imam in south africa a lesbian couple in istanbul an egyptian who spent a year in prison for being gay before fleeing to paris and four young men who fled iran for their lives and now live as political refugees in canada the documentary is notable for its depiction of the tenacity with which its subjects hold on to their faith despite the wall of bigotry often homicidal that confronts them nowhere is that seen more vividly than in the plight of the iranians take arsham parsi a subject of mr sharmas who now runs the iranian queer organization irqo net from toronto in he says in a phone interview "two of my close friends committed suicide because of the bad situation for queer people " their deaths galvanized him to begin a gay and lesbian support group conducted furtively and electronically consisting largely of articles on gay related subjects from english language sources the enterprise grew to include six separate electronic magazines "we used to think we were alone in the world " mr parsi says "with these magazines we knew we were not " in fact homosexuality has a particularly rich history in iran the qajar dynastys nasseruddin shah a contemporary of queen victoria and ruler of iran for nearly years took a kurdish boy named malijak as his lifelong lover it is hardly less present in contemporary iran not just in the parks of tehran but the seminaries of qom but mr parsis activism put him at particular risk "the police use the internet to make undercover arrests " he says "theyll write to say i am looking for a partner entrap someone and use their correspondence as evidence " that was the fate of friends of mr parsi who in were sentenced to lashes in the space of an hour and it would have been his too had he not fled iran on word he was about to be arrested from toronto mr parsi works on asylum cases and continues to publish a newsletter called cheraq "light" which reaches about readers in iran yesterday it published a selection of letters to mr ahmadinejad by gay iranians "i pray that some false note in the divine composition has you fathering a gay offspring so that the hammer that youve raised over our heads comes down on your very own " writes one "i recommend you partake in the first iranian gay pride parade so you can see for yourself that it will be more glorious and more populated than your quds day or annual revolution commemoration day parades " writes another adding that a gay parade would be attended voluntarily in contrast to "a bunch of schoolchildren and innocent peasants who have been forced to show up to punch the world oppressors in the mouth " all of this ought to be evidence that when it comes to the iranian regime the gap between bad neocons and pure of heart progressives ought to be no more than tactical this is ultimately a regime that needs to go not so mr sharma for instance rails in the huffington post against the "the good vs evil caricature" that he says prevails in western attitudes toward iran mr sharma is a gifted filmmaker but his politics remind me of the socratic observation that poets are poor judges of their own work or how else is one supposed to view the scene he captures of mr parsi at last arriving in toronto and weeping both for the freedom he has gained and his friends still trapped in islamist captivity is it a testament that there is no meaningful difference between free and unfree bushworld and ahmadinejadland take that view seriously and you wind up taking the notion of gay rights and human rights too lightly for anyones good
