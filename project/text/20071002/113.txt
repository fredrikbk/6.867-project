the elected and the electors in corporate board governance in her commentary "corporations shouldnt be democracies" editorial page sept lynn stout writes that "by giving activists even greater leverage over boards the secs proposed proxy access rule will undermine american corporations ability to do exactly what investors and the larger society want them to do pursue big long term innovative business projects " she omits the corporations duty to their shareholders to pursue lawful profit maximizing activities and strategies she neglects to mention that the many innovations she applauds in the corporate world were the result of students and business people working out of their garages bill gates and steve ballmer microsoft succeeded in software development because ibm with all its resources planning and capital sat on the sidelines pursuing its larger projects while we must not make it easier for shareholders to extort money from corporations or have corporations assume the duties of government we should not forget that the corporate board does not have an exclusive on innovative business products services and delivery systems better to focus on freedom to innovate wherever it occurs than to attribute exaggerated roles for boards that many have yet to exhibit by implementing truly innovation business solutions david laufer ventura county calif mr laufer was elected to a public companys board served on its audit and compensation committees and later was elected as its vice president and general counsel lynn a stout is so right but there is a deeper reason why she is the people who demand a say because they are "shareholders " in directing the management "agents" are usually not shareholders at all they are themselves hired help the managers of various kinds of institutional funds they are also agents bearing their own load of self interested agendas and agency conflicts as prof stout says the political metaphor of "democracy" doesnt apply to corporations when we realize that cries for "shareholder democracy" are claims not from shareholders but from a competing set of agents we can understand how completely nonsensical the political metaphor is the celebrated ideas of adolph berle and gardner means "the modern corporation and private property" are out of date what we have in the st century for large corporations is "agency capitalism " our theories and ways of speaking need to be re worked to address this fact alex j pollock resident fellow american enterprise institute washington prof stouts argument is built on the false premise that the size of a corporation is testament to its success and that the fact that a high number of the worlds largest corporations are located in the u s proves the quality of its corporate law japan is cited as an example of success in corporate law because it is second behind america on this list of top companies but it is well known that japans keiretsu style of corporate structure where giant corporate conglomerates inhibit capitalist creative destruction by shielding members of the family from bankruptcy have been historically dubious in their record of creating shareholder value russia meanwhile is building a behemoth in gazprom but is this an example of good political or corporate governance im not sure whether corporate governance should be democratic but i am sure the correct metric for prof stouts analysis should be historical creation of shareholder value not size solomon moshkevich boston the "proxy access" proposal under review by the sec described by prof stout is far from the jacobin overthrow of american corporate governance that she paints it to be the proposal would only clarify shareholder proxy rights that are currently inconsistent and some cases would even counter shareholder access for example corporations could ban votes on proxy advisory proposals under the new rules but votes on mandatory changes to bylaws could still proceed confusingly shareholders would no longer be free to suggest but would instead have to demand prof stout is correct in saying that corporate america is not and should not be a democracy however it is a republic with the board of directors as the shareholders voice any sec rule that would weaken this link between the electors and the elected weakens the legitimacy of american corporate governance ralph d ward publisher boardroom insider magazine riverdale mich see related letter "letters to the editor corporate board overview" wsj oct
