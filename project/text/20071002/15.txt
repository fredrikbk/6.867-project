wake of a shooting incident in iraq a congressional report cataloged a long list of incidents involving the security contractors use of force while protecting u s diplomats the actions came on the eve of a congressional hearing set for today to examine blackwaters tactics which critics increasingly have characterized as overly aggressive the fbi said it was joining the investigation at the request of the state department and would be sending a team to iraq to assist in the investigations of a sept shooting that left iraqi citizens dead yesterday house oversight and government reform committee chairman henry waxman d calif released details on dozens of shootings involving blackwater based in moyock n c and the efforts by state department officials to deal with political fallout from those incidents the committee also highlighted an exponential growth in government payments to blackwater totaling almost &# billion for providing diplomatic security according to the report the companys guards have been involved in shootings since or roughly shootings each week in more than of the cases blackwaters guards fired first sometimes with deadly consequences for bystanders the committees investigators said the report says that blackwater has said the incidents involve iraqi casualties during the hearing erik prince blackwaters founder and the chairman of its parent company the prince group is expected to answer questions about the companys activities in iraq during his testimony the blackwater founder is expected to endorse increased oversight of security contractors "blackwater believes that more can and should be done to increase accountability oversight and transparency " according to a copy of mr princes testimony reviewed by the wall street journal blackwater said in an emailed statement last night that it "conducted over protective missions in baghdad alone since june with weapons being discharged in approximately of all missions " the committees report noted that blackwater dismissed employees over the past three years for problems ranging from misusing weapons alcohol and drug violations inappropriate conduct and violent behavior the report says that of the dismissals involved weapons related incidents while involved "aggressive violent behavior " the company currently has about employees in iraq according to blackwaters statement the companys actions regarding those employees demonstrates that it "enforces high standards discipline accountability and proper contract oversight " the bush administration has become increasingly reliant on contractors to provide security in iraqs most dangerous zones dyncorp international and triple canopy inc also perform similar security work the report noted that blackwater "has the highest incidence of shooting first although all three companies shoot first in more than half of all escalation of forces incidents " the companys contract with the state department allows it to fire only in situations of self defense the committee said "in the vast majority of instances in which blackwater fired shots blackwater is firing from a moving vehicle and does not remain at the scene to determine if the shots resulted in casualties " according to the report blackwater has maintained that it did nothing wrong in connection with the sept shooting incident although some iraqi officials have said it was unprovoked at least iraqi citizens were killed during a gunfight that erupted while the blackwater team was evacuating a u s diplomat after a car bomb exploded near a building where a meeting was being held in the wake of the incident blackwaters aggressive style of providing security to u s diplomats has come under scrutiny the committee is looking at how often blackwaters guards shoot and why given the defensive nature of their work protecting diplomats as specified in their contracts with the state department on dec a blackwater employee who had been drinking killed one of the iraqi vice presidents guards the employee was allowed to leave iraq and no longer works for blackwater according to an email the morning after that incident a copy of which was reviewed by the journal state department officials appear to have been worried that the dec shooting could prompt a wider backlash against blackwater in the email a department official in baghdad asked another official to press blackwater for "sizeable compensation" for the family of the iraqi guard killed the official wrote "if we are to avoid this whole thing becoming even worse i think a prompt pledge and apology even if they want to claim it was accidental would be the best way to assure the iraqis dont take steps such as telling blackwater that they are no longer able to work in iraq " another state department official in response to the email reported cautioning department officials against too large a payment to the family of the deceased iraqi guard the official a special agent in the departments security arm said figures discussed ranging from &# to &# were "crazy sums " adding "i of course think that a sum this high will set a terrible precedent this could cause incidents with people trying to get killed by our guys to financially guarantee their familys future " the department and blackwater later decided on &# in compensation blackwater officials were closely monitoring the aftermath of the shooting a blackwater official appeared relieved that initial news reports of the shooting pinned the blame on the u s military instead of blackwater three days after the shooting a blackwater official sent an email to a supervisor with a transcript of a report carried on a regional television channel that said "a drunken u s soldier" had killed the bodyguard in the email a copy of which was reviewed by the journal the official noted "thought you might want to see this at least the id of the shooter will take the heat off us " in another incident involving the death of an iraqi civilian the state department requested a smaller &# payment to "put this unfortunate matter behind us quickly " according to the committees report the committees report tallies the exponential growth in blackwaters federal contracting business in recent years in blackwater received just under &# million for its services from the u s government according to the committee the companys u s government contracts rose to about &# million in and have been rising dramatically each year since the total tally according to the report tops &# billion the report said the state department is being charged &#
