eyes on the road good news bad news on fuel economy trends looking for some bedtime reading i have just the thing "light duty automotive technology and fuel economy trends " when congress returns to the subject of climate change energy security and automotive fuel efficiency reading the annual environmental protection agency survey of the state of automotive technology and energy efficiency will make you a smarter judge of the preaching and posturing to come bear with the dry prose and you will get a fascinating study of americas character we really are the "bigger is better" nation we are in love with speed size and power it isnt just a hollywood or madison avenue image our cars give us away compared with the average weight of the vehicle we drive has risen by pounds or the average time it takes for a vehicle to go from zero to miles an hour has dropped to seconds the fastest since the epa started compiling this data in our average car or truck has horsepower and the most horsepower per pound on record there is some good news the year decline in the average fuel efficiency of americas new car fleet that began in appears to have stopped the epa forecasts that the average fuel economy of model cars and trucks will be miles a gallon the same as and slightly better than mpg measured for that would make three straight years when the new vehicle fleets fuel economy was no worse or slightly better than it was in the coming energy debate will be portrayed as greens versus detroit but in this case "detroit" is just about all the major car makers since only one major automotive group in the u s has increased its overall average fuel economy toyota motor corp and not by much all the big auto makers are down compared with true the detroit three have the lowest average fuel economy scores among the eight major automotive groups honda motor co is the overall best daimlerchrysler now chrysler llc is the worst my favorite part of this report is toward the end where the epa experts imagine what the fuel efficiency of our vehicle fleet would be if cars and trucks had stayed the same weight and size as in or if cars were as light on average as cars our national average car fuel economy according to the unadjusted epa lab figures would be better than current reality if model trucks were the same weight as the average for their fuel efficiency rating would be better who brought this about look in the mirror we bought cars and trucks that were safer and more luxurious and more powerful that tended to make them heavier which in turn increased our demand for power "all other factors being equal higher vehicle weight which supports new options and features and faster acceleration performance e g lower to mile per hour acceleration time both decrease a vehicles fuel economy " the epa authors write michigan rep john dingell a longtime friend of the auto industry in congress recently proposed a bill that would raise the tax on gasoline but not diesel fuel by cents a gallon put a &# a ton tax on carbon and eliminate the mortgage interest deduction for mcmansions larger than square feet mr dingells bill cuts a wide swath in part because cars and trucks contribute of all u s carbon dioxide emissions according to the epa mr dingell calls attention to the other its pretty likely this bill will go nowhere but mr dingell already has made his point if you want people to change their behavior you have to make it worth their while or knock them on the head or both preaching alone wont do it
