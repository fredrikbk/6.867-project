human due diligence someone may soon buy the european bank giant abn amro holdings the royal bank of scotland and barclays are each offering more than &# billion and investors are waiting to see if a sale goes through but if the past is a guide markets will focus on assets portfolios and business synergies and overlook a key to whether the deal is successful people people issues are often the root of failed deals our research shows that is because they are frequently an afterthought in the frenzy of a deal dealmakers gather reams of financial commercial and operational data but they often pay scant attention to what we call human due diligence understanding the culture of an organization the roles that individuals play and the capabilities and attitudes of its people when the human factor takes a back seat post merger problems quickly pile up managers are forced to postpone decisions or are blocked from making them differing management styles frequently lead to infighting talent exits integration stalls investors grow impatient in some of the most successful deals theres a flip side rigorous human due diligence helps acquirers get off to a running start having done their homework the new bosses can uncover capability gaps as well as defuse points of friction and differences in decision making most important when critical people decisions are made right away who stays who goes who runs the combined business an acquired business is much more likely to succeed this benefit is borne out in research we conducted among managers involved in recent merger and acquisition m&amp a deals in deals classified as "successful " nearly every acquirer identified key employees for retention during due diligence or within days after the announcement this task was carried out in only one third of the unsuccessful deals dealmakers thus need early answers to some key questions whats the thesis for the deal the rationale for doing it in the first place which individuals are critical to making it happen what organizational structure will best support it and whose culture should predominate once answered human due diligence can then determine how well the targets current structure and culture will mesh which top executives should be retained and how to manage the reaction of the rank and file for example when cargill crop nutrition acquired imc global in to form the mosaic company a global leader in the fertilizer business the cargill team quickly saw that the two companies organizations had similar structures that both functioned well they decided the new company would combine the operations and functional organization of both the new ceo who came from cargill then set out to fill the top boxes he met with the top executives from both companies and questioned the heads of hr and the ceo of imc global these interviews revealed differences between cargills consensus driven decision making process and imcs more streamlined approach which emphasized speed cargills culture prevailed but with knowledge of the individuals and how they worked together the ceo selected leaders who reinforced this position cargill managers also sought to explain the benefits of their decision making system to their new colleagues rather than simply imposing it in some situations the targets people are precisely what the deal is all about the chinese company lenovos acquisition of ibms pc business completed in may is a case in point in fact the board of lenovos controlling shareholder allowed the company to pursue the deal if and only if it could recruit ibms senior executives to manage the merged enterprise lenovos interest ran beyond the top people the company offered a job to every ibm employee with no obligation to relocate or accept reduced compensation most companies however will need to determine as soon as possible who goes and who stays and that requires the kind of assessment that goes into any high level hiring effort acquirers should gather performance reviews interview third partie and assess executive track records they should probe leadership styles and evaluate how managers dealt with difficult decisions most of all acquirers should get to know potential new colleagues as individuals how the organization feels is a primary way public companies attract and retain talent and how an organization behaves as a unit determines its success up front human due diligence helps acquirers decide whether to embrace or kill a deal and determine the right price it also lays the groundwork for a speedy integration ultimately for abn amro and other big deals the people part of the equation will be a key to its success mr harding a partner with bain &amp company in boston and mr rouse a bain partner in chicago are co leaders of bains global m&amp a practice
