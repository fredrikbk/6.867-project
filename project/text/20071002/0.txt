india is becoming a defensive play now sensex hits ninth record in a row as investors look to pare exposure to u s driven woes mumbai india indias key index posted a record close for the ninth straight session coming in at but analysts said that is just a pit stop on the way to or higher undaunted by global financial jitters a rising rupee and a government hesitant to revamp the economy indias stock market continues to soar once considered a backwater india is seen as a haven for investors seeking a place to anchor part of their portfolios until they determine how far the developed

industrial average rose about londons ftse added and tokyos nikkei rose even china focused exchanges trail hong kongs hang seng index nearly tripled but that is still less than half the sensexs advance "india is becoming a defensive play" as investors look for countries less exposed to the weakening dollar and the subprime problems originating in the u s said prashant agrawal the executive director of global hedge fund courage capital advisory in mumbai "out of the emerging markets india still has the strongest fundamentals and some of the best run companies " over the past two weeks foreign institutional investors bought close to &# billion more in indian stock than they sold yesterday the sensex rose points to close at though it had gone as high as an intraday record the flood of foreign funds has lifted indian stocks well above their historical valuations the sensex component stocks which usually hover at an average price to earnings ratio of less than are trading at

bullish the sensex can go quite a bit higher " maybe even another this year said samir arora a fund manager at helios capital management in singapore "india is seen as a bit away from u s consumer issues and subprime problems " indian firms most exposed to an economic slowdown or financial shakeout in the u s are software services and outsourcing firms their shares have fallen amid concern that demand for their services may slow they also are hurt by the stronger rupee as they earn most of their money in u s dollars while many of indias information technology stocks have fallen to low valuations it may take a year or so before investors know for sure if the damage to earnings growth is lasting analysts said indias other blue chip companies unlike many big firms across asia arent dependent on exports most of their revenue comes from domestic sources so they wouldnt be hurt if americans bought fewer cars computers or flat screen television sets "the indian market is on steroids

an emerging global giant" among indian companies courage capitals mr agrawal said "india has emerging champions in steel autos hotels pharmaceuticals oil and gas " a large local or international shock could damp or derail the rally if it were substantial enough for example if political instability in new delhi led to snap elections next year the market would likely take a break for a month or more mr agrawal said if the u s economy slips into recession or the subprime problem spread some foreign investors might yank money out of emerging markets meanwhile should chinas growth slip and commodity prices that have been held up by chinese demand decline a lot of indian commodities companies could be hurt still most investment managers and analysts said that any shocks would be only temporary
