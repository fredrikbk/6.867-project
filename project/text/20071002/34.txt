that investors already are shrugging off the problems that rocked global financial markets only weeks ago the dow jones industrial average closed at rising points or capping a jump of nearly in the space of six weeks the scamper to new highs comes despite surging mortgage defaults the collapse of big buyout deals a plunge in the dollar and growing fears of a recession just yesterday in the latest fallout from credit turmoil in the u s citigroup inc announced a &# billion hit mostly due to write downs in the value of corporate loans and mortgage linked securities ubs ag said it was taking &# billion in write downs banks make such write downs to reflect a new lower estimate of what the loans and other assets are really worth rather than disrupting financial markets the revisions seemed to bolster investor confidence that banks are taking their lumps and losses are mainly in the rearview mirror both banks saw their shares rise the optimists key assumption is that the federal reserve has the situation under control after riding to the rescue last month with its half percentage point interest rate cut many investors believe the fed is ready to ratchet down rates further which could allow the housing market to stabilize by letting borrowers in trouble refinance into more manageable mortgages lower rates and renewed confidence might also loosen up debt markets and allow stalled buyouts to resume yet housing the source of the markets late summer woes remains unstable over the next months americans holding home mortgages with a total value of nearly &# billion will face revised interest rates typically as the low "teaser" rates that drew them in are reset at higher market rates according to data from moodys economy com about of these mortgages or &# billion are loans given to subprime borrowers generally people with poor credit the data show normally the stock market reflects expectations for the economys direction which is why housing skeptics are scratching their heads over the dows surge one factor may be that amid low interest rates and the freezing of credit markets people with cash to invest feel little alternative but to put it in stocks it also may be that stocks are experiencing a false dawn on several occasions during the collapse of the technology bubble early this decade investors grasped at straws to argue the crisis had passed instead the stock markets down trend lasted for years and the real resolution came after tech and telecommunications companies had completed several painful rounds of shedding debt and refocusing their businesses in december the chief executive of nortel networks said the picture for the coming year looked bright but months later the company posted a &# billion loss and cut jobs from peak to trough the stock ultimately fell in july lucent technologies chief executive patricia russo said "we had an all time peak and now an all time valley but we expect the market to stabilize " lucent issued another warning two months later if more mortgages go bad that could force banks and other financial firms to take repeated write downs of the value of securities backed by mortgages that could further roil debt markets and affect the stock market given that financial institutions comprise of the profits of the companies in the standard &amp poors stock index "i think youre going to get this constant flow of hits going forward spread out over multiple quarters " said bill laggner a partner at hedge fund bearing fund lp which has bet against financial institutions and other stocks involved in the housing market "a lot of people think that it doesnt matter what happens that the fed will rush in and find some way to save some of these larger institutions and the various assets that they own " mr laggner said "but i dont see how theres going to be a market for a lot of this paper for a long long time " for the moment the optimists are winning the argument they seized on comments by former federal reserve chief alan greenspan in london he said there were signs the credit crisis could be ending though he warned of the risk of both inflation and recession the dows close topped the old record of set july even home builders the industry at the heart of the housing bust had a good day following an upgrade from an influential analyst citigroups stephen kim who argued that the fundamentals of the industry "have never been worse" and so the stocks were due for a bounce shares of pulte homes inc jumped banks are being helped by some recent improvement in credit markets and a steeper yield curve which means long term interest rates are moving higher than short term rates that typically helps propel earnings by allowing banks to profit by taking in deposits at a lower rate and then lending at a higher rate "investors are pleased to see the financial firms fessing up and taking big hits for the losses that they have incurred " said ed yardeni president of yardeni research inc "this all makes sense if there arent a lot more big bad write offs up ahead " yet citigroup and ubs showed how rocky things are as a result of its write downs citigroup said third quarter earnings would be down from the &# billion it reported during the same period last year ubs said it expected to post a third quarter loss of as much as million swiss francs &# million its first quarterly loss in nine years one lingering uncertainty for banks involves loans they made to finance leveraged buyouts these loans are typically intended to tide over the buyers until the banks can sell the loans on to investors that frees up the banks balance sheets so they can make more loans but the seizing up of debt markets has forced banks to keep the loans on their books for longer than they expected uncertainty still hangs over more than &# billion in loan commitments issued by banks for leveraged buyouts there have been some tentative signs that financing for deals might loosen last week banks managed to sell &# billion of loans backing the buyout of first data corp nearly two times the amount they initially thought could be sold at the same time the majority of the &# billion in total debt financing needed to complete the deal remains to be distributed other big banks such as j p morgan chase &amp co bank of america corp and germanys deutsche bank ag are also likely to face hits due to leveraged buyout loans and write downs related to mortgage debt several investment banks have recorded big write downs on subprime loan exposure though some such as goldman sachs group inc offset the losses with big gains elsewhere ubss problems underscore how a bank can take on risks that few are aware of the bank hadnt been seen as a big investor in mortgage related securities beyond investments made by its now shuttered in house hedge fund dillon read capital management but yesterday ubs said that it had a &# billion portfolio of subprime residential mortgage securities and that it was taking a write down of &# billion to cover the portfolio lyneka little and e s browning contributed to this article
