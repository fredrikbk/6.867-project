an admissions break for the wrong reason while i enjoyed naomi schaefer rileys commentary about the difficulty of gaining admission into the university of chicago a single comment in this struck me as outrageous "the college try may not get you into college " de gustibus taste page weekend journal sept this was the statement by theodore oneill admissions director of the university of chicago to the effect that he would give barack obamas daughters "a break" in the admission process he stated "those children for all their privileges will have interesting things to say about american society based on what im assuming their experiences are " im not sure which is worse the brazen admission that he would grant racial preference to applicants or his assumption that mr obamas children would have had "interesting things to say about american society" based on their race wouldnt it be better for him to test his assumptions rather than act on them isnt it offensive to assume that ones race enables a person to make "interesting things to say about american society " at least he didnt say "since theyre black they must be good at basketball or track and field " but the underlying logic or lack thereof is the same mr oneills statement reveals what is so profoundly wrong with higher education in america and why so many people are mistrustful of our elite learning institutions he does not mention the character of potential students or their educational accomplishments to date or even their potential for future accomplishments but singles out the importance of having "interesting things to say about american society " it would seem to me that any student accepted with such an admission criterion would be at high risk for failure since an ability to learn and a willingness to work hard would take a back seat to having interesting things to say about american society i can imagine the day when a university of chicago graduate applies for his first job in the real world and lists his greatest skill as "having interesting things to say about american society" william e jones pasadena calif see related letter "letters to the editor try to stay calm" wsj oct
