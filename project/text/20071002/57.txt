investing in funds a quarterly analysis a tale of two etf trends prices rise as prices fall exchange traded funds are cheap right well yes and no as etfs continue to multiply now estimated at more than &# billion under management in the u s competition among the giants of the industry has driven down the fees paid by investors for many of these funds etfs which trade on exchanges like a stock and generally track various stock and bond indexes already had lower expenses on average than traditional mutual funds so now investors can find razor thin expense ratios for some etfs that track broad based indexes of market sectors like international stocks u s growth stocks or municipal bonds but investors infatuation with etfs also has prompted several firms to introduce much pricier versions that seek higher returns by following offbeat and narrow indexes such as ones tracking european drug companies or using computer based algorithms to pick stocks vanguard group inc recently began offering an international stock etf that charges a scant of assets annually or &# for every &# invested on the other hand some of the most expensive etfs now charge of assets or &# a year for each &# invested according to fund tracker morningstar inc hundreds of mutual funds offer lower fees than that including well known ones like fidelity magellan at &# per &# invested and growth fund of america the worlds biggest stock mutual fund at &# per &# how the new range of fees in the etf market will play out with investors will depend in the end on the funds performance low costs are an advantage in this regard because fees eat into investors returns a fund that returns before investment fees of will actually return one with fees of will return over long periods of time those discrepancies can make a huge difference an investor who puts &# into a fund that returns a year will see the investment turn into &# after years an investor who earns a year will end up with &# academic research has shown that the majority of mutual fund stock pickers fail to outperform their benchmarks in many years largely because the costs of stock research and frequent trading lower the returns of their funds managers of funds based on broad indexes bet that they will do better in the long run by minimizing investment costs than they could by trying to overcome those costs with smart stock picks the new pricier etfs have costs that the ones based on broad market indexes dont for instance paying extra to license novel indexes but their managers are betting those costs will be outweighed by higher returns heres a closer look at the two sides of etf investing the low end barclays plc dominates the u s etf business with about &# billion in assets or about of the market in july vanguard fired a shot across its bow by offering vanguard europe pacific etf which tracks the same broad based international stock index as the ishares msci eafe fund the largest barclays etf home to more than &# billion the vanguard fund has an expense ratio of less than half the levied by the barclays etf it garnered about &# million in assets in its first six weeks on the market vanguard aims to replicate the success of vanguard emerging markets etf which was started in but switched its benchmark last year to match the one used by barclayss ishares msci emerging markets index fund the vanguard etf which has an expense ratio of took in &# billion during the first eight months of this year compared with &# million for the ishares fund which has an expense ratio of according to morgan stanley vanguard "is doing yeomans work putting pressure on the fee front " says matt hougan editor of indexuniverse com a web site dedicated to the indexing industry barclays says it is ready for the heightened competition lee kranefuss head of barclayss etf business says investors will continue to flock to barclays funds in part because of the firms indexing experience and the services it provides such as a large and knowledgeable staff to answer questions barclays also argues that investors benefit because many of its ishares etfs are the largest and most frequently traded in their class and this volume reduces trading costs there is little question that the price war is widening as recently as january barclays appeared to have the market for bond etfs locked up its six bond etfs such as the broad based ishares lehman aggregate etf with an expense ratio of were the only bond exchange traded funds available now state street corp and vanguard have their own offerings including etfs that track the same benchmark as the broad market barclays bond offering state streets spdr lehman aggregate bond etf with an annual fee of and vanguard total bond market etf at just last month the battle extended into another area municipal bonds barclays began offering ishares s&amp p national municipal bond fund on sept state street was hot on its heels spdr lehman municipal bond etf appeared less than a week later state streets fund claims the edge on price levying fees of versus the barclays funds according to morningstar barclayss bond etfs collectively hold &# billion vanguards four hold &# million and state streets six hold &# million barclayss mr kranefuss says that while ultralow prices may grab attention they might not be sustainable "its easy to grab headlines with i am going to charge less " he says but "you can run into problems " if a company is offering funds that arent profitable he says that could "raise questions about whether you are committed to the business " vanguard says it hopes to lower fees still further as the funds accumulate assets according to spokeswoman amy chain "we hope to bring them down over time " she says state street global advisors is confident in its product line says tony rochte senior managing director "we think we offer a very competitive product set and we think we offer very good value for investors " barclays isnt tipping its hand as to whether it might cut some fees in coming months last year the firm sliced expense ratios of of its sector etfs to from barclays says that while it aims to offer funds that are "competitively priced " the move wasnt a response to rivals instead the funds had grown larger than the firm expected allowing it to spread fixed costs over a wider base of assets also the move brought expenses for all ishares sector etfs down to the same level simplifying barclayss pricing scheme vanguard hasnt let up the pressure just last week the firm said it cut expense ratios on of its sector funds to from the high side among recent new funds with above average fees are claymore robb report global luxury index etf which offers investors exposure to luxury goods stocks and charges of

healthshares european drugs etf which charges while large fund companies have created their share of high priced etfs pricier funds largely are associated with start ups like powershares capital management of wheaton ill founded in and now a unit of invesco plc and new york based xshares founded in these firms have carved a niche for themselves with funds that cover narrow corners of the stock market or promise novel investment ideas powershares chief executive bruce bond notes that his firm pays a premium to license research intensive indexes that aim to pick attractive stocks based on companies financial ratios another factor in cost is that niche funds almost by definition are small so fixed costs are shared among relatively few investors industry executives say christian magoon head of the etf group for claymore securities inc says small size and a big helping of international stocks which can be more expensive to trade both contribute to the higher than average costs of the firms global luxury index etf "our etfs are geared toward outperforming traditional indexes " he says this fund and others at the higher end of the etf price range dont have enough of a track record yet to determine whether that will be the case some industry analysts arent impressed most "gimmicky funds forgo the biggest advantage of indexing low costs " writes russell kinnel research director of mutual fund research at morningstar in a recent report still some investors are finding that pricey etfs are a good fit in their portfolios a model etf portfolio offered up by mr hougan
