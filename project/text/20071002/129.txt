why smaller hedge funds may be looking to sell out hedge funds are in play on the heels of a rocky summer for many funds and as money continues to flow to the industry more hedge funds are examining the possibility of selling out to larger rivals or big securities firms such moves probably will put even more pressure on smaller funds last night perella weinberg partners lp the advisory and securities firm formed by star banker joseph perella announced it is purchasing xerion capital partners llc a fund that manages about &# million and has been among the best performers this year the deal gives perellas money management business another strategy to sell to its clients and marks a new leg in the growth of the firm terms of the transaction werent disclosed though it is likely that the price will vary depending on the performance of xerion and perella weinberg partners the deal is part of a bet that xerion will be able to find bargains among the rubble of the credit markets which have been rocked by losses from mortgages extended to borrowers with sketchy credit histories it also is another sign that perella weinberg which has a huge infrastructure for a young firm will be more than an advisory boutique despite mr perellas continued reputation as an elite banker the firm which he started in june with a group of co founders has had some success in the merger advice field it has employees in three cities and already has money managers focusing on areas such as water infrastructure and more traditional hedge fund strategies the xerion transaction comes on the heels of last months purchase of city investment managers ltd a &# million london based fund by cqs one of londons largest hedge funds wall street firms such as morgan stanley have been buying up funds in the past year but the activity is expected to increase as more hedge funds combine with rivals firms like blackstone group lp och ziff capital management group llc and glg partners lp all have gone public or plan to do so giving them shares to use to make acquisitions behind the trend is the growing realization by those who run smaller hedge funds like xerion that their job has gotten much harder the firm has scored gains of so far this year betting against financial companies and subprime debt and by making wagers on so called special situations such as shares of early stage commodity producers according to one investor xerion which was formed in january was up about last year but its founder daniel arbess said so much money is flowing to larger funds that it makes it harder for smaller firms to raise cash the largest hedge funds control about of the money in the hedge fund world up from less than at the end of that leaves thousands of smaller players scrambling for the rest "we dont need to sell out now " mr arbess says "but the hedge fund industry is becoming winner take all with the vast majority of capital going to the largest most institutionalized firms " mr arbess who will become a partner at perella said that selling out to the larger firm will help cut xerions trading costs give it better client service and technology and enable it to raise more money since large institutions such as pension plans generally want to invest at least &# million in a fund and dont want to hold more than of assets it makes them less likely to shift money to a mid size firm like xerion that adds to the attraction of selling out to perella mr arbess says perella will put &# million into xerions funds as part of the agreement still some investors are concerned that the rush to establish large "multiple strategy" hedge fund firms that embrace different investments might not work out they cite amaranth advisors a multiple strategy fund that collapsed last year after heavy energy trading losses they worry that some of the hedge fund managers selling out are simply cashing in while the money continues to flow others say the push to purchase hedge funds and offer more strategies to clients is simply a way to increase management fees rather than a means to deliver top notch returns as large firms buy up hedge funds and bolt them together to form multiple strategy funds many could prove unable to appropriately allocate capital and manage the risk of these varied investments says gregory curtis chairman of greycourt &amp co a pittsburgh firm with &# billion in assets that invests in hedge funds for wealthy individuals he says that even successful hedge fund managers usually know little about allocating money among different strategies or how to manage all the risk some hedge fund operators say they are examining purchases of traditional money management firms known as long only investors because they dont bet against or short stocks they would then enjoy the fees that come from managing this chunk of money in an investing style that can be more attractive to pension plans and other institutional investors
