cough drugs for kids spark concern in wake of fda review suggesting over the counter remedies pose risks some doctors advise traditional treatments drugstore shelves are full of cough and cold medications marketed for babies and toddlers but doctors are increasingly opposed to the medicines use now recent safety reviews of these remedies from the food and drug administration have added to the debate leaving parents with a dilemma how should they treat very young children suffering from runny noses and other mild but unpleasant symptoms pediatricians suggest falling back on a range of old fashioned therapies that may help and will often provide comfort to a sick kid these include humidifiers saline drops and yes hydrating fluids such as the classic chicken soup for a child with more serious symptoms such as a consistent wheezing cough that persists for more than a few days parents should consider seeing a physician they say on oct the fda plans to hold a public meeting of a group of outside advisers to examine the safety and effectiveness of over the counter cough and cold medicines for babies and young children which are sold under a range of brands including wyeths robitussin novartis ags triaminic and johnson &amp johnsons tylenol plus cold on friday in advance of the meeting the agency unveiled in depth reviews of the issues by its own experts and some other groups though the fda hasnt come to a final conclusion about how to deal with the drugs a number of the reviews echoed alarm bells that doctors had earlier raised agency safety reviewers wrote that an analysis suggested that the use of some of the medications has been associated with serious side effects and some deaths in patients younger than years old they also noted that the drugs havent been proven to work in children the fda said friday it had reports of deaths in children linked to decongestants containing the ingredients pseudoephedrine phenylephrine and ephedrine from to sept and reports of deaths linked to antihistamines with the ingredients diphenhydramine brompheniramine and chlorpheniramine the agency said the bulk of the reports were in children younger than also a number of the deaths occurred in children who had gotten overdoses "parents need to be extremely cautious about using the products and be very aware of the ingredients " so they dont inadvertently give young children two formulations that contain the same active drug says charles ganley director of the fdas nonprescription products office in a letter that also became public friday the american academy of pediatrics recommended that the medications labels should note that they have "been shown to be ineffective" in children younger than and that "serious adverse reactions including but not limited to death have been reported " a group representing drug makers the consumer healthcare products association in a statement made public friday said the drugs should be labeled against use in children younger than thats a contrast to the current packaging of many of the products one version of triaminic for instance says on the front of the box that it is an "infant" decongestant and anti cough medicine and it bears a drawing of a smiling baby the infant drop formulation of tylenol plus cold a painkiller that also soothes stuffy noses carries a picture of a mom and baby on its front theres also a robitussin infant cough product given the industry groups recommendation "i dont know how they can continue to sell these products " says joshua sharfstein the baltimore health commissioner who with other physicians petitioned the fda to add new warnings to the drugs labels johnson &amp johnsons mcneil unit which markets the tylenol product says in a statement that it supports the industry groups recommendations the company said it plans to work with the fda to provide dosing information to parents and in the meantime "will inform parents and pediatricians to not use these products in children under two years of age " wyeth says it will "hold off on any changes to our marketing efforts until we receive appropriate guidance" from the fda and its advisers novartis says in a statement that it had input into the chpas recommendations and that the company will continue to work with the association and the fda to address the issue parents say theyre getting mixed signals "i dont think theres clear information " says michele nekos of katonah n y who says she found over the counter cold products didnt work well for her three children and "a lot of it feels like marketing " she now uses a humidifier in the room of a child sick with a cold she says some doctors say they advise parents to learn how to use nondrug treatments for instance lynne maxwell a pediatrician and associate professor at the university of pennsylvania suggests that parents with infants suffering from stuffed noses carefully suction out nasal secretions with a bulb syringe and place a few drops of saline solution in each nostril parents need to be careful she says "you dont want to pour a large amount of liquid into a babys nose " still doctors say some drugs are appropriate for kids with cold like symptoms ian paul an associate professor of pediatrics and public health sciences at the penn state college of medicine who has done research on pediatric use of the cough medications and is now consulting for some of the products makers says he doesnt advise their use for colds but "antihistamines work well for allergies " he says and he will use them in kids for that for pain childrens or infants versions of acetaminophen or tylenol are also acceptable for young kids he says other doctors suggest that the real issue to pay attention to is misuse and that the medications can be helpful when used properly jonathan field director of the pediatric allergy asthma and immunology clinic at new york university medical center bellevue hospital says he suggests that parents check with a pediatrician he believes these medications can be used in short term circumstances even in children under if the child has an acute but mild cough without more serious signs such as fever vomiting or wheezing or if the child is being treated for the underlying disease such as bronchitis or a viral infection "i see no reason why they should suffer if you can give someone symptomatic relief of the cough " he says to prevent overdosing especially when a child has more than one caregiver dr field recommends that parents keep their childs medications in a bag with a log where each caregiver records when and how much medication was given little noses pediatricians offer these tips on treating cough and cold symptoms in very young children and babies consult a doctor before using any medication and if symptoms are serious or persist for more than a few days try to alleviate the childs discomfort with steam baths or humidifiers keep the child hydrated with lots of liquids to ease a stuffy nose try suctioning out fluids and putting saline drops in the nostrils
