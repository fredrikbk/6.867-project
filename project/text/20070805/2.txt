eyes on the road plugging in to the future getting miles per gallon while driving to work in a modified toyota prius online edition i drove to work one day last week in a prototype car that is either a harbinger of a far more fuel efficient future or another in a long line of technological insurgencies that will fail in the end to crack the auto industrys century old status quo the car was a toyota prius modified by the addition of a kilogram pound lithium ion battery pack into a so called plug in hybrid capable of operating for as many as miles almost entirely on electric power alone the battery pack is a product of massachusetts based a systems www asystems com and its recently acquired hymotion inc subsidiary heres how my drive to work went i walked out of the house to where the prius was parked close enough to my garage so that i could run an extension cord from the wall outlet to a three prong plug installed in the cars rear bumper id plugged in the car the night before and by morning the lithium ion batteries installed in the trunk were charged up i stuck a plastic key fob into a slot in the dash hit the "power" button and then hit it again because i couldnt tell if the car was on there was no engine noise once i had the on off business sorted out i put the car in drive and silently rolled out into the street and i continued to roll on electric power in a normal prius the gasoline engine kicks in once you get past walking speed in this car the extra batteries allowed me to keep rolling in electric only mode at highway speeds the company estimates the electricity cost of an overnight charge to be around cents for extra miles as i dodged fellow citizens in their last century gas only suvs i snuck glances at the priuss information screen which displayed my fuel consumption and the flow of power from the batteries and the gasoline engine for most of my roughly mile trip to the office i appeared to be on electric only power accelerating to merge with traffic and avoid becoming a high tech oil spot under a semi i engaged the gasoline motor but cruising was all electric and according to the priuss on board fuel consumption computer i was cruising at miles to the gallon the only awareness i had of the power generation hand offs between the gas engine and the lithium ion batteries or the lithium ion batteries and the priuss factory installed nickel metal hydride battery system was the videogame display in the dashboard screen my reaction to this experience drawing on years of covering the auto business was "wow who wouldnt want this " its the questions that come next that have been a problem for the auto industry what does it really cost is it reliable what about the warranty toyotas stance on that last question is that anyone who modifies the prius into a plug in voids the warranty not so long ago it looked as though the industrys big dogs werent confident they had good answers for those questions in the near term electric cars have foundered since the industrys earliest days on the rocks of cost reliability and range plug ins have range but with current battery technology they didnt appear to have mass market levels of cost or reliability gm earlier this year made a splash with a prototype of a plug in called the chevrolet volt but stressed that the batteries to make the volt real hadnt been invented yet skeptics me included wondered where was the beef lithium ion battery technology can handle the cycles of charging and discharging required for a plug in better than nickel metal hydride batteries its used now in small power tools and laptops but lithium ion battery also has whats referred to as "heat management" issues that means fire scarecrow the recent spate of publicity about lithium ion laptop batteries bursting into flame has only made resolving this issue more urgent the a prius conversion kit is just one sign of the increasing optimism within the automotive and enviro tech communities that the battery technology required to deliver a reliable plug in or electric vehicle could be ready sooner than once thought last week about groups entered the automotive x prize competition which plans to offer a multimillion dollar reward to entrants who can build a marketable mile per gallon car and compete in races scheduled for meanwhile several companies such as tesla motors of california are drumming up interest in electric vehicles tony posawatz the vehicle line director for gms plug in hybrid chevrolet volt and other vehicles using gms e flex electric vehicle technology says he expects to get battery packs by the end of this year from suppliers who believe they have what it takes to meet gms criteria for a safe reliable and cost effective plug in hybrid a is part of one group along with continental ag another involves big korean battery maker lg chem "we are encouraged " mr posawatz says of the developments in battery technology gm is still aiming to have a production version of the volt ready to roll by late provided the batteries are ready too he says gm has also said it wants to make a plug in version of its saturn vue compact suv mr posawatz wont say the volt by is now a sure thing but with a telephonic wink to the naysayers he says developments such as the a prius conversion system are "indicators telling you that from a technological perspective its not that far off " toyota meanwhile earlier this month took another step closer to the plug in camp by announcing it will start offering prototype plug in priuses for testing in the u s and japan plug in advocates will say we told you so while gm and toyota ramp up their rival plug in programs consumers will get a chance to vote with their wallets on whether plug in technology makes sense ric fulop an a founder and vice president of marketing and business development says his company is on track to offer by early next year lithium ion plug in conversion systems similar to the one i tested to toyota prius owners and hybrid ford escape owners initial numbers will be relatively low he said "if we sold next year thats a big start " prices arent set yet but its likely a system that can extend the electric only range of a prius by miles will cost about &# a mile system will cost about half that he says the company is working to get tax breaks to offset those costs and mr fulop says a is trying to convince toyota to ease the hostile stand on warranty coverage a toyota spokeswoman says shes unaware of any discussions on the issue as for the volt mr fulop says "it totally can happen " send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
