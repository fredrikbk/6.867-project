love &amp money promises we make to kids and cant keep me and my big mouth recently i spent several days fruitlessly looking for my wifes ipod which i was hoping to use in the car on a family road trip i called my year old into my office and asked if he had seen the gadget he hadnt but he offered up a deal "if i find it " he asked "can i have a cellphone " thus we arrive at the point in our story where i do something really stupid i said "sure buddy its a deal " i have no clue why my brain said that or why my mouth allowed those words to escape my wife amy and i have already decided that our son is too young to have a cellphone as i chronicled several months ago in this column i suppose i figured he would hunt for a few minutes get bored quickly and go back to watching tv when i heard him shout "dad " i knew i was in trouble luck apparently has a deviant sense of humor because he found the ipod in a disorganized kitchen cabinet within minutes how do you handle this as a parent a situation in which youve made a promise you know you cant keep take one path and i go against my better parenting judgment as well as anger amy take the other and i destroy my sons trust in my word its damned if i do damned if i dont and its all my fault now i must figure out how to repair the damage i know im not the only parent who has made this blunder we all make promises that we have no intention of keeping sometimes we discover after the fact that our promise costs more than expected and we unilaterally declare it invalid but mainly we make promises because we assume well never have to fulfill them "ill give you a million dollars if you can make that foot shot with your eyes closed " "you can stay out as late as you want every night if you get a perfect score on your sats " my cellphone promise was just such a never going to happen deal im not implying we maliciously act in bad faith after all parenting is an art at best and we do what we must to navigate situations that arise but to kids especially younger kids we are reneging on iron clad guarantees were breaking our promise and in a kids world thats as bad as bad gets i know from experience when i was in ninth grade my stepfather promised i could buy a german shepherd puppy if he broke a pledge to stop smoking based on his weakness for british cigarettes i knew i was days away from a new dog not five minutes later i walked into the kitchen to find him hunched over the stove lighting a cigarette on a burner he thought i had left the house with friends i immediately claimed victory but he said our handshake deal was just a joke no puppy i still remember this some years later a stark illustration of just how strongly parental lies can stick with a kid and because of that memory this is an issue that resonates deeper with me than it might with many parents my son actually thinks i lied to him he has told me so repeatedly in recent weeks i want to make it right with him but i cant just give him a cellphone for months amy and i have been united in sending him a message that hes too young for a cellphone and with one thoughtless promise i risked destroying that amy feels as if ive already undermined that united front with my careless words shell be even madder at me if i relent and buy him a cellphone so ive created frustration and anger on all sides how though to tell a year old that it was all a mistake i dont accept that "tough luck" or "so sorry" is appropriate because just as i put my faith in my stepfathers word my son put his faith in mine and the last thing i want to do is destroy that bond or to send my son the message that his dads promises mean little when i get myself in a bind like this i often call my friend denise in california shes a financial therapist who helps couples and families navigate the emotional eddies that swirl around money i knew that my stepfathers solution dismissing the promise out of hand as just a joke was dead wrong given the lasting imprint it made on my psyche "you have to be honest about it and apologize to him and explain what happened in ways he can process " denise counseled me "kids at this age still think concretely you said it you meant it how could you be thinking something else "tell him it was a mistake and that while you can understand why he thinks it was a lie they were words that just slipped out because you didnt really think he would find the ipod either and offer to make amends in some way thats ok parentally " so thats what i tried i pulled my son into my office to explain myself "well buddy i screwed up " i started "i know you think i lied about the cellphone but i really thought our deal was just us playing around " "but i took it seriously " he interjected "i know that now and im sorry i made a promise i couldnt keep it was just something that slipped out when i thought we were having fun i thought that if i couldnt find the ipod then you probably werent going to find it either so i didnt think there was much harm in making a deal with you now though ive made mom mad by making a promise and i made you mad by not keeping a promise " "then you shouldnt make a promise if youre just playing " he said "thats true but have you ever said something to me or mom or to your friends that you didnt mean something that was just a joke to you but came out the wrong way because the other person took it seriously " "yes " "well its the same thing only with grown ups i want to make it up to you though since you did find the ipod and i did make a promise to you " on amys advice i offered to make amends by giving my son extra time with me i made him a "day with dad" coupon that he can use anytime and that entitles him to an entire day playing with me he chooses what to do where to eat lunch and i cannot say no to anything it expires never he smiled and said the coupon was a pretty good substitute jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal write to him at
