marketwatch get older get happier it happens it gets better with age some people think those who are decades older have less reason to be joyful but more people in their s and s report being happy than do those in their s according to a recent survey conducted for bank hsbc of people in countries spanning four age groups from to among u s respondents of those in their s and of those in their s said they were happy most of the time in the previous week versus of those in their s who said that whats the secret to aging happily good health and a decent standard of living dont hurt but those factors dont play as big a part as you might think researchers say the truth is people generally get happier as they age says laura carstensen director of the stanford center on longevity and a professor of psychology at stanford university "how often one feels sad angry disgusted contemptuous that frequency declines and in addition to that when negative emotions occur they dont last as long " she says citing research from her studies of people aged to plus of course individuals happiness varies studies of twins indicate your genes likely make you more or less optimistic and the happiness of your parents affects you says peter ubel a professor of medicine and psychology at the university of michigan who has conducted research on happiness but unhappiness is generally not connected to aging mr ubel and other researchers say "i know a lot of unhappy year olds but if you look on average there are a lot more grumpy young men than grumpy old men we just dont call them grumpy we call them angry or irritable " mr ubel says health matters too very sick people arent as happy as healthy people but thats true at all ages indeed "if you compare younger and older people in poor health older people are doing better than younger people " ms carstensen says adding that older people even experience lower rates of depression "even among frail older adults morale is often comparable and at times higher" than younger adults adds gene cohen a psychiatrist and gerontologist and director of george washington universitys center on aging health and humanities ms carstensen says greater happiness is likely related to a desire to make the most of ones remaining time "when people perceive time is limited they focus more on well being " she says for instance "they get rid of the riff raff in their lives and select the people who are most important " mr cohen says brain function changes too brain imaging studies find older peoples brains react less intensely and for less time to negative emotions improved morale as we age "is probably a combination of perspective on life and changes to the amygdalae " a part of the brain that processes emotion he says youd think money would drive happiness not necessarily "money matters very little to happiness except at very low levels of money " mr ubel says for those struggling to pay a mortgage or buy food "a little money can have a huge influence on their happiness " he says "once you get a bit of security and comfort whether you make &# or &# a year has a very small influence on happiness " uncertainty matters more than money and "has more influence on happiness than most other circumstances " mr ubel says he notes for instance that if you are offered a steady yet small stream of income for life "no matter what your previous income had been youll adjust " one lesson remember that insurance can offer important peace of mind particularly in the event of an unexpected health problem mr ubel says "if people are smart theyll invest wisely in disability insurance even though it reduces your current income a little it gives you that security " he explains "we tend to think that having more money so we can purchase more goods will bring us happiness but there is such a small relationship between how much money you have and how happy you are " mr ubel says "it makes more sense to have a little more insurance than having the latest iphone its good for your happiness " if you connect happiness with a longer life span try staying active longer lives are correlated with people continuing to engage in activities they feel are important says robert butler president of the international longevity center in new york it has to be "something thats substantive and matters such as taking care of a grandchild volunteer activity three days a week continuing to work rather than retiring " mr butler says "something that makes a difference in the persons life is life enhancing they enjoy it more and live longer than those who have nothing in their lives " younger adults might consider setting the stage now for such activities mr cohen says "they may want to think about how they can approach ongoing education exploring different areas that would set the stage for development later on maybe they could take a class now and later become a photographer " andrea coombes writes for marketwatch www marketwatch com email forum sunday wsj com
