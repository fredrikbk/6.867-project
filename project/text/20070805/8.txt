small business keep business alive with succession plan nancy sharp chief executive of food for thought enterprises found herself scrambling to make some tough decisions in after her husband then president was diagnosed with lung cancer and couldnt run the family business day to day "we started to be written off a bit " says ms sharp potential customers thought "the owner is sick and the wife is tending to him theyre not going to be there when we need them to be " ms sharp says she made some rash decisions including hiring a new president from outside the lincolnwood ill based event and food service company that person didnt fit well in the new role and left within months luckily ms sharp understood the now employee business enough to keep it growing past her husbands death in but shes now building a succession plan so her successor isnt left in the same bind business owners often feel that they and the business will always be around but without some thoughtful planning about succession its common that businesses wither when the owner passes away or leaves here then are four steps to making sure your business lives beyond you communicate the first step of succession planning is figuring out what you want to happen to the business after youre gone whether thats tomorrow or years away the goal may be selling the business or you might appoint a family member or trustworthy employee to take over but such decisions cant be made in a vacuum says david paradise president of the family business resource center in newton centre mass accountants lawyers and financial advisers can counsel you on the various aspects of succession planning but more importantly owners need to engage their most promising employees and family in a dialogue about the future of the business asking sometimes personal questions to gauge their thoughts and goals once your goals for the business are clear you can better lay out a long term plan most succession plans look five years out and include incremental steps for achieving the ultimate goal of how ownership or leadership will be transferred but you also need a short term contingency plan in case disaster strikes tomorrow mr paradise says succession plans tend to evolve over time so owners should be revising them at least once every few years as time passes and circumstances change detach yourself many businesses rely too much on the founders persona so if the founder dies theres high risk the business will too to avoid this you should start documenting all procedures and policies and writing down how the business operates in vast detail so that "if i get hit by a bus theoretically my staff can walk in and they can follow the steps " says raman chadha executive director of the coleman entrepreneurship center at depaul university in chicago mr chadha estimates that fewer than of entrepreneurs he meets have a succession plan you should keep a copy of the document in a safe place and have at least one trustworthy employee who knows where to find it and has the competency to run the business after youre gone that person should also know the key customers suppliers and employees so its not such a shock if he or she has to take over the business on short notice groom your successor early one of the most important facets of succession planning is deciding who the next leader will be and spending ample time preferably years grooming that person for the role who that person is shouldnt be a quick or emotional decision it should be handled thoughtfully and formally even when youre dealing with family says mr paradise first determine what leadership qualities and skills you want in the next leader then identify qualified candidates using that criteria and talk with them about their interest in running the business devising an evaluation process and setting goals for the candidates can make it easier over time to choose the best one you might allow candidates to lead projects so you can evaluate how they perform as leaders and engage with employees and customers sometimes the best candidate must be recruited from outside the business bob hirsch co owner of gold eagle co a family owned automotive chemicals manufacturer hoped to keep his chicago business privately owned and in the family but none of his children showed much interest in running the business and there was no employee deemed qualified to take it over so in mr hirsch invited his son in law marc blackman to join the business mr blackman was first given a job in sales over the years he was moved into roles with more and more responsibility he became ceo in may when the year old mr hirsch stepped down mr hirsch still works as an adviser for the business though he admits not being the decision maker any more "can be hard at times " some business owners even undertake an extensive external search ms sharp of food for thought estimates shes interviewed several dozen candidates in recent months to fill three senior positions she hopes to choose the next chief executive in the next five years and then spend the following few years training him or her before she retires get financial protections many financial planners say there are key ways owners can protect the business in case of their death or disability or from future disputes having adequate life insurance to pay estate
