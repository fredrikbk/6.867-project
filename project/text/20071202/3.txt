family finances taking a family or medical leave several years ago an allergic reaction sent sue kowols to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a rare skin disorder and then lupus missing many days of work ms kowols feared she might lose her job as a school district secretary in buffalo grove ill but then through a family member she learned about the family and medical leave act "that would at least guarantee me my job when i felt better " says ms kowols who returned to work after days "that was definitely a huge relief " the law known as fmla has enabled millions of people to take unpaid leave from work for a broad range of personal and family health issues since it was enacted in considered by its advocates to be an important protection for those trying to balance family and work the act allows workers to take as many as weeks of unpaid leave in any month period to care for a newborn or a sick child spouse or parent or to recuperate from their own serious medical condition without fear of losing their job many fans say fmla helps avoid costly nursing home or other institutional stays and also lowers employers turnover costs by helping to retain workers in recent years the law has grown in importance for baby boomers who increasingly need to take off from work to care for an elderly parent employees can take fmla leave for a broad range of serious health conditions from episodic ailments like migraines to life threatening illnesses like cancer and for treatments such as radiation therapy the law applies only to companies with or more employees if the reason for leave is foreseeable such as the birth of a child or a planned surgery an employee is required to give at least days notice before the fmla leave is to begin in the case of a medical emergency notice must be given as soon as practicable more information on fmla regulations can be found at the labor departments web site at dol gov congress is currently considering legislation to expand the act to cover airline employees who may not qualify because of irregular work schedules and to provide as many as six months of unpaid leave to workers caring for family members injured during military service under certain circumstances employees can take the weeks of unpaid leave intermittently this type of leave is most often taken by people with chronic conditions such as asthma diabetes back pain and severe migraines the labor department estimates that one fourth of people who took fmla leave in did so intermittently but this type of leave in which workers break up their leave into small increments and often give little notice to supervisors has developed into an area of contention between companies and employees the tensions became visible when the labor department issued a request late last year for comments on fmla and received more than responses from workers companies law firms and unions far more than expected "this explosion in the use of unscheduled leave is really what employers complain about " says victoria a lipnic assistant secretary of labor for employment standards "we havent made any final decisions" about revising the act ms lipnic adds while fmla requests made by employees go smoothly in the vast majority of cases some workers say companies are making it more difficult to qualify for leave and requiring second or third opinions from health care providers some say they have been fired or punished with worse assignments when they return to their jobs some employers for their part are on the lookout for fraud and have even hired investigators to check up on employees matrix investigations &amp consulting based in cincinnati charges &# a day to send an investigator equipped with tiny cameras hidden in buttons or hats to videotape workers on fmla leave in one case the company found a worker taking fmla leave in the spring to start a landscaping business and another during the winter for a snowplow business
