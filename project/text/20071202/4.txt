getting going invest it all in stocks no way take a walk on the mild side earlier this year a slew of readers wrote to me wondering why they shouldnt invest in stocks after all my correspondents noted stocks always win in the end the last time i regularly got such emails was in the late s as the bull market hurtled toward its dizzying peak were this years emails a warning sign of rougher times ahead we seem to have gotten our answer with the dow jones industrial average plunging from its oct high before bouncing back somewhat my correspondents unfortunately were overlooking one of the basic tenets of portfolio building yes holding a few bonds might hurt returns but the financial loss is small and the benefits impressive especially at times like this since year end the standard &amp poors stock index has clocked a year easily outpacing the annual return for intermediate term government bonds yet if you had kept a sliver of your money in bonds you would have sharply reduced your portfolios price gyrations without paying a big price in returns for proof consider some numbers from ibbotson associates a unit of chicagos morningstar since a mix of s&amp p and intermediate government bonds would have had annual volatility that was lower than that of an all stock portfolio meanwhile you would still have notched a year which means you captured of the s&amp p s annual return this assumes you rebalanced back to your mix at the end of each year even at s&amp p and bonds you would have earned a year or of the s&amp p s annual performance while suffering less annual volatility that sure seems like an attractive tradeoff youre losing a quarter of the annual volatility but getting just less annual return if you are creative with your bond holdings you could probably reduce risk even more for instance accelerating inflation is a big threat for stock investors to offset that risk you might keep part of your bond money in an inflation indexed bond fund such as fidelity inflation protected bond or vanguard inflation protected securities though to be honest im not enthused about inflation bonds at todays modest yields similarly a shaky u s economy could cause u s stocks to plunge in that scenario the dollar might weaken which would bolster foreign bond funds such as t rowe price international bond and the exchange traded spdr lehman international treasury bond etf but there is one bond market sector that probably wont be a good diversifier like stocks high yield junk bonds tend to reflect the strength of the u s economy that means junk bonds dont provide much portfolio protection for stock investors while keeping a small sum in bonds wont greatly crimp your annual returns that slight disadvantage will compound over time indeed after or years you will likely end up with far more wealth if you opt for an all stock portfolio but this of course assumes you can grit your teeth and live with stocks can you remember risk tolerance isnt stable in early after more than four years of rising share prices it was easy to be big and brave but in october when stocks hit bottom after the s&amp p s plunge nobody was writing to me touting the virtues of a stock portfolio most folks i believe just dont have the emotional fortitude to keep everything in stocks allocating some money to bonds doesnt just provide psychological comfort and a financial cushion during stock market declines it also gives you buying power when stocks plunge that creates a sense of crisis triggering an overwhelming urge to act among many investors but what will you do now that share prices are lower the rational strategy is to purchase more stocks if you have some bonds you will have the money to do just that all that said i believe stocks will win in the end if you are invested in a diversified stock portfolio and you can live with the volatility you will likely earn dazzling long run returns still these dazzling returns arent guaranteed over the past century many foreign stock markets have been shuttered because of war or internal political turmoil today it seems unimaginable that that could happen in the u s and if it did bond investors would likely also get crushed there is however also the risk that u s stocks could suffer horrendous returns because of economic dislocation or because valuations contract from todays heady levels for instance if you bought stocks at the market peak and held on through the great depression it would have taken more than years to get back to even as measured by the s&amp p s total return meanwhile if stocks reverted to the modest price earnings multiples and rich dividend yields we saw in the early s the s&amp p would tumble or from current levels could it happen the chances are slim but a slim chance isnt the same as no chance which means keeping or of your money in bonds is probably a prudent move a separate "getting going" appears each wednesday in the wall street journal email jonathan clements wsj com
