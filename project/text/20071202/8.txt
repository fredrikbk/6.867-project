love &amp money a family trip as a gift the readers weigh in readers respond this week to a family holiday trip packaged as a christmas present gambling as entertainment and a few issues related to kids and finance my column last week on an expensive family vacation to lake tahoe during the coming holidays fueled far more email than i imagined i wrote that were giving this trip to our two kids ages and as their major gift this year though this is a trip that my wife amy and i would have likely booked anyway but i asked in the column is that fair can a holiday vacation youd have otherwise taken one which the kids did not ask for really be your childs major christmas gift readers were split lisa la salle in goose creek s c says "the idea of a trip as a present to children as young as yours is laughable there is no possible way that a year old is making that mental leap and the year old will seem to make the stretch right up until christmas morning and then will be puzzled and confused especially since you wont actually be on vacation christmas day " she says her family with three kids aged to took a family vacation last thanksgiving rationalizing that it "would be part of everyones christmas " however she says they embarked with the car so "fully loaded with gifts that we almost had to tie the youngest child to the hood as there was no room for him inside " ms la salle says amy and i should "enjoy your vacation make the memories with your kids but dont be ebenezer opdyke this christmas because you have settled on some formula for christmas spending and both the trip and the gifts have to fit within those parameters " paul griffith an expatriate living in london says that last year for the first time he and his wife took their three kids ages and on a christmas skiing vacation in austria that he says "was the big gift " mr griffith says success is "all about communication and managing expectations if you communicate to your kids well ahead that going on a christmas trip is part of the under the tree package they will likely understand the biggest part is getting them to understand that real happiness doesnt come from stuff but is experiential and for us it was granted kids probably have to reach a certain age before they can buy into the experiential is better than material concept but we have found it to be very enriching and i see us doing the same thing for many years to come " as full disclosure he notes that the family still exchanges gifts "however rather than the bounteous piles of christmas past we give the kids one small but meaningful gift and a few tidbits in their stockings " speaking to one of my primary worries is sue a reader in minneapolis who went the trip as gift route last year doing exactly what amy suggested in my column she put pictures of the destination under the tree to represent a present "despite having numerous other small gifts there was no wow factor " sue says "kids live in the here and now a trip next month is not something they can play with on christmas morning buy one wow gift in addition to the trip " several weeks ago i wrote about the mistakes ive learned trying to ingrain a sense of financial savvy in my son through the years and how as a result ive taken a more laissez faire approach with my daughter realizing that the lessons i want to teach her need to wait until shes older a few readers including terri schwerzler in tacoma wash took me to task for what they saw as gender bias "i had three brothers and they were all treated differently than i " says ms schwerzler "they would have to protect the family have a well providing job and a great education i on the other hand was just a girl and would be married off and protected by a man if your second child had been a boy would you still have made the financial changes you decided on " finally what happens in vegas doesnt stay in vegas i wrote recently about the gap that erupts between couples when one wants to gamble a few dollars as entertainment while the other sees the expense as a waste of money isabelle maddock in tamarac fla says she too enjoys gambling within reason but has had to answer to her own kids who would quiz her on how much she lost after returning from trips to las vegas "i told them " she says "i did not lose any money i spent my vacation money to me it did not matter on what i spent the money i allocated for the las vegas vacations it could have been for the many shows i saw while i was there the slot tournaments i entered and enjoyed or perhaps even a new dress or a good dinner this was money set aside for vacation to enjoy any way i wished " as for our own trip to vegas i took &# as amy and i negotiated i gambled just one evening for all of minutes i won &# got bored and walked away from the craps table amy lost &# at one point nearly hyperventilating because she accidentally bet cents per turn on a slot machine instead of the cents she had been playing jeff opdyke covers
