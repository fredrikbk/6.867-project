just a nap or is the bull getting tired this bull market is getting ornery at last mondays close the dow jones industrial average was down from the record high reached less than two months earlier starting the first textbook "correction" since a strong rally over the next few days left the dow up for the week but that wasnt enough to stop the benchmark from posting a drop for november the worst monthly return since december the november sell off and this years wild gyrations in share prices have investment pros thinking defensively theyre taking pains to remind clients that the u s economy is likely to slow and to temper their expectations for gains "you dont want to own investments today that you wouldnt want to own in a recession tomorrow " says alan skrainka chief market strategist at edward jones in st louis the housing downturn and credit squeeze have upped the likelihood of a recession many economists say mr skrainka says its time for people to go back to proven investment principles diversify well and be sure to hold high quality investments such as large company stocks and investment grade bonds mind your portfolios exposure to risk for example an investor probably doesnt want to load up on volatile holdings like commodities and emerging markets shares just before retirement because the risk of losing principal when its needed most is too high above all many financial advisers are reminding folks to rebalance investment portfolios trimming holdings of the strongest performing asset classes or stock sectors back to their long term targets a long run up in share prices like the one seen over the past few years typically leads to heavier than normal stock weightings for investors who dont rebalance that can leave portfolios overexposed to sharp downturns in the market to be sure few analysts are predicting a doomsday scenario many strategists feel the economy and the market still have some steam left in them but they stress that investors should be more cautious than theyve been in years past that may sound like just the ticket to investors made queasy by the markets recent volatility the market was uncharacteristically blase in and with the dow clocking just and days respectively of daily moves of or more up or down that trend changed abruptly this summer from june through august the dow had days of or greater moves the figure for to date analysts expect the volatility to continue over the past years the dow has averaged daily moves of or more making and exceptions not the norm investors who have grown accustomed to frequently checking their k balance online should try to change their ways advisers say scale back to a quick peek once a month since high volatility means the daily balance wont provide much intelligence but will add lots of stress history offers limited guidance as to how long the recovery from a correction will be since the dow has seen corrections drops of to within a bull market there have been bear markets or drops of or more all of which obviously started as corrections the average time for the dow to recover from a bear market was about three years from the low point when it was a simple correction the market recovered and climbed above its previous peak within six months on average only two corrections since have needed more than a year to recover and even then the dow was back to its former high within two years and if the corrections and bear markets are taken together the average recovery time is just a year and four months good news for the many investors who have a much longer time horizon looking ahead to "i dont think its a good time to be aggressive " says david joy chief market strategist at riversource investments after several years of economic expansion he suggests investors slowly build more conservative portfolios people may want to trim exposure to consumer discretionary stocks such as retailers which take their lumps with the economy and have decent exposure to industrials that are poised to benefit from economic growth abroad and to health care which is a fairly resilient category as in recent years advisers say investors should hedge their bets on the u s economy by looking overseas for buying opportunities the rising commodity prices that can hurt growth in the u s will benefit many emerging markets countries and a falling dollar will help returns in foreign company stocks when they are translated back into dollars "anything that an investor feels comfortable with in the u s they should probably have a similar exposure to in the foreign markets " says lee schultheis chief investment strategist at aip funds in white plains n y an investor who thinks u s financial stocks present some smart opportunities because theyve been beaten down recently for example might want to buy an equal stake in financial stocks in europe or asia among u s stocks investors should consider favoring larger companies with strong growth prospects rather than bargain
