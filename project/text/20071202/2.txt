eyes on the road technology allows monitoring of teen drivers raising questions finding a balance between privacy rights and preventing unnecessary accidents online edition ever wanted to know what your teenage driver is doing with the car right now technology that gives parents the answer is poised to make the jump into the mainstream if some big car insurers can resolve worries about privacy you might already be aware that a small number of auto insurance companies are starting to offer systems that can monitor how a car is being driven either by capturing and transmitting digital data about speed or location or capturing video of the driver they are promoting these systems to consumers as a way to keep tabs on a newly licensed teenage driver some of these systems use gps devices to gather and transmit information about the vehicles location and speed other systems offer speed location braking and other data plus video of the driver and passengers all of them speak directly to parents fears about their kids shaky judgment behind the wheel these fears are well founded based on the statistics about teen drivers and accidents "the highest crash risk is when they first begin to drive without the parent in the vehicle " says anne mccartt senior vice president for research at the insurance institute for highway safety "we do believe these devices have potential in helping teens to learn safe driving behaviors and correct unsafe driving behavior faster than they would otherwise " in vehicle monitoring systems have been in use for some time among truck fleets and some company car fleets the emergence of these virtual back seat driver systems to keep watch over teens is relatively recent but there are signs the concept is gaining momentum last march american family insurance of madison wis launched a three state test of what it calls the "teen safe driver program " in a partnership with drivecam inc a supplier of in vehicle video technology american family offered consumers a system that records video of a drivers behavior and captured other data about the cars behavior such as swerving or hard braking in the case of say a sudden sharp braking maneuver the system stores video from seconds surrounding the event that video is then sent to an "analysis center " not operated by american family there american family says analysts comment on what happened and rate the incident by its level of risk parents and teens can log on to a web site www teensafedriver com to review the video now that three state test has been expanded to all of the mostly midwestern and western states in which american family operates one factor in that decision was research from the university of iowa that indicated the monitors and the "coaching" it made possible by confronting parents and teens with video evidence of driving goofs significantly reduced risky incidents one fascinating finding of the iowa study only seven of the teens monitored were responsible for the bulk of potentially dangerous driving mistakes in the test of the teens from a rural iowa high school had a rate of "safety relevant events" every miles but the other seven recorded events per miles almost times the rate of the safer kids according to the study the drivers including the worst seven then spent nine weeks living with the video camera in their cars getting "feedback" about driving mistakes from a blinking light in the car the teens and parents also got a weekly disc with video clips of their mistakes the bad drivers recorded a reduction in "safety relevant events" after this period of being confronted by their mistakes this suggests that an " " rule is in operation with teen drivers and that tools that change the behavior of just a few very bad young drivers could save a lot of expense and more important pain and heartache the iowa researchers are now conducting a larger test in minneapolis right now american family isnt offering discounts to customers who put cameras in their cars according to steve witmer a spokesman for american family the company is still gathering data to be sure that the actual claims experience justifies a price break thats one issue for insurers an equally important issue thats giving insurers pause is privacy state farm the leading auto insurer is testing the idea of onboard monitors but the company isnt offering such a product and privacy concerns are a big reason why a company spokesman says at rival allstate corp roger parker assistant vice president of consumer driven innovation says the company is taking onboard monitoring quite seriously but hasnt worked out the best way yet to roll out a product that overcomes privacy concerns "consumers are very worried about privacy issues and big brother issues " says parents may want to know what their teens are up to in the car he says but they probably dont want the insurance company to know or to have the power to use information to penalize them by for instance denying a claim based on video recorded stupidity moreover annoying a teen with intrusive technology today could mean losing an adult paying customer tomorrow something allstate doesnt want to do "if we avoid the temptation for the insurance company to know more about you but use technology to empower people we can accomplish a lot " mr parker says for example he says allstate employees including himself have tested a system that buzzes a cellphone when the car is exceeding a set speed limit mr parker says a timely digital prod during a recent drive probably saved him a speeding ticket allstate which insures about million cars in states isnt offering a teen monitoring system now but within a year mr parker says the company plans to offer "several different products" for consumers as well as commercial accounts as insurers develop solutions for the privacy issue and the cost of the hardware goes down mr parker says he expects on board vehicle monitoring will get big fast "we think it could be huge " he says send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
