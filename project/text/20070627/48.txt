fiscally fit calling all seven year olds a friend of terris son gets a cellphone but isnt the junior set too young for that online edition "whats the right age for a cellphone " thats the question my print colleague tom weber raised earlier this week in the juggle the online journals blog about balancing work and family tom and his wife were debating the merits of getting their eight year old daughter a cellphone to make it easier to keep in touch the question hit home for my husband gerry and me because one of our sons seven year old friends recently began sporting his own phone when i first noticed the cellphone attached to the waistband of jakes shorts i thought it was a toy then one day jakes mom called him and i couldnt help but roll my eyes a real cellphone before hes eight gerry and i are already inundated with pleas from our son for the latest trendy and pricey sneakers etnies are his current obsession so i feared jakes new accessory would quickly lead to gerald demanding a phone of his own jakes cellphone to me was another example of a parent giving in to a childs desire to raise the stakes in the kids endless effort to out cool one another turns out i shouldnt have rushed to judgment as we sat together at a recent basketball game i casually mentioned the cellphone to jakes mom and she immediately set me straight "we did not buy the cellphone because he wanted one " she said "we bought it because we felt he needed one " most of my sons friends live just a few houses away but not jake his house is more than five blocks off and near a state highway this is the first year jakes parents have given him permission to ride his bike alone to our neighborhood to play with his friends in the past his parents would walk along with him or drop him off by car jakes newfound independence hasnt been easy for them on a couple of occasions weve received panicked phone calls after he failed to check in when he got to our house another time he biked far beyond where his parents had allowed him to go and through a busy intersection to visit a friend in a different neighborhood thats when jakes dad a self described tech geek suggested they buy jake one of the new cellphones geared toward young children phones offered by cellphone providers such as at&amp t verizon wireless and disney mobile use gps technology to locate the childs cellphone when jakes parents check their cellphone they can instantly tell where jake is in the neighborhood assuming of course that the cellphone is with him charged and turned on jakes folks have also subscribed to a cellphone service that sends alerts when jake strays from certain predetermined areas such as our neighborhood or the schoolyard the service isnt cheap but being able to track jakes whereabouts and be in immediate contact with him when necessary has given them greater peace of mind particularly since they have a kindergartener and a newborn to keep tabs on as well their reasoning made me think back to the arguments gerry and i have had about how much freedom to allow our son gerald was barely seven when gerry first allowed him to ride his bike around the corner and i would often panic if it took more than a few minutes for him to circle the block then there was the creek incident last year the boys moms and i have a "hand off" arrangement when the kids leave one house to go play at another they have to call home to let their parents know where they are on their way home from one boys house to ours the kids took a detour and ventured far down into a nearby creek bed to chase frogs when no hand off call came anxiety ensued until we finally tracked them down waist deep in mud and neck deep in trouble gerry wasnt as concerned we live in his childhood home so he grew up playing in that creek cellphones i realized could do more than just solve the "wheres waldo" problem of keeping track of a pack of boys constantly on the move they could also help kids learn to manage time and money turning the question over in my head i decided that before id ever give gerald a cellphone wed first sit down with the details of the plan how much it cost and how many minutes hed be allowed to use each month then wed break that monthly minute allotment down into a daily figure so gerald would know that minutes meant hed generally be limited to using minutes a day once limits were set for cellphone time the cost of any additional minutes used or any games or ringtones downloaded would come out of geralds allowance and id make sure he knew how much it would cost to replace the phone should it get damaged lost or stolen then id sit down and show him all the capabilities of the device pointing out functions such as internet access that would be off limits id make sure to review our cellphone bills with gerald each month pointing out any unexpected fees wed also make sure he understood the importance of keeping the phone properly charged a dead cellphone is the same as paying for a gym membership but never going to the gym to teach him to be responsible for the phone wed include "charge the phone" in his evening ritual of brushing book and bed by taking these steps gerald might see how well he or she was managing cellphone time and money wed set firm ground rules for when and where the cell can be used calling your friend after school sure texting your friend from church no way wed also need to abide by geralds schools policy on cellphones right now our school has a complete ban on kids carrying any type of electronic device but some parents want an exception for cellphones for many of the same reasons jakes parents had pick ups would be easier if the child had a cell to keep in touch and the key to instilling responsible use of a cellphone by a child is to crack down when its used irresponsibly when gerald understands that the phone is a privilege and not a right he may think twice before breaking rules and risking loss of phone service at least that was how i mapped out the rules in my head but then i held back parents responding to the post on the juggle complained of children who couldnt manage to charge their phones didnt answer them or found them a big expensive distraction and i kept coming back to my initial reaction does a pre teen really need a cellphone ultimately its up to the parents to decide that as well as whether their child is mature enough to handle the responsibility i remember the thrill of getting a landline phone in my bedroom with my own phone number for my th birthday much like pierced ears i viewed it as a rite of passage into adulthood for my parents the second line meant id stop hogging the main line after thinking it through i decided gerald should wait until his teens to get his own phone i understand the appeal for jakes parents and other parents who want an easier way to stay in close touch with their children but for now well keep using our old school hand off system eventually gerald and his friends will start venturing farther afield and well reconsider a cellphone if peer pressure doesnt force the issue before then so far weve been lucky on that score the novelty of jakes phone faded when the boys discovered it was programmed so jake could only talk to his mom and dad sheesh wheres the fun in that is seven too young for a child to carry a cellphone how do you teach your child to properly manage cellphone use write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com and then come join me in a discussion about kids and cellphones or join me and your fellow readers in a continuing discussion
