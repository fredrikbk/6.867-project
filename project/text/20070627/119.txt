the informed patient tackling tube misconnections hospitals scramble to prevent errors redesign devices for adults and children hooked up to a tangle of tubes and catheters in the hospital the risk that someone will inadvertently hook the wrong line to the wrong device or medication is a nightmare scenario an air hose accidentally connected to an intravenous line can create an air bubble that leads to a fatal embolism or an infants feeding solution inadvertently infused into the bloodstream instead of through the nose or stomach can cause severe brain damage and death now with growing concern about a small but steady number of cases each year hospitals government agencies and safety organizations are scrambling for solutions the most significant initiative is being led by premier inc the purchasing alliance of hospitals around the country which is educating staffers on how to avoid misconnection errors and working with medical device makers to redesign equipment so that the connectors linking iv lines and feeding tubes arent compatible with each other a number of groups are also looking at creating technical standards that could be used in designing safer tubing and connection systems the main concern experts say is the use of a universal connection system known as a luer fitting with "male" and "female" components that are designed to fit together often with a locking mechanism to join together a broad range of devices with totally different functions because they are commonly used on iv feeding and respiratory equipment patients are at risk for example if they are receiving fluids through a vein feedings via a stomach tube and getting air through an oxygen mask "nearly all tubings have the same connection and in a busy and fast paced health care environment with many interruptions misconnections are made and patients die from it " says gina pugliese vice president of premiers safety institute which offers free safety resources on its web site www premierinc com safety though there are no precise statistics to compare errors on an annual basis misconnections are generally underreported according to the nonprofit joint commission which accredits hospitals though many errors are caught in time to avoid harm last year the joint commission issued an alert to hospitals warning that misconnections are a "persistent and potentially deadly occurrence " citing nine cases of misconnections seven in adults and two in infants eight of which led to death and another to serious disability two more cases have been reported in the past year to the joint commission another nonprofit group that collects such data u s pharmacopeia found more than tubing misconnection cases between and and says that since then there have probably been more cases the errors include intravenous infusions connected to epidural lines bladder irrigation solutions connected to central iv catheters infusions intended for intravenous administration connected to nasal tubes and intravenous solutions sent through urinary tract epidural and kidney dialysis catheters gas can be inadvertently delivered through liquid lines and vice versa and cables connected to power sources can be confused leading to patient burns and even electrocution the nonprofit institute for safe medication practices has reported several cases in which the tubing from a portable blood pressure monitoring device was inadvertently connected to the patients iv line in one case leading to a fatal air embolism in another case a child receiving medication via a nebulizer to treat asthma died after a staff member accidentally reconnected the oxygen tubing to the injection port of an iv tube and last year a pregnant woman in a wisconsin hospital died when a nurse mistakenly administered an epidural anesthetic intravenously but staffers often catch such errors in one case an air supply hose from a compression device was inadvertently hooked up to a needle less iv tubing port but the device was turned off and the misconnection was found before any harm occurred the potential for error is of special concern for newborn intensive care units where solutions or medications intended for the feeding tube can be given via the wrong route causing a life threatening situation permanent injury or death premier asked manufacturers to come up with better designs for newborn and pediatric patients first the first company to step up to the plate with a redesign was feeding systems maker viasys healthcare inc which was recently acquired by cardinal health inc the company partnered with baxa corp a maker of syringes to create a feeding system with syringes tubes and newly shaped connectors that when used together are incompatible with luer connectors on ivs and other kinds of tubes the food and drug administration approved the components which hospitals need to buy separately viasys says the cost is "competitive" with what hospitals are currently using nancy pratt the senior vice president of clinical effectiveness at premier member sharp healthcare in san diego who worked with the manufacturers says the next step is similar redesigns for systems used on adult patients "coming up with designs to prevent hazards should be a no brainer " she says "it is inconceivable to me that in we still dont have a connector that doesnt plug into an iv " the fda which says luer misconnections remain a significant public health issue recently asked the beaumont technology usability center a unit of the william beaumont hospital in royal oak mich to develop education tools to help hospitals deal with misconnection issues and make staffers aware of their impact on patient safety the tools will be distributed on the fdas medical product surveillance network medsun net "its important to educate hospitals and make everyone aware of the problem but unless we physically change the design there will still be mistakes because of all the distractions in a clinical environment " says izabella gieras beaumonts director of technology management still there are many serious misconnection risks for which no design standards or guidelines exist according to stephanie joseph a project engineer at ecri an independent nonprofit health services research agency that has investigated accidents involving misconnections and offers guidelines on prevention among them identify the most common risks in each hospital unit require staffers to trace each line to its source before connecting it to another tube and position different lines on different sides of the patient so there is less clutter and it is easier for clinicians to correctly identify and connect them appropriately email informedpatient wsj com
