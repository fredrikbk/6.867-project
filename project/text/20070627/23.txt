can pixar cook up a hit with a rat in the kitchen pixars pantheon of animated superstars includes lovable toy cowboys insecure superheroes and wisecracking fish now the walt disney co unit is adding a more unlikely character to its roster a rodent chef "ratatouille " which opens friday may be pixars toughest sell yet not only is the star a rodent and a very ratty one at that not an anthropomorphic mickey mouse he also spends most of the movie in the one place no one wants to see him a kitchen then theres that mouthful of a title and a plot that focuses on decidedly adult themes of fine dining and gourmet cooking with lots of references to fancy cheeses and fine red wines that flow generously throughout the family film pixar has a track record of generating family friendly hits and the new movie has gotten positive reviews still there are signs that getting the word out on the new film is more of a struggle than usual in a move seen in hollywood as an admission that pixar has a challenge on its hands in a competitive summer disney recently held more than sneak preview screenings of the film on a saturday night such tactics are usually reserved for films that studios believe need an extra boost "its not an easy film to sum up " says director brad bird "disney decided that the best advertisement for the film was the film itself " the sneaks may have helped firms that track potential moviegoers reported a jump in awareness and interest in the movie still "ratatouille" has a lot to live up to from s "toy story " on through "finding nemo " "monsters inc " and "cars " all of pixars movies have grossed well over &# million domestically any pixar release that fails to make it to that lofty level will undoubtedly cause worries about whether disney overpaid for pixar in its &# billion acquisition of the company last year "ratatouille" follows the ambitions of remy a rat and expert cook who befriends linguini a dishwasher and would be chef in the kitchen of a once leading parisian restaurant former pixar director jan pinkava came up with the idea and spent several years working on it but three quarters of the way through pixar decided to switch directors bringing in a rising star mr bird fresh off "the incredibles " immediately mr bird took a knife to the project rewriting the script cutting scenes and killing off characters he replaced all but two lines in the dialogue he also simplified the story to focus on remy and linguini the overhaul was all the more demanding because he was determined to stick to the original timetable giving him months to finish the movie mr bird says he wanted to embrace the premise rather than dance around it he decided to make the rats look more rat like giving them longer tails and putting many of them on four legs rather than two instead of avoiding the kitchen these rats take it over making it a bigger focus of the story "if movies are supposed to be about characters overcoming obstacles what greater obstacle than this " he says the animation team did extensive research to get the kitchen scenes right including taking cooking classes the movie goes into great detail on the workings of a gourmet kitchen with a budget of around &# million the movie needs to draw in a broad audience but mr bird says he never considered making the movie more overtly kid friendly "it sounds heartless but that never really is a factor " he says "im pleased children are part of the audience but i dont make a single decision based on what a kid would or wouldnt get in the movie " he adds "kids are ways smarter than most filmmakers think they are " when he first came on board the movie a year and a half ago mr bird says pixar founder steve jobs was questioning whether they should change the title because it may be hard for people to pronounce they came up with some alternatives such as "rats " and "chefs tail " but at a meeting at apple inc where mr jobs is chief executive mr bird successfully argued that they should stick with "ratatouille " because "its french its food and its got rat in it " mr bird suggested that they make the pronunciation part of the ad campaign the advertising which emphasizes pixars past hits and featured a nine minute clip from the movie online includes "rat a too ee" below the title mr bird jokes that perhaps "by the end of the summer people might be able to pronounce" the title a merchandise campaign was also a challenge they settled on a modest rollout that for the first time includes branded wine sold at costco wholesale corp carrefour sa also has "ratatouille" branded cheese and other foods and high end kitchen store sur la table is selling "ratatouille" cookware and tableware for kids mr bird says the challenges of selling "ratatouille" remind him of a previous movie he did "the iron giant " distributed by warner bros that movie a complex tale about a giant alien robot who befriends a boy didnt do well at the box office but mr bird says hes confident "ratatouille" will do better because "the disney marketing team is the best on the planet at selling this stuff "
