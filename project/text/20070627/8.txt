ancient midwestern mysteries and efforts to preserve them about years ago a tribe of indians in ohio built a stone fence around the top of a hill nobody knows who they were or why they did it yet their structure still stands near the no stoplight town of bourneville on a summit the locals call spruce hill the little wall of bourneville isnt in the same league as the great wall of china but its an interesting specimen of the mysterious mound building culture that thrived in north america long before settlers landed at jamestown parts of that culture are preserved at places such as hopewell culture national historical park in ohio and effigy mounds national monument in iowa yet much of it has been lost either dug up by pot hunters and tomb raiders or plowed beneath the soil by farmers who like their fields flat spruce hill has more or less survived these threats although crops have grown on it and builders have removed some of its stones it remains an obvious feature on the landscape on june however spruce hill was scheduled to go to auction sold to the highest bidder be it a real estate developer or a timber company with time ticking short a group of preservationists stepped forward and signed a contract to buy the acre site from its private owner they now have until july to raise &# so far theyve brought in about &# "theyre succeeding in the face of long odds " says gary merkamp a ross county park administrator who helped bring the two parties together "its close to a miracle " three months ago the leaders of the highlands nature sanctuary a conservation group thats organizing the campaign to save spruce hill didnt even know the property was about to become available in the weeks that followed they struggled against not only a tight deadline but also a public thats only dimly aware of the ancient mound builders and what they left behind when it comes to the new worlds pre columbian architecture glamorous aztec and mayan sites such as tenochtitlan and chichen itza bask in attention in the u s southwestern cliff dwellings and pueblos such as mesa verde in colorado and chaco canyon in new mexico are tourist magnets the earthworks of eastern north america by contrast arent well understood or appreciated there are a few possible exceptions the mini metropolis of cahokia a few miles from st louis in illinois is one of unescos world heritage sites it features a collection of age old mounds and other structures including a foot tall pyramid and a reconstructed astronomical observatory known as woodhenge in ohio the great serpent mound is at once inscrutable and seductive in louisiana the much eroded poverty point hints at archaic splendor yet the vast majority of these sites are isolated and unvisited over the years ive laid eyes on two or three dozen of them in parks from minnesota to mississippi on just about every occasion ive had the mounds virtually to myself even the grandest of them suffer from the stubborn fact that theyre essentially heaps of dirt still theyre impressive in their enigmatic way the prehistoric people who built them with simple tools put enormous effort into these projects and theyve lasted across centuries some mounds are conical crypts that rise to elevations of more than feet others including the walls at spruce hill are only a few feet tall but form large interlocking squares and circles several appear to track the movement of the sun and moon but their fundamental purpose remains a puzzle archaeologists probably wont ever solve the riddle of their meaning except to describe them as "ceremonial " which is one of their professions catch all terms in ohio mounds are so common that theyve been incorporated into golf courses mound builders country club in newark and baseball fields indian mounds park in columbus the majority of those that still exist however are out of sight unmarked or on private property some are even deliberately hidden researchers are reluctant to publish maps because they dont want to encourage grave robbers as david la vere notes in "looting spiro mounds " a new book about the s destruction of a complex in oklahoma this is an old challenge spruce hill has benefited from benign neglect although it was discovered and surveyed in the th century it wasnt until that scholars confirmed its age "its pretty much a blank slate " says jarrod burks a columbus based archaeologist who hopes to conduct a geophysical analysis with a magnetometer and ground penetrating radar "the site is unusual because so much of it is made of stone " there have been previous attempts to buy spruce hill and officials with the national park service have expressed an interest in acquiring it the property came on the market so suddenly however that the federal government couldnt move fast enough "we cant purchase anything without congressional approval " says dean alexander superintendent of hopewell culture national historical park in chillicothe several national nonprofit groups also lacked the versatility to jump in so mr alexander contacted larry henry and nancy stranahan to see if they might play a role theyre co directors of the highlands nature sanctuary which tries to protect unique ecological areas in southern ohio "i went to the hill and did a botanical blitz " says mr henry "the flora was beyond belief " because they have no experience in dealing with sites such as spruce hill theyre flower people not archaeologists mr henry and ms stranahan teamed up with paul gardner the midwest regional director of the archaeological conservancy which purchases and protects threatened sites in the u s they put up a web page and activated their donor networks if they fall short of their &# goal they plan to take out a loan buy the hill and continue fund raising in the future they hope to turn spruce hill into a jointly managed public park the national park service might operate acres on the top including the earthworks earlier this month a house subcommittee heard testimony on a bill that would allow the nps to acquire the property wildlife conservationists would be in charge of the slopes the ross county government might chip in as well ideally there would be a parking lot at the base of the hill and trails with interpretive markers leading to its peak if spruce hill appears to be headed toward a happy ending the same cant be said for other ancient sites in the same area the earthworks at cedar bank just a few miles away are visible from a nearby road but they also sit on privately owned land thats much more valuable than spruce hill its probably only a matter of time before bulldozers level it completely unless of course some plucky preservationists tap into additional philanthropic dollars and guarantee that it too will continue to endure mr miller writes for national review and is the author of "a gift of freedom "
