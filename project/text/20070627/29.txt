cellphones get wi fi adding network options vacationing in oregon recently rob mahoney was having cellphone reception trouble his signal from at&amp t inc was so weak he couldnt browse the web so he tried plan b pressing a few buttons to turn off the smart phones cellular connection and turning on its built in wi fi connection instead soon the year old retiree from temecula calif was surfing the web over the free wi fi network provided by his bed and breakfast it was "as if i were on a laptop computer not a phone " he says mr mahoney is at the forefront of a new trend running cellphones on wi fi the technology which extends landline internet connections over radio frequencies within limited ranges is already very popular with laptop users now handset manufacturers want to bring it to cellphones as well allowing customers to surf at higher speeds and in some cases even make calls when their phones are near a hot spot while high end wi fi smart phones have been available for several years manufacturers of popular handsets are increasingly making the technology standard apple inc s iphone scheduled to make its debut on at&amp t friday will use wi fi to let users browse youtube and other content at much faster speeds than at&amp ts cellular network allows deutsche telekom ags t mobile usa is launching a service today with phones from nokia corp and samsung electronics co that will automatically transfer cellphone calls onto wi fi networks when users have access to them at home or at one of the companys hot spots t mobile plans to offer similar features on other devices including a blackberry from research in motion ltd later this year according to people familiar with the matter operators have resisted selling wi fi phones in the past fearing that such devices would eat into revenue from voice and data plans by allowing customers to cut back on cellular network usage they also worried that wi fi could become a trojan horse for third party services that allow cheap or free internet calling while such mobile internet calling services arent widely available to date they do exist ebay inc offers a mobile version of its skype service for windows mobile phones that has been downloaded more than five million times the iphone wont include any software for making wi fi calls but skype and other companies say they are interested in developing such services if apple will allow them while some carriers explicitly ban users from making web calls over their own high speed "g" networks operators dont currently have the technology to easily detect and block users from doing so over wi fi some carriers though are starting to warm to the technology seeing it as a complement not a substitute to their networks they think wi fi can help them ease network congestion as mobile media applications like video hog more of their expensive bandwidth and some are finding ways to use wi fi to their advantage offering wi fi based voice calls as a premium service in any case much of the mobile industry believes mobile wi fi is here to stay by nearly a quarter of all handsets shipped world wide will have wi fi according to abi research up from just in "wi fi is becoming just another network consumers can access on their phones " says jim balsillie co chief executive of research in motion wi fi phones detect that they are in range of a wi fi connection in much the same way that a laptop does tapping the network generally requires the user to hit a button selecting the wi fi mode some operators will automatically switch users on to whatever connection is stronger cellular or wi fi without them knowing using wi fi on a phone can carry benefits like faster connections and stronger access in areas with weak cell reception including remote college and corporate campuses users could also scale back their voice and data plans if they used wi fi instead of cellular service but using wi fi on a phone comes with other hassles likely to keep users from scrapping their cellular plans entirely wi fi can sap a phones battery life significantly and because its coverage is fairly localized users could get kicked off while trying to use the connection over long distances to address these concerns operators are developing a variety of technologies and services some of which try to handle the handoff between wi fi and cellular connections more seamlessly t mobiles new service which will automatically transfer cellphone calls onto wi fi networks will have an introductory price of &# a month on top of a monthly calling plan and it will work initially with samsung and nokia wi fi handsets t mobile the most aggressive wi fi adopter hopes to eventually embed the functionality into most of its phones the phones will work with any home router but t mobile will sell two types free with a mail in rebate that it says will boost battery life and be easier to set up "weve made it really simple for the average consumer to use this technology " says joe sims t mobiles executive vice president of product development "they dont need to understand wi fi " other operators are being more cautious offering some phones with wi fi but stopping short of developing a separate service for calling verizon wireless which is jointly owned by verizon communications inc and vodafone group plc and at&amp t have both tested a t mobile like service that draws on technology embedded in phones to allow users to switch between wi fi and cellular connections for calling but neither has announced plans to deploy it at&amp t which has about hot spots says it sees wi fi as a convenient alternative when customers are out of range of the companys high speed network "we view wi fi as a complement to our broadband and high speed networks " says at&amp t spokesman mark siegel nokia this week announced that it plans to introduce two more wi fi handsets in the u s offering the devices which will retail for around &# to businesses through it distributors and to consumers directly through several online retailers to use the phones consumers can swap in a compatible sim card
