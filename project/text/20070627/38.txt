common sense ftc suit makes wild oats ripe target for arbitrageurs ive never recommended individuals join the ranks of arbitrageurs the professional investors who trade in the targets of merger and acquisition bids but im making an exception for wild oats markets the "super natural" food chain that is the target of a friendly merger bid from whole foods market why put simply the federal trade commissions suit to block the deal is the most harebrained antitrust action ive encountered in years ive recommended whole foods repeatedly over the years and own shares myself however my most recent recommendation dec was to sell the stock based on disappointing same store sales trends and weak guidance from management thats just as well since the shares then at about &# fell to &# yesterday a week closing low whole foods shares did see a positive blip on news of the proposed acquisition before resuming their downward trend then earlier this month the ftc sued to block the deal on antitrust grounds arguing that the combined company would "increase prices and reduce quality and services " to reach this conclusion the ftc had to define the relevant line of commerce as "premium natural and organic supermarkets " excluding everything else including grocery chains specialty food stores and wal mart stores since the suit was announced ive dropped into branches of major grocery store chains and all had prominent organic sections at least in new york city where i live the other chains have all improved their lighting cleanliness and freshness since whole foods came to town competition seems alive and well between the "premium" whole foods and everybody else as for wild oats the suit has put a cloud over the deal and as a result its shares fell to &# yesterday from just above &# in april the bid is for &# in cash per wild oats share it seems obvious that the relevant market is purveyors of groceries not just "premium natural and organic supermarkets " a market that encompasses only whole foods and wild oats virtually any merger could be blocked if markets were defined so narrowly after arguments on july a federal district court judge should give the ftc the lecture on real world competition and dismiss the complaint in that case wild oats shares should quickly jump to near &# thats a gain in little more than a month over annualized if you buy the stock and the deal still somehow falls through youll end up with wild oats shares how bad is that before the bid the stock was dragged down by the same factors that have hurt whole foods namely increased competition in organic foods from large retailers but even then shares got down only to about &# with consumer spending under pressure from oil prices and interest rates whole foods stock isnt likely to recover anytime soon but long term the stock is a good value james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsjcommon
