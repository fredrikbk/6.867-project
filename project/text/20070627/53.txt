florida department of law enforcement "this needs to be kept in perspective " said danielle courtenay spokeswoman for the orlando orange county convention &amp visitors bureau "we have million visitors who come here and the vast majority who come here have wonderful experiences " much of the crime that put orlando on the morgan quitno list is concentrated in a few poor neighborhoods in city limits but the perception that crime is spreading could depress tourism in the region many tourists dont know that most of the tourist destinations such as disney world are located outside the city

owner in orlando "the number of criminal events against tourists is minuscule however the crime in orlando is going up " in a recent chamber of commerce study the top worry among orlando citizens was violent crime "five or years ago you wouldnt see it in the top " said jim kitchens president of kitchens group an orlando public opinion research firm that has done surveys and focus groups on the subject now the justice department is sending bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and fbi special task forces into orlando after requests from the local fbi office and the acting u s attorney "i

attorney jim klindt of the middle district of florida in addition the local police department is launching a program that will put more desk officers out on patrol all this comes at a time when construction of hotels time shares and condo hotels is soaring in the area demand is driven in large part by the trend toward so called vacation ownership where consumers either own their hotel rooms or own the right to use them for a specified time orlando is also dependent on business travelers it is the second biggest convention market behind las vegas by number of visitors so far there is little evidence that tourism has suffered because of the crime and no tourist has been killed ms courtenay of the orlando orange county convention &amp visitors bureau said visits were up this spring

corzine who runs ucfs sociology department and studies crime in the area says two of last years murders were gang related but the parramore neighborhood and others seeing the spike have long had drug problems "theres been a change in what we would call street culture " he says "where it exists in the orlando area it has become more violent and in some cases more lethal " it has also gotten younger about two thirds of murder suspects are under mr corzine says and many have lengthy criminal records and have been in and out of jail sgt barbara jones a spokeswoman for the orlando police department says most of the crimes affecting tourists are burglaries "people come here the weathers beautiful they have a great time going to disney and then they go to their room and leave the door open " she
