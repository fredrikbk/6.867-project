ahead of the tape overseas shifts in treasury piles may help fed as federal reserve officials meet today and tomorrow to discuss the direction of interest rates they ought to consider again how foreign central banks are influencing the markets prices on u s treasury notes have risen in recent sessions sending their yields lower as skittishness over the troubles at two big bear stearns hedge funds sent investors scurrying for safety but for much of the year treasury prices have been trending lower pushing their yields higher over the past month the yield on the year treasury note has risen from to the performance of the economy is part of the story it appears to be absorbing the blows of a weak housing market better than expected market participants once thought the fed would cut short term interest rates sometime this year to breathe some life into the economy with the economy holding up they now look for the fed to keep its target overnight lending rate at the two day policy setting meeting that starts today should do little to change that view although the core rate of inflation which excludes food and energy prices has backed off recently the fed is concerned that low unemployment could push wages and therefore prices higher foreigners dont influence short term interest rates but they do affect long term interest rates in the past foreign buying of treasurys had the fed worried long term interest rates were being kept artificially low now foreign central banks could actually help alleviate the feds inflation worries by helping to boost long term rates the teeth of recent treasury selling which brought the yield on the year note to its highest level in five years came in the first part of this month for years developing countries with large trade surpluses have been parking export earnings in financial markets with the bulk going toward u s treasury securities and other low risk dollar denominated debt lately however theyve made incremental moves toward diversifying their holdings witness the stake china took in private equity firm blackstone group some countries such as india have also allowed their currencies to appreciate by more against the u s dollar which gives them a less pressing need to buy dollar denominated assets the waning appetite for treasury securities from central banks didnt hit home with the bond market until this month the amount of both treasurys and federal agency bonds held in custody at the new york federal reserve fell for two weeks in a row in the first two weeks of june these custody holding figures are very volatile but it was unusual to see them decline for two weeks in a row says economist brad setser especially since the central banks were opportunistic buyers in past bond market declines since the selloff the central banks have been buyers again pushing their treasury holdings back up but the message is that they may no longer be a backstop to the treasury market when selling intensifies the upshot is that long term rates will remain higher keeping a lid on the economy and inflation if the fed is worried about inflation it might not have to lift a finger send comments to justin lahart wsj com
