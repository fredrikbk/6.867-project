jaccuse the poisoning of alexander sasha litvinenko in london last november revealed the old monster of the soviet "evil empire" behind the benevolent facade of a new russia on his deathbed sasha named vladimir putin as the man behind his murder but next week president bush will entertain mr putin at his family home in maine repairing the damage as sashas friend and his widow we feel compelled to argue our case on sashas behalf sashas accusation was based on personal acquaintance with mr putin and deep knowledge of the culture he represents the fsb secret service rooted in the old kgb which hijacked the russian state after mr putin came to power after sashas death the detectives of scotland yard unearthed more evidence sasha was killed with polonium a radioactive substance manufactured in russia at the sarov facility the birthplace of soviet nuclear weapons the radioactive trail left by the killers identified former kgb officer andrei lugovoi as the likely perpetrator of the crime he was indicted in britain which has requested extradition but mr putin has refused to surrender mr lugovoi to british authorities and has called the extradition request "foolishness " his defiance is understandable mr lugovoi had no motive and no access to polonium if he talks he might name those who sent him on his deadly mission one likely motive for the killing is revealed by the kremlins own propaganda to frame sashas emigre friends the dissident tycoon boris berezovsky and the chechen leader akhmed zakayev the refusal of british courts to hand them over to russia had irritated mr putin to the point of obsession he called them terrorists and enacted legislation permitting fsb to eliminate "extremists" abroad even today notwithstanding the polonium evidence the kremlin continues to accuse sashas friends of murdering him a disinformation campaign that smacks of the old kgb as much as does the murder itself some say sashas killing could be the work of "rogue elements" in the fsb and was not necessarily officially sanctioned true the fsb had a long standing grudge against sasha who had collected evidence pointing at the fsbs role in the apartment bombings that provoked the chechen war and arguably helped mr putin win the presidency but fsb operatives have no access to polonium it is a short lived isotope which is produced by the russian atomic ministry transferring the poison to the fsb would have required interagency approval at the level of kremlin administration of course the kremlin itself is controlled by former fsb members making it hard to distinguish between "rogue elements" and a rogue state all of this does not prove mr putins personal culpability but it squarely puts the blame for sashas murder at the gates of the kremlin when mr bush treats mr putin to a family dinner he will probably dismiss these considerations and rely instead on his sense of his guests soul which he famously gained after having looked into his eyes a number of years ago he has used this in lieu of a russian policy ever since but the problem this time is different murder is absolute the president cannot possibly accept even a remote possibility that sashas allegations may be true by embracing mr putin he must be discounting them completely polonium and common sense notwithstanding by doing so he also brushes aside poloniums security aspect imagine somewhere in the depths of russia scientists in secret laboratories develop and test radioactive poisons that can be used against human targets polonium is as toxic as anthrax a gram is enough to kill a million people sasha received a lethal dose in one sip from a cup of tea which contained enough polonium to kill hundreds as many as innocent bystanders in and around london were contaminated if this is not nuclear terrorism then what is polonium is an ideal material for a "dirty bomb " if the kremlin has used it once there is no reason why it would not use it again or give it to someone else when it suits its purposes given continued endorsement of mr putin by americas president it is unlikely that sashas murderers will face justice in the immediate future we can only hope that the next administration will be less naive and see the danger coming from a regime that has used a radiochemical weapon in the center of a western capital that would be a form of justice for sasha too mr goldfarb and ms litvinenko are the authors of "death of a dissident the poisoning of alexander litvinenko and the return of the kgb " published by free press
