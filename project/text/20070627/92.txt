real estate finance reits weigh leverage levels typical low debt is debated after huge amounts are used in private equity acquisitions some real estate investment trusts are questioning whether they should pack on more debt in an era of highly leveraged acquisitions by private equity funds reits typically operate at relatively low levels of debt a legacy of the s and s when many highly leveraged real estate companies went belly up as interest rates soared when many of todays reits went public in the early s they had to keep debt levels low to win support from investors and analysts because reits pay out at least of their taxable income in the form of dividends investors wanted to be certain that these payments could be made "if you have higher leverage and a cyclical business when earnings go down maintenance of the dividend payments becomes a challenge " says david harris a reit analyst at lehman brothers low debt levels also allowed reits to fund opportunistic acquisitions by taking on more debt and then over time refinance the purchase and reduce the leverage level he adds but after private equity firms made big plays for reits this year using massive amounts of debt some have suggested that reits could start looking to increase their leverage levels blackstone group for instance bought equity office properties trust with about leverage according to green street advisors in newport beach calif at a reit industry conference this month doug linde chief financial officer of boston properties inc told investors the office reit is sitting on &# billion in cash and based on its taxable income in calendar year expects to pay out a special dividend in excess of &# million "we are at a leverage point today that is what i would consider to be grossly below where we would like to be on an operating basis " mr linde said according to lehman brothers estimates most reits have debt levels of between and in contrast many private long term holders of commercial real estate often leverage at while those that buy reits with the intent of selling off the assets fairly quickly have gone as high as "in the past few years reits have been grappling with how best to grow in the face of this wave of capital providing liquidity to the marketplace " says lisa sarajian a managing director in standard &amp poors structured finance group "they want to seek to manage their business more aggressively " low debt levels can impede reits ability to grow through acquisitions when theyre outbid by private equity investors employing higher levels of leverage analysts say in addition high rates of return on cash can be more easily achieved with higher leverage to be sure others wonder if having low leverage could work to the advantage of reits in todays environment of rising interest rates in recent months the costs of borrowing have gone up because of an increase in treasury bond yields on which loans are based and widening spreads of commercial mortgage backed securities pools of real estate loans that are sold to investors as bonds with rising interest rates reits with less debt could be better positioned to make opportunistic purchases analysts say they could also potentially take advantage of distressed selling by overleveraged buyers that paid top dollar for assets using cheap debt and that are scrambling to refinance as interest rates rise "wider credit spreads could now start to push some of the more highly levered players out of the private acquisitions market in turn benefiting some of the reits with dry powder on their balance sheets " says christy mcelroy a reit analyst at banc of america securities in new york bernie freibaum chief financial officer at general growth properties inc a chicago mall reit says having higher levels of debt hasnt been a liability the companys overall total leverage is in the range of to high by reit standards but mr freibaum says general growth just obtained a commitment for a &# million loan on a mall at a relatively attractive rate of "it is only those extremely high loan to value mortgage loans that are not available in the current environment " he says mr freibaum adds that debt service coverage a metric lenders use to ensure that borrowers have enough cash flow to pay their debt gives his company the security to make more highly levered deals having too much equity and not enough debt he adds could make a reit a takeover target for private investors and still others say the leverage debate is overblown mike kirby an analyst at green street says that leverage "is neither a good thing nor a bad thing" and that reits operating at " leverage have just as much going for them as those operating with higher levels " one might be able to get a higher yield with higher leverage he says but that yield is offset by the higher risk mr kirby doesnt think reits should blow off their debt covenants just because debt though rising in cost now has been cheap in recent years "this is cyclical a short window in time and over the long haul the reit formula of lower leverage has worked great "
