new route as competition rebounds southwest faces squeeze growth hits turbulence for low cost pioneer fuel hedges lose lift dallas for years southwest airlines managed to fly above the industrys storm clouds trouncing rivals with a hard to match formula of low costs and low fares now its facing a painful role reversal its revenue growth has slowed its costs are mounting and its resurgent rivals have torn key pages out of its playbook the shifting landscape has chief executive officer gary kelly contemplating such major changes as offering assigned seating and international flights for the first time and curtailing the companys rapid growth "the threat to our future is real " mr kelly wrote in a four page memo to his managers last month "now is the time to lead " during the slump in air travel that followed southwest was one of the few carriers to remain profitable its costs were far lower than those of its rivals and its web of primarily short haul domestic flights allowed it to operate more efficiently mr kelly shrewdly utilized financial hedging instruments to lock in low fuel prices saving southwest hundreds of millions of dollars as oil prices soared but many big competitors suffered severe financial losses and restructured in some cases in federal bankruptcy courts and the cost gap began narrowing southwests fuel hedges are growing less effective its rivals have reduced labor costs substantially helping them offer lower fares at a profit that in turn has left the aging work force of year old southwest among the highest paid in the industry in addition newer low cost airlines such as jetblue airways have grabbed many elements of southwests model while dangling enticements that southwest has resisted such as in flight television southwest is wrestling with a broader predicament in business when a companys competitive weapon is low costs and efficiency its vulnerable to rivals that respond by getting leaner themselves like southwest retailer wal mart stores inc and computer maker dell inc for example relied on low costs to grow rapidly now both are struggling to adjust to resurgent competition since mr kelly who is years old took over as chief executive of dallas based southwest three years ago he has boosted fares aggressively and raised employee productivity by but increasingly the airline appears boxed in by its strategy of frequent flights and rapid growth in a weak domestic market southwests cost advantage over competitors has narrowed its "unit cost" the cost per seat per mile flown was cents last year up from cents four years earlier by contrast the cost per seat mile at amr corp s american airlines excluding its regional affiliates was cents last year down from in southwest raised ticket prices six times last year which boosted its average fare by nearly double the pace of the prior year when southwest reported first quarter results in april however mr kelly indicated he had begun to see evidence that passengers are starting to resist fare increases the airlines "unit revenue" revenue per seat per mile flown didnt keep pace with the increase in unit costs first quarter net income rose to &# million but excluding one time fuel hedging gains net income fell to &# million down nearly from a year earlier the company said southwest probably wont hit its profit growth target this year mr kelly says although southwest is still profitable its stock has languished shares of airlines like american plunged in value several years ago then recovered over the past five years southwests stock has bounced around between about &# to &# a share its shares closed yesterday at &# in p m composite trading on the new york stock exchange mr kelly says he has little choice but to shake things up further "its time for a little remodeling " he says "we may need to bring in some new plays and that does carry some risk " the company may shed more light on its plans during a meeting with analysts today in new york since there is no futures market for jet fuel airlines buy contracts that lock in prearranged prices of crude and heating oil since those prices correlate closely with jet fuel prices profits on those contracts can be applied to buying jet fuel if not for its fuel hedges southwest would have lost money during eight of the past financial quarters according to j p morgan chase &amp co analyst jamie baker the company says only five would have been unprofitable and two "roughly break even " as its hedges become less effective southwest is facing big jumps in fuel costs increases that its largely unhedged rivals were harder hit by several years ago last year southwest paid about more per gallon of jet fuel on average than in the previous year while americans per gallon cost rose about according to southwest and americans financial disclosures in a report published last month by prudential equity group analyst bob mcadoo said southwests hedges have been masking other problems as the airline moved in recent years into higher cost airports such as philadelphia and denver since early southwest has continued to add flights to new routes that are consistent money losers in an effort to gain market share mr mcadoo said he calculated that losses have occurred in of the new routes added since that time "when youre waiting for a market to become profitable you dont put in a fifth or sixth flight " he said prudential equity group has eliminated its market research group since mr mcadoo published the report mr kelly says mr mcadoos report is "flawed " although he declines to elaborate he says southwest doesnt disclose profitability by route and that he believes in giving new markets ample time to make money mr kelly a native texan who is fond of jalapeno peppers with his dinner has been at southwest for years while serving as controller and chief financial officer he worked closely with co founder and executive chairman herb kelleher mr kelly developed southwests budgeting system in and was responsible for the airlines fuel hedging program he became ceo in july and quickly made his mark with some bold strategic moves southwest won an auction for assets of discount carrier ata airlines which was then operating under bankruptcy court protection but has since emerged southwest entered a "code share" agreement with ata that enabled the two carriers to expand their networks by selling tickets on one anothers flights that agreement has generated millions of dollars in revenue for southwest he also led a successful battle to overturn an arcane law that restricted long haul flights from dallass love field airport where southwest dominates service southwest executives say mr kelly has brought a new focus on quantifying the airlines performance under a continuing airport efficiency program that kicked off in phoenix two years ago employees with stopwatches have measured the time passengers have to wait to check in southwest has built customer loyalty with frequent daily flights between many of the cities it serves in states the flight frequency and the airlines lack of small jets also explain why its percentage of seats filled last year is below the industry average of mr kelly recently ordered his staff to get more aggressive about identifying underperforming flights with an eye toward shifting planes to more lucrative routes this summer the airline is using new software developed in house to squeeze more hours of flying time out of its fleet each day the equivalent of four new planes last week lehman brothers airline analyst gary chase noted that southwest has stopped selling seats on a number of long haul routes effective in october including flights from baltimore and philadelphia to both los angeles and oakland that is "leading us to believe that the company might significantly adjust or reduce some of its long haul flying later this year " mr chase said in a research note southwest has never offered assigned seating that wasnt an issue when southwests fares were hundreds of dollars cheaper than other airlines but now that the price gap has narrowed and mr kelly is trying to woo more demanding business travelers the airline is considering assigned seating southwest says it has already conducted tests that show this wouldnt slow the boarding process mr kelly says the airline is now testing a variety of boarding and seating concepts that could alter at least one southwest phenomenon passengers lining up long before their flights depart to get a decent seat some of the changes mr kelly is considering could be expensive without a guaranteed payoff southwest does not have entertainment systems on its planes relying on flight attendants to amuse passengers with their wit and sense of humor now that southwest is flying longer routes and some other discount airlines are offering entertainment systems mr kelly says that may no longer be sufficient he recently requested bids on in flight systems offering internet access and possibly movies or television the airline which might charge passengers for those services hopes to begin in flight testing early next year according to one person involved in the project southwest has never flown internationally but mr kelly has indicated that he wants to change that these days competitors like american airlines and continental airlines use lucrative international fares to help offset less profitable domestic fares southwest doesnt have the technology to book international itineraries but plans to have it by rather than fly its own jets mr kelly says southwest is likely to begin international service by offering flights through ata airlines that would enable southwest to avoid high international start up costs while garnering some new revenue mr kellys critics say he isnt acting quickly enough some contend that he should have curtailed growth months ago or begun charging fees for passenger conveniences lehmans mr chase says the problem lies elsewhere "the real problem is labor costs " he says "we dont see ancillary revenue as a sufficient fix for the problem " southwest which prides itself on being employee friendly is one of the only airlines that has not sought wage or benefit concessions from its workers the airline characterizes its work force as ultraproductive and pleasant to passengers if management seeks pay cuts it risks alienating employees who mr kelly calls the airlines "greatest weapon " mitch hall an in flight crew scheduling supervisor who started at southwest years ago as a mail worker says he was confident after that southwest wouldnt cut pay or lay off workers "there wasnt a doubt in my mind " he says adding that the company has always treated him well so hes going to "do them right " mr kelly says hed consider pay cuts a "management failure " it would be difficult for southwest to start charging fees for snacks and itinerary changes without appearing to contradict its credo not to nickel and dime its customers southwests ads have even poked fun at other airlines for various charges mr kelly maintains that southwest which has little debt and a strong balance sheet has time to address its cost problem he expects costs per seat mile flown will rise each year until when he expects them to level off by then he says his plans for more revenue should be in full swing for now he continues to advocate growth during a question and answer session he held this month in dallas with about southwest managers one of them asked why southwest continues to buy new planes mr kelly said he fears that if southwest doesnt enter new markets in time competitors will get there first in his memo last month to managers mr kelly signaled the airline would slow growth if its profit trends didnt improve by the third quarter but growing slowly he wrote "jeopardizes our employees job security " he said he expects managers to find new ways to cut costs "communicate with your people talk about waste continuously control spending " he wrote mr kelly says that "little bittie incremental improvements arent going to solve" the airlines problem "we cant do it overnight "
