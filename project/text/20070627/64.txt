last of the old guards operas san francisco opera don giovanni tomorrow and saturday iphigenie en tauride friday der rosenkavalier tonight and sunday san francisco the san francisco opera company is winding up its season the first under the general direction of david gockley although essentially set in place by his predecessor with performances of three productions during the month of june all three of which one may see in the week ahead the first in a dark death haunted victorian symbolist production borrowed from brussels top hats long black dresses lots of skulls and tombstones is a musically and for the most part dramatically pleasing production of mozarts "don giovanni" directed by david mcvicar and very sympathetically conducted by music director donald runnicles the eight solo parts are played by singers you have probably never heard of although polish baritone mariusz kwiecien who creates a giovanni both convincingly seductive and convincingly evil has sung mozarts lecherous aristocrats in major houses around the world four of the eight are graduates of the companys merola training program which provided some of the best singing and acting of the season one of the "merolini " elza van den heever a young soprano from south africa took over the role of donna anna on three days notice and sings it beautifully but there is not a weak link owen graduss leporello is swaggering and self assured the young lovers luca pisaroni and claudia mahnke are persuasively young and in love the coloratura passages for anna elvira twyla robinson and ottavio charles castronovo are all managed with precision and grace duets and ensembles blend into a dreamlike mozartean vessel sailing atop the orchestras finely shaped waves glucks late opera "iphigenie en tauride" is an important work in the history of music that melts the hearts of music lovers with different tastes than mine san francisco finally got around to it this month in a new production the company owns jointly with lyric opera of chicago where it opened last september and covent garden in london where it will start the autumn season like our new "don giovanni " this "iphigenie" producer robert carsen designer tobias hoheisel is an almost all black production set inside a dark gray box with a steeply sloping floor at the suddenly happy ending the walls lift up to reveal a world of white light outside the names of characters from the greek legend borrowed from euripides are chalked on the walls and floor like giant graffiti symbolic swords corpses and pools of black blood are spilled about thirty dancers in black when they are not playing dead mime old murders or mill about as furies pursuing orestes iphigenias brother who killed their mother because she killed their father because she thought he had killed their daughter if you look to opera for potent drama intensified by richly colored music representing a variety of emotions this may not be the one for you the swooning lugubrious action comes to life only halfway through act four when brother and sister finally recognize each other just as she is about to sacrifice him to the gods although gluck could write heartbreakingly moving and dramatically pertinent arias and orchestral passages of great tenderness and force patrick summers conducted his musicians with dutiful respect i find the first half of this opera much too austere with its dreary variations on sad simple themes the second half picks up a bit despite all the corpses the singers have to keep climbing over and a ridiculously prolonged argument between orestes and his best buddy pylades over who gets to die first each of the three leads susan graham as iphigenia bo skovhus as orestes and paul groves as pylades has a magnificent and memorable voice each is given before the end some beautiful music to sing the most joyful offering of the san francisco season is a nearly flawless production of richard strausss "der rosenkavalier" set in thierry bosquets re creations of alfred rollers neo rococo box set designs for the prague premiere of what makes the production so outstanding is the fact that everything works and works together the sets costumes also after roller and lighting seem to be created by the rich overripe score interpreted with alternating tenderness and gusto by mr runnicles although the mob scenes of act iii always present a problem i have rarely seen the complex serio comic stage movement and personal interactions so well managed credit here to stage director sandra bernhard reintepreting the seven year old concept of lotfi mansouri and elisabeth soderstroem our original leads here are new and nordic with the exception of kansas born joyce didonato a marvelous singer who incarnates octavian a love smitten young man with great charm and conviction soile isokoski from finland is a regal troubled if not yet fully matured marschallin who is handing over her year old boy toy to the even younger sophie angelically sung by miah persson from sweden baron ochs the oafish falstaffian lecher who precipitates the farcical scenes was far more wisely controlled than usual in the hands of kristinn sigmundsson from iceland who also plays the commendatore in "don giovanni " martina serafin from vienna will sing the marschallin in the final two performances even though i have not yet heard ms serafin this production is so admirably wrought that i advise anyone in or near san francisco to try to see it early in the season two operas were presented here as vehicles for star sopranos verdis "un ballo in maschera" for deborah voigt slimmed down but still vocally ravishing and puccinis "manon lescaut" for karita mattila one of the worlds most convincing singing actresses both were a delight to hear again but both were surrounded by minor league singers in productions unworthy of their talents the night i attended this companys "tristan und isolde " which used the brightly colored cartoon like david hockney sets slightly refined over years the magic didnt happen except in mr runnicles superlative orchestra but hearing christine brewer sing the role of isolde a second time seven months later in the los angeles philharmonics long in progress "tristan project" peter sellarss failed attempt to combine a semi concert version of wagners opera with a pretentious and often irrelevant big screen slow motion video by bill viola i learned that when the stars are properly aligned she can be one of the worlds greatest living isoldes the best thing i heard the los angeles opera do last year was renee fleming in "la traviata " a chance for californians to learn why such a fuss was made over her met debut in the role in i have seen different violettas beginning with licia albaneses years ago ms flemings was the best the first season of david gockleys own making in san francisco starting in september will feature out of productions never seen here before his new broom sweeps very clean including the premiere of philip glasss "appomattox " the west coast premiere at uc berkeley of rachel portmans "the little prince " our first handel "ariodante " and the start of francesca zambellos new wagner "ring " which we are sharing with washington national opera for a company that has recently been favoring provocative productions over well known singers the names on the san francisco roster which include olga borodina natalie dessay angela gheorghiu susan graham denyce graves thomas hampson jennifer larmore james morris peter seiffert and ruth ann swenson are unusually impressive mr littlejohn writes about west coast cultural events for the journal
