politics &amp economics chinese shift bank savings into frothy stock market shanghai the erosion of bank balances in china is creating a challenge for policy makers as the trend adds froth to the stock market without producing much fundamental benefit for the economy chinas individual savers had a record &# trillion in yuan squirreled away in bank accounts at the end of march but household bank savings fell &# billion in april and by &# billion in may according to data from the peoples bank of china the back to back reductions marked the first drops in yuan household deposits in six years and stand in contrast to the period from to when such savings ballooned by times the money is pouring into stocks underscored by record numbers of new stock trading accounts that have taken the total to more than million a survey by chinas central bank in may also found that for the first time consumers showed more enthusiasm to put money in stocks and mutual funds than in savings accounts in chinas poorly developed capital markets savings are the safest investment money withdrawn from banks "is not going toward consumption " says jonathan anderson an economist at ubs in hong kong "it is a shift in the way people are saving " now economists say beijing may take steps to stem the outflow of savings from banks at least of money earmarked for the stock market shortly analysts say china could push deposit interest rates higher for the fifth time in about a year there are also increased expectations for a reduction in an eight year old tax that individuals pay on bank interest income each move would raise payouts on bank deposits and theoretically damp enthusiasm for stocks expectation of an interest rate increase has hurt the stock market recently while no one is calling for a weak stock market economists say the money flowing out of banks is largely bypassing the real economy because the flow of deposits into stocks has been relatively recent a particular worry is that it puts household savings and spending power at the mercy of a market that is up nearly this year and viewed as expensive by international standards a flow of money out of bank accounts and into stocks represents the latest permutation of a recurring story in china a wave of cash that is pushing asset prices abruptly higher the risk is that the overheating could be followed by a crash in this case of stocks as in an earlier episode of speculation in which borrowed money was splurged on property analysts see beijing turning more aggressively to administrative measures to slow the movement of money than to market oriented policies such as interest rate increases "its easier for the government to make the markets less attractive than to make deposits more attractive " says paul cavey an analyst at macquarie research in hong kong he says a income tax on earnings from bank interest could soon be cut in half for years chinese have been among the worlds most voracious savers with individuals consistently plowing up to a quarter of their income into bank accounts economists say their bulging savings accounts reflect widespread worry in chinese society about future costs of education and health care and are a stark sign of doubt in communisms once promised "iron rice bowl " corporate deposits are even bigger than household savings last year they contributed to gross domestic savings that have remained near the worlds highest at of gross domestic product world bank economist louis kuijs estimates household savings were equivalent to about of gdp in recent years policy makers in beijing have prodded individuals to spend more of their savings the income tax on deposit interest in was just such a measure the idea has been to unlock consumer power by making the economy more like that of the u s and less driven by exports and investment which are considered unsustainable washington has supported that effort in hopes that chinese individuals will demand more imported products and balance trade flows between the countries lower savings could push chinas banks to reduce their nearly full reliance on generating income by offering depositors less interest than they charge borrowers
