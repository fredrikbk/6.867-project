politics &amp economics why iraqs kirkuk is vital kurds shiites raise tensions over oil rich city further testing u s washington the bush administrations iraq "surge" centers on baghdad the city u s officials have long considered the most important in determining iraqs future but they also are concerned that the countrys destiny instead may be shaped in another locale kirkuk under the iraqi constitution a binding referendum is to be held in the oil rich northern city before the end of the year giving residents the option of choosing whether to become part of autonomous iraqi kurdistan the kurds who hold a majority in the multiethnic city are widely expected to win any such vote which would give them control of kirkuks extensive and rich oil resources but the kurdish push is infuriating iraqs shiite muslim arab majority which wants to keep kirkuk under the control of the countrys shiite dominated central government the dispute is bringing americas two main partners in iraq its shiite and kurdish populations into open conflict with the u s stuck in the middle the rising tensions over kirkuks future are alarming the citys large sunni muslim arab and turkoman minorities who fear they will be forced out or left as second class citizens in a future kurdish state several of iraqs neighbors are also worried about kirkuk and its oil coming under kurdish control turkish and syrian officials say they fear iraqs kurds will declare independence upon gaining control of kirkuk which could fuel secessionist movements among their own countries sizable kurdish minorities earlier this month firebrand shiite cleric moqtada al sadr said in a television interview that "kirkuk is an iraqi city " rejecting kurdish claims to it the comment was seen within iraq as an implicit threat that mr sadrs mahdi army militia might battle kurds for control for the city following mr sadrs lead iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki a hard line shiite hasnt set a date for the referendum or allocated any money for carrying it out the kurds have responded by threatening to pull out of mr malikis government if the vote isnt held on time which would trigger new elections and months of increased political instability iraqi officials fear the kurds might try to seize the city by force and then declare independence a move that could trigger armed clashes between kurdish and shiite forces and possibly an invasion by neighboring turkey u s officials have been pressing kurdish leaders to delay the referendum until next year as a way of lowering tensions according to people familiar with the matter the u s officials said they were hopeful the kurds would agree to a postponement "the u s would support a process and resolution that is based upon consensus by all concerned not unilateral steps a process which advances rather than sets back the cause of national unity and reconciliation and contributes to a reduction of tension " says phillip reeker a spokesman for the u s embassy in baghdad "we believe that is well understood by the iraqi kurdish leadership " kurdish officials say they are unwilling to compromise on the referendum even if it puts them in direct conflict with iraqs shiite community "kirkuk is the only major point of contention the only major source of dispute between iraqi kurds and iraqi shiites " says qubad talabani washington representative of the kurdish government and the son of iraqi president jalal talabani "but we cannot pick and choose which articles of this constitution get implemented and which dont " u s military and civilian officials are anxiously watching as tensions rise and bloodshed worsens in kirkuk a wave of attacks this month destroyed two of the citys main bridges and left dozens dead apparently concerned about matters there lt gen raymond odierno the no u s commander in iraq sent his chief political adviser emma sky to kirkuk a few weeks ago on an undisclosed fact finding mission a senior commander familiar with the trip said ms sky was tasked with gauging "how close kirkuk is to exploding " ms sky didnt reply to emails seeking comment on her findings lt col james hutton a spokesman for gen odierno also didnt reply to emails seeking comment the increasing tensions in kirkuk highlight a significant new wrinkle to iraqs fractious political landscape in the years since u s forces ousted former iraqi president saddam hussein the shiites and kurds who were the wars biggest beneficiaries have abided by a largely unspoken quid pro quo the kurds allowed shiites to solidify their control over arab iraq while the shiites stood aside as the kurdish regional government in the north took on more and more of the trappings of an independent state but with neither group showing any signs of budging over kirkuk the impasse is threatening to unravel that delicate compromise at issue is a section of iraqs constitution that has sparked controversy since the document was drafted in article was the product of a backroom deal between kurdish and shiite negotiators seeking a way of creating an autonomous quasistate in southern iraq modeled closely on the kurdish north which has enjoyed a large measure of freedom since the u s and its allies established protective no fly zones after the gulf war the provision says "normalization a census and a referendum in kirkuk" must be held before dec shiite officials later agreed the "normalization" of the city by pushing out the arabs brought to kirkuk by mr hussein and replacing them with displaced kurds would be completed by march that a census would be held by july and that a final vote would be held before the end of the year tens of thousands of kurds have moved to the city in recent months but even mr talabani and other kurdish officials acknowledge the normalization process is far from complete the iraqi government has failed to begin making any preparations for the kirkuk census which means the july deadline also wont be met the kurds continue to insist that the referendum itself somehow be held before the end of the year a demand that infuriates the citys many other ethnic groups who accuse the kurds of altering the citys demographic balance to ensure they win any future vote as well as an increasing number of prominent shiite political leaders across iraq "kirkuk should remain an indivisible part of iraq " mr sadr said in a june interview on the al iraqiya network "we consider it as an iraqi holy land that must be defended by all the power we have " mr talabani says u s officials have been pressing the kurds to delay the referendum telling them "it would be good if this issue just went away for a while " but he says kirkuks status has gone unresolved for too long "for four years we have been telling our american friends that kirkuk is an issue that has to be addressed " he says "each time the can has been kicked down the road but were almost at the end of the road "
