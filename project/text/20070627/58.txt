insurers try to rebuild trust the destruction caused by hurricane katrina the most costly natural disaster in u s history is still apparent in the hundreds of boarded up buildings along the gulf coast as residents there struggle to rebuild lives and homes devastated by the storm also struggling is the reputation of national insurers which have been the target of a barrage of lawsuits by policyholders the storms record profits for the insurers and skyrocketing premiums in some storm ravaged areas have affected the way consumers view their insurers making them more likely to sue and have spurred state regulators to take a hard line stance industry participants say hurricane season began june and is expected to be unusually active with named storms and eight hurricanes expected meteorologists for wsi corp said in may some insurance executives say the industry needs to do more to win back trust "insurance brands are getting bashed from capitol hill to main street " ramani ayer chairman and chief executive of multiline insurer hartford financial group said earlier this month at the companys annual investor day at a recent insurance industry conference in new york he offered some advice to insurers "we have a lot of work to do to recapture in peoples minds the importance of this industry i dont believe we have done enough work here " insurance companies walk a fine line between meeting the demands of consumers regulators and shareholders to maintain profits it is critical to restore a reputation for fairness to help discourage customer litigation and regulatory pressure j robert hunter insurance director with the consumer federation of america and a former state insurance commissioner says many customers have become convinced insurers have lost their "moral compass " mr hunter pointed to a handful of katrina related coverage lawsuits that have underscored sometimes confusing policy language customers cant decipher such as "concurrent causation" language in some homeowners policies in some katrina suits both sides have debated whether such clauses let insurers off the hook for paying for covered wind damage if any noncovered damage such as flood damage was also present "that is putting the bottom line ahead of the consumer " mr hunter said as katrina related lawsuits were taking off in mississippi last year the record breaking earnings added to the perception that insurers only care about profits criticism was heaped on insurers for raising rates on consumers at a time when profits were so high according to the insurance information institute industry profits surged in to &# billion from the year before helped by a steep drop in catastrophe losses and generally strong performance across all business segments it was a radical change from the big storm year of when insurers were hit with &# billion in catastrophe losses charles kavitsky president of allianz of america inc says the negative perception of insurers is unwarranted and stems from a lack of understanding of the challenges associated with providing coverage in high risk areas "some states feel that an occasional is too much profit for our industry " mr kavitsky said at the conference earlier this month "if we get the truth out there will be more respect for our industry " allstate corp caught flak from regulators in california earlier this year when it asked for a average rate increase after reporting record profits in when allstate announced in may it would stop writing new homeowners policies in the state to manage its catastrophe risk there many interpreted it as adding insult to injury a poll conducted by the los angeles business journal in may found that of respondents favored banning allstate from doing business in the state altogether "we cant have insurers deciding to only choose folks who are expected to never file a claim " said carmen balber a consumer advocate with the california based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights but an allstate spokesman said the survey was unscientific and didnt reflect widespread sentiment "we made a responsible move in the interest of our customers " said rich halberg a spokesman for allstate in california he noted that allstate is the third largest insurer in the state with homeowners as customers the insurer has pulled back in other catastrophe exposed areas as well "i think our policyholders appreciate the fact that our company is diligent and responsible about managing how much risk" it takes on not all insurers feel that consumer dissatisfaction is widespread some point to more positive indicators including potentially kinder feelings customers may have for their insurer if it is a mutual rather than a publicly traded company "our data shows we have held our own " said jonathan freed a spokesman for state farm mutual automobile insurance co the countrys largest homeowners and auto insurer and the subject of several high profile hurricane katrina lawsuits "we are faring better in consumer tracking surveys than any of the major carriers in mississippi where state attorney general jim hood filed a lawsuit last week charging state farm with underpaying storm victims the insurer actually picked up market share after the storm mr freed said that happened even though the insurer said in february it will no longer write any new homeowners or commercial property business within the state citing the unpredictable legal environment shivan subramaniam chairman and chief executive of fm global a mutual insurer that specializes in covering large commercial facilities said it conducted a survey of customers who had filed a katrina claim and reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the resolution though he noted media and political coverage of insurers was frequently negative after the storm a necessary task for insurers is to be "very clear about what we cover and what we dont cover " he said fm globals customer base makes that an easier job than for a personal lines insurer with millions of customers he said "it is a big challenge "
