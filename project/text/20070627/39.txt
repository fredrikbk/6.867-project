debt bomb lending a hand how wall street stoked the mortgage meltdown lehman and others transformed the market for riskiest borrowers inside the subprime mortgage debacle second in a series twelve years ago lehman brothers holdings inc sent a vice president to california to check out first alliance mortgage co lehman was thinking about tapping into first alliances lucrative business of making "subprime" home loans to consumers with sketchy credit the vice president eric hibbert wrote a memo describing first alliance as a financial "sweat shop" specializing in "high pressure sales for people who are in a weak state " at first alliance he said employees leave their "ethics at the door " the big wall street investment bank decided first alliance wasnt breaking any laws lehman went on to lend the mortgage company roughly &# million and helped sell more than &# million in bonds backed by first alliance customers loans but first alliance later collapsed lehman landed in court where a federal jury found the firm helped first alliance defraud customers today lehman is a prime example of how wall streets money and expertise have helped transform subprime lending into a major force in the u s financial markets lehman says it is proud of its role in helping provide credit to consumers who might otherwise have been unable to buy a home and proud of the controls it has brought to a sometimes unruly business now however that business is in deep trouble and some consumer advocates and policy makers are pointing the finger at wall street roughly of subprime loans stand in or near foreclosure bringing turmoil and sometimes eviction to tens of thousands of homeowners dozens of lenders have gone out of business bear stearns cos is trying to bail out a hedge fund it manages that was hurt by subprime mortgage losses critics say wall street firms helped create the mess by throwing so much money at the market that lenders had a growing incentive to push through shaky loans and mislead borrowers at a hearing in april sen robert menendez d n j said wall street firms "looked the other way" as they profited from questionable loans "fueling a market that has very little discipline over itself " federal reserve chief ben bernanke said in a may speech that some lenders focused more on feeding the marketplace than on the quality of loans in part because most of the risks that loans would go bad were passed to investors as a result "mortgage applications with little documentation were vulnerable to misrepresentation or overestimation of repayment capacity by both lenders and borrowers " he said a generation ago housing finance was different bankers took in deposits lent that money to home buyers and collected interest and principal until the mortgages were paid wall street wasnt much involved now it plays a central role wall street firms provide working capital that allows thousands of mortgage firms to make loans after lenders sign up consumers for home loans investment banks pool the income streams from these loans into bonds known as mortgage backed securities the banks sell them to yield hungry investors around the world before the mid s mortgage backed securities consisted mostly of loans to borrowers with good credit and cash to make ample down payments then investment banks found they could do the same with riskier loans to borrowers with modest incomes and flawed credits pooling the loans created a cushion against defaults by diversifying the risk the high interest rates on the loans made for bonds with high yields that investors savored new technology helped make it easier for lenders to collect and collate mounds of information on borrowers lehman one of wall streets biggest players in the subprime boom says it has gone to great lengths to screen loans for fraud and vet the lenders it works with "no financial institution would knowingly want to make or securitize a loan that it expected would later go into default " david sherr lehmans head of securitized products told mr menendez and other senators "rather the success of mortgage backed securities as an investment vehicle depends upon the expectation that homeowners generally will make their monthly payments since those payments form the basis for the cash flows to bondholders " at the sectors peak in with the housing market booming loan defaults remained low wall street pooled a record &# billion in subprime mortgages in bonds up from &# billion in according to trade publication inside mortgage finance the figure slid to &# billion last year as the housing market slumped and subprime defaults picked up lehman topped other wall street firms over the past two years packaging more than &# billion in subprime mortgage backed securities in both and overall lehman officials say the subprime business has accounted for of the firms overall revenues in recent quarters or roughly &# million in lehman has also been a leader in investment banks push to buy their own lenders through its subprime unit bnc mortgage inc it lends directly to consumers bringing in more fees and giving it more control over the quality of the loans lehmans deep involvement in the business has also made the firm a target of criticism in more than lawsuits and in interviews borrowers and former employees have claimed that the investment banks in house lending outlets used improper tactics during the recent mortgage boom to put borrowers into loans they couldnt afford twenty five former employees said in interviews that front line workers and managers exaggerated borrowers creditworthiness by falsifying tax forms pay stubs and other information or by ignoring inaccurate data submitted by independent mortgage brokers in some instances several ex employees said brokers or in house employees altered documents with the help of scissors tape and wite out "anything to make the deal work " says coleen columbo a former mortgage underwriter in california for lehmans bnc unit she and five other ex employees are pursuing a lawsuit in state court in sacramento that claims bncs management retaliated against workers who complained about fraud lehman officials say theres no evidence to support such claims they say the firm has tough antifraud controls and goes to great lengths to ensure that it works with mortgage brokers and lenders who meet high standards and that loans are based on accurate information lehman says company records clearly refute specific details of the accounts given by these former employees it says most of them never raised concerns during their tenures at lehman lending units even though that was a requirement of their jobs some employees contacted by the wall street journal said they werent aware of improper practices "we think it is misleading to extrapolate from a handful of cases in each of which we have a strong defense and make a judgment about the way we conduct our business " lehman says lehmans history in subprime goes back to the mid s when the sector was still tiny back then lehman established itself as a leader in the market for subprime mortgage backed securities it built a staff of experts who had worked at other securities firms and established relationships with subprime mortgage lenders one of them was first alliance mr hibbert the lehman vice president traveled to orange calif in june to help decide whether lehman should provide financing to first alliance and underwrite its mortgage backed bonds in his memo mr hibbert reported back that there was "little risk of fraud or impropriety" at first alliance but he also said it was clear it made some loans "where the borrower has no real capacity for repayment " lehman officials say mr hibbert ultimately supported going forward with first alliance a decision the investment bank made on the basis of extensive discussions and a page memo they also note that the &# million line of credit that lehman initially wrote for first alliance was small compared with what other firms were putting up to finance the lender by late prudential securities and other investment banks had abandoned first alliance federal regulators and seven states were investigating allegations it used deceptive sales tactics to get borrowers into loans with excessive upfront fees first alliance trained loan officers to use a sales pitch designed to "confuse and mislead" borrowers and disguise fees u s district judge david carter in california found in a bankruptcy related proceeding during the turmoil lehman helped keep first alliance afloat with more loans in early an internal lehman memo noted the proliferation of government probes targeting the lender and the possibility that involvement with the lender might produce bad publicity for the investment bank but the memo recommended going forward arguing that first alliances borrowers rarely defaulted on their loans and noting that lehman stood to earn millions in fees by managing the lenders mortgage backed securities deals lehman officials say they took close account of first alliances practices its reviews showed the lender was committed to improving its practices it hired a new in house counsel along with a chief financial officer who once worked at lehman first alliance shut down in march as pressure from lawsuits and investigations grew in a federal jury in california delivered a &# million verdict in a class action against first alliance attributing of the damages &# million to lehman a federal appeals panel upheld the jurys decision but instructed the trial court to recalculate the dollar award that decision is pending lehman also settled a lawsuit filed in broward country circuit court by florida authorities who said lehman was an "accomplice" in first alliances frauds the investment bank admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to pay &# and review its practices lehman calls the first alliance saga an aberration and says it is unfair to use it to draw conclusions about how it does business more than a decade later the subprime market contracted between and as continuing ripples from that eras russian debt crisis and the collapse of hedge fund long term capital management prompted investors to pull back from riskier markets the crisis also presented a buying opportunity in lehman started operating its own subprime lending unit finance america as a joint venture with an ailing subprime lender named amresco inc as a minority partner it bought out amresco in and another minority investor in lehman also took an ownership stake in california based bnc mortgage in after helping management take the company private it bought out managements remaining stake in and last year merged finance america into bnc earlier this month it said it would merge bnc with its aurora loan services unit with interest rates low and the economy recovering the market took off and bnc and finance america grew quickly they ballooned from &# billion in total loan originations in to &# billion in ranking lehman no among all subprime lenders as subprime grew lehman officials say fraudulent schemes pushed by rogue mortgage brokers and others became more sophisticated throughout the industry by taking full ownership of bnc and finance america the firm says it was in a better position to combat these practices when lehman consolidated its control of the two companies in lehman officials say the lenders practices were consistent with industry standards but they acknowledge the lenders like others in the subprime industry had problems with loan quality and fraud prevention "since then we have worked long and hard as we have taken control to make these companies models for the industry on best practices for fraud detection and borrower protection " the firm says since the start of bnc has nearly doubled the size of its staff devoted to quality control fraud investigations and other jobs that help ensure the lender makes good loans some former employees claim however that the pressure to boost loan volume during the boom years of and prompted some workers at the lending units to step over the line and push through questionable loans dena ivezic a mortgage underwriter for both companies in downers grove ill in late and early says some staffers at her branch used "cut and paste" techniques to fabricate documents they needed to get loans approved some workers tried "to take a stand" against such practices she says but "they were reprimanded for not being cooperative not wanting to be creative about making deals work everybody else just kind of bottled up and just never said anything because you needed a job " cedric washington a former regional sales manager for finance america in california contended that employees at the lender actively pushed through questionable loans in a employment discrimination lawsuit in state court in sacramento mr washington said he witnessed a fellow manager alter a loan document by forging a borrowers initials later he said he discovered finance america employees forged borrowers signatures on credit disclosures and used falsified documents to inflate loan applicants incomes in one instance the lawsuit said a loan officer submitted a loan on a duplex that was "not a home or duplex at all but merely a greenhouse " mr washington complained the loan was backed by falsified collateral the suit said but a finance america executive refused to pull the loan bnc officials said mr washington himself was complicit in fraud which he denied according to the lawsuit lehman officials say his lawsuit "had no merit" and was "not brought in good faith " it was settled last year for an undisclosed sum as for ms ivezic lehman says she worked at bnc for just months and her experiences are "hardly representative of bncs employee base " other former employees contacted by the journal said that fraud wasnt a problem at the lenders they say their managers didnt hesitate to reject fishy loans "everything we did was by the guidelines " says barbara webb a loan underwriter for both finance america and bnc in texas from into lehman officials say they have procedures in place to prevent mortgage brokers and others in the loan process from bending rules bnc reviews brokers before putting them on its approved list and rechecks them annually searching state licenses and lawsuits and making sure theyre not on federal officials watch list for problem brokers bnc says it has stopped doing business with more than since largely because of fraud it works with an average of about brokers a month at bncs headquarters in irvine calif officials say theyve designed their business with an eye to weeding out bad loans mortgage underwriters and loan processors who make sure loan application data is accurate get extensive training in how to spot fraud under bncs organizational chart theyre set apart from sales to avoid pressure to let problem loans slip through bnc officials say lehman notes the office of thrift supervision bncs regulator received just three complaints about the company from april through march a tiny fraction of the roughly loans it made during that span some complaints have surfaced in court borrowers lawsuits in pennsylvania louisiana mississippi and other states have alleged finance america and bnc took advantage of unsophisticated borrowers or used falsified information to approve loans a lawsuit in state court in saginaw mich by uaw gm legal services plan which serves auto workers and retirees alleges a mortgage broker "confused and pressured" an elderly couple into signing up for a bnc loan that obligated them to pay as much as as the interest rate adjusted upward the suit says bnc was aware of "the seamy details of what happened here" because it prepared the documents vetted the application and gave the broker "a set of instructions for how to proceed " george and evelyn lees july loan was pooled by lehman with nearly other subprime home loans from bnc into a securities deal that produced more than &# million in mortgage backed bonds the broker in the case real financial llc has been the subject of complaints to michigan financial regulators and a fraud lawsuit thats pending in federal court in michigan state regulators dismissed many of the complaints but have upheld eight of them and referred others for investigation real financials attorney says the allegations stem from an unfavorable economy thats sparked rising foreclosures and unjustified complaints against lenders and brokers lehman says it wasnt aware of complaints about real financial until the lawsuit was filed but has since removed the firm from its broker list "bnc was not aware of anything wrong with the lees loan because all it saw was the loan application which was in good order " lehman said "real financial was not bncs agent and bnc gave it no instructions whatsoever we strongly believe bnc has been added to this case only as a deep pocket " despite the controversy thats emerged in the subprime business lehman officials say theyre proud of their role in helping the market grow and offering access to credit for consumers who might not otherwise have the chance "we think its a business we should all be working to improve not diminish " the firm says
