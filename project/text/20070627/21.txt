business bookshelf their view from the top new ideas from dead ceos by todd g buchholz collins pages &# when i was a kid one of the first real books i read was " greatest sports heroes " a series of flattering portraits of babe didrikson george mikan lou gehrig and other athletes from the first half of the th century todd buchholzs "new ideas from dead ceos" has a similar sort of retrospective glorifying spirit and it has plenty of nonathletic feats to celebrate it is also a lovely read whether it truly offers "new ideas" is another matter mr buchholz presents his own portraits of heroic ceos a p giannini the founder of bank of america tom watson sr and tom watson jr of ibm mary kay ash and estee lauder founders of their eponymous cosmetics companies david sarnoff of rca ray kroc of mcdonalds akio morita the founder of sony sam walton the founder of wal mart and walt disney who as they say needs no introduction the life stories of these titans not to mention their business stories are certainly memorable we see mr giannini caring for his customers so much that he reopened his bank four days after the san francisco earthquake of on a sunday no less while every other bank in town stayed closed in the chaos mr giannini went down to the wharf and put a plank across two wooden barrels he declared himself open for business and made a name for himself mr disney supported himself in his studios early days by taking baby pictures at one point payroll came from a &# check for a film on dental hygiene sam walton crawled around at competitors stores opening cupboards under display racks to check on their inventory mr walton was so cheap that he once shared a motel room with eight staff members after he became the richest man in america he relented and merely doubled up in motel rooms we see mr morita on a payphone in new york having an argument with his board about one of the most important decisions in sonys young life bulova had offered to sell sonys new transistor radios if it could put the bulova name on them mr morita wanted to keep control of the sony brand but the board was desperate for business mr morita conveniently ran out of change and declared himself the winner of the argument and was as history shows absolutely right mr buchholz draws such portraits in a nicely droll style he doesnt describe mr sarnoff as an impoverished russian he says that mr sarnoff at age five was "a poor jewish monk" sent to a "russian shtetl so remote and obscure that the cossacks did not even bother to come by and burn the homes " when mr sarnoff was nine his father had saved up the &# he needed to lift the family "out of russian poverty and into american poverty " when it comes to extracting new ideas though mr buchholz faces a difficult challenge the ideas of these ceos have been conventional wisdom for decades mr buchholz commends mr disney for realizing unlike his competitors that he should have movie related toys appear in stores when his movies debuted but businesses absorbed the retail tie in lesson long ago mr buchholz shows how several of his subjects rode demographic shifts cosmetics companies for instance seized on the movement of women into the work force to create more demand for their products but how did mary kay ash and estee lauder spot those trends what trends should companies latch on to today the two that mr buchholz suggests the aging of the population and the growing number of hispanic americans are fairly obvious by now and certain lessons have limited value mr buchholz credits the younger mr watson with a "bet the company" decision that launched a line of mainframe computers in the s and gave ibm some two decades of clear sailing but what about digital equipment which a decade later made a "bet the company" decision to persevere in the minicomputer market while ignoring personal computers only to fall by the wayside when do you bet the company and when do you hedge your bets mr buchholz says that the aol merger with time warner in failed because the new companys executives didnt heed mr disneys lesson about aggressive leadership and the importance of being on the cutting edge of technology god knows they made serious errors but to borrow sportswriter stanley woodwards line such an explanation is like blaming the johnstown flood on a leaky toilet in altoona no amount of leadership or technology could have saved a fundamentally misconceived merger like that of aol time warner but who cares the remarkable lives in "new ideas from dead ceos" are more than enough to carry a reader along forevermore when i hear the name estee lauder ill remember the time she told a wealthy customer that she could make her face creams last longer by storing them in the refrigerator the labels came off in the cold and the customers maid served face cream at a formal dinner as mayonnaise oops mr carroll is currently writing with chunka mui "the devils advocate avoiding the eight strategy mistakes that cost companies billions "
