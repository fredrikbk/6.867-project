better ways to measure your portfolio new tools let investors create customized benchmarks beyond the s&amp p index new tools are helping individual investors build a better yardstick to gauge if their holdings are performing up to par most investors compare their portfolios performance to that of such well known stock indexes as the s&amp p the problem is that the s&amp p measures just a slice of the overall stock market and doesnt reflect the diversified portfolios that most individuals actually hold and as investors add more complex assets such as real estate and commodities to their traditional holdings of stocks and bonds the s&amp p and other well known indexes have become even less reliable indicators of whether youre getting a reasonable return from your portfolio given the level of risk youre taking on now financial research firms are launching more diversified indexes that better reflect how many people actually invest for example if you plan to retire in a recent "target date" index lets you see how your holdings stack up against a model portfolio with a similar retirement date horizon meanwhile some investors are designing their own benchmarks using free online tools to build model portfolios of index mutual funds or exchange traded funds without even having to invest in the funds jim pflugrath a year old biochemist in the woodlands texas recently wanted to see how his diversified portfolio stacked up against some strong fund performers so he assembled a custom benchmark made up of dimensional fund advisors funds by comparing his own holdings against the model portfolio mr pflugrath found he could have gotten better performance if he owned more small cap value stocks so in recent weeks he started buying shares of wisdomtree international smallcap dividend etf which holds small cap value stocks investors who want an accurate picture of how their investments are doing need to select their benchmarks carefully simply outperforming for example doesnt mean much if youre using the wrong yardstick most stock funds beat the s&amp p over the past five years often by holding strong performing small cap and international stocks an appropriate benchmark also can show whether any fee youre paying for investment management is money well spent without good benchmarks "youre flying blind " says bud green a principal at santa monica calif based fortress wealth management even many mutual funds which are required to compare their performance against a benchmark in the prospectus often list an inappropriate index says berk sensoy assistant professor of finance at the university of southern californias marshall school of business in a study mr sensoy found that of actively managed u s diversified stock funds listed a benchmark in their prospectus that didnt match their investment style some small cap funds for example list the large cap s&amp p as a benchmark while some mid cap funds compare themselves against the small cap russell index financial advisers have long created custom benchmarks for clients often using software and index data that cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year now individual investors can more easily design their own custom index and they dont have to spend big bucks to do it to build your own benchmark the first step is to analyze how much of each asset class you hold in your portfolio such as stocks bonds cash and other investments free online tools that do this are offered at the web sites of many mutual fund and brokerage firms investors also can use the free "instant x ray" tool under the portfolio tab at morningstar com by entering the name of the funds or stocks you own along with the dollar value of your holdings the tool shows how your portfolio is divided among asset classes such as stocks and bonds and even stock styles like large cap growth or mid cap value the next step is to build a custom benchmark by assembling a list of index mutual funds and exchange traded funds that track the asset classes represented in your portfolio to find out which funds track which asset classes investors can use the data tool at indexuniverse com or the mutual fund and etf screeners at morningstar com a boom in etfs means these funds now track virtually every slice of the market including high yield bonds real estate and emerging market stocks finally investors can use free portfolio tracking tools available at sites like finance yahoo com or morningstar com to assemble and track their custom benchmark along with their actual portfolio if for instance your portfolio is u s stocks foreign stocks short term treasury bonds real estate and commodities you might create a custom benchmark consisting of vanguard total stock market index fund vanguard ftse all world ex us index fund ishares lehman short treasury bond etf dj wilshire reit etf and powershares db commodity index tracking etf some investors prefer the simplicity of benchmarking against the new breed of more diversified indexes dorchester capital management co a financial product firm in houston recently launched its capital markets index which tracks all u s investment grade stock and bond markets as well as money market instruments currently the index which can be accessed at www cpmkts com has an asset allocation of about stocks bonds and cash but dorchester in coming weeks plans to launch a portfolio calculator that will let users customize the allocations to match their own if your own portfolio is underperforming the total market with a similar asset allocation it may be time to rethink your investments frank wozencraft managing director of texan capital management inc in houston started using the dorchester index in recent months as a benchmark for some clients if he finds the index is performing better than his clients portfolios with less risk he says hell consider shifting his clients asset allocation to more closely resemble the benchmark since the index represents the entire u s capital markets he says it provides "a totally objective way to allocate between stocks bonds and cash " other new more diversified indexes include "target date" indexes launched by dow jones indexes a unit of dow jones &amp co which also publishes the wall street journal like target date funds the indexes shift to a more conservative mix of investments as they approach their target retirement dates both dow jones indexes and lipper inc also offer "target risk" indexes which allows investors to compare their portfolios against others with a similar investment style such as moderate or aggressive once investors have found an appropriate benchmark they should weigh its risk as well as its returns against their own portfolio to do this compare the benchmarks worst quarter for several years against your portfolios worst quarter suggests craig israelsen associate professor at brigham young university if your portfolio is lagging slightly behind the benchmark but suffered much smaller losses during the worst of times youre probably doing pretty well mr israelsen says but if your portfolio has lower returns and more risk than the benchmark you might consider adjusting your asset allocation or switching to low cost index funds financial advisers say checking up investors have more options to assess their portfolios performance new indexes are designed to track diversified portfolios online tools make it easier for investors to build their own benchmarks besides performance investors also need to measure relative risk
