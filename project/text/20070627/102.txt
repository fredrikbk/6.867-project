suicidal proposal for palistinians amid the wests wishful thinking the "new" in michael orens "new paradigm" is really quite old and of dubious value "fatah isnt the answer " editorial page june consider his proposal for establishing "extensive palestinian autonomy in the west bank " he writes that "security will be jointly administered by israel and jordan the jordanian involvement is crucial to convincing palestinians that the status quo of occupation has ended " this formulation ignores the fact that jordans occupation would be over sovereign israeli territory jordan illegally seized this land during the war of independence and was forced to relinquish it to israel as an outgrowth of the six day war the land in question was originally granted to israel by the british mandate to therefore suggest that jordanian security forces be placed on israeli land to help establish autonomous areas for those committed to the destruction of the jewish state is suicidal as is clear from the example of gaza when israel withdrew its citizens from the gaza strip two years ago within hours palestinian missiles were flying into israel and direct attacks against its civilians escalated furthermore notwithstanding democratic elections the historic hostilities between hamas and fatah resurfaced in all of their gore while the millions of dollars of infrastructure left behind by the israelis for palestinian use were totally destroyed mr oren defies credulity by pretending that rewarding the palestinians with sovereign territories could ever lead to a "durable peace " lynn field monroe township n j mr oren correctly notes the absurd delusional reaction of america israel and europe following the hamas victory in gaza ridiculous as it may seem the wests latest "road map" for peace in the middle east now seems to entail backing the "good" terrorists fatah vs the "bad" terrorists hamas nevermind the fact that the palestinian people in democratic elections that the west openly supported and encouraged elected hamas not fatah to run their government but even mr oren succumbs to the wests usual wishful thinking in his proposed "interim answer" to the latest crisis his plans for a "national assembly" and "fully empowered" palestinian leaders able to "manage all aspects of daily life" are pithy academic recommendations that just wont fly in gaza or the west bank its time for the palestinian people themselves to resolve this issue in their own they voted in hamas and as in any democracy its time for them to live with the government they elected jay lewis baltimore
