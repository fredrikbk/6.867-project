business whole foods ceo serves up heated words for ftc the permanence of email has undone numerous executives in recent years from former boeing co chief harry stonecipher to wal mart stores inc marketing guru julie roehm a week ago whole foods market inc chief executive john mackey appeared ready to join that list after the federal trade commission cited an email sent by mr mackey in its lawsuit to stop whole foods planned &# million acquisition of wild oats markets inc in the missive to his board mr mackey lists as his top two reasons for the deal "elimination of an acquisition opportunity for a conventional supermarket " and "elimination of a rival " words guaranteed to get antitrust regulators attention "its remarkable how many corporate executives dont understand that the e in email stands for both evidence and eternal " says joseph grundfest a professor at stanford law school and former member of the securities and exchange commission "my only surprise here is that mr mackey is surprised that the government got his email read his email and used his email against him " mr mackeys choice of words is certainly curious his memo lists six other reasons for the wild oats deal together they likely would have persuaded the board to do the deal a whole foods spokeswoman says mr mackey had no reason to be circumspect "we did not think the ftc would make such a big issue out of this merger " she says in an email but this story may not follow the familiar script once chastened most ceos would shrink from the microphone and let their lawyers do the talking not mr mackey the year old vegan who built whole foods from a single store in austin texas to a &# billion a year company is seeking to turn the internet to his advantage with a diatribe against the ftc shortly after a judge unsealed the full ftc complaint mr mackey posted a word blog entry on whole foods web site in a tone of outrage he accuses the ftc of being "biased adversarial and arrogant " moreover he claims the ftc didnt do its homework and didnt analyze prices in his stores "they asked for million whole foods documents but didnt ask us for any pricing information " he writes "pretty incredible in my opinion " thats a very unusual strategy and could backfire by further provoking the ftc and putting statements on the record that make it harder for whole foods to settle the case ftc officials say they are prohibited from responding outside of court the agency hasnt filed any papers that reveal price data antitrust lawyers say it would be very unusual for the agency not to collect pricing information in a case like this and the ftc did request that economists testify at a july hearing on its effort to block the deal in court mr mackeys bluster will matter little like most merger related antitrust cases this one will turn on a judges view of the "relevant market " the ftc says whole foods and wild oats cant combine because they are the two biggest operators of "premium natural and organic supermarkets " offering "a distinct set of products and services to a distinctive group of customers in a distinctive way " thats a new market description but the natural foods business until now has been too small to matter a postmerger whole foods would "increase prices and reduce quality and services " the ftc says hogwash mr mackey responds he says whole foods faces increased competition not just from natural foods specialists but mainstream chains such as safeway inc wegmans food markets and publix super markets inc that have discovered the organic food market whole foods prices are no lower where it competes with wild oats than where it doesnt he says antitrust veterans draw comparisons to the ftcs successful effort to block a merger of staples inc and office depot inc before then no one had considered so called big box office supply stores a distinct retail market but the ftc prevailed and the companies called off the deal in another way though the whole foods case resembles the governments efforts to block oracle corp s acquisition of peoplesoft inc like mr mackey oracle chief executive larry ellison is a brash headstrong entrepreneur determined to consolidate a fractured industry like mr mackey he fought the governments description of the market for big business software as too narrow mr ellison prevailed by persuading a federal judge that the software market was broader and more robust including rivals such as microsoft corp mr mackey may repeat the trick
