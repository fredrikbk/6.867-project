the daily fix henman wins a thriller as american men falter online edition tim henman probably wont ever win wimbledon but hes also not one to bow out easily the briton now and overshadowed by year old scotsman andy murray won his th straight wimbledon first round match on tuesday after four hours and five sets over two days the victory brought to mind andre agassis stirring run last fall to hold off retirement at the u s open "by the end it was as if an entire career had been compressed into the minutes that took henman from in the fifth set against carlos moya to the margin which gave him the victory yesterday afternoon " richard williams writes in the guardian "in the space of games we saw just about every facet and every dimension of henman witnessed since the boy from oxfordshire first stirred middle englands heartstrings " when it was over "the fans watching nearby on the big screen screamed and celebrated henman hill was reclaimed no longer murray mountain " new york daily news columnist filip bondy writes "this was no ordinary reconciliation henman remains the quintessential english contender a self deprecating wry gentleman raised on these very courts people want him very badly to succeed even as they shake their heads at the dire probabilities " should mr henman continue to overcome the dire probabilities and provide pleasant flashbacks he wont face another seeded player until at least the quarterfinals hes in line to face andy roddick who has only james blake as american company in the worlds top surveying a landscape in which the u s men have failed to win the last majors bruce jenkins writes in the san francisco chronicle "american mens tennis has hit rock bottom reaching absolutely its worst point since bill tilden came onto the scene in the s " mr jenkins also gives mr blake ample space to comment "great tennis players are coming from everywhere in generations past we were so dominant that you tune in the second weekend of a grand slam and see at least one american you cant do that any more the sport has become so global i think its pretty good to have two guys who have a chance " the lack of a dominant american male to challenge roger federer and rafael nadal has reduced u s television ratings but dont blame slates troy patterson who is attempting to watch and blog about much of the coverage yesterday he relieved the tension of the henman match by tuning in to "the age of love " the odd dating show centered around former tennis semi star mark philippoussis the guardians patrick mccarthy cant be bothered with wimbledon for reasons among them the crowds bizarre nationalism and the players entourages then theres this about the local press coverage "for the tabloids the tournament is no more than an extended opportunity for fat sweating hacks to pass judgement on the looks of young women " you might have heard that barry bonds is close to passing hank aaron on the all time home run list happily there are other baseball milestones worth watching this season thanks in part to the impressive longevity of last decades stars tom verducci notes on si com among the near term possibilities is roger clemens winning his th game "no one under the age of has seen more than one th victory for a pitcher" and craig biggio reaching hits "only players in baseball history ever reached base safely more times" meanwhile atlanta braves manager bobby cox is closing in on the career record for ejections and two of his former stars greg maddux and tom glavine each pitching for national league rivals have a sense of humor about it both get behind the idea of sending mr cox a bronze thumb to mark his achievement in conversations with cbs sportslines scott miller mr miller enjoyed the recent record tying heave ho "catcher brian mccann was griping to plate umpire chad fairchild after he took a called third strike from detroit closer todd jones " mr miller writes "cox ran onto the field to try to keep mccann in the game but arrived too late after mccanns ejection cox wound up sticking around long enough to get the heave ho talk about a historical flourish it was the perfect way to tie a record like nolan ryan finishing a no hitter with a strikeout or pete rose going into the record books with a hard single " the philadelphia phillies arent laughing about their approach of another historical mark cumulative losses a number never reached in baseball mark kram of the philadelphia daily news finds that the club isnt planning to celebrate the occasion just as it overlooked the th loss too bad mike veeck and other outside promoters suggest to mr kram some fun ideas "say you handed out a loss coffee mug " offers orlando magic exec pat williams "except they would have to have a crack in them or perhaps a hole in the bottom some type of defect that would be in keeping with the occasion " on the eve of the nba draft the portland trailblazers are remaining coy about their intentions with the no pick even though its widely assumed theyll pick center greg oden oregonian columnist john canzano says there are downsides to the attention grabbing silence "by not validating oden as the no brainer no selection at every opportunity by not immediately nationally anointing him as the pick and the new face of the franchise with so many watching youre devaluing the kid before hes even played a single nba game losing opportunity to market him and at the same time making people wonder if youre competent " after mr oden and the presumed no kevin durant are called to the stage to tower over david stern the rest of the draft unfolds with uncertainty one interesting subplot is watching where the six eligible florida players go three of them are likely to go in the lottery "winning consecutive national championships has a way of elevating your stature but just as intriguing is what might follow " joe henderson writes in the tampa tribune "top players come to college thinking about a professional career so what impact could thursdays draft have for floridas future for the states " noting that the draft was a hotter topic around the league during the finals than well the finals and the champion spurs jack mccallum offers an explanation "we have clearly become a rotisserie league sporting culture more interested in analyzing what could be rather than watching what is " mr mccallum writes as they look ahead to their nba careers tomorrows draftees could aspire to be the next karl malone or the next robert horry the former is one of the best players of all time but never won a title the latter has never made the all star game but has seven rings st petersburg times columnist john romano offers some other names to place alongside mr horrys on the list of unremarkable players who had the good fortune to win multiple championships "no matter what the sport a championship is and always will be the ultimate barometer " mr romano writes "but watching horry win another ring as a part time player helps you realize that not all titles come with the same definition " baltimore sun columnist john eisenberg bids farewell to the space hes held honorably and with good humor for years hes leaving to focus on writing books "i like to think my column stood for themes i consider important such as the absence of college in college sports and the orioles chronic inability to right what has gone wrong " mr eisenberg writes "i shouted myself hoarse on the latter and if im rooting for anything as i leave its that the day comes when the orioles finally give their fans something to cheer about again the ravens have taken over but this is still a good baseball town that deserves better " tip of the fix cap to don hartline found a good column from the
