politics &amp economics dingell keeps tight rein on energy measure washington the chairman of the house energy and commerce committee is keeping tight rein on energy legislation in the house as the panel prepares to take up a modest bill aimed at reducing the nations reliance on fossil fuels the narrowly focused legislation reflects an effort by rep john dingell to build bipartisan support on sometimes divisive issues and lay the groundwork for action on more substantive legislation to combat climate change later this year the michigan democrat is putting off action at least for now on more aggressive proposals such as raising vehicle fuel economy standards or mandating that electric utilities use more environmentally friendly fuels such as wind and solar power but the strategy is raising tensions with some house democrats who want more aggressive action and beyond this weeks maneuvering fights loom on the house floor for now mr dingell is pushing legislation that would promote greater energy efficiency setting new standards for appliances and lighting fixtures for example he would also speed delivery to market of renewable fuels such as corn based ethanol and his bill would encourage investment in new technologies aimed at controlling harmful emissions while supporting development of battery powered hybrid vehicles mr dingell is arguing that action on more aggressive measures should be deferred until after labor day giving him time to build consensus to keep control of the agenda he has structured proceedings in his committee today to ensure that he retains maximum leverage to keep the more aggressive proposals out of the narrowly focused bill he has laid before the energy and commerce committee the energy bill hits the full house floor in july at that point power will shift from mr dingell to speaker nancy pelosi the california democrat ms pelosi is eager to move forward on climate change initiatives especially after the senate approved an energy bill last week that would raise fuel efficiency standards for the nations auto and light truck fleet from todays miles per gallon to miles per gallon during the next ten years but democratic leadership aides said it is not clear whether shell open the door for a vote on the floor on the fuel economy proposal as part of the energy bill or whether shell wait to push it later in the year when the broader climate change measure begins to move the speaker is "leaving her options open " said one democratic leadership aide
