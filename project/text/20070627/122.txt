why insurance can vex some after a slew of major catastrophes damaged thousands of homes and vehicles along the u s coast in and many property owners discovered that their insurance policies didnt cover all the damage two years later consumers still appear to be misinformed about what their homeowners and auto insurance policies cover the misconceptions could cost policyholders thousands of dollars if they fail to buy the coverage they need or neglect to make claims for damage they believe is not covered according to recent consumer surveys metlife inc recently conducted a telephone survey of homeowners and renters and auto owners to explore customer beliefs about their homeowners rental and auto insurance policies matthew cullina director of product management for metlife auto &amp home said he was overwhelmed by the large number of respondents who said they werent sure about the basic elements of their policies such as whether a homeowners policy would cover damage caused by a fire "usually people take a stab at an answer" but many figuratively threw up their hands in confusion he said among the questions homeowners found confusing was whether their homeowners policy would cover the cost to rebuild their home if it was destroyed most policies cover rebuilding cost but homeowners should make sure they have that coverage which would protect them should rebuilding costs outstrip the homes value mr cullina said after s hurricane andrew left many insurers paying for vastly inflated rebuilding costs some companies have capped this kind of coverage usually around of the expected cost to rebuild the home this means that even if homeowners opt for that coverage some could get an unpleasant surprise mr cullina said for an extra fee that adds around to the cost of most policies metlife and some other insurers offer a guaranteed replacement policy which puts no cap on the cost to rebuild in the aftermath of the and hurricane seasons the cost of rebuilding homes skyrocketed amid shortages of building materials and labor customers who had the lesser coverage might have run into problems covering the cost of rebuilding he said as much as of homeowners said they didnt believe their insurance would cover damages from a lightning strike and an additional were not sure which cullina said surprised him as homeowners insurance was originally developed to cover such events and is a standard feature of policies today "we have to do a lot better education wise" to make sure people understand their policies mr cullina said a similar survey conducted by the national association of insurance commissioners found of homeowners mistakenly believe their policy covers flood damage despite that standard homeowners policies have not offered flood coverage for decades on the auto side metlifes mr cullina said a major area where drivers came up short on understanding their policies was around the issue of auto depreciation and the fact that new cars drop substantially in value the moment consumers drive them home "people have a hard time understanding depreciation " and frequently dont understand that a policy typically wont cover the purchase price of a new car if it is totaled several months later he said that misconception led metlife to modify its auto insurance policies in most states to cover the full price of a new car if a policyholders new car is totaled within a year of its purchase a majority of customers said they would prefer to pay a slightly higher premium for full coverage to never hear their agents say the dreaded words it isnt covered mr cullina said part of the purpose of metlifes research into customer perceptions is to help the company develop products and educational materials for its growing auto and home business which so far makes up a small part of metlife revenues "we try to fill in some of the gaps" of knowledge by changing policies to meet public perceptions of what a policy should cover he said one such change was made in light of research that showed widespread fear of identity theft customers have expressed concern that a house break in or car theft could lead to identity theft metlife added identity theft coverage to homeowners policies and more recently to its auto policies and found the coverage to be extremely popular mr cullina said it was the first product innovation ever to score a perfect in customer acceptance in company surveys
