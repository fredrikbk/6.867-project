computer scientists pull a tom sawyer to finish grunt work how is this for low elite computer scientists are using highly addictive computer games to trick unsuspecting web users possibly including children into toiling without pay for some of the worlds richest companies on stupefyingly dull grunt work its all true though in fairness nothing nefarious is going on at all the scientists are part of a minimovement known by the oxymoronic name of "human computation " the idea is that because there are many tasks that humans still do better than computers why not just get people to do them often the best way to do just that is to make a game out of it that was the insight of luis von ahn a year old professor at carnegie mellon university who is the creative force behind a web hit known as the esp game at espgame org the site has had more than visitors and has lately inspired other researchers to try the same thing the game links two random players via the web both are shown the same picture then have to type in possible keywords to describe what they see if the keywords match points are awarded people have been known to play for hours whats really going on though is that a previously unlabeled picture collected off the internet is being given keywords that can be used later to categorize or retrieve it computers still perform woefully on this sort of "image recognition " there isnt a program in the world that can do what any three year old can be shown pictures of a cow or a bridge or a pencil and consistently pick which is which among the inspirations for the game said prof von ahn was the realization from computer solitaire that people will happily diddle away endless hours at their machines a key innovation in the esp game was the introduction of a scoreboard which taps the competitive juices of the players and extends the addiction the esp game is not prof von ahns only contribution to the modern computing scene he is also one of the developers of the captcha those distorted words you have to retype correctly before you can say open a new email account prof von ahn clearly is on a career roll last fall he was awarded a macarthur foundation "genius" grant he was also just named a research fellow at microsoft google has licensed the esp game and is now using it with its google image labeler to id its own massive collection of web pictures just as significantly other researchers in other projects are starting to warm to the idea of using games to solicit human help douglas turnbull a graduate student at the university of california san diego developed a game for classifying music people supply text descriptions of brief passages for later use in a program intended to help with musical recommendations two other game based efforts are going to be discussed at an upcoming convention of music researchers he said the game approach has limitations the chief one being that when two people play a game it tends to produce the lowest common denominator of responses because the points are won when the player comes up with a term someone else also chooses dan ellis a columbia university researcher who with graduate student michael mandel is working on a music oriented game said that in his own playing he learned quickly to avoid clever terms and stick to the basics another limitation with the game approach is that lay players usually are of no help at all with technical or scientific images how many nonscientists would be able to spot and then accurately label a molecule of guanine prof von ahn agreed that the gaming approach works best for relatively simple tasks still this notion of human computation is beginning to infiltrate other computer corners google is now hinting that in web searches for example humans might have a role in refining search results weeding out low quality pages in addition amazon com offers a site called "mechanical turk" named for a fake th century chess playing robot that is an outsourcing service for people to perform simple tasks under contract the pay is shockingly low write a summary of a movie plot for cents answer a question about computers for two cents its hard to know which is worse paying next to nothing or as with the games paying nothing at all to what extent is this use of humans to dot the is that computers cant themselves dot a retreat from the grand idea of computer scientists to have machines spare people from just this sort of work prof von ahn says its just a stopgap that in years at least in the case of vision and images all of these problems will have been solved and we wont need the human labor but he concedes that result is contingent upon a research breakthrough the likes of which he cant even begin to describe absent such a bolt from heaven even years might not be enough time at least in the field of computer vision and image recognition and human beings will likely be needed for much longer "we really are just inching along here " he says
