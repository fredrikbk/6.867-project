the mossberg solution testing out the iphone we spend two weeks using apples much anticipated device to see if it lives up to the hype in search of the comma key one of the most important trends in personal technology over the past few years has been the evolution of the humble cellphone into a true handheld computer a device able to replicate many of the key functions of a laptop but most of these "smart phones" have had lousy software confusing user interfaces and clumsy music video and photo playback and their designers have struggled to balance screen size keyboard usability and battery life now apple inc whose digital products are hailed for their design and innovation is jumping into this smart phone market with the iphone which goes on sale in a few days after months of the most frenzied hype and speculation we have ever seen for a single technology product even though the phones minimum price is a hefty &# people are already lining up outside apple stores to be among the first to snag one when they go on sale friday evening we have been testing the iphone for two weeks in multiple usage scenarios in cities across the country our verdict is that despite some flaws and feature omissions the iphone is on balance a beautiful and breakthrough handheld computer its software especially sets a new bar for the smart phone industry and its clever finger touch interface which dispenses with a stylus and most buttons works well though it sometimes adds steps to common functions the apple phone combines intelligent voice calling and a full blown ipod with a beautiful new interface for music and video playback it offers the best web browser we have seen on a smart phone and robust email software and it synchronizes easily and well with both windows and macintosh computers using apples itunes software it has the largest and highest resolution screen of any smart phone weve seen and the most internal memory by far yet it is one of the thinnest smart phones available and offers impressive battery life better than its key competitors claim it feels solid and comfortable in the hand and the way it displays photos videos and web pages on its gorgeous screen makes other smart phones look primitive the iphones most controversial feature the omission of a physical keyboard in favor of a virtual keyboard on the screen turned out in our tests to be a nonissue despite our deep initial skepticism after five days of use walt who did most of the testing for this review was able to type on it as quickly and accurately as he could on the palm treo he has used for years this was partly because of smart software that corrects typing errors on the fly but the iphone has a major drawback the cellphone network it uses it only works with at&amp t formerly cingular wont come in models that use verizon or sprint and cant use the digital cards called sim cards that would allow it to run on t mobiles network so the phone can be a poor choice unless you are in areas where at&amp ts coverage is good it does work overseas but only via an at&amp t roaming plan in addition even when you have great at&amp t coverage the iphone cant run on at&amp ts fastest cellular data network instead it uses a pokey network called edge which is far slower than the fastest networks from verizon or sprint that power many other smart phones and the initial iphone model cannot be upgraded to use the faster networks the iphone compensates by being one of the few smart phones that can also use wi fi wireless networks when you have access to wi fi the iphone flies on the web not only that but the iphone automatically switches from edge to known wi fi networks when it finds them and pops up a list of new wi fi networks it encounters as you move walt was able to log onto paid wi fi networks at starbucks and airports and even used a free wi fi network at fenway park in boston to email pictures taken during a red sox game but this wi fi capability doesnt fully make up for the lack of a fast cellular data capability because it is impractical to keep joining and dropping short range wi fi networks while taking a long walk or riding in a cab through a city at&amp t is offering special monthly calling plans for the iphone all of which include unlimited internet and email usage they range from &# to &# depending on the number of voice minutes included in an unusual twist iphone buyers wont choose their plans and activate their phones in the store instead they will do so when they first connect the iphone to the itunes software despite its simple interface with just four rows of colorful icons on a black background the iphone has too many features and functions to detail completely in this space but heres a rundown of the key features with pros and cons based on our testing hardware the iphone is simply beautiful it is thinner than the skinny samsung blackjack yet almost its entire surface is covered by a huge vivid inch display theres no physical keyboard just a single button that takes you to the home screen the phone is about as long as the treo the blackberry or the blackjack but its slightly wider than the blackjack or treo and heavier than the blackberry and blackjack the display is made of a sturdy glass not plastic and while it did pick up smudges it didnt acquire a single scratch even though it was tossed into walts pocket or briefcase or katies purse without any protective case or holster no scratches appeared on the rest of the body either there are only three buttons along the edges on the top theres one that puts the phone to sleep and wakes it up and on the left edge theres a volume control and a mute switch one downside some accessories for ipods may not work properly on the iphone the headphone jack which supports both stereo music and phone calls is deeply recessed so you may need an adapter for existing headphones and while the iphone uses the standard ipod port on the bottom edge it doesnt recognize all car adapters for playing music only for charging apple is considering a software update to fix this touch screen interface to go through long lists of emails contacts or songs you just "flick" with your finger to select items you tap to enlarge photos you "pinch" them by placing two fingers on their corners and dragging them in or out to zoom in on portions of web pages you double tap with your fingers you cannot use a stylus for any of this in the web browser and photo program if you turn the phone from a vertical to a horizontal position the image on the screen turns as well and resizes itself to fit in general we found this interface called "multi touch " to be effective practical and fun but theres no overall search on the iphone except web searching and no quick way to move to the top or bottom of pages except in the web browser the only aid is an alphabetical scale on the right in tiny type theres also no way to cut copy or paste text and the lack of dedicated hardware buttons for functions like phone email and contacts means extra taps are needed to start using features also if you are playing music while doing something else the lack of hardware playback buttons forces you to return to the ipod program to stop the music or change a song keyboard the virtual keys are large and get larger as you touch them software tries to guess what youre typing and fix errors overall it works but the error correction system didnt seem as clever as the one on the blackberry and you have to switch to a different keyboard view to insert a period or comma which is annoying web browsing the iphone is the first smart phone weve tested with a real computer grade web browser a version of apples safari it displays entire web pages in their real layouts and allows you to zoom in quickly by either tapping or pinching with your finger multiple pages can be open at the same time and you can conduct google or yahoo searches from a built in search box email the iphone can connect with most popular consumer email services including yahoo gmail aol earthlink and others it can also handle corporate email using microsofts exchange system if your it department cooperates by enabling a setting on the server blackberry email services cant be used on an iphone but yahoo mail supplies free blackberry style "push" email to iphone users in our test this worked fine unlike most phone email software the iphones shows a preview of each message so you dont have to open it and if there is a photo attached it shows the photo automatically without requiring you to click on a link to see it it can also receive and open microsoft word and excel documents and adobe pdf files but it doesnt allow you to edit or save these files memory the &# base model comes with four gigabytes of memory and the &# model has eight gigabytes thats far more than on any other smart phone but much less than on full size ipods also theres no slot for memory expansion cards our test &# model held songs a dozen videos including a full length movie over photos and over emails including some attachments and still had room left over battery life like the ipod but unlike most cellphones the iphone lacks a removable battery so you cant carry a spare but its battery life is excellent in our tests it got seven hours and minutes of continuous talk time while the wi fi was on and email was constantly being fetched in the background thats close to apples claim of a maximum of eight hours and far exceeds the talk time claims of other smart phones which usually top out at five and a half hours for continuous music playback again with wi fi on and email being fetched we got over hours shy of apples claim of up to hours but still huge for video playback under the same conditions we got just under apples claim of seven hours enough to watch four average length movies and for web browsing and other internet functions including sending and receiving emails viewing google maps and youtube videos we got over nine hours well above apples claim of up to six hours in real life of course you will do a mix of these things so the best gauge might be that in our two week test the iphone generally lasted all day with a typical mix of tasks phone calls the phone interface is clean and simple but takes more taps to reach than on many other smart phones because there are no dedicated hardware phone buttons you also cannot just start typing a name or number but must scroll through a list of favorites through your recent call list or your entire contact list you can also use a virtual keypad one great phone feature is called "visual voice mail " it shows you the names or at least the phone numbers of people who have left you voicemail so you can quickly listen to those you want its also very easy to turn the speakerphone on and off or to establish conference calls voice call quality was good but not great in some places especially in weak coverage areas there was some muffling or garbling but most calls were perfectly audible the iphone can use bluetooth wireless headsets and it comes with wired ipod style earbuds that include a microphone a downside theres no easy way to transfer phone numbers via at&amp t directly from an existing phone the iphone is meant to sync with an address book and calendar on a pc contacts and calendars these are pretty straightforward and work well the calendar lacks a week view though a list view helps fill that gap contacts can be gathered into groups but the groups cant be used as email distribution lists syncing the iphone syncs with both macs and windows pcs using itunes which handles not only the transfer of music and video but also photos contacts calendar items and browser bookmarks in our tests this worked well even on a windows vista machine using the latest version of outlook as the source for contacts and appointments ipod the built in ipod handles music and video perfectly and has all the features of a regular ipod but the interface is entirely new the famed scroll wheel is gone and instead finger taps and flicking move you through your collection and virtual controls appear on the screen theres also a version of the "cover flow" interface which allows you to select music by flipping through album covers other features there are widgets or small programs for accessing weather stock prices and google maps which includes route directions but no real time navigation another widget allows you to stream videos from youtube and yet another serves as a notepad theres a photo program that displays individual pictures or slideshows the only add on software apple is allowing will be web based programs that must be accessed through the on board web browser the company says these can be made to look just like built in programs but the few we tried werent impressive missing features the iphone is missing some features common on some competitors theres no instant messaging only standard text messaging while its two megapixel camera took excellent pictures in our tests it cant record video its otherwise excellent web browser cant fully utilize some web sites because it doesnt yet support adobes flash technology although the phone contains a complete ipod you cant use your songs as ringtones there arent any games nor is there any way to directly access apples itunes music store apple says it plans to add features to the phone over time via free downloads and hints that some of these holes may be filled expectations for the iphone have been so high that it cant possibly meet them all it isnt for the average person who just wants a cheap small phone for calling and texting but despite its network limitations the iphone is a whole new experience and a pleasure to use email us at mossbergsolution wsj com find all our columns and videos online free at the all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
