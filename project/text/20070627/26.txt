chevrons tahiti facility bets big on gulf oil boom on an oil platform machinery is typically crammed into every inch of deck space to the point where crews live two to a closet sized room but chevron corp has left precious deck space clear as it puts the finishing touches on tahiti a skyscraper sized offshore production facility illustrating the uncertainty about what will follow the current production boom in the u s gulf of mexico tahiti which is scheduled to produce first commercial oil in mid is one of several new multibillion dollar energy projects in the deepwater gulf taken together they are expected to temporarily halt a year decline in u s oil production by the end of the decade "tahiti is one of chevrons five big projects " said peter robertson vice chairman of the san ramon calif companys board "its going to be extremely important to our growth prospects in the future " chevron the second largest u s oil company by market capitalization expects the &# billion platform to increase output to barrels a day of high quality oil within seven months of the start of production other companies will be scrutinizing how chevron the second largest u s oil company by market capitalization uses the empty patch on tahitis top production deck as much as the initial production figures the space is marked off for whatever equipment will be needed to slow the decline that will come a few years or perhaps even months after tahiti hits its peak all fields decline at some point but other projects in the deepwater gulf have seen unexpectedly rapid dropoffs in production if successful tahiti and its peers will offer the best confirmation yet that the gulf can live up to its promise "it will be closely watched " said julie wilson senior gulf of mexico analyst with wood mackenzie in houston "people will be very interested to see how those wells perform " tahiti like nearly every other major deepwater field under development lies beneath the "salt canopy " a layer of minerals that begins about miles off the easternmost tip of louisiana and extends to the texas coast the salt hides crucial details about oil reservoirs from even the most advanced imaging techniques meaning chevron wont know how difficult it will be to maintain the flow of oil once production begins next year but chevron and its competitors are eager to take on the risk of drilling into the salt with earlier hotspots ranging from the shallower end of the gulf to the north slope of alaska seen in irreversible decline deepwater also represents a last surge for u s oil production a wave of discoveries some in development since the late s are expected to boost deepwater production from barrels a day in to million barrels a day in according to the u s minerals management service an agency that oversees oil and gas production in federal waters "over a five year period the operators have been fairly good about predicting what they are capable of producing " though forecasting more than five years forward is considerably more difficult said richie baud who co wrote the mms deepwater forecast chevrons field in particular will be observed for how the strong flow of oil seen in early well tests will hold up over time tahiti will start with just six production wells producing an average barrels a day double the flow at other similar projects chevron outlines three possible scenarios for tahiti each of which could apply to other projects counted on to boost production in the region chevron owns a stake in the field with norways statoil controlling and frances total sa controlling recoverable reserves are estimated at million to million barrels in the most optimistic scenario tahitis oil is sitting in one giant easily accessible reservoir which would allow the platform to produce at maximum capacity for five years with little interference a more likely though still rosy situation would have chevron drill three more wells to boost production once the decline begins the least desired path would involve extracting oil tucked away in many small reservoirs known as compartments with most of the crude isolated from tahitis six initial wells chevron would need to drill six new wells along with extra holes used to inject water into the reservoir to flush out pockets of oil billy varnado who manages the tahiti project gives water injection odds not good enough to install the equipment on the platform before it ships out but enough to justify leaving deck space open for the possibility chevron officials tend to avoid comparing tahiti to other deepwater finds where the track record so far has been shaky "every deepwater field is unique " mr varnado says of the three fields leading the next wave of deepwater production tahiti is the only one to come in on time and on budget bp plcs atlantis with an expected peak of barrels a day is scheduled to start production sometime this year delayed from thunder horse a barrel a day platform also operated by bp is due for a two year delay smaller fields have had equally spotty luck murphy oil corp built a barrel a day platform over its front runner field about miles northeast of tahiti in production peaked at barrels a day murphy now says front runner will average no more than barrels a day this year bp operated mad dog drilled into a similar rock formation same geological age of tahitis reserves is built to handle wells producing barrels a day but currently operates at half its capacity drilling the wells has proven slower and more expensive than expected past failures by other companies have kept chevron from making long term predictions about tahiti said ms wilson of wood mackenzie "chevron has seen other people burned with news of poor performance " she said "theyre just being very realistic " although production has lagged well behind the pace of discovery the energy majors over the past year have continued to move forward on earlier finds that arent expected see first oil until at the top of the list for chevron is jack a discovery more than miles southwest of tahiti chevron completed a successful well test last year and will drill a second well later this year that far offshore the majors are encountering formations unlike any they have ever exploited before said mr baud of mms "to a large degree jack is an unknown " mr baud said "its a different type of rock altogether " the salt canopy by comparison is crystal clear
