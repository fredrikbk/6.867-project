prosperitys pitfall why indian lions are dying in wells the deep unfenced holes are peril to man and beast gujarats rescue squad sasan gir india three months ago babu chhagan senjaliya was awakened by a stench that wafted through his cotton field using a flashlight the indian farmer spotted paw prints that led toward his new well an open hole feet deep and wide enough to swallow a tractor holding his nose mr senjaliya peered inside and saw the bloated corpses of two young lions floating in the water the lions apparently had chased an antelope through the farm a few nights earlier and fallen in such lethal plunges are common here in the gir forest the only part of the world where the rare asiatic lion still survives according to forestry officials about lions inhabit this hilly speck of northwest indias gujarat state in the past five years about lions are said to have dropped into open wells about half of them have either drowned or died of injuries caused by their falls others have been rescued many of the victims were cubs "in the night they chase the prey and sometimes we see both the prey and the predator at the bottom of a well all dead sometimes they just get curious and fall down " says bharat patak the top forestry official in charge of the gir forest "livestock is also falling human beings are also falling into open wells " he adds "but the lion is more important " the reason for these mishaps is simple according to mr patak more lions and more people who need more wells all competing for the same small patch of land lions needs usually take precedence here in gir the big cats are hugely important as a potential tourist draw for the gujarat state and as a powerful symbol of india a separate subspecies distinct from the more common african lion the panthera leo persica once roamed from the ganges to the balkans poems pictures and songs have been dedicated to the lions singh the indic word for lion is the surname shared by millions of indians hindus and sikhs including current prime minister manmohan singh even indias national emblem emblazoned on its passports and currency is modeled after a sculpture of four asiatic lions that was erected years ago on the orders of emperor ashoka "youll find lions being worshiped everywhere in india " says pradeep khanna the chief wildlife warden of gujarat "here a lion is the symbol of power " one of the reasons for these animals deadly problem with wells is the very success of the countrys preservation program in the early th century when the local monarch the nawab of junagadh proclaimed the lion a protected species only a couple of dozen harried cats remained in the gir forest the exact number is uncertain now the unfenced gir sanctuary where tourists in decrepit off road vehicles go on lion safaris has become far too small for the multiplying felines asiatic lions whose males typically have a shorter mane than their african cousins can often be spotted on roadsides several miles from the sanctuary and occasionally they block the local railway they also frequently visit nearby farms preferring the ease of snatching cows and goats to the strain of running after deer and antelope the government usually compensates farmers for livestock killed by lions farmers meanwhile have also become more numerous and richer as indias economy keeps expanding the benefits of development such as state supplied electricity have trickled even into this remote corner of gujarat as a result an agricultural revolution is under way in the villages of this dusty sun baked region traditionally villagers here relied on the monsoon rains for their crops and kept their land idle in the dry months now those who can afford it dig wells on their properties and irrigate their crops with an electric pump throughout the year most of these wells are unfenced unguarded holes in the ground just like the one on mr senjaliyas cotton farm in the village of rabarica mr senjaliya says he spent rupees &# a large sum for rural india to dig his well four years ago by last year he had saved enough to fit it with an electric pump "it cost me too much " he complained as pigeons nestling in the walls of the well made a riotous noise in the darkness below "if i had any money left i would have built a parapet around the well but i have no money left " mr senjaliya adds that he was saddened by the death of the two lions which often cavorted near the farm and unlike other lions that occasionally maul villagers in the region never showed any aggressiveness toward humans "we like the lions to hang around here because they kill the animals that spoil our crops the blue bulls the wild boars the deer " he explained "lions are good for us " some of these cats that drop into wells which can be even deeper than mr senjaliyas survive if they are noticed in time one early morning last year farmer pacha kambaliye was greeted by a neighbors shrieking children when he arrived at his groundnut field near the village of dhaneg on the edge of the forest "look something has fallen into your well " they shouted it didnt take long for mr kambaliye to realize there were two lion cubs at the bottom one dead and one still living he ran to the village and phoned the forestry rangers a rescue team arrived minutes later a ranger descended into the well wrapping the cub in a gunnysack and safely taking him to the surface the cub which recovered on the farm was eventually picked up by his mother rescuing adult lions presents more of a challenge says gir ranger naval aparnathi who says he has participated in fishing live lions out of wells the usual method is to lower a loop of rope and try to fasten it under a trapped lions front legs "the lion is very angry when we put down the rope " says mr aparnathi "but when he sees khaki uniforms he relaxes because he knows were there for him " once a rope is secured dozens of villagers combine forces in pulling the struggling roaring animal which can weigh as much as pounds into a cage placed at the edge of the well no such salvage missions have to be carried out inside the gir sanctuary the lions core habitat all the wells there forestry officials say have already been lion proofed with parapets or fences but there are at least unprotected wells within miles of the sanctuary on farms like mr senjaliyas and mr kambaliyes forestry officials estimate that it will take about &# million to make all these wells safe for lions an amount that the gujarat government says it doesnt have the states conservation officials last month adopted a novel approach at a meeting with representatives of major indian companies including tata chemicals ltd reliance industries ltd and the anil ambani group they asked for help from the countrys flourishing private sector the response was overwhelming with most participants pledging money for the high profile project reliance industries alone has promised to spend &# on lion proofing wells and an additional &# for a lion ambulance according to parimal nathwani the conglomerates gujarat based president for corporate affairs "a lion " he explains "is a very royal and prestigious animal "
