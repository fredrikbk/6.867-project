weekend journal taste houses of worship rome ward bound last month francis beckwith president of the evangelical theological society ets noted evangelical philosopher "god blogger" and professor of church state relations at baylor university was received into full communion with the roman catholic church shortly after he resigned his presidency and membership in ets sending shock waves through the religious blogosphere and parts of the evangelical community the ets executive committee of which i am a member as a past president of the society myself released a statement thanking mr beckwith for his many contributions to the society and expressing its desire to maintain cordial relations with him the committee also noted that his resignation was appropriate since the ets affirms that "the bible alone is the word of god written " the phrase "the bible alone" in the ets context refers to the books in the old and new testaments of the protestant canon and thus rules out mr beckwiths continued membership given that the roman catholic church accepts additional books in the canon commonly referred to as deuterocanonical or apocryphal books mr beckwith maintains that he can still sign the ets statement with full integrity because it does not enumerate the books but he voluntarily withdrew his membership in the interests of avoiding a rancorous debate in the society responses to mr beckwiths conversion run the gamut a small number of evangelicals have reacted as if he committed an act of betrayal among many more including us on the executive committee the response has been one of cordial disagreement on some critical matters accompanied by an acknowledgment that we nevertheless have much in common as fellow christians mr beckwiths conversion did catch many off guard though not since the conversion of thomas howard a graduate of wheaton college evangelicalisms flagship school had a scholar of such high profile made the journey "from wheaton to rome " a professor of english literature and prolific author mr howard was widely read among evangelical intellectuals and his conversion sparked a similar reaction to mr beckwiths including a page spread in christianity today as it happens i am mr howards nephew and thus watched his conversion from close range it was anything but sudden his and my fathers family of origin embraced a robust protestant fundamentalism in the s but in the s feeling an aesthetic as well as theological longing he became an episcopalian and finally in the s a catholic he retains some of the best of his fundamentalist upbringing a vibrant personal piety and commitment to historic orthodox doctrine even as he embraces the full teachings of the catholic church mr howard was among the first of what has become a steady stream of evangelical converts to catholicism in the past years three who achieved prominence after their conversions were the singer john michael talbot now the no catholic recording artist scott hahn a best selling catholic author and joshua hochschild a professor at wheaton fired for his conversion in a common element among these converts is a strong commitment to the catechism and papal encyclicals these catholics are not generally in sympathy with the theologically liberal wing of the american catholic church but are enthusiastic supporters of popes john paul ii and benedict xvis emphasis on orthodox teaching and practice in short they have more in common theologically with evangelicals than with liberal catholics and evangelicals themselves in many respects have more in common with traditional catholics than with mainline protestants especially on social and political issues there is much room for common cause evangelical catholic relations have not been this cordial in the past of course history is littered with the corpses sometimes literally of past conflict and conversion from one camp to the other was for a long time almost unheard of the second vatican council however with its more ecumenical outlook changed the landscape and relations between catholics and protestants in most parts of the world have improved greatly since in the u s one encouraging development is evangelicals and catholics together ect an enterprise that began under the leadership of charles colson an evangelical and the rev richard john neuhaus once a lutheran minister and now a catholic priest since the ect has issued position papers highlighting "important areas of agreement and disagreement among us " francis beckwiths conversion to catholicism should be seen in this same light in an email he states "my academic work has always dealt with issues and questions that concern all christians protestant catholic and orthodox my return to the catholic church will not change that project " for myself i can say that i have lost a valued colleague in the ets but i remain his brother in christ and wish him well in his new spiritual home mr howard is the dean of the center for biblical and theological foundations at bethel university in st paul minn
