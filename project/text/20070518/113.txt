weekend journal the home front catalog critic summer grilling testing big ticket beef as fatty kobe style wagyu grows popular despite price we get out the butter knife along with &# grills and &# outdoor pizza ovens theres another expensive item showing up in backyard barbecues lately &# steaks those pricey cuts are wagyu steaks a variation of japans famed kobe beef authentic kobe beef comes from the wagyu breed of cattle raised around kobe japan often called "white steak " its known for its intense fattiness and rich foie gras like taste thats partly thanks to special treatment for the cows including a carefully chosen diet and sometimes even massages what americans call wagyu is essentially the same animal only bred outside of kobe in countries like the u s and australia there can be other differences wagyu raised in the u s typically has a lower percentage of fat regional preferences play into the formula american diners mostly eat the steak on its own while japanese chefs are just as likely to use the meat in soup style dishes still the best wagyu is generally fattier and more marbled than usda rated prime beef and some retailers say their steaks are tender enough to eat with a butter knife the wagyu breed was introduced in the u s in the mid s and demand has grown over the past few years the american wagyu association reports that its membership mostly consisting of ranchers has more than doubled in the past five years to over and given that wagyu can be hard to find in local markets it has become a popular mail order item morgan ranch a rancher and retailer

dinners to see if the steaks live up to the hype we ordered wagyu new york or sirloin strips from five vendors and grilled them up with beef expert bart castellano owner of the meat supreme chain in new york and the garden of eden market in jupiter fla in a blind taste test mr castellano found that almost all the steaks were as good as or better than the best u s prime rated beef angus or otherwise they werent always more expensive one top choice cost &# a steak before shipping but finding good wagyu can be a complicated proposition cross breeding among the cattle is common and most products on the market are actually half wagyu half angus says american wagyu association spokesman charles gaskins some ranchers and retailers aim for a higher percentage morgan ranch says its cows are mostly to wagyu while lobels says it requires a minimum of there are no federal rating systems for wagyu unlike most steak sold in supermarkets labeled by quality from "select" to "prime " its not graded by the u s agriculture department finally almost every ranch has a proprietary blend of grain and roughage for the cattles diet and cows that are raised longer can yield more marbled steaks our weakest wagyu picks had less of the fatty richness that defines the breed and in one instance mr castellano detected a liver like aftertaste the best entries lobels wins best overall and morgan ranch wins best value literally melted in the mouth in fact you could use a butter knife to cut them at least that saves you from buying an expensive set of steak knives how we shopped first we read through
