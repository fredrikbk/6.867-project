ports in a storm activists choke growth of european shipping space demand increases as asia imports rise ms aperss crusade when local residents got in the way of the yangshan deep water port near shanghai in chinese authorities knocked down their houses sent a few protesters to labor camp and finished the three year expansion right on time the chinese however didnt have to contend with marina apers a year old cleaning woman who has become the bane of belgiums port of antwerp a major shipping terminal for european goods and an important hub for receiving asian exports supported by strict european union environmental laws and a band of die hard residents squatters and gypsies ms apers has sued to keep alive the th century village of doel which was slated for destruction her efforts delayed the first stage of the antwerp ports expansion by three years and now stand in the way of new infrastructure and a second container dock port officials say at a time when the global container shipping trade is growing by a year thanks to booming exports from asia europes ports cant keep up say growth advocates a combination of environmental protections and resistance from local residents is helping to stifle ports expansion plans across the continent and with china planning to spend &# billion in the next years on building and expanding ports the mismatch between its capacity to ship and europes ability to receive goods is growing fast some maritime economists say all this could have big implications for the european economy as europes deep water ports jam up ships from china will face growing costs as they wait in line to dock fewer imports could lead to higher prices for consumers and shortages of some goods made in asia if exports are affected it could restrict economic growth in europe activists contend that port expansion projects are classic boondoggles that offer few benefits while causing more pollution traffic and the loss of plant and animal life they wonder why existing ports cant be modified to handle more capacity or why consumers cant simply change their spending habits "europe just needs to buy less from asia " says joris wijnhoven a netherlands based campaigner against port expansion at friends of the earth an environmental group in the first quarter of of container ships arrived late in european ports up from in the same period last year according to the latest annual report by drewry shipping consultants ltd every extra day at sea costs shipping companies an average &# per vessel rotterdam in the netherlands hamburg in germany and southampton in the united kingdom all had to turn away container ships for lack of docking space lately in march alone rotterdam sent away or delayed more than ships and containers the average european port expansion project delay caused by activism or environmental hurdles is now four years according to drewry "in that time china builds another rotterdam " says neil davidson the consulting firms london based director rotterdam is the worlds third biggest port in terms of tonnage shipped after singapore and shanghai u s ports face expansion hurdles too environmental activists and local residents in houston los angeles and charleston s c have delayed projects although the u s also has tough environmental rules and protected areas its coastline is less crowded and offers more area for expansion say port experts additionally ports in mexico and canada have been taking some of the overflow thats an option the eu doesnt have because of bad road and rail connections and strict border controls with eastern neighbors like russia and turkey at the heart of the scramble to build more port space is the world economys increasing reliance on containers these are or foot steel boxes that goods are packed into so they can be easily transferred within ports then mounted on ships trucks or trains containerized shipping requires deep water docks new infrastructure and more storage space asia increasingly the worlds factory has moved fast to build up container port capacity so it can ship and sell its goods singapore alone can handle million container units with a unit defined as one footer or half a footer per year five other asian ports can handle more than million units in europe only rotterdam can los angeles at around eight million units is the top american port british ports have so little capacity to receive big container ships from asia that they often send them to dock across the english channel where containers are then transferred to smaller ships destined for britain port authorities in hamburg plan to deepen parts of the elbe river so the port can handle bigger container ships the project has yet to begin because of opposition from environmental activists and a group called save the elbe in rotterdam environmentalists and a fishermens association have used the courts and eu law to delay a new &# billion terminal that port authorities had hoped to start building in the mammoth project will involve putting down new dikes and filling in acres of north sea water with sand opponents complain the new docks will disrupt the transport of fish larvae and silt along the coast and damage air quality construction on the rotterdam project is now scheduled to begin in six years late and to be completed by friends of the earths mr wijnhoven however says the group plans further legal action meaning that further delays are possible besides advocating less consumption activists also decry the polluted water and air that ports produce they point out that europe has dozens of smaller ports that could handle excess capacity "why do we have to choose between people and the economy why cant we have both " asks rudi van buel a doel resident who opposes the expansion port advocates counter that smaller ports lack the railway lines roads and barge connections to handle more traffic "eu environmental law allows activists here to cause massive delays and legal uncertainty for investors " says eric van hooydonk a lawyer retained by the antwerp port who has written a book called "the impact of eu environmental law on ports and waterways " indeed activists across europe have been using the eus habitats directive it prohibits major construction near protected nature areas unless builders can prove the project is fundamental to national economic interest and cant take place anywhere else because european coastlines are so crowded ports are frequently located near nature reserves the european commission the eus executive arm is now preparing a special policy to give europes ports extra legal ammunition in battles with environmental activists "if our rules on the environment unduly hamper investment in ports trucks will stay on the road with all the negative consequences " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said in a speech last year in china there have been more cases of individuals blocking projects in recent years but protesters are often at the mercy of the state when residents of little yangshan island opposed plans to evict them to make way for expanding the port there government officials moved in to negotiate case by case but when a group of residents traveled to beijing to protest the government convicted several of organizing an "illegal complaint trip " one was sentenced to jail and five were sent to a labor camp some people were moved out of their homes ahead of schedule the &# billion project was completed on time in the port of antwerp faces steeper obstacles nearly a decade after belgian authorities ordered doel to be razed in the village is still standing holding up expansion plans while traffic at the port has almost doubled antwerp belgiums second biggest city blossomed as a world class harbor in the middle ages and its port grew rapidly as it rode europes industrial recovery after world war ii the right bank of the schelde river was developed first because it was on higher ground on the left bank scenic villages such as doel became popular getaway destinations day trippers took in the windmill the beach and the th century house that once belonged to the family of peter paul rubens that structure is a prominent element of marina aperss defense of doel although the flemish painter himself never lived there when villages on the scheldes right bank got in the way of port development in the s and s inhabitants were evicted and compensated "there were opponents but they didnt have the support of eu environmental law " says patrick verhoeven president of the brussels based european sea ports organization by the s the right bank was crowded with petrochemical plants and docks in the belgian government announced it would start expanding the port on the left bank where a massive nuclear power already sat and in it was doels turn the plan was to first build a new container dock south of the village and a second where the village stands at a later date the government set aside &# million to buy up homes and ordered it to be leveled by roughly of doels inhabitants had cleared out streets are quiet now and most houses are empty "you cant really live there anyway " says eddy bruyninckx the ceo of the antwerp port authority noting the growing traffic to serve the newly built dock and the nuclear power plant which towers over the village just a few hundred yards from ms aperss kitchen window thats not how some residents felt one elderly man in despair at having to leave hanged himself ms apers who moved here with her family in likes the beach and her minute bicycle ride to work at the nuclear power plant "we wont become monkeys in a traffic jam " says ms apers she hired a prominent belgian lawyer named mathias storme who agreed to work for a minimal fee she also helped found an activist group called doel filing regular legal motions she and mr storme held up the project several times in march she filed a petition claiming the port project violated the eu habitats directive and won the project was delayed until when the flemish regional government grew so frustrated it invoked special emergency powers to overrule the court ruling according to the government doel was an uninhabitable no mans land "we needed the project for jobs " says marc van de vijver mayor of beveren county which includes doel authorities estimate the &# billion expansion will create jobs the first dock was finished in three years late support for ms apers has come from an unlikely source the motley crew that moved in to doels empty houses pieter de winter says he was living a life of "playstation and parties" with his girlfriend in brussels when he heard about the empty houses in doel the high school dropout moved into a three bedroom brick home with a large backyard on the main strip squatters vagrants and gypsies now known as roma from all over europe started showing up and doel became a cause celebre among european environmentalists in response the flemish authorities negotiated a settlement the squatters could stay if they paid rent most of the roma families left mr de winter stayed where else could he find a three bedroom house for &# a month to pay the rent mr de winter and his girlfriend started a cafe called effort he now makes a living selling cheap beer to locals and visiting activists a delegation from the hard line environmental group sea shepherds and delegates from a finnish nature group were through recently says mr de winter at first ms apers was suspicious of her new neighbors "then i realized all these people living here could help us argue in court its worth protecting " she says five young women in town are pregnant she notes the new inhabitants helped persuade the flemish government earlier this year to push back the date for doels demolition to august to give them time to leave the port says it plans to start construction on a second container dock shortly thereafter or use the space to support the existing one ms apers and her lawyer have filed suit against the demolition decision at the european court of human rights in strasbourg arguing that the flemish government violated normal judicial procedure and is unjustified in ruling that the town is uninhabitable a win she hopes could secure doels future flemish authorities say theyll start knocking down more than uninhabited houses
