love actually london on wednesday june there are going to be a lot of very disappointed people in britains labour party that is the day gordon brown "kisses hands" with the queen at buckingham palace and receives the seals of office that tony blair will have returned to her earlier that morning mr brown wont actually put his lips to the monarchs hands a practice that has sadly fallen into abeyance it is also the day that millions of labour voters hope he will announce britains withdrawal from iraq in the movie "love actually" there is a scene in which the british prime minister played by hugh grant uses a downing street press conference to denounce the american president played by billy bob thornton as an international bully he announces the end of the special relationship and britains supposed client status vis a vis the u s labour activists are plumping up the sofa cushions in front of their tv sets in excited anticipation hoping for a real life replay of that moment it wont happen gordon brown has an acute sense of britains place in the world and if it is not going to integrate more fully into the european union it desperately needs a powerful political and economic counterpoise he has regularly rejected opportunities for britain to enter the euro zone and will continue to do so to alienate the u s at a time that britain is popular there for some short term domestic political advantage is precisely the kind of accusation he regularly flings at his tory opponents he was tony blairs chief lieutenant of the past years for of them he sat in on the central cabinet decisions that took britain to american led wars in kosovo afghanistan and iraq even so much as a raised eyebrow or a subdued cough indicating his dissent could have derailed british involvement entirely they never came so on june he will have to face the disconcerting sight of seeing his own face replacing mr blairs on the protest banners pasted on to the body of a poodle mr brown has sat in on the security service briefings warning senior politicians that mi is presently monitoring no fewer than "active" terrorist plots in the u k close cooperation with the u s over counterterrorism would not cease were british troops to be withdrawn from iraq but the close effective and year long intelligence relationship would be seriously damaged similarly britains present updating of its nuclear deterrent system while not ending should the troops leave basra would become a much more protracted expensive and difficult exercise no one expects mr browns relationship with president bush to be as close as tony blairs was the modern day equivalent of the unanimity of purpose exhibited by lord salisbury and teddy roosevelt fdr and churchill macmillan and jfk reagan and thatcher but it will not be frosty cordially workmanlike is all either side needs right now the fact that president bush "popped in" to say hello to mr brown on his recent visit to the white house but with no photos taken that would have embarrassed mr brown in any leadership contest shows how the administration appreciates the delicacy of this moment for him president bush rightly does not expect a brown ministry to distance itself on anything but the most cosmetic level from his administration mr brown holidays almost every summer in nantucket he went there for his honeymoon too speaking to him last year at a breakfast organized by the atlantic partnership itself not an event hed have attended unless he was happy to be identified as pro american i was impressed by his knowledge of and fascination for american political biography the special relationship will be safe in his hands moreover there is no british general election necessary until june and the american election will take place in november by the time mr brown needs to face the polls he will have had the best part of a year being photographed with the new u s president and his collaboration with the bush administration will be a distant memory when the antiwar mp george galloway accused tony blair of being bushs poodle over iraq the prime minister replied "its worse than that i actually believe it " so does mr brown who is on record as saying that he would have done the same thing as mr blair under the same circumstances since the labour left was unable to corral any meaningful opposition to mr brown as leader he will be under even less pressure in the commons to distance himself from tony blairs foreign policy legacy that legacy of liberal non imperial interventionism backed by the repeated use of force has not been seen in its present form since the days of george canning and lord palmerston the relatively short length of the iraqi insurgency only four years in the post world historical struggle and the relatively small number of british soldiers killed so far ought not to have turned the british public against the blair doctrine but they have mr browns task will be to stay in iraq defend the special relationship and yet not look like a poodle good luck gordon mr roberts is the author of "a history of the english speaking peoples since " harpercollins see related letter "letters to the editor most unlikely candidate for the title pacifist" wsj may
