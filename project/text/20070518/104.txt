weekend journal review film magical once is pitch perfect rock love story thirteen eloquent songs and a battered guitar shreks welcome return it takes all of seconds for john carneys "once" to announce itself as something special a handsome young street musician in dublin raises his voice in song then raises it higher with heart stopping fervor when a mysteriously endearing young woman stops to interrogate the busker about his music she turns out to be a musician too the movie reveals itself as something magical when they sing their first duet its a song of such transporting passion that you wonder where the drama can possibly go since theyre obviously made for each other and should instantly leave the screen to live the rest of their lives in private bliss the lovers are played by glen hansard the lead singer of the irish rock group the frames and marketa irglova a musician from the czech republic amazingly given her gifts as a singer pianist and actress ms irglova was only years old when the movie was shot both performances give new meaning to the timeworn phrase "pitch perfect " while both characters do nicely without names theyre listed in the credits only as the guy and the girl coy appellations of this sort often serve as warning labels for faux simple fables that are fatuous or downright cloying but thats hardly the case here "once" proves to be as smart and funny as it is sweet it swirls with ambiguity and conflict beneath a simple surface in all of minutes mr carneys singular fable follows its guy and girl through a week of musical and emotional growth that could suffice for a lifetime music is intrinsic to the filmmakers plan the love story can be seen and felt and heard as a succession of chord changes and the exquisite resolution amounts to a mutual musical offering at a time when movie musicals have come to be synonymous with emotional and visual extravagance the super mega over the topness of "chicago" or "dreamgirls" mr carney has dared to take everything down to its essence whats left is two intensely likable people trying urgently through very few words and a bakers dozen of eloquent songs to come to terms with love theyve lost and collaborate on the future as guys go this one seems like the answer to a girls prayer he sings like an angel a loud angel whos no stranger to anger he summons sumptuous sounds from his battered guitar and writes brilliant songs when he isnt fixing hoover vacuums in his fathers dickensian shop as girls go this one is irresistible from the first moment she opens her mouth when was the last time you couldnt wait to find out what a movie character was all about shes got spunk to spare speaks with a slightly extra terrestrial accent sings with no accent at all writes her own powerful songs and miracle of miracles has a hoover that needs repair in one of the many memorable sequences in the film which was shot by tim fleming she trails her ailing vacuum cleaner like a blue dog on a hose as she and her guy stroll through dublins streets in the year that glen hansard started the frames he also played outspan the baby faced dublin guitar player in "the commitments " a feature that has gained a global following its one of my favorite films ever what makes "the commitments" so widely loved is among other pleasures its use of a working class rock bands rise and fall as an armature for individual drama "once" may earn the same special status by doing something similar albeit on a more intimate scale using pop rock songs to shape its characters ecstatic feelings and very much like "the commitments " this remarkable new irish film grounds its guy and girl in the rock solid specifics of musicianship when she plays mendelssohn on a piano in a music store he listens with enchanted intensity when they finally get to singing lyrics she has written to his melody the sense of their intimacy transcends physicality its worth noting that the story neither needs nor bothers with conventional sexual interludes my own feeling is that i should say something negative here how else will anyone trust all this praise in fact the film presents inevitable language problems not bad language of which there is more than a soupcon but the authentic and sometimes impenetrable language of a guy from ireland and a girl from moravia who dont speak in mid atlantic tones another problem could be more substantial or may have been confined to the projection at my screening where the audio quality of some of the music tracks left a lot to be desired enough of that though the title of one of those tracks is "you must have fallen from the sky " thats the way i came to feel about "once " shrek the third we live in a world of wonders according to the production notes for "shrek the third " the animation artists used hp dli proliant servers and hp xw workstations powered by amd operton processors so whats the result a parallel world of wonders zestfully conceived and radiantly rendered in which the great hearted ogre tries his likeable best to avoid the parallel threats of kingship and parenthood this latest iteration of dreamworkss money machine has its ups and downs its longueurs along with its felicities plus an abiding preoccupation with poop in the proper context though a profusion of feature animation thats second rate or worse "shreks" return is a signal event and the signal of course shines green the issue of reigning over the kingdom of far far away is raised by the death of fionas froggy father king harold who voiced by john cleese gives a hilariously rambling death bed speech shrek is the logical successor to the throne but terrified by the responsibility he sails off to find an acceptable substitute in fionas cousin artie justin timberlake a student at medieval high where hogwarts meets the san fernando valley eddie murphys donkey and antonio banderass puss are back too although donkeys role has lost its bite without losing its whinny for a while it sounded as if someone was impersonating mr murphy among the new arrivals are eric idles merlin who puts on an impressive magic show and despite shreks worst fears and best efforts at denial a houseful of cute little baby ogres who draw not only thanks to the wonders of computers from vast reservoirs of spit up dvd tip "brassed off" is a fantasy with music set in working class yorkshire during the thatcher era when the government was closing coal pits throughout britain in one grimy town a colliery brass band struggles on in the quixotic belief that its survival will save the local
