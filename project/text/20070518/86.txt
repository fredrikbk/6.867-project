the new style of fashion investment permiras bid for valentino signals a search for value that goes beyond designer earlier this week while the owners of italian fashion house valentino talked with bankers in milan about selling the company valentino garavani boarded a jet to the south of france the year old designer flew to the cannes film festival to conduct the type of negotiations that have made his brand famous wooing hollywood celebrities to wear his floor sweeping gowns at one of the years most glamorous events since mr garavani founded his brand years ago he has been intricately linked to its image using his villas in capri and rome to host parties and fashion shoots but now with the fashion world expecting him to retire soon and his brand poised to change hands for the third time in a decade mr garavani is no longer at the core of valentino he wasnt consulted by the marzotto family which controlled valentino fashion group spa when they sold their stake in the company to private equity fund permira on wednesday permira which said late yesterday it had entered exclusive talks to buy a further of the fashion group from other members of the marzotto family hasnt contacted the designer either according to a person close to the situation mr garavanis exclusion from the decision is one more sign of the historic shift in the worlds luxury goods industry as the fashion world completes its transformation from a family based business into a &# billion global industry subject to shareholders corporate raids and rising competition the influence of once powerful designers is eroding "it comes down to finance versus design " says pamela golbin the curator at the paris fashion museum musee de la mode et du textile "theres no longer going to be a designer establishment " yesterday the fate of valentino lay in the hands of financiers permiras stake purchase values the company at around &# billion and its move to try to buy a further underscores the private equity funds effort to take undisputed control of the fashion house but u s private equity fund carlyle group said yesterday that its also considering an offer for the valentino group which includes a majority stake in german fashion house hugo boss prefacing a possible takeover battle for two of the biggest names in high fashion on the milan stock exchange yesterday shares rose to close at about &# its unclear whether mr garavani would stay on under a new owner mr garavani didnt respond to requests for comment many of the worlds fashion houses are part of publicly traded luxury goods conglomerates such lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton sa and frances ppr sa with their financial heft and negotiating power these industry giants are making life harder for independent family owned players that are coming under increased pressure to sell as a result private equity funds have recently entered the fray snapping up small fashion houses such as jimmy choo and jil sander last year apax partners spent &# billion to buy tommy hilfiger corp amid a global boom in the luxury goods market and fast growing new markets such as india china and russia private equity firms are betting they can make fashion brands flourish with the right management and fresh funds as the finances of the industry change however the balance of power between designers and managers has shifted efficient logistics that can get products onto shelves when consumers want them are as important as beautiful designs parties fashion shows and extravagant lifestyles that once put designers at the center of the fashion world are giving way to more calculated retail and marketing strategies moreover many of the worlds famous designers including mr garavani giorgio armani and karl lagerfeld are reaching retirement age a new generation of designers including nicolas ghesquiere at balenciaga and marc jacobs at louis vuitton is being groomed to heed consumer tastes rather than creating in a vacuum in many cases designers are playing second fiddle to merchandisers and executives who manage the books when celebrated u s designer tom ford left gucci three years ago the italian fashion house turned its back on the celebrity designer strategy that was at the heart of the brands resurgence in the s under little known creative head frida giannini the label is selling more wearable clothes and has broken sales records even at versace whose founder gianni versace was murdered in designer donatella versace has taken a back seat as the fashion house focuses on high margin accessories to boost profitability "brands are born from charismatic designers but that doesnt mean you always need the designer associated with the brand " says ubs luxury goods analyst yasuhiro yamaguchi he notes that mr garavani for some time hasnt been involved in designing valentinos menswear line or its accessories which contribute the highest profit margins its still unclear how the industrys transformation will shake out history shows that many fashion houses that lost key designers also lost their way storied names such as yves saint laurent and givenchy foundered for years when a new creative direction didnt click with consumers in fashion brand loyalty has been closely linked with designers mr garavani for instance has a large roster of private clients who are drawn to the way he cuts a princess coat not just to the brand name "its very important for the final customer to know the designer is there " says massimo macchi the chief executive of italian fashion brand gianfranco ferre mr ferre stayed on with the brand when it holding spa bought it five years ago "the designers personality is one of our key communication points " thats why as valentinos new owners decide whether to keep mr garavani on board or choose a new designer they will have to tread carefully "you want to see stability but you also want to see evolution " says robert burke head of the new york based luxury goods consultancy robert burke associates and the former fashion director at bergdorf goodman "choosing a pope is probably a good analogy " mr garavani is one of several star designers who flourished in the s and s messrs saint laurent lagerfeld and armani became celebrities in their own right and their personal images were directly linked to the success of their brands mr garavani lived the lifestyle of his customers employing butlers and hanging picassos on the walls of his mansions endowing his brand with his own personal glamour in the s however the industry began to change lvmh morphed into the worlds first and biggest luxury goods conglomerate by buying lagging family owned brands such as fendi and givenchy rival gucci group took a similar approach expanding from its main gucci label to include brands such as yves saint laurent balenciaga and shoemaker sergio rossi but as the groups grew tensions developed between managers and designers who tried to cling to their creative freedom at some houses such as givenchy that led to a disruptive coming and going of designers other brands overhauled their offerings shifting away from clothing to higher margin accessories including handbags and wallets mr garavani stayed with his brand when in he sold his company to italian media and fashion group holding di partecipazioni industriali spa and again when it changed hands in becoming part of the marzotto textile and fashion group which already owned a majority stake in hugo boss working under contract mr garavani had to go along with marzottos plans for his brand the designer continued to attend red carpet events and dress stars such as nicole kidman and gwyneth paltrow but marzotto also roped him in to oversee new product lines such as the more affordable valentino r e d collection marzotto poured money into developing valentinos store network increasing the pressure for the company to offer a wide range of products beyond clothes in the boutiques still the brand has fallen behind rivals last year valentino reached a operating margin on sales of about &# million lagging behind many other french and italian luxury brands accessories were the motor for much of the growth with sales increasing from the previous year the exclusive haute couture collection which was at the heart of the business mr garavani founded only totaled around &# million in sales valentinos strong brand name and flagging finances have made it a natural prey for investors permira which partnered with italys mediobanca spa and citigroup inc to buy the stake from the marzotto family for about &# billion this week hasnt yet unveiled its plans for the valentino fashion group which also holds licenses for casual clothing lines such as marlboro classics permira owns fashion retailers new look in britain and spains cortefiel at valentino where accessories make up of sales compared with at gucci analysts expect the new investors to develop such underexploited product categories not the evening gowns for which mr garavani has become famous
