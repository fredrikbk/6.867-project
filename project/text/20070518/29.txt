excellent at her job or not she lied in regard to james m houses may letter on the firing of marilee jones as director of admissions at mit after she lied on her resume about her education "driven from job despite years of excellence" i find it ironic that a woman charged with determining the best candidates to attend a prestigious institution felt the need to lie on her application about her own qualifications unlike mr house i agree with mits decision lying about a material fact in a job application is a serious matter while ms joness performance was stellar a significant ethical breach in a field that requires the highest ethical standards is egregious and warrants termination years ago i had the unfortunate task of firing a talented manager who had lied about her education to our embarrassment the offense was discovered by a client who had requested a simple background check her lie had long reaching implications to our company the client relationship our reputation and her colleagues how can we even begin to judge college students for admission if we cannot stand before them and know that we have held ourselves to the highest standards as well its time we recognize that falsification exaggeration and embellishment are all shades of the same behavior telling a lie melissa carver sottile hartland conn mr house goes on to say and i paraphrase that if the person who lied has done good over the years there should be redemption and forgiveness that sounds all well and good but what about the people who were competing for the position many years ago and lost out to someone who lied what does mr house suggest we do to make them whole surely they have been adversely affected i believe the punishment here fits the crime eugene sullivan director office of telemedicine university of virginia charlottesville va
