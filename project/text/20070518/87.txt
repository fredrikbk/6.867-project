the numbers guy just how amazing is jacqueline gagne and her golf aces jacqueline gagne has had once in a lifetime experiences in less than four months since jan the year old from rancho mirage calif has hit holes in one or just eight fewer than were hit on the entire ladies professional golf association tour last year her local paper the desert sun of palm springs calif has corroborated ms gagnes feat running notes alongside articles from editors saying theyre just as skeptical as readers but everything has checked out the paper also asked a local statistician michael mcjilton of the college of the desert to compute the odds against the feat the result which headlined the article to and that was after just seven aces i asked mr mcjilton to repeat the computation after ms gagne hit three more in the following couple of weeks over a total of just rounds he returned the astronomical number of roughly septillion followed by zeroes to such an unlikely event should never happen its like winning the lottery four straight times no wonder david letterman came calling is there an explanation for ms gagne the numbers deserve scrutiny and her feat isnt as improbable as it seems though the odds against it are very steep probability may not explain it mr mcjilton who says that as the only statistician at a local college "i got the call" was using the desert suns assumption that it takes the typical amateur golfer rounds to hit a hole in one or par holes since there are typically four shorter holes per round and acing longer holes is so rare it can be ignored that estimate turns out to be pessimistic there are data on millions of attempts at holes in one from events awarding prizes for aces two insurance companies that specialize in writing coverage for these basically agree on the odds for the typical amateur once every shots on par s says mancil davis director of golf operations for national hole in one association in according to us hole in one the former more conservative estimates translates to roughly a hole in one every rounds that in turn leads to odds of sextillion to against about a reduction from mr mcjiltons septillion mr mcjilton also assumed that no two holes in one could come in the same round a safe assumption for most mortals but not for ms gagne of late though she hasnt yet doubled up allowing for magic striking twice in holes as david boyum co author of the book "what the numbers say " suggests reduces the odds against by a further still ms gagne persists in defying the numbers she has a seven handicap better than the typical amateur but the democratizing feature of a hole in one is that it isnt that much more common for tiger woods to ace than for an average duffer the average winner of a hole in one prize is a handicap says mr mancil pros hit holes in one about once every par s while the best amateurs ace one of every half as often lets say we apply the latter rate to ms gagne though mr mancil says shes not quite yet in that group wed still get odds of quintillion to against how about the holes she has aced eight of the are between yards and yards but shorter holes arent as easy as you might think both insurance companies say their rates rise by at most for shorter holes there are three possible qualitative explanations for the feat one that the feat didnt happen fits the principle of occams razor the simplest explanation tends to be best but ms gagnes story has checked out with witnesses in the desert suns investigations another is the notion of a hot hand popular among basketball fans but not among researchers they have found little evidence of streakiness as a factor in predicting whether the next shot will go in or how long any streak could last ms gagnes th ace caromed off a tree before sinking into the hole which makes it neither illegitimate nor explainable by a hot streak forty years ago mr davis had a hot streak three aces in a week five in a month and eight in a year he has career holes in one considered by some the world record he offers a third explanation he aims for the hole "maybe because i made several early in my career my brain focuses a lot better on the ultimate target " he says mr davis says doctors measured his brain activity at the tee for par s and found it similar to that of golfers staring at long putts he and some researchers also interviewed hundreds of texas golfers none of whom said they aim at the hole nor do most pros who instead set up the best birdie putt yet mr davis had an year drought before hitting his st last month at age it made news before ms gagne stole headlines ms gagne meanwhile says she just missed her th ace in four months by mere inches last week "the only thing i thought about was the hole in one " she told me "i didnt think of my surroundings it was the perfect shot " then reconsidering she adds "if it was the perfect shot it would have been a hole in one " email me at numbersguy wsj com read daily
