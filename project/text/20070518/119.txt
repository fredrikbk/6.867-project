weekend journal travel the telescope tourists stargazing fanatics go to ends of the earth the great refractor mauna kea hawaii two and a half miles above sea level david monahan inches forward in the dark popping open his cellphone to serve as an emergency flashlight nighttime temperatures have plunged below freezing snack food atop this dormant volcano consists of a bucket of dried squid for mr monahan and five fellow adventurers this is bliss they have slipped inside a dome at the w m keck observatory home to two of the worlds biggest optical telescopes while astronomers prepare to search the skies the newcomers shiver excitedly alongside celestial imaging equipment perched on a catwalk feet off the ground they look like stowaways on a space ship ordinarily security guards would dash into the dome and eject such intruders these visitors however have special privileges like mr monahan a hotel executive each has donated &# or more to the observatory entitling them to an up close glimpse of the frontiers of astronomy stargazing conjures up staid images of field trips to the local planetarium or puttering with a backyard telescope but a new breed of obsessed fans is crisscrossing the globe to visit legendary observatories destinations include remote deserts mountaintops even the south pole many of these travelers are engineering buffs people who love nothing more than to gawk at the one of a kind quirks of multimillion dollar machines even the smell of old telescopes lubricants a bit like crayons intrigues them others are astronomy pilgrims retracing great moments in scientific history some simply like pioneering their own form of extreme travel for observatories affluent tourists can become welcome new funding sources in hawaii the keck has collected more than &# million from private donors in the past few years to help pay for new instruments other sites regard steady visitor traffic as a good way to build up astronomys image particularly with school groups which may include future scientists some popular sites get more than visitors a year one of the most ardent telescope tourists on the circuit is year old louis berman who says he fell in love with stargazing as a boy his passions turned to theater lighting as a young man before more job changes led him to become chief technology officer at a new york based hedge fund about seven years ago mr berman rekindled his infatuation with astronomy now he plans to visit one major observatory a month until he has enough material to write a book which he plans to call "scope seeing " so far he has completed more than a dozen u s trips and is working on a european jaunt in august his wife isnt too thrilled about his new hobby he concedes but if she doesnt want to come along he travels alone "visiting observatories is like going to a scientific church " mr berman explains "theres something wonderful about seeing stars that are so far away that youre looking back in time by billions of years " the longtime king of telescope tourism is william keel an astronomy professor at the university of alabama his adventures started in the s right after graduate school during a research stint in holland he and his wife used their weekends to dash across europe exploring old observatories some dating back to the renaissance in bonn germany they saw the telescope that friedrich argelander used to compile the first major atlas of the stars in the mid th century "its almost mystical " prof keel says "youre in touch with this romantic legacy of the lone observer gazing into the sky " prof keel has since trekked to observatories ranging from chile to west virginia on his web page www astr ua edu keel telescopes he provides photos and chatty commentary about each stop including his visit to russias caucasus mountain range home of the enormous but poorly engineered bolshoi azimuthal telescope russian astronomers told him about a design quirk that made the bolshoi known as the cyclops of the caucasus so elongated that it couldnt withstand strong winds at one point astronomers there were forced to cover cracks in the telescopes mirror with black cloth in hopes of salvaging image quality amateurs are crisscrossing the world in search of stellar adventures too some of them belong to the antique telescope society which attracts engineers woodworkers and casual historians the ats meets at a different observatory each year this october the group will gather in greenville s c to see "the great refractor " a year old instrument that once belonged to princeton university and next year its off to holland to celebrate the th anniversary of the invention of the telescope for many members old fashioned craftsmanship is everything "these older telescopes are controlled by amazing clockworks " says peter abrahams an ats member in portland ore who builds computer workstations one of mr abrahamss favorites is at the yerkes observatory in williams bay wis completed in it was built in a gaudy victorian style with celestial and mythological figures rendered in ornate terra cotta inside and out one of the last big telescopes to be built with lenses rather than mirrors to focus light yerkes was used for important scientific work until the s academics hardly bother with it anymore making it easier for amateur stargazers to use the instrument at night another ats member walt breyer spent most of his career as a chemical engineer at scott paper co designing diapers and toilet seat covers retired now he says his growing interest in astronomy makes for better dinner table chatter among his favorite tales visiting birr castle in northern ireland home of a huge th century telescope and staying for dinner with lord rosse whose forebears built the observatory "there we were in sweatshirts and other casual clothes suitable to explore the telescope having dinner in the castle " mr breyer recalls "i wonder what lord rosse and his wife thought of the americans who came to dinner so casually dressed " modern facilities usually arent as obliging visitors galleries provide daytime glimpses of some equipment but doors are generally locked at night so that astronomers can work without distractions an extreme case in point is the south pole observatory funded by the national science foundation created in it hosts as many as visiting astronomers at a time scientists there study submillimeter radiation from stars which usually is obscured by water vapor in the earths atmosphere visibility improves at the south pole however thanks to the extremely cold dry air travelers who stop by for a quick tour might get a cup of coffee or a meal but thats all says d a harper a former director of the center for astrophysical research in antarctica where he oversaw the south pole outpost "space is very tight " prof harper explains "the rule is if they want to spend the night theyve got to bring their own tent " that frosty welcome plus the &# round trip cost of flying to the pole from the antarctic coast has kept unplanned tourist traffic down to guests or fewer most years prof harper says still a few teachers journalists and politicians who make the trip each year get friendlier treatment as part of the nsfs outreach efforts arlene sharp a chicago educator spent six days at the south pole observatory in with a middle school student she says she has been sharing her experiences with teachers and parents ever since in texas big bend region the mcdonald observatory offers tourists a pragmatic compromise nighttime access to its largest telescopes is highly restricted but for &# the observatory will throw a private "star party " letting guests spend hours gazing at planets nebulae and distant galaxies through three of its smaller scopes "being out there is elemental wild and simple " says mike halperin a seattle area doctor who took such a trip in april he was especially moved by up close views of saturns rings some of his friends on the trip were ex microsoft corp employees who had hoped to see one of their former colleagues charles simonyi orbiting the earth during his brief stint as an astronaut no luck mr simonyis spaceship was in too low an orbit to be visible but other spectacular attractions such as globular star clusters made up for it in hawaii about visitors a year come to a viewing station partway up the slopes of mauna kea where they can see the night stars through relatively small telescopes about make it to the foot summit usually for a daytime look at the keck and eight other major observatories operated by european japanese and north american universities as for getting inside the keck at night thats a rarer experience afforded only about major donors a year on such trips the observatorys development officer debbie goodwin cheerfully barges through doors marked "no visitors " her guests in tow a popular stop is the "mirror barn " where the observatory stores spare hexagonal tiles for the kecks two foot primary mirrors the inch thick tiles are polished to within one millionth of an inch of design specifications and cost more than &# apiece visitors cant touch them but no one stops people from cavorting in front of them watching their reflections as they giggle and make faces to some visitors surprise there arent any chances to see actual stars through the kecks main telescope images are captured digitally turned into columns of numbers and transmitted to astronomers at computer stations miles away that helps researchers do their work more efficiently but it creates a sightseeing experience that isnt much different than watching bond traders adjust their portfolios there are other stops on the tour that are crowd pleasers however one involves a thin orange laser beam thats shot into the sky helping the kecks telescope produce images so clear they rival those of the hubble space telescope the thin air atop mauna kea reduces the sort of atmospheric distortion that makes stars twinkle but doesnt eliminate it altogether fancy computer software can correct for this as long as astronomers are able to calibrate their adjustments on a precisely defined object in the heavens thus the laser its thin orange beam excites atoms in the upper atmosphere creating a disk shaped image thats miles away and just inches wide software analyzes that artificial "star" and makes adjustments until its image is as crisp as possible this tinkering known as adaptive optics greatly sharpens the images of celestial objects as the orange streak lights up the hawaiian sky one evening visitors inside the dome involuntarily lift up their arms and point to it they try to guess how far out it can be tracked a mile two miles before it disappears into the infinity of space among the most delighted spectators is clive davies the retired president of linear technologies inc a silicon valley chip company forty years earlier he was a graduate student in physics curious about all kinds of things but its been a long time since he has thought about lasers optics and the heavens now hes enjoying the chance to revisit that part of his life so much so that he has donated more than &# to the keck in the past few years "it keeps the gray cells active " mr davies says
