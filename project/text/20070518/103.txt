weekend journal review books autumn of the matriarch the last mrs astor a new york story by frances kiernan norton pages &# to most new yorkers the name roberta brooke russell doesnt mean anything neither does brooke kuser or for that matter brooke marshall for the soldiers daughter from portsmouth n h who was known by all three names the door to renown only opened with her last husband who gave her not only his storied surname but upon his death in a fortune it was on these wings that the estimable brooke astor soared from the late s to the late s she was everywhere in new york a doyenne of the new york social world and the grand dame of the citys philanthropists despite the relatively modest charitable fund that she had at hand the vincent astor foundation and mrs astors inheritance together amounted to &# million a lot of money in but small potatoes when compared with the foundations established by men like henry ford and john d rockefeller yet no one could magnify the effect of a dollar like mrs astor by dint of well timed grants and a well tempered personality she helped sustain new yorks most important cultural institutions through the citys darkest hours mrs astors remarkable and intermittently tragic life is the subject of frances kiernans "the last mrs astor " a gently revealing biography that does an especially good job of portraying mrs astor before she was well mrs astor it is amazing to be reminded brooke astor is living today in briarcliff n y that she was born more than a century ago in needless to say the expectations for young women then were different from today nobody seemed to think that she needed college so as a naive year old she was married off to dryden kuser the son of a wealthy new jersey businessman a violent and philandering drunk mr kuser depended on his bullying father for money and at one point broke his wifes jaw the union produced a son but husband and wife drifted apart until finally mr kuser asked for a divorce so that he could marry someone else brooke was delighted since she had been having an affair with a married stockbroker named charles "buddie" marshall during her life as a gay divorcee she lived in a new york apartment decorated by billy baldwin spent time with the likes of noel coward and brian aherne and like other rich parents of the time left her son largely to european nannies buddie marshall eventually left his family to marry brooke and together they led a storybook existence dining in paris with cole porter and receiving in london a gift from buddies mother of a small blue rolls royce "all in all " ms kiernan writes perceptively "it was a glorious life hard to make vivid in retrospect if only because great contentment like great charm remains hard to capture on the page " mr marshalls sudden death in after years of marriage left his widow heart stricken and given her lavish lifestyle poor since his money went mostly to his earlier family "suddenly brooke russell marshall found herself in the awkward position of being fifty years old and looking forward to living on a fixed income of about &# a year " writes ms kiernan that is a mere &# in todays money the governments food stamp program was still some years away so mrs marshall was more than open to the possibility of marrying vincent astor a boring and unpleasant tycoon who was shopping for a new spouse the incumbent mrs astor hoping for a smooth and presumably remunerative divorce appears to have been an eager partner in this shopping project mr astors first choice was glamorous janet rhinelander stewart who turned vincent down flat according to legend he assured her that his doctors had given him only three years to live to which she replied "but vincent what if the doctors are wrong " brooke marshall was offered the same terms &# million outright and &# million if she lasted a year it seemed like a bargain "of course she married vincent for the money " mr kiernan reports louis auchincloss a friend of brookes saying "i wouldnt respect her if she hadnt only a twisted person would have married him for love " as it turned out vincent astor lasted six years his letters make clear that he genuinely loved his vivacious new wife and when he died he left virtually his entire fortune in brookes care she got half his estate and control of the other half in the form of his

within limits mrs astor recently celebrated her th birthday surrounded by admirers in her own beloved home but reportedly afflicted by dementia as a longtime friend explained to ms kiernan "for all the charm and froth she was perfectly aware that at the end of the day you cry alone " mr akst is writing a book on self control
