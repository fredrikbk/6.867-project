weekend journal review theater tough nut sweet meat troilus and cressida chicago shakespeare theater courtyard theater navy pier chicago &# &#  closes june arcadia court theatre s ellis chicago &# &#  extended through june hope springs infernal house theatre of chicago the viaduct n western chicago &# &# closes june chicago shakespeare never wrote a tougher play than "troilus and cressida " is it a comedy or a tragedy or both it all depends on how you direct it when barbara gaines the founder and artistic director of chicago shakespeare theater first produced this knotty tale of love and death in the trojan war she emphasized the romance now shes wrapping up her companys th anniversary season with an opulently violent "troilus" staged with breathtaking speed and concentration and climaxing in the best battle scene ive ever seen on a stage this is a wartime "troilus" with a hard political edge the main set piece is a blood soaked obelisk reminiscent of the washington monument but ms gaines has taken care not to wear her opinions on her sleeve instead she lets shakespeare do the talking "and appetite an universal wolf so doubly seconded with will and power must make perforce an universal prey and last eat up himself " youre more than welcome to draw parallels with the war in iraq if you wish but its no less acceptable to approach ms gainess "troilus" as a broader parable of mans monstrosity to man thats where the battle scene comes in imagine a dark empty space filled with mist and lit from below with lurid shafts of light that slice through the fog of war to show us pairs of desperate men locked in mortal combat you can almost smell the blood and the fear like all of ms gainess shakespeare productions this one is a collective triumph of casting design and direction and i can do no more than single out a few of the people who are most obviously responsible for its excellence chaon cross a chicago based actress whose name is new to me is an exceptional cressida at once handsome and arrestingly well spoken a combination that helps make her credible both as the love of troilus kevin odonnell and later as his betrayer michael philippis set is simple and strong while robert wierzels high contrast lighting and george stiless evocative incidental music contribute greatly to the total effect of the production i see a lot of shakespeare both in new york and across the country and the more i see the more impressed i am by chicago shakespeare theater its productions are smart yet accessible personal yet universal and above all consummately theatrical i cant think of a shakespeare troupe in america with a higher batting average and this production of "troilus and cressida" will surely be remembered as one of its signal achievements the phenomenal success of lincoln center theaters production of tom stoppards "the coast of utopia" has made regional theater directors stoppard conscious i plan to spend the next couple of months reporting on a string of american revivals of his plays and im happy to say that the first show on my list the court theatres blithe and incisive mounting of "arcadia " is an extraordinarily fine piece of work in theory "arcadia " a highbrow whodunit whose plot charges back and forth between and the present ought to be as hard to unravel as "troilus and cressida " on stage it plays like a high speed boulevard comedy heavily salted with wicked punchlines yet for all its fizzing fun "arcadia" is also a deeply serious meditation on what it means to live in the shadow of modernity and the climactic scene in which a fey child prodigy bethany caputo and her tutor grant goodman reflect on mans fate is haunting and hopeful "when we have found all the mysteries and lost all the meaning we will be alone on an empty shore " "then we will dance is this a waltz " charles newell the courts artistic director has put together a perfect cast everyone in it is unimprovably right whose members play their parts with terrific style and dash to watch them sail through stoppards deliriously complex script is like standing in the middle of a fireworks display no sooner was it done than i wanted to watch the whole thing over again if youve never been fortunate enough to see any of tom stoppards plays this would be a wonderful place to start in addition to well established companies like chicago shakespeare and the court the windy city has no shortage of small troupes whose productions are comparable in quality to the best that off off broadway has to offer i sang the praises of remy bumppo theater company in this space last september and this time around a theater savvy local steered me to the house theatre of chicago a gaggle of twentysomethings who put on shows in a converted garage across the street from a north side viaduct the lobby contains a bar and a pool table you cant get much farther off the beaten path than that but ben lobpriess "hope springs infernal" is more than worth the extra mileage mr lobpries has reworked the greek myth of deucalion jamie abelson and pyrrha erin damron survivors of the great flood sent by zeus to destroy the human race into a frisky romp played out on a set consisting of several miles of wrinkled plastic sheeting the actors are alarmingly young the sound effects astonishingly loud and the results amazingly pleasurable mr teachout
