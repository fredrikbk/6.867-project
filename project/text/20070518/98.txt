unicredit rides wave of deals pursuit of italian bank reflects rapid changes in european sector two years ago unicredit spa barely figured in rankings of europes top banks now the italian lender is poised to make an offer for rival capitalia spa in a move that would create europes second largest bank and a formidable competitor to u s financial giants unicredits mushroom like growth from local italian bank to global player is part of the rapid consolidation of europes banking sector until recently cross border banking deals were rare in europe and many lenders were insulated from takeovers by cozy shareholder arrangements and government regulators who wanted to preserve the national character of their financial institutions but the protections are now melting setting off a flurry of deal making earlier this week unicredit and capitalia ended months of speculation by announcing their merger talks the boards are expected to meet as early as sunday to discuss the details of the potential all stock offer according to people familiar with the situation the market value of the combined bank would exceed billion euros &# billion second in europe only to hsbc holdings plc and fifth largest in the world "consolidation has only just begun and from now on it will only accelerate " says davide pasquali chairman of swiss fund pharus sicav which holds unicredit shares after shareholders pressed for a change in strategy abn amro holding nv of the netherlands is trying to seal a deal with barclays plc of britain as it fends off a hostile offer from a consortium led by royal bank of scotland plc in unicredit completed the largest cross border banking deal in europe when it took over germanys hvb group ag that put pressure on its italian competitors banca intesa spa and sanpaolo imi spa italys no and no lenders respectively merged to form intesa sanpaolo spa one of six separate banking tie ups in italy last year including the purchases of banca nazionale del lavoro spa by frances bnp paribas sa and of banca antonveneta spa by abn amro this year four banking deals in italy have been announced capitalia was cobbled together from several smaller italian banks including banca di roma and banco di sicilia and inherited a tremendous nonperforming loan burden the current management has worked hard to overcome that and to overhaul inefficient retail operations though much remains to be done investors say unicredit chief executive alessandro profumo has already shown his ability to pull off difficult deals unicredit "succeeded in achieving most of the hvb merger targets ahead of schedule and delivered strong results " says niccolo pini a fund manager at florence based banca ifigest which owns unicredit shares he says being able to integrate new banks into an existing network is crucial to staying competitive "big mergers are necessary to compete at an international level " he says even some of the europe banking sectors top players are surprised at the pace of its evolution "the situation has changed completely " said francisco gonzalez the chairman of banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria in an interview earlier this week in paris mr gonzalez said bbva isnt currently looking for acquisitions but is focusing on internal growth and a technological upgrade mr gonzalez said political barriers to cross border moves are starting to dissolve in part as a reaction to recent scandals involving banking regulators in italys central banker antonio fazio resigned after he was implicated by prosecutors in an unsuccessful plan to block foreign bids for two banks "i think the banking system in europe is ready for transactions that are wanted by shareholders and this tide cannot be stopped " mr gonzalez said "the shareholders are the kings of the game " politics still has a role however unicredits ceo mr profumo pursued a deal with capitalia seriously only after informal talks about a tie up with frances societe generale sa were put on hold partly because the french political establishment feared one of the countrys top banks would wind up in italian hands conversely unicredit has strong political backing in italy for a deal with capitalia since he took office a year ago prime minister romano prodi has been eager for italian banks to bulk up lest they be easy prey for foreign rivals he was quick to bless the creation of intesa sanpaolo and last week said he favored of a unicredit capitalia deal a stable of large national banks is also crucial in preventing foreign takeovers in other industries last month intesa sanpaolo was among the companies that bought a controlling stake in telecom italia spa and kept italys former telephone monopoly from foreign control a deal with capitalia would reverse mr profumos previous strategy of trying to plow into new markets and reduce exposure to italy together with capitalia unicredit would control about of the italian market second to intesa sanpaolos and would be the largest shareholder in italys most powerful investment bank mediobanca spa giving it tremendous pull over italys largest insurer assicurazioni generali spa in which mediobanca has a stake
