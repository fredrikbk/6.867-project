next co worry less absorption oceans diminished power to sop up gas may result in more of it in atmosphere the ability of the worlds southern oceans to absorb carbon dioxide isnt keeping pace with the rate of emissions due to human activity which means that future concentrations of the gas in the atmosphere may be higher than what current projections suggest a new study finds oceans plants and soil are the planets main carbon sinks absorbing about half of all carbon dioxide emitted by industry cars and other human sources the southern atlantic pacific and indian oceans take up about of the total absorbed carbon dioxide or co the study published on the web site of the journal science says that the southern oceans absorbing capacity significantly weakened between and over that period "the southern oceans became about less efficient at absorbing carbon dioxide " said corinne le quere lead author of the study and an oceanographer at the university of east anglia england dr le quere suggests that over the next years the oceans capacity to absorb carbon dioxide will continue to decline thereby increasing atmospheric levels of the gas over several centuries carbon dioxide is a contributor to global warming the earths carbon cycle is ruled by a complex interplay of ocean land and atmosphere as climate change becomes a more urgent issue for policy makers scientists are making a big push to assess how much of human emitted carbon dioxide can be absorbed by nature and to what extent technological or policy efforts might be needed to reduce atmospheric levels of the gas for example one idea is to seed the oceans with iron in order to promote blooms of marine plants thereby transferring more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the deep oceans dr le quere and a far flung team of scientific collaborators from the u s germany new zealand south africa france and japan based their conclusions on observed data collected from stations in the southern oceans and other stations across the globe previous research showed that the southern oceans have become a less efficient absorber because of an increase in "windiness" that began in the late s the two believed causes were the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming both linked to human activity which triggered temperature changes and which in turn led to more winds on the planets surface the authors of the latest paper found that more wind causes more mixing of the water of the southern oceans which brings up carbon dioxide rich water from the depths to the surface because this water is already loaded with the gas it is less efficient at absorbing additional carbon dioxide since over the next years or so the ozone layer isnt likely to recover significantly and the global warming trend is expected to continue "the winds will probably continue to increase and the effect will go on " said dr le quere the study has limitations "the idea that youd get this effect makes sense " said ken buesseler senior scientist at woods hole oceanographic institution in woods hole mass who is familiar with dr le queres past research but hadnt reviewed her latest paper however he cautioned to make the conclusions more robust "id like to see a longer term record of the mixing" that moves the carbon at various depths of the southern oceans dr buesselers own work shows how complicated such mechanisms can be a study led by him and published in late april in science found that carbon dioxide taken up by marine organisms on the oceans surface doesnt necessarily sink to the depths of the oceans from where it can no longer re enter the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas instead the scientists found that the sinking carbon is often consumed by animals and bacteria in the upper reaches of the oceans and so never reaches the depths
