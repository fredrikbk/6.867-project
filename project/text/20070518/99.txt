volatility becomes symptom of doctors meetings data previews may give rise to insider trades sharp moves in imclone and other drug firms there are few certainties in the stock market but this appears to be one of them before a big meeting of doctors a handful of pharmaceutical stocks move in mysterious ways with an annual gathering of cancer specialists coming june the action already has begun shares of imclone systems have tumbled more than since tuesday on heavy volume after embargoed data from an important cancer trial was released to physicians expected to attend the conference of one of the largest oncology groups the american society of clinical oncology or asco shares of regeneron pharmaceuticals have fallen almost since and genentech is down while onyx pharmaceuticals is up almost as investors pass around abstracts or summaries of data to be released as part of the asco meeting even though regulators have clamped down recently on companies relaying market moving information to select investors it isnt the first time that stocks have moved sharply ahead of the key event amid the growing hunger of investors to get an information edge on volatile stocks such as biotechnology companies "oncology stocks consistently have shown unexplained volatility around the time asco releases data on embargo to its members " says steven harr an analyst at morgan stanley in fact a number of analysts and investors have urged asco officials to stop sending the summaries to doctors before the conference or make them available to everyone in order to give investors an equal opportunity "we have pointed out the volatility to asco in multiple communications over the past several years " says dr harr who also is a physician he was among a group of analysts and institutional investors who approached asco two years ago to complain about the volatility in certain stocks after the abstracts were released but the oncology group says that while it has tweaked the way it shares the data ahead of the meeting it doesnt have plans to stop releasing the summaries beforehand officials say they have tried waiting until the conference to release the data but its members were inconvenienced noting that asco serves its members doctors and cancer patients not wall street officials say the abstracts which can be submitted as much as six months in advance of the meeting only go to asco members and that they come in a shrink wrap package that has written instructions that the recipient cant "publish the information or provide it to others or use it for trading purposes " says kristin ludwig senior director of communications and patient information for asco "weve worked very hard to communicate the policies to members " ms ludwig says she says asco will review its policies after the meeting the strategy doesnt seem to be working the summaries were sent out last week and a broad range of investors say they got their hands on the abstracts this week some say they have made trades based on the asco information because they received the data from third parties and therefore were under no obligation to abide by the embargo increasingly hedge funds and other investment firms hire doctors as analysts or consultants making it easier to get their hands on the abstracts doctors who trade on the information could be in violation of insider trading laws say securities experts if they tell another investor about the data it gets murkier but it could be problematic if the doctor knows that the recipient will trade on the information some analysts even have made changes to their estimates based on the talk about the abstracts michael king an analyst at rodman &amp renshaw in new york lowered his profit estimates for imclone this week because "the specificity of the market chatter gives us caution" about the results of imclones study of its erbitux cancer drug a spokesman for mr king wouldnt comment "we understand the abstract books have been released and theres no other news in the marketplace so our conclusion is the marketplace thinks it knows something about the abstracts " dr harr says regenerons stock tumbled amid speculation that data to be released at ascos meeting on an ovarian cancer drug might not be as good as hoped genentechs share price declined ahead of a study on how a low dose of its key cancer drug compares with a higher dose and on how the imclone data will affect the company onyx is up on favorable speculation centered about its liver cancer drug representatives for imclone regeneron genentech and onyx declined to comment or didnt return calls some investors say it is really up to asco to prevent rumors from rocking the shares "im disgusted by the fact that asco has continued this policy of releasing the abstract to thousands of members weeks ahead of the conference " says jay markowitz who helps pick biotech stocks for t rowe price in baltimore "i want to make sure there is a level playing field and people arent trading in a way that disadvantages the rest of the market "
