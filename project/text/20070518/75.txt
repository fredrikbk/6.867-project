politics &amp economics why tensions with russia endure moscows vigor yields conflict with west despite diplomatic overtures as european union and russian leaders meet for a difficult summit two fundamental changes ensure that relations with the west will stay tense for some time moscows new assertiveness inspired by an economic boom and its deepening conviction that old enemies are trying to contain russias revival relations between moscow and the u s as well as the eu are at their worst since the fall of the soviet union in u s secretary of state condoleezza rice visited moscow on tuesday to cool tensions ahead of a meeting of presidents next month russian officials promised to heed her call to tone down searing rhetoric of recent months that included cold war style threats by generals to retarget missiles toward europe but both sides also refused to budge on key disputes from the placement of a u s missile defense shield in europe to proposals at the united nations to make the serbian province of kosovo independent that pattern is likely to be repeated at the eu russia summit which began last night outside samara miles southeast of moscow with an informal dinner hosted by russian president vladimir putin with disputes mounting and the summits showpiece agreements shelved some eu nations argued earlier this week for canceling the meeting altogether the sense that washington and its allies are trying to contain a resurgent russia underlies moscows bitterness toward the west in recent months the theme has been taken up by russias state controlled media with relish as part of a kremlin drive to harness nationalism as a tool to consolidate support for the ruling elite ahead of december parliamentary elections "there is a concerted effort to build identity " says sergei karaganov director of the council for foreign and defense policy a government advisory group that includes senior kremlin officials "the russian economy is booming " mr karaganov says describing a view held widely in moscow "our military is the second most powerful force in the world after americas we are a player in the larger middle east and china is wooing russia like mad the wind is blowing in russias sails " the kremlins identity forging campaign moved forward thursday when the russian orthodox church formally ended a rift with an offshoot set up abroad in the early days of the soviet union the reconciliation was a longtime goal of president vladimir putin who called it "an important precondition for the restoration of the lost unity of the russian world " russians increasingly perceive their nation as distinct from europe according to opinion polls more than half of respondents in a february survey by the eu russia center said they viewed the eu as a potential threat to russia while said they didnt regard themselves as europeans in the u s and europe moscows assertiveness is viewed with growing concern particularly because it has been accompanied by a steady rollback of democratic institutions inside russia and growing use of economic leverage and other means to pressure its neighbors the kremlins differences with washington were spelled out in a speech mr putin delivered in munich in february in which he lashed out at americas behavior as "pernicious" and flatly rejected u s plans to base a missile defense system in eastern europe in a speech may he seemed to some western ears to compare washingtons foreign policy to that of the third reich though the kremlin later assured ms rice that mr putin was referring to international terrorists not the u s moscows pledge to dial back the rhetorical attacks is likely to be tested in the coming months as the u s continues to pave the way for installing a missile defense system in eastern europe moscow sees it as a military threat ms rice also said washington will continue to support u n plans to grant independence to the separatist serbian province of kosovo plans that moscow vehemently opposes parliamentary elections in russia in december could become another flashpoint ms rice expressed hope that the kremlin would ease its grip on the media and relax pressure on political opponents before the vote a test on that issue will come when opposition activists hold a demonstration near the site of the eu russia summit in samara german officials called on moscow to allow the protest but while local authorities have granted a permit several organizers have been detained by police the eu has been deeply divided over how to handle moscow in recent years with germany and other "old" eu members irritated by what they see as the anti russia prejudice of poland and the baltic states the eus new east european members say the eu is too soft on russia and is allowing moscow to split the bloc by punishing some member countries while courting others poland and lithuania are blocking the start of negotiations at the summit on a new framework agreement governing trade and other relations between the eu and russia eu officials also had hoped the summit would include the signing of an agreement on siberian overflight fees that cost european airlines more than million euros or more than &# million last year that looks unlikely too because russia isnt ready moscow has so far succeeded in playing the divisions in the eu to its advantage seeking deals with individual member states eager to secure energy supplies but the sheer number of russian disputes with its neighbors has begun to harden attitudes toward moscow "nobody wants a conflict with russia but a time is coming when these big countries are starting to understand that we are in the same boat " said marek siwiec vice president of the european parliament
