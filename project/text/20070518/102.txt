maya angelou and norman mailer random house knows how to make a best seller later this year the legendary publisher will find out whether it also has what it takes to help create a hollywood hit this fall general electric co s focus features will release "reservation road " a movie based on the novel of the same name by john burnham schwartz published in by random houses alfred a knopf imprint the

or three such films each year culled from random houses backlist of titles the partners will share production costs hoping to recoup their investments by selling foreign distribution rights and bringing in other investors in exchange for its investment random house has a voice in picking screenwriters directors and actors random house says its move into the film business isnt mainly about increasing profits via movie tickets and dvds rather its about selling books "were doing this primarily to sell more books as movie tie ins " says peter olson ceo of bertelsmann ags random house global publishing arm "if the movies do well at the box office and as dvds thats an additional bonus " at a time when book publishers are worried about their abilities to lure readers and bolster sales movie tie ins are particularly valuable anne messitte publisher of vintage books one of bertelsmanns paperback imprints says sales of patrick suskinds "perfume the story of a murderer" jumped to more than copies sold from copies annually after the movie of the same name was released in and antonia frasers biography of marie antoinette which had been selling fewer than copies annually has sold more than copies following last years release of "marie antoinette " directed by sofia coppola "you can see why tie ins matter " says ms messitte vintage publishes the paperback edition of "reservation road " the movie version with a production budget of about &# million was directed by terry george the director of "hotel rwanda " now complete its expected to be released this november paperback editions of the book now in stores carry gold stickers on the cover that read "first read the book then see the movie " the novel has sold hardcover copies and about the same number in paperback vintage hopes the movie will spur sales of several hundred thousand more paperbacks including a new pre movie edition whose cover will feature art from the film "the vintage people and the focus features people were engaged at an early level about promoting the tie in " says mr schwartz who also wrote the original screenplay the dark story revolves around a fatal hit and run accident mr schwartz is betting that movie will also give a boost to his next novel "the commoner " being published in january by bertelsmanns nan a talese doubleday imprint "my hope is that it will catch some of the wind from the movie promotion " he says the project has plunged publishing executives into unusual roles "one of the oddest things that happened to me was looking at a dvd of joaquin phoenix mark ruffalo jennifer connelly and mira sorvino in order to approve their clothes and hairstyles " says peter gethers president of random house films referring to the films primary actors mr gethers whose thriller "hades " was recently published by lagardere scas mysterious press under his pseudonym russell andrews does have a long involvement with the movie business having collaborated on several screenplays with roman polanski other projects that random house and focus features have in various stages of development include ross macdonalds "the galton case" yasmina khadras "the attack" dean koontzs "the husband" and the coming nonfiction book "curveball spies lies and the man behind them how america went to war in iraq " a look at the intelligence buildup to the iraq war by bob drogin a prize winning correspondent for the los angeles times though agents reserve film rights when they sell the publishing rights for books to publishers and some film rights to random house books are sold elsewhere and will continue to be james schamus focuss ceo says the pact provides "access to more or less the largest ongoing accumulated reservoir of interesting works in print in english " the deal also gives focus features an early look at some upcoming random house projects "we have several hundred editors world wide who see manuscripts earlier than anyone but agents " says mr gethers of random house films those works however cant be shown to focus features without the cooperation of the books authors and agents "the projects of interest to the joint venture arent budget busters but more likely character and narrative driven story telling " says stuart applebaum a random house spokesman mr applebaum noted that random house films then has to purchase those rights from the authors representatives this paid off when the partners were able to sign up "the husband" before mr koontz had finished the book the thriller which revolves around a kidnapping was published in may by bertelsmanns bantam imprint and hit no on the wall street journals list mr koontz has had many titles turned into movies but hasnt been pleased with the results "in my conversations with peter gethers and james schamus i had the sense that they werent giving me the its the best thing ive ever seen baby treatment " he says mr koontz had an active role in picking the screenwriter mr gethers read through more than screenplays and then sent him the work of about a dozen writers to look at "much to my surprise i thought that all were good " he says ultimately they chose glenn gers a veteran screenplay writer to write the script of course since this involves hollywood messrs gethers and schamus have already suffered their share of disappointments for example they wanted to buy kaui hart hemmingss novel about a family in hawaii "the descendants " published this month by the random house imprint instead the partners lost out to another film company "we wont get everything " says mr gethers "weve been outbid on a couple of things and in a couple of cases agents showed the manuscripts first to other people thats life but it shows that everybody is getting a fair deal " the biggest surprise so far mr gethers says he was taken aback by a request to provide an animated logo "focus called us after a few months and said what are you doing about your logo i hung up and said what does that mean " the company now has an animated logo for random house films as well as a print variation of the classic random house logo with filmstrips on either side
