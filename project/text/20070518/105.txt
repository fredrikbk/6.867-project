weekend journal review television the th homer in the th episode of "the simpsons" sunday to p m edt on fox marges older sisters selma and patty make a brief appearance as do a host of other "simpsons" characters the magnificently hostile crones now live we see in a deadly looking set of high rise towers the spinster city apartments the sight of which sets off in a viewers mind a chain of questions just where in springfield would this housing project be and how did the sisters get here bizarre queries no doubt given that "the simpsons" is a fictional enterprise whose animators can and do throw anything they please into springfield including the huge python who shows up sunday this creature soon reduced to hopeless reptilian neediness is barts replacement pet for his dog santa temporarily deranged bizarre or not the afore described queries are natural enough the inevitable result of "simpsons" watching and years of immersion in the life of springfield its remarkable how much weve come to know about this burg and its citizens its teachers school principal police chief doctor not to mention dentists a profession that has had over the years a considerable presence in the series all of it chilling who can forget lisas visit back in the s to the practitioner who told her she needed braces to persuade her of the fate that awaited her if she didnt get them the dentist pulled out a volume titled "the big book of british smiles" an album of familiar english faces in caricature in this nightmarish collection a jibe at the alleged notorious state of dental health among the british a grinning prince charles sports monstrous teeth in sundays episode were back at the dentist again but this time its the occasion for more contemporary concerns like rappers in particular the rap stars gingivitis and periodontitis who cant succeed in fooling one member of the simpsons family at least as the ever canny lisa points out these rapsters are just glamorizing tooth decay "simpsons" episode which follows the regular "simpsons" program shown from to p m is a fittingly grand jumble of events during his forced visit to the dentist a family affair bart manages to treat principal seymour skinner who is trapped in an examination chair to his own special form of dentistry homer lucks out by buying the one millionth ice cream cone sold in a store the beginning of a chain of events that leads to disaster for kent brockman springfields channel anchorman kent a deeply solemn character bearing a wicked resemblance to ted koppel has run afoul of profanity laws and network sensitivity one of those political themes with plenty of contemporary resonance that regularly inspire the shows writers that these political thrusts tend to be glancing and exude a spirit of fun as opposed to sermonizing counts as one of the series enduring strengths as does the writers reliable ear for all the latest in hot cliches theres no fun in the fate that has befallen brockman who somehow allowed to let slip on air the worst of forbidden words obvious candidates come to mind but were never told which its a word so vile marge breathlessly declares that it could only be uttered by satan sitting on a toilet seat a political free for all ensues on the subject of censorship and still more delicate themes like the pro choice pro life issue swept up by all he hears on the news a little poke here at fox news homer sounds off about the outrages perpetrated by liberals including the pro choice militants hes especially outraged to learn that these liberals are even planning he says to abort space missions before looking at the th episode i looked at closet shelves that held who knows how many old "simpsons" tapes and picked one at random on it was a label with one word scrawled in large letters "wonderful " no help here trying to pick a tape each carried the same kind of label i decided on the one id picked up first a rich romantic episode about marges birthday which homer has forgotten prodded into action homer runs out to get a gift while marge and family gather to celebrate at a local restaurant named the singing sirloin home of ballads and salads here groups eat and wander about singing one little bunch doing "the anniversary waltz" another more pensive belting out "nearer my god to thee " all this was packed into a brief few minutes evidence of the kinds of brush strokes and inventiveness that have distinguished "the simpsons" from its beginnings in those few minutes too marges sisters selma and patty deliver vicious commentary on homer who they note never buys any birthday gift for marge that isnt something he wants for himself there was that tackle box he got her for example at dinner homer begins at once wolfing down his steak an accident waiting to happen selma mutters know the heimlich maneuver patty asks selma no is the answer "good " homer in due course proudly presents his birthday present a bowling ball to a furious marge who reminds him that she never bowled or had any interest in the sport off she goes next in defiance to a bowling alley to learn the game where she meets the french seducer and bowling instructor jacques who will sweep her off her feet into a romantic escapade "there are pins in my heart " the silky jacques tells her "and youve knocked down eight " it all ends safely enough with marge restored to homer and the children but not before shes experienced high romance with glorious cole porter music in the background when "the simpsons" does music it is always for real and full throated the most perfect exemplar an episode not to be missed by any "simpsons" admirer is that great cultural event that once took place in springfield the musical version of "a streetcar named desire " there is no point trying to figure out how good the series still is the simpsons have been with us too long a family likely to live in our hearts longer than the sopranos possibly because none of them are going to get whacked because bart and homer and marge and lisa are always who theyve been because the sun never sets on springfield and its people wonderful indeed
