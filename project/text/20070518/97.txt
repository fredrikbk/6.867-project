treasury targets financial fixes paulson sets study on rise in corporate restatements and the impact on markets washington treasury secretary henry paulson concerned that the number of corporate financial restatements has "soared" in the past decade has ordered a study into the cause of the increase and its impact on investors and the u s capital markets mr paulson said restatements impose significant costs on capital markets and can confuse investors and erode public confidence in financial reporting "when you have or so restatements in the course of a year this is confusing to investors and tells us that the system isnt working the way it needs to be " he said the focus is part of a broader move aimed at reducing legal and regulatory burdens that mr paulson backed by a chorus of business executives says are making the u s a harder place in which to do business while more steps are expected in the coming months for now the treasury seems focused on finding ways to ease financial reporting requirements largely by relaxing rules that apply to the accountants who audit those financial reports as part of that effort mr paulson wants a separate review of the accounting industry by a special advisory committee that would recommend changes such as limiting the liability of public accountants and reducing the concentration of auditors in the hands of a few big firms treasury officials and corporations are concerned that accounting firms shoulder too much risk and in turn take an aggressive approach to the companies they audit that can lead to financial restatements and make companies wary of taking risks for fear of running afoul of auditors said mike ryan executive director of the u s chamber of commerces center on capital market competitiveness "the reason auditors are taking a rigid approach is because they are themselves exposed to very significant litigation until that is addressed auditors are going to be playing defense " mr ryan said the treasurys committee which is expected to make recommendations by year end will be headed by former securities and exchange commission chairman arthur levitt and donald nicolaisen a former sec chief accountant meanwhile the sec in a move supported by mr paulson is already engaged in a process to pare back the most debated sarbanes oxley corporate governance rule which requires that companies have strong internal controls over their financial reporting the rule has drawn fire from businesses which say auditors are too strict in how they enforce the rule and require them to document things not connected with preventing fraud or mistakes robert steel the treasurys undersecretary for domestic finance said the moves are all aimed at improving financial reporting so that investors get the most useful information possible in a speech before the council on competitiveness here he said the u s needs to take "a new approach" to regulation and structure its rules so that regulators weigh costs and benefits and focus on issues that are material to investors investor advocates say the efforts seem aimed more at weakening the financial reporting system while the treasury said the number of restatements reached in up from in accounting experts say that is largely a result of tougher accounting oversight that has helped uncover weaknesses and problems investors are entitled to know about lynn turner managing director of accounting research firm glass lewis who has studied corporate restatements said many of the restatements didnt stem from minor problems or small errors instead he said the rise is a result of companies being forced post enron to examine their financial reporting and correct deficiencies "what weve gone through here is a period of some pretty significant findings of things that need to be fixed and thats whats really driving the restatements " said mr turner who is also a former sec chief accountant with others he worries washington is on the cusp of pushing corporate accountability back to pre enron days "we have this history of doing things and when things start looking good we have very short memories and then we pull back and then along comes the next implosion " he said
