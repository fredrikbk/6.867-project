politics &amp economics estonia gauges best response to cyber attack a cyber attack on the baltic country of estonia will likely shape a debate inside many governments over how such attacks should be considered in the context of international law and what sort of response is appropriate the estonian government compares the episode which it has blamed on russia to an act of war the kremlin has denied any russian government involvement since the end of april the unprecedented cyber attack has crippled web sites operated by estonian government ministries banks media outlets and other companies the "denial of service" attacks swamp web sites with so many hits they are forced to shut down the attack comes as the u s and other governments are mulling how to respond to cyber attacks "there is a discussion over how cyber aggression should fit into current law and whether a conventional attack would be suitable retaliation " said johannes ullrich chief technology officer at the sans institute a bethesda md internet security company that tracks threats to the internet in meetings this week estonia brought the attack before the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union nato has dispatched a cyber crime expert to estonia the estonian government said it traced much of the traffic that inundated its web sites to russian computers the government also said it found on the internet instructions in russian on how to carry out the action the estonian foreign minister initially accused the kremlin of orchestrating the attack lately the government has softened that position alleging the attacks came from russia but that it has no evidence implicating the kremlin "if a bank or an airport is hit by a missile it is easy to say that is an act of war " said madis mikko a spokesman for the estonian defense ministry "but if the same result is caused by a cyber attack what do you call that " the attack began on april shortly after estonia removed a soviet statue from downtown talinn that commemorated red army soldiers killed by the nazis in world war ii the incident inflamed relations between the two countries in moscow pro kremlin youth groups blockaded the estonian embassy and harassed the estonian ambassador estonia with a population of million was formerly a part of the old soviet union in the early days of the attack government web sites that normally receive around visits a day were receiving visits every second according to mr mikko the onslaught shut down some web sites for half an hour others for several hours or more according to government officials "they tried to cut us off from the rest of the world " mr mikko said estonia is particularly vulnerable to such an attack because of its heavy use of the internet over two thirds of the countrys population has access to broadband more than of the countrys tax returns are filed online and most estonians pay their bills via the internet "this is a threat to the security of our country " said sten hansson the information technology adviser to the estonian prime minister he added that while servers within the country have been able to restore usage for most of the sites there are still delays particularly for users outside the country trying to access estonian sites russian entities have gained a reputation in recent years for similar attacks using what are called "botnets " they consist of a group of computers simultaneously controlled sometimes thousands at once by an unauthorized user who illicitly takes them over without the knowledge of the computer owner the infected computers are then directed to deluge the target with traffic "russia has a fairly long track record for this kind of activity " said joe stewart a security researcher with secureworks inc an atlanta internet security company mr stewarts own web site was knocked offline for several days in january after he blogged about the schemes mr stewart and other experts recalled that chinese hackers have gone after u s web sites in the past and the vatican web site has come under attack but the estonian case is rare for the scope and length of the siege
