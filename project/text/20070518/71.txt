pyongyangs perfidy over a month has passed since sweetness and light were due to break out on the korean peninsula on feb the six party talks in beijing ratified a bilateral agreement between the u s and north korea providing for pyongyang to give up its nuclear programs the first step days after ratification was to be that north korea "will shut down and seal for the purpose of eventual abandonment" the yongbyon nuclear facility and readmit inspectors from the international atomic energy agency iaea other steps were to follow but the first move was unequivocally to be made by pyongyang the days came and went and indeed another days have come and gone no iaea inspectors have been readmitted and not even pyongyang claims that it has "shut down" yongbyon instead observers especially iran and other nuclear weapons aspirants have witnessed embarrassing u s weakness on a supposedly unrelated issue unmentioned in the feb agreement that issue involves north koreas widely publicized demand that approximately &# million frozen in macau based banco delta asia bda accounts be released and transferred to pyongyang the funds came from north korean counterfeiting of u s currency money laundering and other fraudulent activities uncovered by a u s treasury investigation begun in the accounts were frozen in and the bda was promptly put on treasurys blacklist for illicit activity while the bush administration denies a direct link the north koreans have said publicly that they will not comply with the bilateral agreement until the bda funds are safely under their control this obvious quid pro quo is not only embarrassing it sets a dangerous precedent for other regimes that would blackmail the u s what are the consequences of the bda meltdown first the timetable of the feb agreement is already shredded president bush said at the time of the deal "those who say that the north koreans have got to prove themselves by actually following through on the deal are right and im one " assistant secretary of state chris hill the deals u s architect and chief negotiator said "we need to avoid above all missing deadlines its like a broken window theory one window is unrepaired and before you know it youll have a lot of broken windows and nobody cares " those statements were correct when made and they are correct today sadly however they no longer seem to be "operative " second by making secret side deals with north korea the state department has left itself vulnerable to future renegotiation efforts this is the norths classic style negotiate hard to reach an agreement sign it and then start renegotiating not to mention violating the deal at will americas serial concessions on bda simply confirm to pyongyang that state is well into the "save the deal" mode which bodes well for future north korean efforts to recast it consider the sequence of administration positions on bda initially the criminal investigation and the nuclear issue were not supposed to be connected but the north insisted and the u s gave in then north korea moved the renegotiation into high gear demanding the return of the funds as a precondition to complying with its own commitments unwilling to "just say no " the bush administration tried to distinguish between "licit" and "illicit" funds returning only those that were legitimate this of course begs the question whether anything that the criminal conspiracy running north korea does is "licit " even the "licit" funds returned however were to be used only for "humanitarian" projects in north korea rather than returned to kim jong ils grasp although how in an age of the u n s "cash for kim" program the state department thought this was to be verified remains a mystery nevertheless north korea was not satisfied insisting that all the funds had to be returned to the actual account holders with no restrictions on their use even though all agree that at least some were acting illicitly this too state accepted third we now face the nagging question whether there are other secret side deals beyond bda of course the bda agreement was not so secret that kim jong il was barred from knowing about it by definition most troubling however is that state apparently thought it too sensitive to share with the american people until the february deal broke down in an unavoidably public way but even this was not enough for north korea which sensing u s weakness continues to press for more although conflicting stories abound north korea may be seeking not just the return of the bda funds but something much more significant guaranteed access to international financial markets even through an american bank indeed this week wachovia corp confirmed that it had been approached by the state department to assist in the transfer of funds here the issue is inescapably related to north koreas nuclear program the norths access to international financial markets to launder its ill gotten revenues is critical both to continued financing of its nuclear regime and to keeping kim jong il in power if this is even close to what the state department is prepared to do who will ever again take us seriously when we threaten financial strangulation of rogue states and terrorist groups granting this north korean demand would make u s concessions on bda look paltry by comparison fourth the bda affair calls the remainder of the feb agreement into question just to remind is the th anniversary of the agreed framework a predecessor u s north korean agreement and the th anniversary of the joint north south declaration on the denuclearization of the korean peninsula in all likelihood it is also the th and th anniversaries respectively of north koreas first violations of those agreements no serious observer contends there is any sign of a strategic decision by north korea to give up its nuclear program which means therefore there is no more reason to believe the north will comply with the feb deal than it has complied with its predecessors it is not even clear if north korea actually gave up anything significant in the feb deal it is entirely possible for example that yongbyon is now a hulk well past its useful life span and that the north agreed in effect to shut down a wreck even if yongbyon is not in such parlous condition it may be that the north has extracted all the plutonium possible from the fuel rods it has and that yongbyon therefore offers it nothing more here the omissions in the feb agreement become significant the deal says nothing about the plutonium perhaps weaponized perhaps not that north korea has already reprocessed how these issues play out will have ramifications far beyond north korea particularly for iran some say the bush administration entered the feb deal because it desperately needed a success one thing is for certain it does not need a failure the president can easily extricate himself from the deal just based on north koreas actions to date he should take the first opportunity to do so mr bolton is a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute and the author of "surrender is not an option defending america at the u
