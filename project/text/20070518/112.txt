weekend journal tastings sauvignon american style u s plays catch up with global trend aiming for elegance wed guess that americans and people all over the world are drinking more sauvignon blanc these days than ever before for many years those in the know enjoyed wines made from the sauvignon blanc grape such as frances marvelous sancerre just in the past few years though there has been a wave of good sauvignon blanc coming from all over the world new zealand south africa chile often at bargain prices its clear that many people now consider sauvignon blanc a great summertime wine and theyre right its refreshing good with lighter food and very easy to enjoy in the midst of this sauvignon surge american vintners havent come close to leading the charge california wineries sold about as much sauvignon blanc in as in according to figures from impact databank while u s imports of all new zealand wines largely fueled by sauvignon blanc which is its signature wine rose about fold during the same period unfortunately theres good reason for this for years american vintners made sauvignon blanc into a kind of junior chardonnay stripping much of its grassy vibrant mouth watering tastes and burying what was left with an overlay of oak when vintners in other countries started offering americans vibrant juicy and delicious sauvignon blanc instead u s winemakers were caught flat footed or rather with flat footed wines that has begun to change in the past few years as american wineries developed their own style of sauvignon blanc one that we like quite a bit not quite as earthy as many french wines but more restrained and less over the top exuberant than new zealands its simply another example of the versatility of this grape which can be as bright and aromatic as fresh mown grass in the sunshine rich and earthy dry or a little sweet an elegant wine when paired with its traditional blending partner semillon especially in white bordeaux and an ingredient in some of the worlds best and most luscious dessert wines in this mix we believe that some american winemakers now are creating sauvignon blanc that is special with its own style with warm weather arriving we asked ourselves this question if someone wanted to know which american sauvignon blanc to buy that could stand on its own against the class of sancerre the value of chilean sauvignon blanc and the life of new zealands style which would we recommend so we decided to do a different type of tasting usually we buy or so examples of a certain kind of wine and taste them blind to get an overall sense of the state of that wine our index of favorites as we routinely explain is only meant to give an idea of what these might taste like at their best this time though we decided to have a best of taste off we bought all of the american sauvignon blancs that we have recommended over the years more than in all and tasted them blind against each other we bought either the or vintage whichever was the younger we saw our mission was to come up with a list to answer the question were sure to be asked this summer if i were going to buy an american sauvignon blanc which would you recommend because all of these have been good over several years wed feel especially good recommending the best of the best in any vintage whether or even when its released the we were looking for wines that have been consistently good over the years that express a special american style and that stood out among their peers in this tasting we tasted the wines in blind flights over several nights they were often good of course since they were already among our favorites in the past but they expressed a wide variety of visions what the best ones had in common was good fruit and some sense that the winemaker was very deliberate in fashioning a particular style of sauvignon blanc not surprisingly among our favorites were groth chateau ste michelle and joseph phelps which have all made excellent sauvignon blanc for some time its also interesting that several of our favorites had at least a touch of semillon and hogue had fully our best value was another old favorite geyser peak as always it pretty much exploded in the mouth with ripe fresh tastes of lemon lime fruit on the taste map its more toward new zealand style but it also offers a hint of underlying minerals that gives it a nicely grounded somewhat haunting finish and at &# or so its hard to beat for the price its widely available too the winery made cases that were distributed nationally our best of tasting deserves kudos for walking a very delicious line it retained the varietal tastes of the grape while also offering richness and mouthfeel this is an elegant wine appropriate to sophisticated summer dinner parties and it turned out that we paid just &# for it though &# is a more representative price it was from bernardus winery which made about cases of it what makes this wine which is semillon stand apart we called the winemaker at bernardus dean dekorth "for me it sort of reflects the growing conditions in monterey county " he told us "the largest source is from griva vineyard and it just has a gravelly rocky extremely poor soil and a lot of wind in the afternoon its just the right balance to give it its own special character the terroir of the vineyards i like doing pretty minimal stuff trying not to do anything that messes it up we use stainless steel for most of it trying to avoid getting oaky notes the semillon is very rich and dense and the wine has a lot of semillion character that gives it a special little note " interestingly mr dekorth says that bernardus used to make oakier sauvignon blanc and adds "everybody was doing that until new zealand came out with its our model was from new zealand they were making very bright intensely varietal wines so a lot of us went that way " in the past we have found american sauvignon blanc too variable with some fine examples and many that were ok but flat even in this tasting we certainly found some winners but we didnt find the wines as consistently likable as new zealand sauvignon blanc so if you asked us what american sauvignon blanc to buy this summer one that would offer taste value and an american viewpoint wed suggest the eight in the index of course none is available everywhere but good wine shops will likely have one or two you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones american sauvignon blanc index in a tasting of american sauvignon blanc sometimes called fume blanc among wines that have been our favorites in broad blind
