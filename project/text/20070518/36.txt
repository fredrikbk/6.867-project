historic shift laid out in deal on immigration new policy would favor job skills education wariness from business key senators and the white house reached an immigration deal that would give the nations million illegal immigrants a chance to stay in the u s while giving added weight to education and job skills in deciding who gets to settle here in the future the deal marks a major departure from the u s s historic policy of giving preference to family members of immigrants already living in the u s if enacted into law it would be the most ambitious effort yet to deal with americas illegal immigration problem which has mushroomed in the past two decades it also represents an attempt to reconcile two important changes that have unfolded simultaneously in recent years the nations increasing dependence on immigrant labor and heightened fears about porous borders in the wake of the sept terrorist attacks the proposed legislation would step up security along the u s mexican border but also allow almost all of those immigrants now in the u s illegally to remain as long as they were willing to report to authorities and pay a &# fine one of its most sweeping innovations would be a guest worker program that eventually would allow temporary workers to come to the u s each year to fill low skilled jobs in the booming service sector among the winners in the deal would be major employers of low skilled workers including packing plants the construction industry and agriculture which would be assured a steady supply of labor and could keep many of their workers now in the u s illegally it would also aid college students or members of the military who were brought to the u s illegally as children by giving them a faster track than others to legal status however despite their heavy lobbying the deal seems to offer little to high tech companies that have come to rely on skilled workers recruited from abroad and while illegal immigrants would be allowed to stay on legal immigrants who had hoped their families would be able to join them in the u s could be disappointed big labor also stands to lose because the new temporary workers arent like to be unionized deeply split the compromise though a breakthrough in cooperation between congressional democrats and the white house still faces a tough fight in both the senate and the house democrats are generally sympathetic to easing the way for immigrants and can expect generous help from president bush but they will need dozens of votes from republicans who are deeply split between a business friendly wing eager to provide employers with access to more immigrant labor and social conservatives who believe american culture is being diluted by too many foreigners even democratic support isnt a given sen robert menendez d n j criticized the plan on the senate floor for the "prohibitive" fees that immigrants must pay to gain legal status and predicted that unions wouldnt oppose the guest worker program in the house rep howard berman d calif a leader on immigration policy called the bill "a good start " the bill gives immigration advocates a major victory by giving immediate legal status to millions of people who currently face forcible deportation in a bid to win conservative support for that provision the bill would place new demands on employers to verify the legal status of their employees and commit the government to stepping up border security the bill also makes concessions to conservatives who have long maintained that u s immigration laws admit too many children parents and siblings of other immigrants and too few skilled workers to win them over senate negotiators agreed to a merit system that would award credits to foreign nationals based on their education proficiency in english and job skills that means that thousands of people whose only claim to an immigration visa is their family ties to an immigrant already living in the u s would lose their preferred status even so high tech industries that might benefit from the new emphasis on skills arent likely to be entirely happy with the changes initially at least they would have access to employment based visas the same number as now additionally high tech employers fear that some sort of point system would deprive them of the flexibility to recruit specific workers to plug gaps in their work forces "im not sure anyone thought the employment based system was broken " said ralph hellman of the information technology industry council a trade group of high tech employers the deal creates two new new visa categories a "y" visa for temporary workers and a "z" for illegal immigrants who arrived before the start of this year the z visa would allow illegal immigrants to stay in the u s after paying a &# penalty and making a "touch back" visit to their home countries they would be eligible to start on the path toward citizenship only after about four million families now in line for immigrant visas have been cleared through the system a process that could take about eight years enough points even then they would be required to demonstrate they have enough "points" to merit an immigrant visa the point system hasnt been worked out but preliminary proposals put out by the white house during the negotiations suggested z visa holders could earn credits for having medical insurance owning a house and or serving in the military the requirements give lawmakers the political cover to legalize millions of people without appearing to grant them amnesty thats a touchy point among conservatives but even immigration supporters agree that a bill that appears to give a free ride to illegal immigrants would encourage even more illegal border crossings preliminary white house proposals awarded eight points to science technology math and health care workers and points to workers trained in fields that the bureau of labor statistics predicts will see the fastest job growth over the next decade some of those jobs including software engineers and computer systems administrators are highly skilled but among the jobs in heaviest demand are nurses aides and other low skilled workers other points would be awarded for english language fluency and for having family members in the country already but the white house didnt say how many points an applicant would need to qualify for a visa the bill requires the u s to meet certain border security and enforcement standards before the guest worker program or the process of legalizing illegal immigrants can begin it calls for the department of homeland security to hire border patrol officers build miles of vehicle barriers and miles of fencing at the border and to be given enough funding to hold illegal crossers at a time the bush administration says those benchmarks can be met in months also in that month window employers would be required to confirm that all new hires are in the u s legally by checking their identification and work papers and comparing them against a database of valid social security numbers within three years all employees not just new hires would have to go through such screening "critical infrastructure" companies like defense contractors would have to begin the id process immediately but employer groups complain that government databases are flawed and that the timetable is unrealistic "we will have a harrowing period of pressure on employers with the risk of criminal prosecution and discrimination lawsuits " said angelo paparelli an attorney who represents high tech companies and is president of the academy of business immigration lawyers open ended access sen charles grassley an influential republican from iowa also has criticized the plan for giving the department of homeland security "unlimited open ended access" to tax and social security data as part of the verification system many economists have argued for shifting the criteria for immigration toward job skills and the idea has periodically circulated in congress where it was long resisted by democrats and immigrant advocates last year about of the million immigration visas issued went to relatives of u s citizens or legal residents about went to individuals because of their skills only went to workers with what the government calls "first priority" skills including those it identifies as "outstanding professors or researchers " while almost twice as many went to the siblings of immigrants under the senate bill the government would issue family preference visas yearly until the current backlog is eliminated after that the senate bill envisions awarding about family based visas and merit based visas yearly under the visa quotas will be boosted temporarily to allow the bulge of z visa holders to work its way through the system meanwhile some family members who currently are entitled to immigrate would lose their preferences ending what conservatives deride as "chain migration " only immigration visas would be issued yearly to overseas parents of u s citizens for example although they still could visit on another new temporary visa good for days point system that idea already has drawn howls from immigrant groups who say a point system would favor educated europeans over hispanics and asians "its mean " says karen narasaki president of the asian american justice center a washington advocacy group she adds that immigrants depend on family members to help them adjust to the u s and staff the small businesses such as fruit stands and motels that many of them open business groups are also wary employers who already are desperate for low skilled workers might not be able to get enough of them under a point system that gives weight to college degrees they say "are only rocket scientists going to get in " asks laura reiff of the essential workers immigration coalition which represents service industries those employers might have to look to the guest worker program the bill proposes that workers a year be admitted on two year y visas and matched with employers who have proved they cant find workers in the u s guest workers could renew their visas twice but would have to leave for a year each time anyone who didnt leave when the visa expired would be barred permanently from re entering the u s immigrant groups were quick to denounce those provisions "come here and work but we dont really want you to be one of us that is not a recipe for a healthy society " said cecilia munoz of the national council of la raza an hispanic advocacy group some employers argue that making workers leave after a few years will be disruptive to their businesses and deprive them of experienced employees who could move up to supervisory and management jobs
