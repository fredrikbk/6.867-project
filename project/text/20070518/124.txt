wumarts long halt points to a flaw hong kong market has tough time policing mainland firms hong kong when wumart stores inc announced a rise in first quarter net income at the end of april the shares of beijings biggest supermarket chain didnt move and it wasnt because investors didnt have an opinion in fact wumarts shares havent budged since nov when they were suspended from trading on the hong kong exchange pending the release of "price sensitive information" by the company not long afterward wumarts founder and chairman zhang wenzhong resigned the company said he was giving "his personal assistance" to an investigation by chinese authorities wumart says neither the investigation nor the abrupt departure of its founder have affected operations of the companys stores in the beijing area its business as usual sales and profits are rising and an annual general meeting is slated for june its also business as usual for research analysts from credit suisse and citigroup who continue to cover the stock and have price targets for a company that investors havent been able to buy or sell for six months when trading was suspended shares were at hong kong dollars u s cents higher than at the start of in a march report citigroup said it rated wumart "sell" on the back of "high valuations and uncertainties brought by the chairmans resignation and the fact that he has been involved in investigations by prc authorities " the fate of shares of beijing based wumart highlights a peculiarity of the hong kong stock market where trading in stocks is sometimes suspended for weeks months or even years it also underscores how hong kongs exchange faces limitations when trying to police companies from mainland china "when regulators keep stocks closed for six months at a time it reduces the transparency of that market environment " says james oberweis who oversees the &# million oberweis china opportunities fund which holds a small wumart position other wumart investors include julius baer investment management capital group and j p morgan chase "if it were to happen frequently it would decrease the attractiveness of that market for foreign investors " mr oberweis adds hong kong is attracting listings from a growing percentage of the chinese companies seeking to tap international capital but because hong kong and china maintain separate legal systems the ability of this citys regulators to monitor mainland chinese businesses is often stymied as the companies day to day activities are in another jurisdiction about half of hong kongs us&# trillion market capitalization is from chinese enterprises regulators are stepping up cooperation for investors in wumart though the months of radio silence has been difficult the hong kong stock exchange declined to comment on wumarts case citing a policy of not commenting on individual suspensions suspensions in hong kong can drag electric equipment maker mandarin resources was suspended for years until amid a fraud investigation and trial currently of hong kongs publicly traded companies are suspended and companies are in the process of delisting according to exchange data in the u s suspensions rarely last more than a day and when they do there is a high likelihood the stock wont trade again david webb a shareholder advocate and hong kong exchange director says that as long as the directors of a company know as much as the investors the stock should be allowed to be traded "its a shortcoming of the regulatory process" in hong kong he says "it shouldnt be up to the exchange to protect investors from the unknown the risk is where the company is holding something back " the suspension has hurt wumarts momentum a planned us&# million share placement to finance acquisitions had to be scrapped after the stock was suspended and in april the company announced the failure of a &# million acquisition that was to be funded in part with stock during the six months wumart has been suspended the overall hong kong market has risen that climb could help buoy wumarts shares when they resume trading investors say though the four analysts who have maintained coverage see the stock underperforming according to
