karaoke bar fight has hanwha chief singing the blues korean conglomerate head is charged with assault business leaders lose face seoul south korea at the end of a night of drinking in a karaoke bar here in early march kim dong won a year old college student got caught up in a fight that left him needing stitches on his forehead the next night his year old father chairman of one of the countrys largest conglomerates exacted revenge police say they say the father kim seung youn directed three associates who rounded up people including a former boxer and an organized crime figure and took the men involved in the fight to a construction site outside seoul there they were beaten by several men including mr kim himself what happened next was extraordinary in a country where the power of conglomerate chairmen is rarely questioned rumors about the revenge attack which found their way onto internet discussion sites were eventually splashed across the local media police whose preliminary investigation ended quickly when one of the victims bosses said that nothing had happened restarted their probe late last month amid a growing public uproar in the blaze of publicity that followed victims participants and witnesses poured out details of the alleged crime last week police arrested the elder mr kim on six charges of assault abduction and confinement and he remains in jail in the korean justice system an arrest must be approved by prosecutors and a judge and in almost all cases leads to indictment and trial yesterday police officially handed the case over to prosecutors in all people are being charged with crimes related to the episode including mr kims son and the man who hit him in the bar police announced if mr kim is found guilty he could be sentenced to years in prison he may be forced to give up the top job at hanwha group the conglomerate of insurance chemicals and other companies started by his own father and which he has led since the age of koreas th largest conglomerate by assets hanwha had total sales of about &# billion last year before his arrest mr kim denied to police and the public that he was involved in the beatings but after his first appearance before a judge last week he said in a statement "i am greatly reproaching myself for not behaving according to legal procedures from the beginning of the incident " mr kim couldnt be reached for this article koreas conglomerates were formed with government backing in the s as a means to quickly lift the country out of poverty and they are still dominant for years korean politicians preached that business leaders needed to be treated differently because they were doing the all important work of building the countrys economy even today the conglomerates are structured to concentrate power with the chairman to whom employees pay unstinting deference mr kim seemed to acknowledge that his actions tarnished more than just himself and his company when after the arrest he told reporters "i sincerely apologize to all businessmen who work hard for the countrys economy for creating a misunderstanding about them " most koreans are less impressed and intimidated by the conglomerate chiefs than they used to be a change thats partly a sign of the peoples own growing affluence in addition as leadership of the conglomerates has passed from founders to their children and grandchildren the heirs are less well regarded than their forebears were "the perception of the younger generations of the conglomerate families is they are rude and mean " says kim hye jung an office worker here in seoul "people are much more critical of the conglomerate families when they do something wrong " in the past few weeks anti hanwha web sites have sprouted up and some people have tried to organize a boycott of its various companies which include the countrys second largest life insurer hotels and a professional baseball team college professors have used the incident to start discussions about business ethics and koreans changing views of law and order president roh moo hyun who campaigned in for reforms in the conglomerates weighed in in late april by telling police to conduct a full investigation even pro conglomerate voices recognize the damage "this case cannot be seen as just a funny story in which a chairman wielded a lead pipe while wearing leather gloves " wrote moon chang keuk vice publisher and chief editor of the joong ang ilbo newspaper which is affiliated with samsung group koreas largest conglomerate "this case shows that money can be translated into power or even worse buy conglomerates authoritative power " to many people the surprising ingredient in the hanwha episode is mr kims personal involvement "i was shocked that he didnt just send some people " says lee sang yeol a financial company employee in seoul "i could only laugh at the situation he should have known this could get out there " according to police mr kim enlisted the help of a hanwha secretary a manager and a bodyguard to find men to fight the guy who hurt his son the night after the karaoke bar altercation the men involved were called back to the karaoke club to apologize once there several of the them have told police they were pushed into cars and taken to a mountainside construction site outside the city police said both mr kim and his son hit the men citing the accounts of the victims and of witnesses who include a friend of the son some of the victims said mr kim swung a long pipe but mr kim has denied that in his public statement after his arrest mr kim called himself a "foolish father" and said he should have chided his son before becoming angry with others mr kim took over the hanwha conglomerate years ago after the death of his father who started the group with an explosives company mr kim became more involved in the chemicals industry and made several acquisitions including korea life insurance co at the beginning of this year hanwha launched a new ad campaign aimed at lifting the image of the conglomerate and korea life its biggest consumer unit as part of that mr kim figures prominently on the companys web site which carries the slogan "your dreamworld hanwha " on its home page an extensive photo gallery devoted to mr kim includes excerpts from his letters and speeches to company employees during a difficult stretch in the late s he told them "we will continue to carry out our reform drive which will call for sacrifice and may be extreme at times however i believe we all agree that this is the only way for us to survive " for the time being mr kim will be able to manage the group from jail because each of its companies has its own chief executive says ju cheol beom a spokesman for hanwha group "if this lasts a long time we may set up an emergency management system " he says
