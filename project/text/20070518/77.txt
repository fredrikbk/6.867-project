pride of the caymans let us say right up front that its terrific that john edwards lives in a country where he can lose an election and still land a &# part time job as a consultant to an investment firm that keeps its hedge funds in the cayman islands as a tax shelter for its clients this truly is the land of opportunity were also encouraged to hear that according to the former senators spokesman "john edwards is running for president to give every american the opportunities that hes had " while there may not be enough half a million dollar a year part time consulting gigs to go around just yet the hedge fund industry is growing and theres always private equity if you find yourself as mr edwards described his circumstance making &# a year at an antipoverty think tank and wanting to learn something about "capital markets " thus did he turn in his time of need to fortress investment group llc pride of the caymans it would also be churlish to repeat the by now tired line about which of his "two americas" mr edwards lives in notwithstanding his &# million net worth about &# million of which is invested in fortress and in any case no one should have to apologize for his wealth and success that said we can understand why the former senators campaign wants to change the subject mr edwards has campaigned both in and now against the use of offshore tax shelters the supposed rising tide of u s inequality and the plight of the american worker mr edwards employment at an investment firm that headquarters most of its hedge and private equity funds in one of the worlds most notorious tax shelters underscores all of those themes albeit not quite in the way the edwards campaign has chosen to emphasize mr edwards did tell the associated press that he took the job not merely to make money but also to learn about the relationship between the capital markets and poverty how refreshing it would have been then for mr edwards to have emerged from his toil in the crucible of high finance to explain that all is not moral darkness in the upper reaches of the investing class that people who invest in businesses help alleviate poverty and make the economy strong and that it is risk taking that offers americans their best indeed their only chance to have "the opportunities hes had " it was not to be alas mr edwards said instead that if hes elected president hell still try to abolish offshore tax shelters at least hell have already made his money
