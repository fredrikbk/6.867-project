weekend journal sports by the numbers earnhardts options with his announcement that he will leave dale earnhardt inc the race team founded by his late father and owned by his stepmother at the end of the season dale earnhardt jr becomes the most sought after free agent in nascar history mr earnhardt is already the highest paid driver in the sport and whoever he goes with his next deal promises to make him even richer but the fact is that on the track the year old mr earnhardt has been quietly struggling lately he hasnt won a race in a year and has never won a season long nextel cup championship so if he really wants to follow in his fathers footsteps here are some factors he should take into consideration when deciding which team to sign with first lets look at winning percentage since when the chase nascars race end of the season playoff system was instituted hendrick motorsports comes out on top with wins in starts from its drivers jeff gordon jimmie johnson kyle busch and brian vickers a victory percentage jack roush racing led by matt kenseth greg biffle and mark martin comes in a distant second with wins in starts for an winning percentage sentimental favorite richard childress racing where mr earnhardts father won six of his seven nascar titles sports a fifth best winning percentage with nine wins eight in and but nascars points system rewards consistency even more than winning which teams were most successful at putting their drivers in the top hendrick leads here as well with a top percentage just ahead of roush with a joe gibbs racing is next at while childresss trailed penske racings mark which teams have won championships for their drivers in the three years since nascar switched over to the chase three teams captured the drivers title in kurt busch won for roush in tony stewart took the title for gibbs last year mr johnson won for hendrick mr earnhardt should also pay special attention to this seasons early results in five races nascar mandated that teams run the so called car of tomorrow cot designed to improve safety lower costs and supersede the current spec car possibly as early as next season the hendrick team has won all five cot races and placed out of its entries in the top the other team to have some notable success in cot is gibbs with mr stewart and denny hamlin at the wheel they led almost half of the total laps run and placed eight of entries in the top roush now called roush fenway racing since red sox co owner john henry bought into the team has had its difficulties with only eight out of entries finishing in the top and only laps led childress was respectable but not stellar nine top s and laps led so based on the numbers a move to hendrick would seem an obvious choice for mr earnhardt but could this move actually happen theres certainly one big stumbling block mr earnhardts rivalry with mr gordon hendricks top driver but in nascar each car owned by a common owner operates virtually as a team unto itself and teammates compete hard against each other hendrick also runs chevrolets which would allow mr earnhardt to continue his relationship with that manufacturer given mr earnhardts stated preference for staying with a chevrolet team roush runs fords his second best option might be gibbs instead of the dream matchup at childress in any case in nascar having the right car is paramount and mr earnhardts upcoming decision will be pivotal in determining if the sports biggest star can become as successful on the track as he is popular off it
