politics &amp economics iran studies china model to craft economic map nation aims to keep political control and lift economy tehran iran iranian officials are looking to china for ideas on solving a riddle that has bedeviled strong fisted governments the world over how does a state loosen its suffocating grip on the economy without losing political control in the process on a tour of china late last year a delegation of iranian officials and members of parliament visited shanghai and shenzhen two boom towns that exemplify chinas approach adel azar head of the iranian parliaments economic committee and a member of the strong study mission says he was shocked by the contrast between dynamism in china and immobility in iran a country with just one eighteenth as many people as china and much more gas and oil wealth "we started our debate about private business about the same time as china " says mr azar referring to discussions in both countries in the early s on how to best balance state and private sectors "we argued they just got on with it " tehran has grown more eager for a clear direction in recent months as international pressure to dismantle its nuclear program has heightened the sense of crisis and policy drift economic sanctions have squeezed iranian banks limited access to technology and damped foreigners already limited enthusiasm to invest here though hugely different both the peoples republic of china and the islamic republic of iran are creations of revolution communist and islamic respectively both proclaim revolutionary ideologies discredited by reality but while china has despite periodic flurries of rhetoric abandoned the economic principles of its revolution iran still clings to its own younger islamic revolutionary legacy since the overthrow of the shah in iran has struggled to craft an "islamic" economic model that mixes social justice religious values and growth the result is a ramshackle oil financed system that respects private property on the margins but is state dominated the state and its affiliates control more than of the economy subsidies for energy food and other items amount to more than a quarter of irans gross domestic product according to the international monetary fund "the economy is going to hell " says saeed laylaz an economist who advised the former reformist government "there is only one economic model here the oil model " irans economic output grew more than last year largely on the back of high world prices for its energy exports but this isnt much better than the countrys growth rate when oil prices were far lower economists say this shows the government is squandering the oil windfall in nonproductive ways mr azar the member of parliament who visited china stands at the opposite end of the political spectrum from mr laylaz but agrees the economy is in trouble "we are of course not satisfied with the general state of our economy " says the conservative legislator but there is no agreement on what to do about it some look to a chinese style solution with private enterprise steered by a strong state hand a rival view which had the upper hand before president mahmoud ahmadinejads election in advocates a more open market based approach on paper at least irans economic strategy is more or less a standard one for a developing resource rich nation trying to reduce dependence on oil and expand its nonenergy sector the country is having the same lack of success in that endeavor as most other oil dependent states but irans hope of getting beyond this stage is further complicated by the ideological baggage of a revolution that in theory at least puts religion at the core of decision making mr ahmadinejad who came to office promising to "put oil revenue on the dinner table of every iranian " has aggravated a sense of policy paralysis with a mix of populist economics and anti western theatrics his government reluctantly backed calls by parliament for reductions in energy subsidies which have made gasoline one fifth as expensive per liter as mineral water but devised an elaborate high tech low efficiency rationing system that seems designed to fail irans nuclear program meanwhile has led to a strengthening of sanctions that already limit the foreign investment and technology iran desperately needs both to develop its biggest assets oil and gas and to expand a tiny private sector the united nations conference on trade and development pegged nonenergy direct foreign investment in iran at just &# million in the last year for which figures are available compared with &# billion for turkey which has about the same population but a far freer economy in a recent speech mr ahmadinejad boasted that irans foes "are worried that iran will become a model for other nations " thats true to the extent that its nuclear program has led saudi arabia egypt and others to consider following suit but in economics iran is widely viewed as a model of failure even hezbollah the lebanese militia and social movement that ranks as irans keenest foreign fan takes a dim view of its patrons economic example says the head of hezbollahs policy think tank in beirut ali fayad while presenting itself as a beacon for the islamic world tehran has hunted abroad for ideas on how to fix its dysfunctional economy "there has been lots of talk about economic models since the revolution first there was the korean model then there was the chinese model and now there is also the malaysian model " says shahriar alesheikh an economist who runs a trade exhibition center in mashad irans second largest city none of these foreign templates have really taken hold this says mr alesheikh the mashad economist is because they "separate religious issues from development issues that is not going to happen here " backers of change look admiringly at atheist chinas ability to get beyond revolutionary cant conservatives meanwhile take heart in beijings ability to resist political change "the thing they like about china is that they think it shows you dont need democracy to grow " says djavad salehi isfahani an expert on the iranian economy at virginia tech university in blacksburg va but he adds beijings example "doesnt apply because iran is not a low wage economy therefore it is not able to export" at competitive prices like china at the root of irans economic paralysis is a system of leadership in which power is divided among an elected government now headed by mr ahmadinejad an elected parliament and the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei a clerical appointee this contrasts with china where power is concentrated in a single body the communist party irans fractious power centers all profess loyalty to the islamic revolution but often disagree on what this means in practice last year mr khamenei obliquely chided mr ahmadinejad for his handling of the economy and called for more progress on privatization in keeping with article of irans constitution which calls for a mixed economy composed of state cooperative and private ventures mr azar the legislator says the supreme leaders intervention opens the way for a long overdue expansion of the private sector "we have to reduce the role of the state " he says but the opening is likely to be very narrow article mandates that heavy industry foreign trade large mines banking insurance energy radio television post telephone aviation shipping and various other spheres all remain under government control this leaves little room for private enterprise "they dont want to lose control of the economy because they believe and they are right that they will lose their political domination if there is any decrease in the governments share " says mr laylaz the economist who favors liberalization indeed mr ahmadinejads economic policies so far have been dominated by measures that increase economic dependency on and loyalty to the state for example he set up a national network of credit agencies called the kindness of imam reza fund whose job is to give cheap credit to newlyweds and others in need economists view the loans as thinly disguised handouts and warn that the governments largesse made possible by a flood of oil generated cash is fueling dangerously high inflation now heading toward unemployment meanwhile remains stubbornly high official statistics put it above with the rate for young iranians exceeding the majority of iranians have little interest in theoretical debate about which model might help but they too often seem torn between a desire for protection from the state and a desire for more private enterprise they curse the government as corrupt and inefficient but also expect it to provide cheap gasoline to shield them against foreign competition and to confront the rich whom they view as corrupt after attending friday prayers in tehran mohammad mohseni a private trader of home appliances grumbled that mr ahmadinejad hadnt delivered on his economic promises but his main gripe is with cheap imported goods "i havent heard anyone saying that they have been helped by mr ahmadinejad " he says "we have got nothing "
