politics &amp economics crude palestinian weapon creates israeli dilemma civilians terrorized but major response may unite islamists jerusalem when it comes to killing people the homemade qassam rocket may be one of the most inefficient weapons ever invented the missile a slender six foot tube packed with as much as pounds of explosives and fitted with four fins and a rocket engine is like an unguided flying pipe bomb yet palestinian militants use of the qassam continues to terrorize israeli civilians plague the nations defense establishment and bring israel closer to a large scale military confrontation the small rocket seems to have oversize influence in the conflict "its accuracy is very bad and its warhead is very small " says efraim inbar who heads the begin sadat center for strategic studies at israels bar ilan university "but if its fired into a population center it creates a big problem " the military wing of the islamist group hamas did exactly that this week firing more than qassams into israel and creating the possibility of an israeli invasion of the northern gaza strip for the first time since last year northern gaza is the turf militants use as a staging ground for their launches one rocket struck an israeli school yesterday injuring two people as residents of the working class town of sderot the closest israeli population center to northern gaza were being evacuated israeli defense forces responded with air strikes against gaza targets israel said were affiliated with hamas the potential for a bigger assault still looms events thus far and the possibility of more violence in the days ahead show how the palestinians use of qassams continues to pose daunting challenges for israel more than five years after the rockets added a new dimension to the conflict first launched in the early qassams named for the hamas military wing the qassam brigades were so crude they didnt have enough thrust to get out of gaza upgraded rockets started reaching israels western negev desert in as design and thrust were improved more upgrades have been made since according to the israeli government the rockets now have a range of more than six miles threatening the nearby industrial center of ashkelon on israels mediterranean coast although probably more than qassams have been launched since they are believed to have killed only people inside israel the more than qassams launched this week left two people seriously injured but death isnt necessarily the goal instead israeli officials say it is the terror created by rockets falling from the sky for which there is little or no warning "we are going back to the stone age but this time its the qassam age the age of terror " says reuven pedatzur who teaches in the tel aviv universitys security studies program and is a defense analyst for the israeli newspaper haaretz "its impossible to let it go on like this " israel has been slow in seeking technology based defense solutions according to critics although it helped fund the development of a laser based system produced by northrup grumman corp israels defense ministry this year picked an israeli contractor developing a different system one that remains at least two years from deployment yaakov amidror a retired major general and chief of analysis for israeli military intelligence says any technological solution faces long odds "to kill a missile especially such as this is a problem all over the world " he says the main challenge qassams are airborne sometimes for only about seconds giving any system precious little time to locate track and attack the rocket the fact that qassams are small also makes them hard to stop even once israels new defense system is deployed many analysts say a large scale ground assault into the qassam staging grounds in northern gaza is the only real way to stop the barrage yet such a strategy could easily cost more israeli lives than it would save and might yield just a temporary fix once israeli soldiers would withdraw qassams would fall again says mr pedatzur of tel aviv university for those and other reasons he says a long term political solution with the palestinians is the only sustainable answer some israeli officials say an invasion is exactly what hamas wants it would give the group a chance to unite warring palestinian factions against israel the officials say and divert attention from the violence in gaza more than people have been reported killed in recent factional fighting israeli leaders are also still stinging from criticism over the way they handled their last assault on a rocket firing adversary the war last summer in lebanon targeting hezbollah which had military rockets much more powerful than qassams most israeli citizens viewed the war as a strategic failure one that damaged the nations deterrence a view recently echoed by a scathing government investigation but mr inbar of bar ilan university says thats exactly why israel needs to go into gaza hard now "the whole world is looking at whats happening here " he says "we cannot afford another loss after the lebanese debacle " mr amidror the retired military intelligence official agrees that a full scale incursion is needed "do we want to wait for hamas to become as strong as hezbollah or do we want to pre empt it "
