dangerous book for boys soars to dizzying heights first there was the question of the title "the dangerous book for boys " harpercollins publishers chief executive jane friedman just didnt understand what it meant sure the book had been a hit in england and australia but that didnt mean it would work in the u s but the sales staff urged her to stick with it and in just two weeks "dangerous" has become the breakout hit of the season the news corp unit initially ordered up copies there are now copies in print one senior harpercollins executive extrapolating from overseas sales and population data projects that "dangerous " which lists for &# could sell as many as four million in the u s the book by english brothers conn and hal iggulden purports to aim itself at a particularly inscrutable

and cook a rabbit it includes a description of the battle of thermopylae but also how to play texas hold em poker and use the phrases "carpe diem" and "curriculum vitae " the unapologetic message is that boys need a certain amount of danger and risk in their lives and that there are certain lessons that need to be passed down from father to son man to man the implication is that in contemporary society basic rules of maleness arent being handed off as they used to be the book aims to correct that it does so with a pretelevision prevideogame sensibility and also by embracing a view of gender that has been unfashionable in recent decades that frogs and snails and puppy dogs tails are more than lines in a nursery rhyme and that boys are by nature hard wired differently than girls but "the dangerous book for boys" is also aimed at boomer dads who nostalgically yearn for a lost boyhood of fixing lawn mowers and catching snakes with their fathers even if that didnt really happen as often as they think it did the gender exclusive nature of "dangerous" bothers some women in a posting on the livejournal com web site one woman addressing the book and boys in general wrote "heres a tip kiddies maybe the girls want to have the same kind of fun you do instead of sitting around the house and learning how to be a servant " matthew benjamin a senior editor at the collins imprint which
