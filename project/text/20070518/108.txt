weekend journal sports nba referees discover less is more fouls fall as nba monitors the refs quicker pace of play as the playoffs enter their fifth week the nbas referees are under attack from every quarter in addition to all the usual sniping from coaches and players theyre being mocked on anti ref web sites created by vindictive fans the nba now sends supervisors to games to grade them on everything from their calls to how fit they look in their uniforms in recent weeks one veteran official was suspended by the league for lashing out at a player while a professor from the wharton school of business thickened the stew by accusing the refs of racial bias but this years playoff statistics point to one surprising conclusion that seems to have escaped the critics by one measure the "zebras" have become models of restraint so far the refs have called fouls per playoff game a decline of over the average for the last six years and at this pace the fewest in at least two decades its not that the refs are slacking off in after a string of uninspiring playoffs with record low tv ratings the nba set out to encourage its teams to play a more fluid style of basketball with less brute physical contact more fast breaks higher scores and ideally higher ratings one important component of the plan reducing the irritatingly high number of fouls being called in the playoffs every season for the last decade the average number of fouls called per game in the playoffs had been about higher than in the regular season to make matters worse average scoring per game tended to drop in other words just as the nba was attracting its largest tv audiences of the season the product was devolving more than any other decision the refs make foul calls have the biggest impact on the overall pace of play some fouls cause a change in ball possession others force coaches to remove top scorers and adopt a more conservative strategy most importantly foul calls stop the clock and often create long breaks for free throw attempts calling lots of fouls does not necessarily hold down scoring in fact the reverse is more common but theres no question that constant whistles break the sports balletic rhythm which is to some its greatest asset "this is a game of fluidity " says jerry colangelo chairman of the phoenix suns "ticky tack fouls have no place " the current shift is the result of a quiet three year old effort by the nba to standardize its officiating after years of collecting little data on referees and hearing about it from owner mark cuban of the dallas mavericks who did the nba now vacuums up information on every call made and missed and filters it through an office of "officiating analysis " before the season the league hired a staff of observers to attend games and monitor the officials performances referees began getting emails informing them if they were deviating from league norms in calling certain violations using a grading system developed by management consultants the observers a collection of former coaches and players along with a few high school and college refs filed notes on everything from the referees accuracy to their "professionalism" and "athletic appearance " while the nba does not share the data the observers judgments help determine which referees are selected to work in the playoffs where they can earn as much as &# on top of their salaries which range between &# and &# depending on seniority the nba has joined a larger movement in pro sports to impose order on officials the more consistent their calls are the leagues believe the easier it will be to impose rule changes that make the product more exciting in a similar move in major league baseball created a system to evaluate how consistently umpires call balls and strikes while the extra oversight is never popular with the officials it was a particularly painful gut punch for nba referees for many years they maintained a rare level of celebrity serving as color commentators appearing in nba highlight videos and playing to the crowds with flamboyant foul calls billy crystal even played one in the film "forget paris " today many refs feel that the leagues minders are more concerned that the referees hit specific foul "quotas" than make accurate calls and that this strategy threatens the integrity of the game "you gotta hit certain numbers more than anything " says one current nba referee who has been in the league for over a decade and declined to be identified the officials collective bargaining agreement prohibits them from speaking to the media without the nbas permission he says a "vast number" of officials make certain calls "just so they dont become an outlier on the stat sheet " stu jackson the nbas executive vice president of basketball operations says the foul information is used to train and develop officials and is "just one of the tools" the league uses in evaluating performance the point mr jackson says is to make sure refs enforce the rules consistently to help teams adjust to recent rules changes designed to minimize the overly physical slow it down tactics that drove down playoff scoring in the past the focus wasnt to create more offense he says but to "improve the flow of our game " the league has tried this before in after years of steady scoring declines the nba adopted a number of changes to encourage offense including allowing zone defenses and reducing the amount of time teams have to bring the ball past midcourt to eight seconds from while the number of fouls declined in those years the changes failed to increase scoring and only seemed to help plodding defense oriented teams such as the san antonio spurs and detroit pistons moreover the changes did nothing to combat a lingering problem the discrepancy between the playoffs and the regular season by shifting its focus to the officials in and instructing them to crack down on hand checking defense the nba machine seems to be moving in the right direction over the last three regular seasons compared to the previous three total scoring rose by six points per game while fouls increased only slightly in the playoffs total scoring has increased by eight points over that span while fouls have declined there is evidence that the leagues emphasis on consistency is also working for the first time in at least seasons the average number of foul calls per game has been virtually the same throughout the regular season and the playoffs if any team stands to benefit from this new environment its the phoenix suns a high scoring fast breaking club led by former mvp guard steve nash the suns are one of the nbas top tv draws and in theory the type of team the nba covets as far as the suns are concerned the fewer fouls the referees call the better in the interest of maintaining a fast pace on the court the teams coaches instruct players to concede some baskets on defense rather than risk a foul that might slow things down "we always want to be last in the league in fouls committed " says suns assistant coach marc iavaroni the suns play the san antonio spurs tonight in game of the western conference semifinals a series thats been marked by controversial suspensions and accusations of dirty play its still unclear that cutting back on fouls will fix the leagues problems the relationship between fouls scoring and aesthetics is a complex one that referees cant fully control and theres no proof that games with fewer fouls draw more viewers so far this year ratings for the nba playoffs are down on espn and on abc nonetheless the refs can already claim some measure of vindication even if it pains them to admit it nba veterans such as kiki vandeweghe the former general manager of the denver nuggets say theres no question the refs are better than they used to be "it really makes you angry to watch video and see how often they get the call right " he says
