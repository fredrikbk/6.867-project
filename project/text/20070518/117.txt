weekend journal the wealth report putting a spin on class warfare as media maul the rich pr experts offer advice the everyman strategy during a television interview this month nbc today co host matt lauer asked new jersey gov jon corzine about whether hedge fund managers were "out of touch with america " given their astronomical salaries "some are some arent " said the governor who made a fortune on wall street "good risk managers and portfolio managers are people that dont lose track of what the real world is about " then after a pause he added "i think some people based on the size of the houses i see built and the automobiles and the things that people accumulate there are some who might be drifting away from reality " it was another example of how the heated politics of wealth and inequality are creating new public relations problems for todays rich with their numbers exploding along with information about their private lives wealthy people are increasingly becoming targets of ridicule forcing them to come up with ever more creative ways to defend their image in the media the problem is made worse by the growing awareness of inequality one typical recent newspaper headline "filthy rich own half of worlds wealth " from the grand rapids mich press the richest of americans now control of the nations wealth up from in during the last wealth boom in the s the rich were largely celebrated gordon gekko the memorable tyrant of the film "wall street " declared that "greed is good " and ceos proudly flashed their expensive toys on the cover of forbes magazine people with money have become more defensive with most avoiding any press donald trump and paris hilton excepted some argue that their windfalls are reasonable and portray themselves as folksy ordinary people many have turned to philanthropy as their saving grace a client recently described the media environment as "like marie antoinettes france " says allan mayer a pr specialist whos worked with wealthy families around the world "there is a kind of class warfare going on and its becoming far more noticeable " he says "in the s every ceo wanted to show the press their new yacht or big mansion now there is a sense that maybe discretion is the better part of valor unless youre oblivious or a complete megalomaniac you know that while youre doing great most people are not " here are some suggestions that top public relations executives are making to their wealthy clients  stay quiet hedge funders have learned this lesson perhaps better than anyone never mind interviews just trying to get official photos of paul tudor jones ii or steve cohen is next to impossible hedge funders of course argue through their representatives that their silence is for security reasons sean cassidy president of new york based dan klores communications says he discourages his wall street clients from giving interviews since "once you start granting access it just fuels" more coverage of their personal wealth "in many cases our job is to keep them out of the press unless theres a business reason " mr cassidy adds if a rich individual or family is forced into the public spotlight say through a lawsuit they should do an interview but downplay their wealth as much as possible some pr experts say "the last thing you want to be today is boastful " says marcia horowitz with new yorks rubenstein associates but for clients who are out of touch with the rest of the world and live in a "bubble" of wealth and privilege ms horowitz advises against interviews "some people dont understand that reporters and their audience may not be sympathetic to the problems of millionaires " she adds one case in point might be an interview that larry ellison oracles famously ostentatious ceo did in for vanity fair on his foot yacht rising sun in the piece he complained that he didnt enjoy his first vacation on the boat "i didnt know whether it was the scale or the newness that was the problem " he said "turns out it was only the newness its really only the size of a very large house "  act middle class since so many of this eras wealthy people made their money themselves pr specialists advise them to play up their middle class roots dress casual theyre told talk about your old ford pickup truck rather than your convertible bentley and about your "simple" life even if you have a household staff of for instance both before and after her jail term homemaking maven martha stewart made a habit of talking about her pets her gardening and her folksy upbringing in many of her interviews she has downplayed any discussion of her multiple vacation homes and private yacht ms horowitz cautions clients to use the "everyman" strategy only if its true  theres always philanthropy if other strategies dont work clients can always turn to philanthropy bill gates and warren buffett may be the most prominent givers but the chronicle of philanthropy says people last year gave &# million or more to philanthropic causes about double the year earlier level but with so many philanthropists vying for attention its harder to get noticed mr cassidy recommends that clients focus their energies on "one charity that is meaningful to them " whats more mr mayer warns that in todays polarized society overly visible giving "can be seen as showing off " contact us at wealth wsj com
