a street pioneer fears a blowup mr bookstaber points to knotty rapid deals catastrophic fallout like many pessimistic observers richard bookstaber thinks financial derivatives wall street innovation and hedge funds will lead to a financial meltdown what sets mr bookstaber apart is that he has spent his career designing derivatives working on wall street and running a hedge fund "the financial markets that we have constructed are now so complex and the speed of transactions so fast that apparently isolated actions and even minor events can have catastrophic consequences " mr bookstaber writes in a new book that is part memoir and part treatise mr bookstaber has a doctorate in economics and now runs a hedge fund at frontpoint partners which was bought last year by morgan stanley but it is his prior positions at morgan stanley and salomon brothers since absorbed into citigroup inc that form the core of his book "a demon of our own design markets hedge funds and the perils of financial innovation " published last month in those jobs he says he played a small part in causing both the stock market crash and the collapse of the hedge fund long term capital management lp "the odds are pretty high that well see other dislocations that match the type of turmoil we saw with the crash in and with the ltcm crisis " mr bookstaber years old says in an interview "any one derivative with some exceptions may be easy to track but by the time you layer a lot of them one on top of the other it becomes increasingly complex so a small unexpected event can propagate in surprising and nonlinear ways and theres no way to anticipate all these possible events " his pessimism isnt widely shared by the financial industry or regulators financial innovation and hedge funds have "greatly enhanced the liquidity efficiency and risk sharing capabilities of our financial system " federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said in april officials at morgan stanley declined to comment on the book author and economic consultant peter bernstein who encouraged mr bookstaber to write the book after hearing him speak attributes mr bookstabers unusual point of view to the fact "his focus is risk management which makes for these kinds of attitudes that things can go wrong " mr bookstaber says his views have been sought out by the government accountability office which is preparing a report on hedge funds his first experience with the destructive power of derivatives came in while he was helping design and market "portfolio insurance" for morgan stanley portfolio insurance was devised in the early s by finance theorists as a way for big institutional investors to use budding options pricing theory to protect their portfolios from losses when stocks went down portfolio insurance required an investor to sell stock index futures according to a formula then to buy futures when stocks rose again the problem was that when many investors did the same thing their sales of stock index futures helped pull down the entire stock market that dynamic fueled the crash mr bookstaber who sold portfolio insurance to investors in japan and managed it for such morgan stanley clients as chrysler ford motor co and gillette writes "through my role in implementing portfolio insurance i had helped precipitate a financial crisis of monumental proportions " in as head of salomon brothers risk management team he tried to find out why a strategy employed by the firms bond arbitrage desk with some of wall streets smartest minds was facing more than &# million in losses even after intensive study the cause remained an "enigma " mr bookstaber writes but he did conclude that declining interest rates were causing the strategy to lose money even though it was designed to be interest rate neutral his findings he says encouraged the new owners of salomon which had just merged with smith barney to close the bond arbitrage unit and liquidate its positions mr bookstaber says as salomon closed out its positions other traders stepped out of the way and liquidity the ease of trading in the underlying markets dried up this he said precipitated ltcms crisis that hedge fund used many of the same strategies as salomon where many of its founders had worked when russias default on its foreign debt in the summer of triggered a plunge in many markets ltcm found it couldnt liquidate except at fire sale prices in parts of the debt markets trading practically halted the fed then organized a private sector bailout of the fund to limit damage to the financial system eric rosenfeld who went to school with mr bookstaber and worked at salomon before leaving to help found ltcm says ltcms problem wasnt complex illiquid strategies but the fact that many firms had similar strategies with similar risk tolerances selling by one triggered selling by others firms need to keep that in mind he said and favor "much more liquid investments and much less leverage " mr bookstaber doubts the ability of regulators or firms own risk managers to prevent disaster he describes how in one traders positions at morgan stanley were revalued with each new trade so to hide a loss the trader avoided making new trades "the firm lost more than &# million by the time someone noticed that the trader hadnt traded for nearly a month " he writes financial markets are like jetliners and nuclear power plants he says they are highly complex systems that require numerous interrelated steps to work together but the "tight coupling" of these steps means when one of them goes wrong the error rapidly ripples through the entire system producing disasters like the valujet crash in or the three mile island nuclear accident in the solution he says is for wall street to strive for less complexity and not trade every instrument that can be dreamed up he admits doing this would require some government oversight even though his book argues that regulation makes things worse by adding to complexity mr bookstabers son david one of two sons who work with him at frontpoint says his father is "not a real evangelizer hes more of an academic" who loves to deconstruct complex situations asked how his father works in an industry about which he has so much foreboding david says "he wont let us develop systems or theories that are too complex "
