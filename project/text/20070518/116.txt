weekend journal the rise of memail re annoying email sign offs katherine rosman on packing the sig with graphics links and logos and why its about to get worse some people bare their souls in love letters others turn to music and poetry then theres the crowd of people who express themselves by affixing bandwidth eating caricatures to their emails hope davis a marketer in athens ala has four different computer generated images of herself which she attaches to her emails depending on her mood when her image is draped on a chaise longue it means shes in "zen mode " if shes suspended in midair on a magic carpet shes feeling "extra crazy " and when shes behind the wheel of a race car shes relaying joy to her friends family and work associates "people can tell what im thinking based on my signature " she says the email signature began innocently with basic contact information and pithy if annoying quotes "its nice to be important but its more important to be nice " but the phenomenon is quickly escalating filling screens with photos links to blogs corporate logos and even promotional videos entrepreneurs are pushing email signature downloads and forging product placement deals with recording artists and clothing companies that want to embed their logos into peoples sig files services like yahoo mail and gmail have updated their systems to more easily accommodate photos and graphics a new generation of sophisticated spam filters can better differentiate between email with embedded graphics and spam on the web site for john edwardss presidential campaign for instance supporters can download a bumper sticker like signature for their emails it shows a photograph of mr edwards in front of an american flag with the message "i support john edwards for president " its the latest attempt to personalize an impersonal medium some compare it to downloading a favorite ring tone to a cellphone while it started with young people and early adopters more adults are embracing the notion of memail meez the service ms davis used to create her digital images or avatars has one million registered users half of whom signed on in the first quarter of moms

to every email a company sends out since it began marketing these videos eight months ago it has produced them for about companies at &# to &# for each one minute clip some new email templates are sophisticated enough to be raising privacy concerns last year the university of nevada football program started using an elaborate email design as a recruiting tool for emails to potential players assistant coach jim mastro has a template that resembles a web site with university insignia photos of players and links to virtual campus tours the university can monitor how often various links are opened by prospective players allowing the recruiters to fine tune their approach some experts on privacy issues say such oversight represents an escalation of information gathering that borders on snooping "its clearly something that would be disturbing to a lot of people if they knew their browsing of the web site was being monitored " says professor joel reidenberg the director of the center on law &amp information policy at fordham university mr mastro says the football program is not infringing on anyones privacy because they dont know specifically which recruit clicks on which link "theres no privacy issue not at all " he says preaching not privacy is an irritant for some recipients rob guglielmetti of boulder colo recently received a message from a colleague capped with an email sig that said "please consider the environment before printing this message " mr guglielmetti is a sustainable design consultant and by trade he is environmentally conscious still he found the sig grating and said so on his blog "what a great idea to follow every email message with a smug self satisfied holier than thou little dig at your own client " he joked he was considering appending to his own email a few similar signatures including "print is murder " and "you are a resource hogging pig " brian lord of franklin tenn views his ever changing email signature as a helpful marketing tool an agent for speakers and entertainers mr lord regularly rotates company supplied email signatures that include the firms logo and photographs of individual agents there are also links to his bio talent list and personal blog from his blog business associates can learn that he doesnt like to shop for light fixtures on saturdays with his wife that he wishes indiana hadnt recently decided to adopt daylight saving time and that he clinched a school contest by properly spelling "nahum" when he was in fourth grade "i had just won what was likely the most dramatic comeback in kokomo christian school spelling bee history " he wrote of his companys blog linked email sig mr lord says "were not the biggest agency but we hopefully are one of the more hip ones " ann mangan a conference producer in framingham mass who is a client of mr lords was compelled to click on the link to his blog "i hadnt realized he was a champion speller " she says some senders get even more personal mike robinson a staff design consultant for ncr in dayton ohio has three different versions of his signature the first two for family correspondence and church related email have links to religious sites and videos his work signature which he calls "more politically correct " is adorned with christian iconography messages like "even when you do not see him god is always there" and a link to a web page that states "revisionists have rewritten history to remove the truth about our countrys christian roots " "my signature hopefully says volumes about who i am " he says his colleagues dont seem to mind the content he adds "were a very open work environment " john hourigan a spokesman for ncr says the company does not police email signatures however it does have a policy prohibiting the use of company resources to "espouse personal political or religious views " he says now a number of companies are betting on the popularity of souped up signatures feedburner revamped a free offering that adds a

more subtle ways to capitalize on sig files are looking to companies like meez the avatar start up users can select a hairstyle and any number of outfits to express their individual style for days that your avatar is feeling frisky you can choose to dress her in low slung pants from which her thong underwear is visible some of the clothing have logos on them reflecting deals meez has cut with companies earlier this year the site forged an agreement with some recording artists now avatars can sport "american idol" runner up katharine mcphees hairstyle or a cent belt buckle in exchange for being able to use cents name and likeness meez promotes his celebrity these signatures can be practical or at least show how plugged in you are david l passmore a professor of work force education and development at penn state fills his sig with every conceivable way to reach him there is his office address and email address a link to his calendar to his personal web site and to his professional web site a number to call to leave "voicemail delivered as email" links to his text over internet protocol a service transmitted over the internet voice over ip and video over ip addresses his instant message addresses gizmo screen name and skype screen name but mr passmore says his students seem indifferent to the profusion of information in his sig "they mostly use the phone and email " he says activists who have relied on the blogosphere to gain viral momentum have begun to turn to email signatures as well ideal bite a company that emails a daily tip on environmental lifestyles to subscribers asked its members march to add a link to their own emails urging recipients to subscribe to the site "you can spread the green word without having to camp in a tree " the tip noted within a few weeks people had forwarded that tip to friends according to ideal bite co founder jen boulden whose email sig links to a video montage of press coverage the company has generated e fan mail the company that designed the university of nevada football templates is pitching similar templates for schools to offer to alumni and sports fans for their personal use says john johnson the companys chief executive with one click recipients will be linked to game ticket sales sites and the web pages of sponsors while an email blast embedded with the same marketing material would probably get caught by most spam filters an individual email sent from one person to a friend or relative is likely to be opened and read "the fan becomes the marketing arm for those sponsors " mr johnson says one issue this creates is mailbox clutter an average text only business email of words takes up nine kilobytes of storage according to proofpoint an email security and research company a small company logo increases the size by to if a company receives emails every day each with a small graphic signature the storage could cost roughly an additional &# to &# a month per email accounts jim gaton who oversees environmental services for a hospital in kettering ohio has already had to cut back several years ago he says "people started calling me superman because i was able to get a lot accomplished " he took to attaching to the bottom of his emails a graphic of superman flying his cape flapping in the wind the hospital now is trying to conserve memory on its servers so in the last year mr gaton stopped using the man of steel on messages sent internally "i decided i should serve as an example " he says he still attaches the image to emails sent outside the hospital however for financial services companies the transmission of personalized signature files is frowned upon earlier this year morgan stanley instituted a standardized signature template that cannot be changed or overwritten "its a new global standard" for all employees a company spokeswoman says some signatures can be avoided though the most recent versions of microsoft office outlook can be set up to filter images depending on your network yahoo mail and gmail both offer an image blocking option photos and graphics arent displayed until a user clicks to view them for some early adopters the novelty didnt last long in when zach klein now was working on internet start up collegehumor com out of a cramped san diego apartment he would link his "office" address in his signature to a google map pinpointing his location since barry dillers interactive corp bought his web site last year hes stopped using a sig altogether iac and dow jones &amp co recently announced they are launching a joint venture personal finance site "now that we are a company of people " mr klein says "i dont feel the need to be so pretentious " mahlen morris of san francisco still likes to put quotations at the bottom of his emails but his system is a little more complex he wrote a program that randomly selects a saying from a database of more than quotes to go at the bottom of his emails among the notable quotables are instructions from a toy manual "to bounce slinky up and down hold a few coils tightly in one hand " mark twain "a banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining but wants it back the minute it begins to rain" and a fortune cookie "&# invested at interest for years will become &# at which time it will be worth absolutely nothing" "only a nerd would do this " he says
