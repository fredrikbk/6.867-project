the magic of stockhausens stimmung many people wouldnt find this very promising six singers sit in a circle and for more than an hour chant the notes of a single chord to be more precise they chant a b flat ninth chord which at least is more tangy than simple b flat but still more than an hour with only one chord theres yet another dimension though that takes this music into the realm of science or metaphysics the singers arent really singing a chord instead theyre intoning a low b flat and six of its overtones overtones being well how can i explain this sing or play any note and nature generates other notes above or around or inside it these are the overtones theyre always present but not always tangibly audible except that the music im talking about makes them audible bringing them front and center they generate the ninth chord but now i fear ive made this music sound more abstract than it really is the piece im talking about is "stimmung " a composition by the lost star of the classical music avant garde karlheinz stockhausen i call him the lost star because in the s and s he and pierre boulez jointly ruled european avant garde composing up through the s the prestigious classical record label deutsche grammophon recorded every note he wrote but then boulez ascended into something like classical music sainthood and mr stockhausen more or less disappeared he wrote a piece that was to be conducted telepathically and another that he said was given to him by beings from another planet later on he launched a series of seven large operas which proved too gigantic a project for the classical music world to swallow finally he took the recordings of his music back from deutsche grammophon and made them available at exalted prices only through his web site which isnt even set up for online sales you have to mail a check to him in germany thus he made himself obscure but his music still can be performed and a new "stimmung" recording by paul hillier and the theatre of voices just released on the harmonia mundi label made me celebrate the man and wish that at age he could have a comeback this is actually the third recording of the piece mr stockhausen himself produced the first in and there was another in by a group called singcircle which shows the music has some life stimmung can mean "tuning " "mood " or "atmosphere " and it is closely tied to stimme the german word for voice im sure not everyone would love the piece but it rested charmed and fascinated me sometimes the sound seems absolutely still but then something happens and the music gets active new things happen all the time thats one reason i found myself listening with such great happiness sometimes the new things are really zany like a voice singing nonsense sounds over and over faster and faster higher and higher till its just a squeak which means that theres more than just the b flat ninth chord rather crazily mr stockhausen asks the singers to intone the "magic names" his words of various gods "ahura mazda " "vishnu " or sometimes the names of the days of the week sometimes they intone mr stockhausens own erotic poetry mostly in german and the overtones do more than just produce the b flat ninth each time they sing any note at all the singers have to produce specific overtones which they do by changing the shape of their mouths this sounds as if theyre singing many vowels a e i o u but with oddball nasal resonance all this isnt as nutty as it sounds these instructions generate the new things that keep on happening which in fact the singers choose completely on their own all mr stockhausen provides are possibilities and an overall scheme in which he divides the music into sections and tells the singers which of them sing in each and which one takes the lead so each performance has a lot of spontaneity the best of the three recordings i think is the stockhausen original where the singers sound most relaxed and most at ease with the overtones which with quiet rainbow resonance hover all around the notes they sing but the newest version also drew me in id avoid the performance which sounds too peppy and not spiritual enough what can you do with this music you might quite seriously try lowering the lights and even burning incense while you listen "stimmung" works for meditation but you could also listen more objectively perhaps with headphones with the same delight and concentration that youd bring to an absorbing book as the music peacefully unfolds youll never guess whats coming next but i think youll always be satisfied mr sandow a composer is writing a book on the future of classical music
