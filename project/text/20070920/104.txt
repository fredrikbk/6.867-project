potential effects including making imports pricier and raising risks of inflation while also making it easier for american companies to sell overseas cibc world markets analysts say the dollars

demand for the dollar denominated assets which would be u s dollar bearish " likewise bnp paribas analysts divined more weakness against european currencies and noted that "the u s dollar index risks breaking its historical low which would intensify the bearish u s dollar tone " the global head of currency research at lehman brothers in london jim mccormick agrees saying "one thing that should be
