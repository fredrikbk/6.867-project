readback studying arts and sciences in c p snows the masters online edition "there is nothing so suspenseful as an academic committee " c p snow once said a claim that sounds preposterous until youve read his novel "the masters " while reading it last week i did something i havent done in years i skipped to the end to see what happened then went back for the rest in synopsis the plot of "the masters" could hardly sound duller at a college very much like one in cambridge in the late s the chief executive the master is dying and the colleges fellows must elect a new one two of the fellows badly want the job the rest divide their support more or less equally in the months leading up to the election rumors circulate lies and threats are exchanged confidences are broken alliances wax and wane its all very much like any modern organization whose top management is in transition except that mr snows characters often sip sherry while they do their office politicking the narrator lewis eliot strongly supports paul jagos candidacy but is young and detached enough to know that his own fortunes will be largely unaffected by the outcome that allows him to study his colleagues tribal behavior as an anthropologist might "it was one of the odd features of a college i sometimes thought that one lived in social intimacy with men one disliked and more than that there were times when a fraction of ones future lay in their hands " patiently and succinctly eliot dissects the machinations and motives of each of the electors one fellow "possessed the knack of losing his temper at the right moment which made him more effective in committee " another who had "saved money for the college like a french peasant " had "the knack of investing any cliche with solemn weight " underlying the rivalry between jago and his rival thomas crawford is the growing tension between the arts and sciences in english universities jago is a humanist wary of scientists audacious claims crawfords scientific gaze is trained confidently on the future a large bequest to the college earmarked for scholars of science hints at future financial blessings if crawford is elected mr snow himself initially trained as a physicist but "being a fairly competitive chap " he later confessed "i dropped physics for a brutally simple reason i was not good enough " he began writing novels and for many years was a fellow at christs college in cambridge in mr snow gave a controversial lecture entitled "the two cultures " lamenting the growing rift between scholars of humanities and science "the masters" is the fourth in mr snows series of novels known collectively as "strangers and brothers " the series follows lewis eliot from boyhood through middle age shadowing mr snows own career charles percy snow was born to working class parents but in he was knighted and he became a baron in he served in high offices of the british government for many years his admirers called him a "pantocratic sage" his critics said he was "so well rounded as to be almost spherical " he died in at the age of by todays high octane standards very little happens in "the masters " its like an old fashioned edition of "seinfeld " one chapter is titled "jago walks round the court " and another is "crawford behaves sensibly " the characters wounds though painful are psychological but the backdrop of cerebral good manners makes the mens hypocrisy and malice seem almost violent yet mr snow cherished his years as a cambridge fellow like many others he found in the academy the solution to one of lifes greatest challenges men entered the academic life in the years between the two world wars mr snow wrote "because with a maximum of comfort it settled their consciences and let them feel that their lives were not utterly without a use "
