high scores matter to game makers too santa monica calif movies have roger ebert wine has robert parker videogames have marc doyle mr doyle edits game reviews for metacritic a web site he co founded that can influence the sales of games and the stocks of videogame publishers one company requires game publishers to pay higher royalties if they receive low scores on such sites but unlike conventional critics mr doyle rarely plays videogames and instead spends more time strumming his banjo he has little interest in mingling with game makers in may he didnt join other game reviewers in previewing new titles at e a major computer and videogame trade show even though the event took place a few blocks from his house "im not the star of the show " says mr doyle yet in many videogame circles the system he helped to create is metacritic compiles game reviews from more than publications and then averages them into a single score on a to scale to help consumers make smarter purchases the site also reviews movies music and other forms of entertainment but such review sites hold the most sway in the videogame industry partly because the stakes are higher for consumers shelling out &# to &# for a new game than they are for someone buying for example a &# movie ticket some game companies now tie bonuses for their developers to game scores on such sites while the stocks of game publishers can fall when a new title gets a disappointing score "everyone wants to make that game that gets a score of plus " says jim ward president of lucasarts the games division of lucasfilm ltd in san francisco game publisher activision inc two years ago began using scores from a site called game rankings to determine part of its bonus compensation for employees in order to spur its game making teams to create better products take two interactive software inc has a similar policy for makers of its sports videogames metacritic and game rankings are both owned by cnet networks inc game rankings unlike metacritic focuses only on games about months ago activision also conducted a study of games made for sony corp s playstation console and found a strong correlation between some high game scores and strong sales activision chief executive robert kotick says the link was especially notable for games that score above on game rankings which grades games on a to percentage basis with being a perfect score for every five percentage points above activision found sales of a game roughly doubled activision believes game scores among other factors can actually influence sales not just reflect their quality because metacritic and game rankings typically post scores quickly after a game debuts and before any sales data are publicly available wall street is also paying attention to them on a friday in early may activisions spider man a game based on the movie of the same name hit store shelves to generally mediocre reviews metacritic gave the playstation version of the game a compared with an for spider man for the same console by the following monday several financial analysts had noted spider man s low scores as a possible concern for activision the santa monica calif companys shares dropped that day and continued sliding for the remainder of that week in august shares of take two soared nearly the week after its new game bioshock got a nearly perfect metacritic score a it has since fallen to as more reviews were included in its average all of this makes metacritics mr doyle an unlikely kingmaker in the &# billion u s games industry he controls metacritics scoring system deciding which publications to compile reviews from a varied list that includes trade magazines like gameinformer the new york times a gamer web site called fourfatchicks com and other outlets mr doyle who graduated from the university of southern california law school launched metacritic on the web in january with his sister julie doyle roberts and jason dietz a law school classmate mr doyle says he realized then that the internet was well suited for providing a composite of reviews minimizing the impact of individual critics idiosyncratic tastes another site rotten tomatoes now owned by news corp was already compiling movie reviews but mr doyle and his partners saw an opportunity to cover a broader range of media the trio sold the site to cnet two years ago for an undisclosed sum mr doyle is now a senior product manager at cnet but he also acts as games editor of metacritic these days publishers frequently plead with mr doyle to exclude reviews they deem unfair from metacritic scores some have argued that reviews in british publications are biased against american football videogames he says but once he has included a publication in the metacritic system mr doyle says he refuses to omit any individual reviews based on such complaints the sites scores are weighted averages in which mr doyle assigns more significance to the reviews of certain publications based on their stature its a formula he declines to disclose calling it metacritics "secret sauce " metacritics method for calculating scores is a sore spot with some game reviewers while many game publications give numerical scores on point scales some assign letter grades like those that students receive in school in such cases mr doyle converts a grades to a score of and fs to a score of zero even though some reviewers believe fs should be closer to a score of in cases where there are no scores the reviewer will sometimes independently send a score to mr doyle that he or she thinks is a fair representation of the review "we give metacritics funhouse mirror conversion scheme an f+ " joe dodson a former editor at review site game revolution wrote in an essay last year criticizing metacritic and similar sites mr dodsons main beef was that metacritics conversion system for letter grades turns game revolutions reviews into scores that are too low metacritics scores arent always on the mark as a sales predictor thats especially true with games based on movies where a well loved well marketed film can lift sales of even games most critics dislike despite relatively poor scores analysts believe activisions spider man game will likely closely match the more than four million copies sold of spider man in the u s and far outsell the first game in the series yet many executives say theres at least an indirect link between game sales and scores much of the games business is now oriented around "franchises" concepts that can indefinitely produce sequels and spinoff titles and savage game scores can hurt the long term sales potential of such a franchise executives say "the first version of a game might sell ok " says neil young general manager at electronic arts inc the worlds biggest games publisher "now when you think about doing a second version of a product youve got an uphill battle " three years ago time warner inc s warner bros unhappy with the quality of some games based on warner movies decided to take action jason hall then the head of warners game efforts began including "quality metrics" in the contracts the studio signed with partners interested in licensing warner movies for games if game publishers dont deliver products that receive specified scores or better from metacritic game rankings or other sites some deals require game publishers to pay higher royalties on game sales to warner than they would have for better scored games a spokeswoman for warner says its too early to determine how much the studios policy is affecting overall game quality mr doyle who was once an avid gamer may soon get reacquainted with the games he has largely stopped playing he says he is tempted by a wave of new games coming out for the holidays and may buy one of the latest game consoles to play them he wont say which ones corrections &amp amplifications the e videogame trade show took place in july a marketplace article yesterday incorrectly said it took place in may wsj sept
