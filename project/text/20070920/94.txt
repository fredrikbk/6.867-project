style on style sponsorship that befits a jeweled timepiece how luxury watchmakers woo patrons of high culture the cachet of marie antoinette when the curtain rises on the los angeles philharmonic in two weeks a giant logo of breguet watches will be projected onto the wavy steel walls of the walt disney concert hall visible from afar in addition to an evening of opera diva renee fleming performing berlioz and puccini patrons will be treated to a gala dinner complete with breguet blue stemware and a collection of rare timepieces from the swiss watchmaker some of which have never been seen in the u s while big watch brands like omega and rolex scour the planet for sports stars and actors to serve as their "ambassadors " the rivalry among limited production super luxury watches is taking a different tack rather than seeking celebrity endorsements breguet and its primary competitors including patek philippe and vacheron constantin are positioning themselves as icons of high culture breguet has paid a substantial sum of money to be the official timepiece of the los angeles philharmonic both sides of the deal decline to say how much but it was enough that the orchestra has agreed not to seek any other corporate sponsors it was also enough to bust breguets normal marketing budget the watch brand had to seek special dispensation from nicholas hayek sr chairman of swatch group ltd breguets parent company in these heady days of a luxury watch boom the companies are seeking new customers at art museum functions fund raising societies for operas and orchestras and other charities many of whom have rarely before received this lavish level of attention from corporate sponsors these watchmakers face a particular challenge how to generate buzz among determinedly un buzz able clients "its a very refined cultured clientele " says joe thompson editor in chief of the watch connoisseur magazine "watch time " though theyre unlikely to garner mentions in "entertainment weekly" or gossip columns these high culture relationships afford the watchmakers entree into a certain social milieu breguet for instance will place salespeople in the los angeles philharmonics "green room" a room that is made available during performance intermissions for big donors to mingle and nibble on hors doeuvres "breguet has a consumer base that is very compatible with a number of our patrons " says deborah borda president and chief executive of the los angeles philharmonic vacheron last march became a sponsor of the paris national opera backing performances of puccinis tosca at the opera bastille vacheron also sponsors the barbier mueller museum a repository of primitive arts in geneva and last year it presented a collection of its watches at a beverly hills fund raiser for the fight against a deadly skin disease in fact just days after breguet locked up the los angeles philharmonic earlier this year a representative of vacheron called the orchestras development office to see if the organization had a watch sponsor vacheron quickly declined to proceed when it heard that its rival was already involved says the philharmonic executive who took the call a vacheron spokeswoman this week said she was unaware of any plans for a los angeles philharmonic marketing effort patek philippe a private family owned company that is the clear sales leader of these watch making rivals thanks to a long relationship with tiffany shuns celebrity advertisements it instead impresses the concept of pedigree with its slogan "you never actually own a patek philippe you merely look after it for the next generation " the watchmaker also sponsors esplanade an arts center in singapore in addition to backing the los angeles philharmonic breguet is paying for a renovation of le petit trianon the chateau on the grounds of the palace of versailles outside paris that was the retreat of one of a l breguets early clients marie antoinette "theres no sponsoring a car or golf
