home &amp family cranky consumer taking the fuss out of meal planning web services offer recipes shopping lists for a week from comfort food to curry so maybe rachael ray doesnt have the market cornered when it comes to the minute meal a number of web based subscription services are now offering their own version of quick and easy meal planning by providing a weeks worth of recipes replete with a shopping list their target market time starved parents who want to put a satisfying and nutritional dinner on the table without using the same few tried and true meals every week in denver mothers karen hutcherson and ann bender founded relish www relishrelish com a cooking site with subscribers who pay &# a month each for a weekly slate of recipes aviva goldfarb a chevy chase md mother and entrepreneur has a &# a year recipe subscription site the six oclock scramble www thescramble com major players have entered the arena as well this year meredith corp s better homes and gardens magazine launched dinner time a weekly meal planning service www bhg com dinnertime with a quarterly fee of &# to see how useful the services are we signed up for five some of which let us specify preferences say low fat or no liver please we tested two recipes from each and let our family be the judge as to whether that "yummi yummi mahi mahi" dish among others was as "remarkably delicious" as promised while the services dont all promise the minute ideal offered by television personality rachael ray most of their recipes keep your time in the kitchen relatively fuss free by using canned or prepared ingredients or emphasizing one dish meals but even when the recipes make claims of speediness they dont realistically account for the fact that much of the prep work chopping onions peeling garlic takes time this is the same criticism thats often leveled at rachael ray the services deliver their recipes via email and or post them to their site some give subscribers lots of customization options and go beyond dinner to include brunch dessert and side dish recipes others stick to a weeks worth of straightforward suppers and some also maintain an archive of past recipes what really distinguishes the services is their varied approach to food from a more contemporary world cuisine aesthetic to an almost retro casserole oriented style dine without whine a subscription service &# a month started by christine steendahl a mother and web site developer in milford ill falls on the homey end of the spectrum the recipes seven dinners in all plus a few brunch and dessert options emphasize such comfort food classics as meatloaf and macaroni and cheese along with sometimes slightly exotic fare grilled caribbean chicken our family found the food on the heavy side lots of dishes call for butter milk or cheese and you cant customize the plan ms steendahl notes lighter and vegetarian menus and other resources are available with her companion menu planning central service www menuplanningcentral com which charges &# a month with better homes and gardens dinner time service you can pick from two weekly plans "quick &amp easy meals" and "lighter meals " each with five dinner recipes and a dessert or snack if you want the flexibility to mix and match however youll need to subscribe to both plans but at least the site archives its weekly plans the shopping lists are among the best designed of all the services organized in such categories as "fruits &amp vegetables" and "dairy " as for the food its in a from the heartland ho hum vein with a quick &amp easy meals plan featuring pasta pizza and pork chops a spokesman confirmed the recipes favor traditional fare but noted the dishes usually have a "twist " the relish and six oclock scramble services offer slightly more sophisticated dining while still stressing speedy cooking times and relatively uncomplicated preparations the six oclock scramble features five recipes a week with no customization or archive feature though the site will be expanding in the coming month on the positive side the scrambles recipes incorporate lots of nonprocessed ingredients the yummi yummi mahi mahi or in our case yummi yummi chicken as the dish allows for a substitution uses fresh tomatoes and parsley on the negative the dishes may put off finicky eaters not every kid likes curry for example and they occasionally feature a harder to find ingredient such as a chipotle salsa ms goldfarb said the recipes have been tested by families to gauge their appeal she also noted that users can always "substitute like crazy " relish provides enough choices to put users in control without overwhelming them each week you can pick five out of meal possibilities from vegetarian to kid friendly to "simple gourmet " or go with the "express menu" of five preset dinners the recipes are flavorful and full of smart ideas the menus which can be customized depending on the size of your family are supplemented with lists of recipes broken into categories ranging from desserts to dinner party meals finally if choice and flexibility are your priorities meal mixer created by the ann arbor mich husband and wife team of russell and marianne blaesing has that in abundance subscribers receive a complete weekly plan breakfast lunch and dinner customized to both dietary concerns be they avoiding allergens or losing weight and taste preferences the service requires you answer lots of questions heres where we noted our distaste for liver and then stay on top of things weekly if you want to tweak the suggested menus as a result meal mixer is more like a recipe databank with thousands of possibilities than a homey one harried parent to another plan mr blaesing said the company will be adding some more user friendly options and because its recipes are all over the map from basic grilled dishes to elaborate roasts some of them do take time meal mixer suggested two dinners that turned out to be among our favorites a nicoise pasta salad with tuna beans and kalamata olives and a spanish roast beef with an unexpected flavor boost from semisweet chocolate as for doing the dishes were still waiting for a service to solve that problem email cranky wsj com service web site price relish relishrelish com &# a month with a three month minimum free trial available features weekly plan with five dinner
