a democrat proposes social security reform caution is advised in democrats and republicans had the rare opportunity to work together to forge a bipartisan solution to the generational crisis facing social security president bush proposed a reform plan and republicans came to the table in good faith yet only two democrats florida reps allen boyd and robert wexler stepped forward to find a solution all other democrats chose to play politics rather than save social security it turned out to be a gigantic missed opportunity so it was interesting to see my colleague rep rahm emanuel d ill in his sept editorial page commentary "supplementing social security " proposing a personal account plan that "would supplement social security " he concedes that "an accounts based system that supplements not supplants social security can work " its an idea we have heard before one championed and pioneered by the respected former rep clay shaw r fla yet rep emanuel conveniently ignores the role he played in as chairman of the house democrats campaign committee leading a well funded attack machine to falsify rep shaws record on social security and demagogue his plan for supplemental accounts the palm beach post reported that rep emanuels democrats spent "more than a year blasting shaws proposal for optional personal accounts to supplement social security " cash flush labor backed democrat allies did their part by flooding the airwaves with attacks against a similar approach that rep emanuel now advocates rep emanuels commentary proves democrats cannot fool all the people all the time but it sure shows they are going to try remember this next time you hear democrats pat themselves on the back for "fiscal responsibility " "tax relief " or "earmark reform " buyer beware rep adam putnam r fla chairman house republican conference washington rep emanuel proposes long overdue policies to promote universal savings for retirement as a precursor to social security reform in considering his proposals we should also recognize how social security may have contributed to low savings behavior i would suggest we go one further by removing or significantly raising the arbitrary limits on contributions to tax deferred retirement plans more and more citizens choose careers and lifestyles outside the standard employment model and their incomes may vary widely from year to year why do we limit their contributions to future financial security as if everyone has the same income path if mr emanuel will step back he will see that this choice in the much larger sense of ones life choices is never trumped by simplicity liberty and the pursuit of happiness has a infinite number of interpretations and our policies should empower those choices not limit them michael harrington ph d los angeles rep emanuel wants middle class americans to save more for their retirement and suggests the government should help while this all sounds well and good one has to consider that the democratic party has traditionally punished americans for working and saving more consider that there are many in the party today who are calling for "means" testing social security benefits in order to save the program what this means is that for every dollar of savings a worker accumulates for investment income he cold lose up to cents in social security benefits essentially this amounts to an tax on savings if americans are to save more today they need to be assured that they will not be punished for it in the future unfortunately for rep emanuel he is in the wrong political party to make his recommendations believable steve walde easton conn rep emanuel should be congratulated for highlighting the need to improve retirement savings in his commentary its a vitally important issue that too often is ignored as mr emanuel points out the automatic k enrollment provision of pension protection act of has been a tremendous success he wrongly asserts however that this was a democratic idea offered as an alternative to republican approaches in fact the idea was bipartisan generating from the joint efforts of the national center for policy analysis ncpa and the brookings institution we were delighted to have mr emanuels support but he was not alone john c goodman ph d president national center for policy analysis dallas
