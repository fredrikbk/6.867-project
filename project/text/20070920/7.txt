a developer finds new porpoise in life a very big aquarium james jacoby built malls now owns marineland nellie the dolphin grows old marineland fla nellie the dolphin has seen a lot in the years she has spent in the concrete sea water tanks of marineland park where she was born in said to be the oldest dolphin living in captivity she has reached twice the normal life span of her atlantic bottlenose species marineland itself hasnt fared that well a once booming movie studio and tourist attraction on floridas northeast coast it was bypassed by the interstate eclipsed by walt disney world and orlandos other megaparks it fell on hard times by the s after a succession of owners marineland was trading in the down market kitsch of a fifth rate attraction one highlight featured nellie towing a little dog named killer on a boogie board now nellie has a new lease on life thanks to her new owner a year old shopping center developer named james jacoby he believes he can restore marinelands former glory mr jacoby by his own account made more than &# million over several decades clearing land to build supermarkets strip malls and nearly wal mart stores throughout the south he has since become a convert to "green" development and wants to make marineland a showcase for his newfound eco friendly business principles since mr jacoby who is fascinated with aquatic life has spent more than &# million buying the park and beginning to rebuild its aging aquariums and dolphin pools the parks stadiumlike arena was replaced by the pools of a "dolphin conservation center " visitors can swim with nellie and other dolphins and learn about dolphin training a marine research facility is operated across the street by the university of florida and mr jacoby hopes to build a veterinary teaching hospital since he is also planning condominiums ecologists and some locals think they see a shark in the water from its founding in until well into the s marineland was a stop for millions of southbound travelers on floridas sunny scenic oceanside aa highway parts of the movie "revenge of the creature" were filmed there marinelands immense pools with hundreds of portholes around them allowed camera crews and visitors to see dolphins manta rays and sea turtles cavort underwater and were a model for todays walk around aquariums but advances in underwater photography ended marinelands business as a movie studio and tourists abandoned it for newer florida resorts by the s and after a succession of owners "it was all pretty rundown " says biologist kevin roberts marinelands curator of marine mammals a college dropout mr jacoby spent his boyhood on the florida coast near miami swimming and watching marine life on outings with his father he began his business career peddling towels t shirts and other beachwear to miami retailers he moved to atlanta in on the advice of a friend who had begun to dabble in georgia real estate mr jacoby bought and sold parcels in atlantas rapidly growing outskirts he began building suburban retail complexes one of which was going up when wal mart stores inc founder sam walton drove past it while scouting store locations in wal mart negotiated for space in the complex sparking a relationship with mr jacoby that ballooned along with the retailing giant a personal crisis caused him to take a particular interest in dolphins in a few months after she was born his daughter julie began suffering from a seizure disorder looking for ways to help her mr jacoby began looking into "dolphin therapy " which is believed by some to help sick or disabled people via interaction with the marine mammals and the relaxing effects of warm water he remembered his childhood visits to marineland mr jacoby feels that the therapy has helped by after a state trust purchased the land as part of marinelands bankruptcy proceedings mr jacoby bought nearly acres including the park for &# million plus a commitment to tear down two aging hotels the purchase also gave him significant sway over the incorporated town of marineland a legally recognized florida municipality with a population of six its boundaries surround the park the university laboratory and a milelong stretch of coastline and woodland mr jacoby occasionally lives in a trailer across the street from the park gift shop at first mr jacoby charmed the neighbors even before he bought marineland he bought food for the dolphins and invested in temporary upkeep of the park once he had control of the property he organized public planning sessions and promised to renovate the attraction and build nature trails through the surrounding marshland and estuaries ecological housing using energy efficient cooling and plumbing systems would replace the demolished hotels and lure longer term visitors best of all he said he would do all this within the limits of an existing land use plan which sought to maintain marinelands oceanfront as one of the few strips of atlantic coastline in florida that have not been overbuilt but mr jacoby upset some of his allies in mr jacoby began selling the bulk of the land outside the park to mass market home builder centex corp for &# million the developers then proceeded to lobby marinelands three person town commission including one of mr jacobys employees to allow them to build more than condominiums "man we got hustled " says pat hamilton a real estate broker based in nearby st augustine much of whose work including marinelands bankruptcy sale to the state involved selling land to the government for conservation purposes a supporter of mr jacobys initial plans mr hamilton later led a group of locals and the florida wildlife federation through a series of ultimately unsuccessful court challenges to the planned development mr jacoby says the development will all be in areas where marineland buildings already stood zoning restrictions remain tighter there than elsewhere along the coast he maintains most importantly mr jacoby says the plan is a practical recognition that for marineland to be restored like most of his recent "eco friendly" projects it has to be part of a commercially viable enterprise among those projects is mr jacobys high rise atlanta office overlooking the concrete sprawl of the city it sits atop atlantic station a &# billion redevelopment of contaminated land around an inner city steel mill site the area now decontaminated today is a bustling retail office and housing development in addition to real estate staff he employs engineers who recently won contracts to convert the garbage and gases at two southern landfills into energy he hired teya ryan a former executive vice president at cnn to revive "marine studios" and produce a series of oceangoing television documentaries the first of which tracks whale sharks marine studios has signed up two grandchildren of the late french ocean explorer jacques cousteau to host some of its films "im trying to connect the dots between all these projects " says mr jacoby still reviving marineland is taking longer than mr jacoby had hoped centex rattled by the current mortgage crisis says it has postponed plans to build and might sell the land to another developer mr jacoby figures the land could end up being sold back to state preservation officials marinelands bottlenoses have successfully reproduced and frolic in new saltwater pools two young year olds including phebe named for mr jacobys mother swim alongside the older dolphins marineland is also home to veterans like lilly champagne a scarred year old female dolphin named for her rare golden brown skin she came to the park in with a shark bite across her eye instead of leaping through hoops and playing basketball the dolphins these days swim with park visitors who pay as much as &# for the pleasure while trainers explain dolphin behavior no longer confined to bleachers guests don life jackets and scuba masks to watch the animals "were going from rodeo to research " says billy hurley a marine biologist who is now the parks general manager "theres a lot to learn once you take the p t barnum element away from it "
