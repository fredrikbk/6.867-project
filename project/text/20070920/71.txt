no trophy structures and better for it berlin tomorrow germany will take a step closer to achieving what its failed to do in the past years the foundation for prussian culture and the british architect david chipperfield will top off the roof of the neues museum an structure on museum island in the center of berlin that had been built to hold king frederick wilhelm ivs collections of prehistoric and ethnographic objects and been closed since british bombs damaged it during world war ii it reopens to the public in the neues museums roof inspired by an plan by karl friedrich schinkel for a palace on the acropolis is at the center of an ambitious project begun in to rebuild the cluster of museums in berlins historical center and turn the island into the citys principal tourist site another years are left before the marathon billion euro &# billion undertaking will be finished in a master plan conceived and then revised by mr chipperfield and his clients museum islands ensemble will be ringed with columns evoking classic greek forms and a golden age associated with schinkel and his pupils there will be a new entrance building by mr chipperfield in the same style a new paintings gallery linked to the island by a bridge and a reconstruction of the th century berlin castle by architects yet to be chosen will follow berlin is haunted by architectural symbols like it or not albert speer whom hitler appointed to remake the capital on an elephantine scale is as familiar a name in german architecture as mies van de rohe walter gropius or any living german architect after speer was imprisoned with hitlers defeat the citys symbol for much of the cold war was the berlin wall not the ideal logo for the tourist board mr chipperfields plan reveals how much berlin and germany have moved beyond the days when the prospect of more than three columns in a row would conjure up memories of national socialism a fear that bordered on paranoia until recently and it reflects the berlin publics aversion to "modernizing" the look of museum island whether by mr chipperfield or by frank gehry whose master plan proposal was turned down in the original competition now public opinion is a crucial part of museum islands plans since the citys museums are asked to bear more of their own costs than in previous years mr chipperfields columns are stick thin helping to avoid any charges that hes bringing a new monumentalism to the german capital the fact that the architect is british working with an international team also pre empts slurs of creeping nationalism although the tabloid bild zeitung deplored the prospect of the british rebuilding what britain destroyed moreover mr chipperfields colonnaded enclosures for the western side of the island are open frames echoing the motif of transparency that germans have belabored since they started rebuilding after world war ii lest anyone accuse them of constructing fortresses or plotting out of public sight huge glass facades that reveal activities inside are a cliche in berlins new official buildings bombs destroyed more than of the neues museum designed by schinkels pupil friedrich august stuler rain through the open roof and stop gap east german conservation made renovation even more difficult a rehab scheduled for was shelved with reunification mr chipperfields plan leaves the interior whenever possible as a ruin "restored much as a damaged work of art would be " said project architect martin reichert so for example only remnants of the museums murals can be seen none are on the walls of the grand main gallery pieces from a series there that depicted the span of history from creation to the protestant reformation are in a box in the basement accompanied by mr reichert i am allowed to tour the interior of the neues museum here mr chipperfields decision to rebuild the structure while keeping the war wounds visible seems reasonable although critics have called it timid the building speaks very well for itself the lyrical murals from the mid th century are intact enough to create a dreamy elegiac atmosphere up a ceremonial staircase a grand gallery for the egyptian collection which includes the head of nefertiti rises to a dramatic height of feet besides egyptian objects part of berlins prehistoric collections some are still held by russia will be exhibited in the museums colonnaded galleries mr chipperfield continues the colonnade motif along the riverbank and in his new neo classical entry building the james simon gallery named for a jewish businessman and philanthropist who lived from and supported museums and other charities mr chipperfields first design selected in was a slab of satinized glass and bronze but he was later asked for a redesign which was unveiled in june the new "temple architecture " says peter klaus schuler director of the state museums of berlin "was a consensus " at long last museum island is attracting crowds attendance rose from some two million in to about five million last year making the ensemble the most visited destination in berlin the pergamons jaw dropping hellenistic altar and ishtar gate from mesopotamia account for much of that traffic but so do a room of paintings by caspar david friedrich in the national gallery and sculpture galleries at the renovated bode museum which reopened last november with renaissance and medieval works that had been packed away in storage still private support of berlins museums remains below its levels in the years before world war i museum island seems to be looking back to that era in its careful renovation with attention to historical detail and a rejection of the trophy structures that have turned berlins boulevards into an exposition park the neues museum will no doubt draw the ire of critics seeking novelty and grandeur but given what the buildings of the island have been through with more than a decade of work to come that dissatisfaction wont be hard for mr chipperfield and his clients to shrug off mr darcy is a correspondent for the art newspaper london
