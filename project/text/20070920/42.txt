french revolution unveiling his domestic reform agenda in paris tuesday nicolas sarkozy called for "a new social contract" for france his proposed revision of french socialist tradition going back to jean jacques rousseau is nothing short of revolutionary his ability to deliver will make or break his presidency true to character mr sarkozy came out swinging the new president declared that frances generous welfare state is "unjust" and "financially untenable " "discourages work and job creation " and "fails to bring equal opportunity " the result frances jobless rate is the euro zones highest the president wants "a new social contract founded on work merit and equal opportunity " he promised to loosen restrictions on working hours and toughen up requirements for jobless benefits to ease hiring and firing rules and reduce incentives to retire early cautious optimism is in order over the summer his new government moved gingerly an autonomy plan for universities was watered down a law assuring minimum transport services during strikes intended to weaken the unions was as well on the plus side wealth and income taxes were cut and the inheritance tax abolished fine but considering his strong mandate and dominance of parliament mr sarkozy didnt overachieve the details of this weeks proposals are sketchy but provide a foundation to build on echoing a frequent promise the president said the law mandating a maximum hour work week ought to be further relaxed to let the french perish the thought "choose work over leisure " inexplicably however mr sarkozy refrained from pulling the plug on a law thats come to symbolize frances slothful ways he showed more political courage in calling for an end to state guaranteed job security at private firms such legal protections discourage companies from hiring new employees and spur outsourcing he also took on the most coddled insiders of all public sector workers state employees retire earlier with full and often better benefits than the rest of the population which picks up the tab train conductors legally stop work at age thanks to a rule dating from when they still shoveled coal into engines scaling back these benefits invites confrontation with the most powerful constituency against change in france public sector unions in when jacques chirac tried something similar strikes brought the country to a standstill but this isnt and unlike mr chirac mr sarkozy won an electoral mandate for change in a opinion way ajis poll published tuesday of the french support mr sarkozys social policy with opposed as for the vaunted "french social model " a bare wants to "preserve it as is " one of the biggest threats to mr sarkozys revolution may yet be from mr sarkozy himself in his first four months in office the president has revealed a populist streak he browbeats the european central bank to lower interest rates and sticks his nose into big business such interventionism harks back to old style french economic management and is out of tune with the approach outlined yesterday mr sarkozys long awaited speech sets the stage for the most important political battle in his first term whatever the president does in the next five years he cant claim to have succeeded unless france breaks out of its economic slumber his equally ambitious foreign policy depends on it too the presidents prescriptions for the ailing french welfare state are hard to argue with now if only mr sarkozy will apply them
