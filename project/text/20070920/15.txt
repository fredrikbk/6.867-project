bill raising fdas powers nears passage washington congress moved closer to passing a final version of a bill that would give the food and drug administration new power to restrict medications that raise safety concerns in what would be the biggest expansion of the agencys authority in a decade the bill which was overwhelmingly passed by the house yesterday would bolster the fdas authority over drugs once they are released on the market the fdas control over that area isnt always clearly delineated the agency sometimes has had to negotiate with companies to get the concessions it seeks often using leverage only before it grants approval for a new drug or the indirect threat of taking its concerns public under the bill the fda would be able to take various actions if it believes a drug carries a potential safety concern including the ability to require new studies limit distribution or order label changes the fda would also be required to monitor drugs after they go on the market and the agency would get new funding for that job the bill would also force companies to make public some of the results from their studies the senate is expected to take up the final bill today some republican lawmakers have objected to provisions related to drug industry liability the senate faces pressure to pass the measure because it also renews funding for the agency that otherwise runs out at the end of the month the agency has threatened to warn employees about potential layoffs if a bill doesnt pass by tomorrow the house and the senate both passed previous versions of the legislation which is built around a five year renewal of user fees the fda charges drug and medical device makers lawmakers have been negotiating to craft a compromise bill but talks between the house and senate went slowly partly because of the liability issue the final bill includes a provision backed by house democrats that could weaken a key legal defense that pharmaceutical companies have used in plaintiff suits the debate centered on the question of drug companies protection against plaintiffs claiming that they were injured by medicines the bush administration has backed the idea that fda approved drug labels pre empt state law pharmaceutical makers have used that as a shield in legal cases arguing that they werent required to warn consumers about a potential risk if the fda determined that the safety issue didnt warrant inclusion in the label the new fda bill that passed the house includes language that could limit that protection by saying that drug companies have a responsibility to maintain their labels thus leaving the manufacturers potentially liable if they fail to make changes even without the fdas explicit approval language backed by senate republicans and the drug industry would have likely strengthened the industrys legal shield but house democrats fought for their version and eventually moved forward with it that was a victory for plaintiffs attorneys who sharply opposed the administrations stance gerie voss regulatory counsel for the american association for justice said it supported the house language because it is "still putting the onus on the drug companies to let the public know when there is a potential drug hazard " since the bush administration put its pre emption policy into regulation in february drug companies have used it in more than two dozen cases with split results there have been about a dozen rulings in favor of pre emption and a dozen against the first circuit court is expected to address the issue in december drug companies notched some wins in the negotiations they won a lower cap on fines the fda could charge companies than was included in the original house bill they also received a provision granting additional six months of exclusive marketing for any drug that is studied for its effectiveness in children pfizer inc lobbyist dolly judge said the company is pleased with the bill "i think this will increase fdas regulatory authority and hopefully restore peoples confidence in the agency and kind of give fda a bigger hammer " she said pfizer is less comfortable with the portion related to lawsuits she said but she didnt expect to have an opportunity to change that as the bill moves through the senate the house voted for the compromise
