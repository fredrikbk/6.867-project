world economy in flux as america downshifts huge trade gap narrows as dollar housing slide exporting lobster traps for years economists have warned that the u s cant run up endless charges on the national credit card to cover its huge appetite for imported cars oil electronics and other goods someday they said the bill will come due it looks like someday may have finally arrived after years during which the u s mainly borrowed and bought while much of the rest of the world lent and sold the global economy appears to be undergoing a fundamental shift american exporters are finding eager overseas markets for their products u s consumers are beginning to temper their free spending ways as the housing boom turns to bust china the middle east central europe and africa are absorbing more of the worlds imports the result instead of depending as heavily on the u s for demand the world economy could become more evenly balanced in the background is a u s dollar that has grown weaker against the euro british pound and many other currencies the euro hit &# this month the strongest it has been since its birth in a j p morgan index comparing the dollar to a basket of currencies weighted by their importance to u s trade is now hovering around a low not seen in more than years a decline given a shove by this weeks federal reserve move to cut interest rates all of this could well add up to a major readjustment of the u s trade deficit which began in and has ballooned to a level that would have seemed unimaginable not long ago the broadest measure of the trade gap known as the current account deficit at the end of hit an all time record of of the gross domestic product the value of all goods and services produced in the u s during the second quarter of this year it was down to that might just be the start "were definitely poised to have some significant rebalancing" of trade says harvard university economist kenneth rogoff a former chief economist for the international monetary fund he had been expecting the account deficit to shrink "by maybe half a percentage point of gdp over the next twelve months now it seems likely it will go down by percentage points " and he adds "we could see something more rapid " something "more rapid" could be painful since americans have financed their prosperity with borrowed money reversing that habit means a period of living less opulently if foreign money turns scarce and the trade deficit narrows suddenly americans could face a tumbling dollar soaring interest rates and an economic downturn that could send shock waves back through europe and asia if their own consumers dont make up for lost demand from the u s the worlds largest national economy if it happens more gradually the recent run of american prosperity may continue in a more subdued way much depends on the fed and other central banks managing to loosen up tight credit markets without reigniting inflation in any case "we not only have to sell more to the rest of the world but we have to tighten our belts here at home " says joseph p quinlan chief market strategist at bank of america its still an open question how much the u s trade gap will contract or whether some new development might again turn it back to widening "the real key is understanding whether this is a fundamental change in the trajectory or whether its temporary " says catherine l mann an economist at brandeis international business school ms mann knows how hard it is to tell she predicted in that the current account would max out at of gdp by and begin to contract if the turnaround persists the implications for the u s could be profound the weak dollar makes imports more expensive and raises an inflation risk interest rates are also likely to be higher than they otherwise would as americans have to offer higher yields to induce foreigners to put their money in the u s "were going to feel a real impact as the current account shrinks " says harvards mr rogoff "the typical individual will see this as a part of a broader inflation cutting into wage gains and standards of living " his back of the envelope calculation is that a drop in the dollars exchange value reduces americans income by adjusted for inflation the massive u s trade imbalance is the product of a tangle of causes and effects it springs largely from foreign exchange rates the attractiveness of u s financial markets the profligacy of u s consumers versus the thrift of consumers elsewhere and persistent differences in economic growth rates among countries between and the u s economy grew an average of per year while germany and japan each limped along at growth rates according to the imf faster growth means more imports the richer americans felt the more they spent on chinese toys german motorcycles mauritian shirts or japanese cars the housing boom gave consumers a sense of well being that led them to spend more freely than ever at the same time the growth differential served as a lure for foreign investors generally speaking its easier to make money investing in stocks in a steadily growing economy than a more languid one the temptation is especially strong when the financial markets are as deep and liquid as those in the u s are the u s government compounded the effect by overspending its budget and issuing treasury securities to cover its debts the central banks of china and japan among others have bought trillions of dollars in u s notes more foreign currency chasing fewer dollars made each dollar more valuable the stronger dollar in turn reverberated through the economy again making imports relatively cheaper and u s exports relatively pricier the strengthening dollar made u s stocks bonds and other investments even more attractive to foreigners because they were more valuable in euros yen pounds or other currencies when the investors cashed out for many years the combination of those forces led the u s to buy far more from overseas than it sold abroad in the second quarter of this year the current account deficit measured &# billion or more than &# billion on an annualized basis to pay for those imports the u s has to attract &# billion in foreign investments every day conditions however have changed dramatically these days u s growth lags behind that of many of its overseas trading partners the imf is projecting growth for the u s in and growth for germany and japan the countries that share the euro are expected to grow this year according to bank of america american consumers endless confidence and insatiable appetite at the mall appear to have been jolted by falling house prices and more recently tight credit conditions "the forces that had been supportive to excess consumption for a decade are now headed the other way and the u s consumer just cant keep driving americas current account deficit to higher highs " says stephen roach chairman of morgan stanley asia in hong kong mr roach calls that "one of the key conditions that could be critical in triggering a long overdue rebalancing of the global economy " indeed the slowing domestic economy already appears to be stifling growth in american demand for foreign goods the u s share of global imports has fallen to the lowest since the recession of according to imf data in the u s soaked up of world imports by contrast brazil south africa india and other developing countries now account for of global imports up from in "were not the sole market of last resort " says mr quinlan the bank of america strategist the weak dollar and strong euro are taking a toll on european companies that try to tap u s markets such as wolfsburg germany based volkswagen ag volkswagen has lost more than billion euros or about &# billion in north america over the past five years partly as a result of the dollars weakness the company said this month that it is considering building cars in the u s again for the first time in nearly years as a way of reducing its exposure to currency fluctuations by making cars in the u s where costs and revenue are in dollars companies help to insulate themselves from unfavorable exchange rate changes currently volkswagens only north american factory is in puebla mexico "the north american region remains by far our biggest challenge " hans dieter poetsch volkswagens chief financial officer recently told journalists and industry analysts during a conference call "we clearly need to change our strategy here " at the same time the recent panic sparked by the impact of falling house prices on the subprime mortgage market may have somewhat damped global enthusiasm for wall street the data are too recent and limited to allow a definitive conclusion but treasury figures released this week showed that net long term capital inflows into the u s often volatile measured just &# billion in july compared with &# billion the previous month investors chose instead to put their money in shorter term securities "at the margin rates in europe and japan are going to look more attractive given the whole subprime mess " says mr rogoff "but im not saying theres going to be a wholesale cut and run out of the united states " the slowing economy and uncertainty about u s financial markets are feeding back into the currency markets "i expect to see more and more weakening of the dollar in the coming months and years " predicts princeton economist alan blinder a former vice chairman of the federal reserve board currency trends are notoriously hard to predict though mr blinder confesses that he thought the dollar was embarking on the long march downwards in only to see it pick up again in the japanese yen has not gained much ground on the dollar compared to years ago the slipping dollar also makes it easier for american companies to compete against overseas firms a key to reducing the trade deficit for years riverdale mills corp in northbridge mass held of the &# million a year market for plastic coated wire used in lobster traps in new england and canada by when the euro was worth just &# an italian company had taken a big bite out of the companys market share but now with the euro resurgent riverdales wire seems like a bargain again "foreign competition got us down to of the market and now were creeping back" to about says james m knott sr the companys chief executive kendig kneen owner of al jon manufacturing llc has seen his exports of car crushers bailers and compactors jump to in the past months driven by faster growth abroad and an exchange rate that helps him take

employees there are still obstacles to a smooth rebalancing of global trade flows and china is one of the biggest beijing has been reluctant to allow its currency the yuan to rise much against the dollar despite fierce pressure from u s lawmakers and business executives who say that the artificially weak currency gives chinese companies an unfair edge over american firms the yuan has appreciated about against the dollar since beijing first allowed it to move in july but u s manufacturers backed by treasury secretary henry paulson say thats not far enough or fast enough to allow even handed competition while china and india are bigger markets for u s companies than they used to be "there are nearly one billion workers in asia who earn less than &# per day " says bank of americas mr quinlan "they can afford a coke but until they can afford a car and computer global rebalancing will proceed slowly " stephen power contributed to this article
