politics &amp economics eu pipeline move adds to rift with russia brussels seeks curbs on gazprom growth but still needs gas brussels a proposal that could prevent russias natural gas monopoly from buying pipeline networks in the european union is evidence of how skeptical of moscow european leaders have become and how tough it will be to stem russian dominance yesterdays eu initiative could limit russian natural gas giant oao gazproms plans to buy transmission networks in europe and would complicate relations between moscow and brussels but the plan faces a long road to approval and the ability of the eu to police gazproms expansion is likely to prove limited gazprom supplies about a quarter of the nation blocs gas under the proposal foreign energy suppliers wouldnt be able to buy energy transmission assets in the eu if they also supply or generate energy an allusion to companies such as gazprom and sonatrach of algeria sergei kupriyanov a gazprom spokesman said of the proposal "were used to it from the europeans " in an interview he said it was too early to say whether the initiatives would seriously hinder the company from moving into european markets if enacted the measures would stop gazprom only from buying parts of the eus transmission network gazprom could still acquire generation production and retail assets allowing it to continue its expansion into eu retail markets how to handle russia the eus dominant energy supplier and largest neighbor has been one of the blocs most divisive foreign policy issues in recent years yesterdays proposal by the european commission the eus executive arm reflects an evolution in attitudes that has seen eu countries that once firmly supported moscow change their tone that is partly the result of changes in eu leadership which has seen close friends of russia such as former german chancellor gerhard schroeder italys silvio berlusconi and frances jacques chirac replaced russias actions are also responsible for the shift gazprom cut off gas supplies to ukraine and other ex soviet neighbors last year in an effort to get them to pay market prices and to punish them for policies moscow considered hostile to its interests that willingness to use energy supply as a weapon of foreign policy spooked and angered european leaders the disillusionment is reciprocal "it is very clear the russians are frustrated by what they see as the eu using energy to discriminate against russia and increasingly they talk about diverting more of russian energy supplies to japan and china " says oksana antonenko a senior fellow at the international institute for strategic studies in london ms antonenko had just returned from a four hour meeting between russian president vladimir putin and western analysts and journalists where energy policy was discussed at length forthcoming presidential elections in russia have added to the tension reducing the hope of resolving any disputes between brussels and moscow until after march russias opposition to plans to give independence to the serbian province of kosovo has also increased friction diplomats say "the attitude in the council of eu member states has changed enormously " said one eu diplomat involved in the discussions "a lot of countries are now trying to underline the need to have one voice in relations with russia which wasnt so before " the proposal to restrict foreign energy companies from acquiring distribution assets was also designed to gain the support of ex soviet eu members for the commissions broader package aimed at increasing competition and cutting energy prices in the bloc the commission has long thundered about "unbundling" energy markets splitting up the companies that both sell energy to consumers and own the networks over which it travels the idea is to make supply and transmission independent so that a multitude of suppliers can compete without being hampered by an incumbent giant that controls the distribution network in the proposed legislation the eu bowed to opposition from some countries particularly france and germany and gave each state in the member bloc the option of choosing an independent operator for their networks rather than forcing the breakup of their energy giants the eu wasnt so gentle on russia in its proposal the commission said foreign companies seeking to buy transmission networks in europe must be divorced from suppliers of energy the commission proposed prohibiting foreign companies from making any such acquisitions unless "bilateral agreements" are in place such agreements would aim to give european companies the chance to buy assets abroad in the event the foreign company wanted to buy in the eu "we need to place tough conditions on ownership of assets by non european companies to make sure we all play by the same rules " commission president jose manuel barroso said at a news conference "we should protect the internal market from noncompetitive behavior coming from the outside " even if the measures are enacted gazproms expansion could continue last november for example gazprom reached a deal with the italian energy group eni spa allowing it to sell gas directly to italian industrial consumers "these proposals dont actually stop gazprom selling its gas to the retail market in europe " says colette lewiner head of energy utilities and chemicals at capgemini "and the unbundled transmission network wont be able to refuse gazprom access " the proposals could also be diluted before making it into law the legislation must be approved by both the european parliament and the european council a body comprising representatives of the countries guy chazan in london contributed to this article
