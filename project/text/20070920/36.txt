dubai exchange vies for global role a stock exchange owned by the government of dubai emerged as the leading contender to win nasdaq stock market inc s stake of about in the london stock exchange group plc and a minority stake in the u s exchange operator itself people familiar with the matter said the deal could make dubai part of the united arab emirates the first mideast government to hold a significant stake in a u s based stock market operator it would also give nasdaq a stake in a dubai exchange designed to take advantage of developing markets growth under terms being discussed nasdaq would sell just under of the lse representing the vast majority of its stake to borse dubai for slightly more than gbp &# a share said people familiar with the matter if it sold or more the buyer under united kingdom rules would have to bid for the entire lse shares of lse closed yesterday at gbp borse dubai would pay about &# a share to take a stake in nasdaq of less than through a multistep deal in which borse dubai would buy nordic exchange operator omx ab in a cash deal and then sell it to nasdaq for cash and shares people familiar with the matter said the deal could be announced as early as today and would likely give nasdaq control of omx nasdaq shares closed yesterday at &# some details of the deal were coming together late last night and it was still possible that one party could back out or that a fund from a rival gulf state the qatar investment authority could raise its offer for nasdaqs lse stake valued at about &# billion borse dubai recently built a stake in omx with options to increase that stake to as much as nasdaq in may agreed to buy omx but borse dubai came in with a higher bid this summer giving it leverage in doing a deal with nasdaq a three way deal among nasdaq borse dubai and omx would create an exchange group with business that stretches through three regions the u s europe and the middle east western exchanges are keen to expand their business in the middle east where capital markets are developing fast amid high oil prices and changes in corporate governance and regulation dubais earlier plans to buy omx would require government approvals to move forward for dubai purchasing the lse stake and teaming up with nasdaq on omx could reflect concern that it couldnt gain approval to buy the entire omx a person familiar with the matter said that dubai was less certain after a recent meeting with swedish authorities borse dubai would get two of the board seats for the combined nasdaq omx and its voting power as a shareholder would be limited to finalization of a deal isnt guaranteed given the risk of pushback in washington over giving a middle eastern country some influence over the second largest u s stock market though details of the deal were sketchy the potential transaction was being monitored yesterday on capitol hill "this deal will raise serious questions that will need to be answered " sen charles schumer d n y said in a statement the rivalry between dubai and qatar for the london exchange stake has lasted several weeks for qatar losing the lse stake would represent a sharp disappointment in one of its first major forays into the deal making over global exchanges stock exchanges in the u s and europe have been consolidating rapidly after transforming themselves into public companies in recent years from clubby memberships owned by trading and brokerage firms in the past two years bidding wars and hostile approaches have characterized a sector where there are a scarce number of prestigious targets lse is one of the most alluring of those targets sought after by rivals on several continents but it has fended off several suitors arguing their bids undervalued it nasdaq led by chief executive robert greifeld built a stake in lse of about while pursuing its own unsuccessful plan to buy the entire lse earlier this year omx stock was halted yesterday afternoon in europe pending an announcement today nasdaq stock was also halted in afternoon trading in new york a spokesman for qatar declined to comment as did per larsson the ceo of borse dubai borse dubai and its predecessors the exchange is the result of a merger of two stock markets in dubai have wanted to become a larger player in international finance and have looked at various exchanges in europe in recent years in looking at nasdaqs lse stake borse dubai had an advantage over qatar because of dubais position in omx which nasdaq wants to buy to expand its international business it is unclear whether dubai has any interest in becoming an active shareholder in lse but according to people familiar with the matter some at the london exchange have preferred the stake to be sold to qatar instead of dubai because qatar had shown fewer ambitions to own an entire exchange dubais stake would shrink about once lse completed its own planned merger with milan exchange operator borsa italiana spa becoming more global was partly how dubai was selling itself to omx join with dubai and gain access to one of the fastest growing regions in the world in particular dubai was keen to gets its hands on omx because it supplied the technology to many of the middle easts exchanges making it easier to consolidate in the region since nasdaq is selling its stake in lse the london exchange doesnt have the ultimate say over who buys it nasdaq could have used the cash from its lse sale to improve its bid for omx which operates several exchanges and provides technology to dozens more but instead nasdaq pursued a more inclusive approach possibly giving mr greifeld his first major international merger in recent years other large exchanges from the chicago mercantile exchange to the new york stock exchange to frankfurts deutsche boerse completed big deals or international deals to transform their businesses jenny clevstrom dennis k berman kara scannell and greg hitt contributed to this
