this is your brain on the job neuroscientists are finding that business leaders really may think differently glendale ariz how do you make a great leader pierre balthazard starts by wiring electrodes to managers scalps and recording electrical activity in their brains after he completes such scans the arizona state university management professor hopes the resulting data will enable him to plot a map of a leaders brain then he wants to train ordinary brains to act like those of leaders mr balthazard says the first scans of local luminaries suggest that visionary leaders use their brains differently than others in the past month he added arizona state graduate students next month hes planning to scan west point cadets "were coming up with the genome the brain map of the leader " says mr balthazard from his asu office one littered with brain diagrams plastic models and a windup toy brain with chattering teeth mr balthazard is among a growing number of researchers looking inside the brain for business insights the surge in interest among researchers is fueled by more powerful diagnostic tools and an improved understanding of how the brain influences character personality and behavior researchers have applied neuroscience to areas like economics finance and marketing academics from stanford university carnegie mellon university and the massachusetts institute of technology for example used a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify parts of the brain that influence buying decisions executive coaches and researchers are increasingly tapping neuroscience tidbits to bolster pet management theories scientists at gallup organization for example say brain research helps managers understand why praise works it boosts levels of dopamine a chemical linked to joy but as more nonspecialists jump in it becomes harder to separate science from hype "a lot of this will end up science fiction " says michael gazzaniga a neuroscientist at the university of california santa barbara who pioneered research in the s and s on the difference between the left and right sides of the brain mr gazzaniga says his research was oversimplified and misused by an eager public he fears a similar outcome with the application of neuroscience to management mr balthazards project is among the most ambitious because it seeks both to identify brain patterns and then train managers to replicate the patterns within their own brains the team uses electroencephalograms or eegs which record electric signals through sensors placed on the scalp advances in eeg technology make it easier to "map" a brains electrical activity but it isnt clear that leaders exhibit defined brain wave patterns or that changing such patterns automatically alters behavior not all brains function the same way neuroscientists say nor do people with similar brain patterns necessarily act in similar ways some of mr balthazards colleagues are wary too david waldman an arizona state management professor who designed the psychological tests mr balthazard uses says he supports the research but views brain training "with a grain of salt " leadership is complex he says and brain maps will most likely be useful to help managers develop specific skills such as showing greater sensitivity to others mr balthazard vows to follow scientific protocols including trying to repeat results with different subjects and consulting with ethicists hes enlisted a well known neuroscientist and eeg expert robert thatcher to help analyze his data and he stresses that brain training will be a leadership development tool not a magic bullet "we dont want to get into quackery here " he says mr balthazard is a tall chatty canadian and systems engineering specialist in while studying ways to measure managers performance he met jeffrey fannin a psychologist and former airline pilot who runs a clinic near the arizona state campus mr fannin was using eegs to find and treat brain wave patterns associated with illnesses like depression or anxiety a procedure still considered experimental by many doctors he claimed the same procedure had helped managers performance in certain areas like enhancing their ability to concentrate messrs balthazard and fannin wondered whether eegs would reveal patterns of brain activity common to good leaders if so they hoped to train other brains to mimic those patterns mr balthazard sought local leaders to brain map including a former dean at arizona state and a one footed mountaineer who climbed mount everest the subjects took mr waldmans psychological tests to pinpoint their leadership and personality styles then mr fannin scanned their brains the researchers sought to correlate the psychological test results with the brain wave patterns messrs balthazard and fannin demonstrated their work one june afternoon at mr fannins clinic where joanne cacciatore the head of a bereavement foundation was getting her brain mapped mr fannin put a red cap studded with electrodes on ms cacciatores head squirting gel under the sensors to better detect the signals a computer screen nearby filled with squiggly lines which spike when they register electrical activity mr fannin watched the screen and recorded ms cacciatores brain activity while mr balthazard asked questions some tested her vision as a leader others explored her sense of ethics she was asked to deal with a fictional employee with probing questions about a sensitive corporate deal "i dont like being a politician " ms cacciatore groaned as ms cacciatore silently mulled another question mr fannin interjected "youre talking to yourself " he said pointing to spikes tracing to an electrode on the left side of ms cacciatores head ms cacciatore nodded in agreement the electrode was above a part of the brain responsible for language mr fannin explained in another room mr fannin demonstrated the brain training technique on retired information technology manager george holland who was suffering anxiety when mr hollands eeg detected high frequency waves associated with anxiety a dolphin on the computer screen he was watching stopped swimming when the readings were near normal the dolphin swam smoothly mr holland who has since completed his treatment said the technique has enabled him to stop taking anxiety medication messrs fannin and balthazard say theyll use the same procedure for leadership training once they can establish an appropriate template thats where mr thatcher a neuroscientist whos worked on eegs and behavior for years comes in mr thatcher sifts through the data from sessions like ms cacciatores looking for brain wave patterns mr thatcher says preliminary analysis of brain maps shows some big differences in activity between managers who rate high on a psychological test of visionary leadership and those who rate low the visionary leaders had more efficient left brains which deal with logic and reasoning and better connected right brains which are responsible for social skills mr thatcher hopes to find more patterns as mr fannin scans more brains the patterns could indicate brain activity associated with specific qualities like charisma or something common to all good leaders the patterns could just reflect "faster brains more processing more power " he says adding that once the patterns are found "you can move people" to them mr balthazard is getting ready hes seeking funding for hundreds more scans and will brain map west point cadets this fall he hopes to begin brain training students as early as next year the schools marketing department has supplied mr balthazard with small rubber brains emblazoned with the arizona state logo and the words "are you wired for leadership "
