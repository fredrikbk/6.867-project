unfair suspicion cast on scientific research i wish to take strong exception to your "science journal" article "most science studies appear to be tainted by sloppy analysis" marketplace sept although all the authors examples come from medical literature the clear implication is that no research results can be trusted in any field of science this message does a disservice to the educators who are trying to attract more gifted young people into scientific careers as a physical scientist i cannot speak to medical research literature however as editor of a print and internet handbook that is widely used by researchers and students in chemistry physics and engineering i spend a great deal of time evaluating research papers in chemistry and physics literature some of them published years ago or more although advances in instrumentation and data analysis techniques lead to more precise measurements in the current literature and to the ability to probe more deeply into the systems under study it is striking how well the older measurements and conclusions hold up when compared with recent ones some interpretations have certainly changed over the years but this is a reflection of the natural progression of science as more information becomes available not an indication of sloppiness bias or fraud on the part of the earlier researchers i particularly object to the statement "no one actually knows how many incorrect research reports remain unchallenged " this is akin to saying "no one knows how many journalists have fabricated their articles " such statements convey no factual information and plant unfair suspicion on the vast majority who abide by professional standards of integrity david r lide editor in chief crc handbook of chemistry and physics gaithersburg md
