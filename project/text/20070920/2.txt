abuse of privilege michael mukaseys confirmation hearings will involve lots of questions about supposed misconduct at the justice department but this week the senate judiciary committee held hearings on a modest little law that unlike the attorney general grandstanding to come might just rein in genuine abuses and those have nothing to do with the war on terror up for discussion was the attorney client privilege protection act first introduced last year and reintroduced this year by senator arlen specter of pennsylvania the house version of the bill passed out of committee unanimously the law is targeted at justices heavy handed treatment of businesses under the threat of indictment for alleged corporate misconduct for years it has been justice department policy to demand that companies under investigation waive attorney client privilege and turn over privileged documents to prosecutors it has also been justice policy to routinely demand the firing or cutting off from legal assistance of accused employees even before theyve been charged much less tried the poster child for these tactics has been the prosecution of former kpmg employees in federal court in new york in that case judge lewis kaplan dismissed the charges against most of the defendants on grounds that prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of the accused yet lawyers at justice remain unrepentant as the senate heard this week norman veasey former chief judge of the delaware supreme court submitted to the committee a roster of cases in which prosecutors have continued to run roughshod over attorney client privilege and defendants rights these took place even after the "mcnulty memo" replaced the infamous "thompson memo" last december as official justice policy for handling white collar cases one unnamed assistant u s attorney is reported in judge veaseys letter to have told a target "i dont give a flying expletive deleted" about the new policy as andrew weissman the former federal prosecutor who headed the enron task force notes the mcnulty memo has proven to be mostly a paper reform of the sort that prosecutors themselves would never credit if a company offered it as proof that it had changed its ways and the kpmg prosecutors even after being rebuked by judge kaplan insisted that what theyd done was consistent with both current and former justice policy charging an entire business with a crime is a draconian step a fact that the mcnulty memo at least pays lip service to but in practice the threat of indictment has become an all purpose tool for compelling extraordinary degrees of cooperation from any company that comes into justices sights simply put mr specters seven page bill would bar prosecutors from punishing companies for refusing to turn over privileged documents or failing to punish those whom justice suspects of crimes at tuesdays hearing the justice department claimed that it had only demanded a privilege waiver four times since justice officially modified its policies last december with the mcnulty memo but in more recent cases it didnt have to companies read between the lines and gave prosecutors what they wanted for fear that the alternative was indictment it is a fundamental principle of our system of justice that the accused be allowed his day in court to defend himself and to have the accusations weighed by a judge or jury that is independent of his accusers most of the time this system works but it breaks down when businesses are coerced under the threat of a firm ending indictment into turning against their former employees and denying them legal counsel or help in paying for outside counsel mr specters bill recognizes this and attempts to rebalance the scales if the senate can find time in between its various snipe hunts and imaginary scandals at justice it has an opportunity to address some of the very real prosecutorial abuses that have emerged since the enron and worldcom scandals
