donors stir bundling questions clinton campaign vows to check contributions solicited by supporter bristow va when hillary rodham clinton held an intimate fund raising event at her washington home in late march pamela layton donated &# the maximum allowed by law to mrs clintons presidential campaign but the year old ms layton says she and her husband were reimbursed by her husbands boss for the donations "it wasnt personal money it was all corporate money " mrs layton said outside her home here "i dont even like hillary im a republican " the boss is william danielczyk founder of a washington area private equity firm and a major fund raising "bundler" for mrs clinton mrs laytons gift was one of more than a dozen donations that night from people with republican ties or no history of political giving mr danielczyk and his family employees and friends donated a total of &# to mrs clinton in the days around the fund raiser in an interview mr danielczyk said he "did not and would not" reimburse employees or others for their political donations such reimbursement would be illegal mr danielczyk said he was a co host for the event at mrs clintons home "everybody was asked to contribute " he said "some said yes and some said no " he added "no arm was twisted " the episode adds to growing questions about the practice of "bundling" donations in which ambitious fund raisers collect money from friends colleagues and sometimes employees to send to a campaign every major presidential campaign now relies on the practice to raise large sums it is an especially important strategy for mrs clinton she has formed a group of "hillraisers" who get special recognition for sweeping in more than &# for her campaign mrs clintons campaign isnt the only one to be touched by suspicions about bundlers the u s district court for the eastern district of michigan last month indicted geoffrey fieger a politically active attorney mr fieger is accused of laundering &# in illegal campaign contributions through dozens of employees to the presidential campaign of democrat john edwards the former senator from north carolina who is running again for president mr fieger denies wrongdoing and says he was set up by the bush administration asked about the donations bundled by mr danielczyk mrs clintons campaign said yesterday it would return the &# donated by mr and mrs layton howard wolfson a spokesman for mrs clinton said "these allegations are troubling and we will again ask each of the individuals solicited by mr danielczyk to affirm that their contributions were given with their own funds " mr wolfson said the campaign will return any contributions that didnt come from the donors own money mr wolfson also said the campaign provides information to its donors that "clearly spell out that donations must be from personal funds " the justice department says it has seen an increase in the number of prosecutions against individuals who seek to reimburse employees and others for political donations the increase began after congress approved changes to campaign finance laws in the new laws barred individuals from donating six figure amounts to political parties individuals can give a maximum of &# per election cycle the laws make it harder for donors who wish to influence elections or become close to a candidate to make their impact felt last month the wall street journal reported that donations raised by businessman norman hsu tracked contributions from a family in daly city calif the justice department later announced that it was investigating the matter mrs clinton and more than a dozen other democrats who received money from mr hsu and his fund raising network have said they will return the money to donors or give it to charity mr danielczyk years old founded a private equity firm called galen capital five years ago and began investing in companies in mr danielczyk took over fractionair inc a nashville tenn company that sells partial ownership of private jets he became chairman of fractionair in september the company went out of business last year after the federal aviation administration asked fractionair to voluntarily turn over its license an faa spokeswoman said the agency became concerned when the company wasnt able to produce documents to verify that pilots had completed their training "you have to have setbacks and failures in life " mr danielczyk said in an interview "you learn from that and move on " election records show that mr danielczyk made his first political donation in june to former sen bill frist a tennessee republican mr danielczyk donated &# to mrs clinton in july and the same amount that september he also gave &# to the clinton global initiative a charitable organization run by her husband according to public records this year mr danielczyk says he wanted to do a fund raiser in april but was "encouraged" by the clinton campaign to do it before march the close of the first important fund raising period "ive never done this before im new to political fund raising " mr danielczyk said "its hard to believe in this day and age im not looking for any favors " about people attended though its not clear how many of those were invited by mr danielczyk according to people there donors mingled in mrs clintons kitchen and outdoor patio and munched on simple appetizers mrs clinton made brief remarks took pictures with donors and chatted for more than an hour according to attendees at a table campaign aides collected donations one person at the event was a washington area investor who was considering putting some money in one of mr danielczyks ventures the investor a registered republican said he was invited by mr danielczyk and a colleague who were wooing him to invest at least &# in one of their companies the investor who spoke on condition of anonymity says he didnt donate any money to mrs clinton campaign finance records show that the investor contributed &# on march to mrs clinton the reason for the discrepancy isnt clear mrs layton who lists her occupation as dental instructor at a wellness center is a republican and her husband philip has supported democrats in the past mr layton is the information technology director at galen capital according to the companys web site "i was invited but i didnt want to go " mrs layton said other republican voters who contributed the maximum amount to mrs clinton at this event included mr danielczyks mother sister personal assistant and a half dozen employees or their spouses most of the donors had never made a political donation before contributing &# to mrs clinton according to fund raising records mr danielczyk said some of the attendees were republicans but "they may vote for her mrs clinton now " he added "its odd you try to get involved in the political process and you come under scrutiny " t w farnam contributed to this article
