companies try to teach old phones new tricks land line telephones welcome to the party in recent years as phone companies have beefed up their cellphones with a steady stream of enhancements innovations to the old land line phone have been slow to come but now in a move largely designed to keep consumers from ditching land lines phone companies are adding to home phones some of the features popular on mobile devices like address books and text messaging and equipment makers latest home and office phones include a range of new features like in home video baby monitoring instant messaging and access to email and the web the stakes are huge for the phone companies especially those such as embarq corp qwest communications international inc and windstream corp that dont own their own wireless networks and are most susceptible to the increasing consumer shift away from traditional phones to cellphones a recent survey by harris interactive inc found that of u s adults use only their cellphones to make calls land lines have traditionally offered better call quality than cellphones especially indoors but even that advantage is eroding as wireless providers address the issue this week wireless provider sprint nextel corp began selling a samsung product in some markets that acts as a mini cell tower inside users homes boosting a low signal to improve reception it costs &# and requires an additional &# monthly subscription t mobile usa a unit of deutsche telekom ag now sells phones capable of operating on home wi fi hotspots another method of improving indoor coverage given these developments companies selling land line phones are putting a higher priority on developing sleeker phones with more features "any company concerned about defending a land line customer base should be working on this " says telecom industry consultant rory altman embarq a spinoff of sprint nextel that has about million subscribers in states is adding an address book feature to its home phones allowing people to look up an entry and dial it by speaking a name into the handset embarq is also testing a text messaging function for home phone users in some markets when a text message is sent to a land line number the home phone rings converts the message into audio and plays it back the land line phone user can reply with an audio message or press a button to send a canned text response such as "thank you" or "where are you " those new features dont require consumers to buy a new handset so embarq can roll them out quickly but over time the company hopes to offer a "digital home phone" that will have a screen showing addresses and voicemails and provide basic information like news weather and sports the company is already working with manufacturers to build that product verizon communications inc is planning to offer a similar device called the verizon hub sometime next year "i think theres a lot of opportunity to innovate around home phones " says embarq chief executive dan hesse he says that while land line phones havent changed much in the past decade cellphones have seen a boom in innovation "why should cellphones have all the fun " he adds equipment makers are already creating more advanced land line phones for both the home and office motorola inc has begun offering phones that include ringtones phone books and instant messaging one new phone even comes with a portable camera and intercom system that can wirelessly stream video and audio from any room in the house to the phone serving as a potential replacement for a baby monitor

soon to be launched ge infolink phone made by thomson inc displays web content on a miniature screen above its keypad greg urban product manager for thomsons consumer network solutions division says the technology is designed to "get people going with the things they need to start their day " the device which costs &# for two phones and an additional piece of hardware needed to plug into users broadband connection will go on sale later this year meanwhile some internet phone start ups are trying to encroach upon the traditional land line business by offering features that arent standard with regular land line phone service internet calling startup ooma inc of palo alto calif currently offers users a free second line as well as the ability to listen to voicemails through a web site oomas chief executive andrew frame says the company plans to expand the "ooma lounge" web site to offer more premium features which could include the ability to download ringtones or receive online alerts in the coming months ooma is currently charging an introductory price of &# for its hardware an answering machine like box but after that steep fee users dont face any monthly charges for u s calls to be sure these new land line phones wont necessarily reverse the trend of consumers giving up land lines for cellphones theres still one wireless feature they cant match mobility also not every cellphone feature translates well to land lines embarq began rolling out a service in some markets last fall that allowed home phone users to assign songs for callers to hear similar to "ringback tones" on cellphones but the initiative fell flat in the early trials because while choosing a ringback tone "is a personal decision a home phone is a community device " said dennis huber embarqs senior vice president of product development mr altman says phone companies dont need to get too fancy too fast just building easy to update contact lists into phones would go a long way with consumers he said "that would solve of their problem " mr altman said at&amp t inc the nations largest phone company isnt fighting the consumer shift partly because its cellphone unit which launched apple inc s iphone this summer is benefiting from the trend ralph de la vega at&amp ts group president for regional telecommunications and entertainment said in some parts of the country the company is no longer requiring customers to buy land line voice service in order to get a discounted rate on high speed internet access he says "our point of view is if you dont want it we wont force you to buy it " the plan will be available nationwide by the end of the year
