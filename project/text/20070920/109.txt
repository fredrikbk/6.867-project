the credit crunch continues at long last financial markets have lurched toward higher risk premiums the extra interest that lenders receive for eschewing treasuries in favor of less safe loans as every literate american knows that adjustment has come at enormous cost and peril in the form of oscillating stock prices fears of liquidity crises in the banking system and a smattering of blowups in the shadowy world of hedge funds the pain has been particularly acute of course in housing where creditors have lost massively and the specter of foreclosure looms over homeowners unable to cover escalating mortgage payments nor has the leveraged lending business been spared the spigot of new commitments has shut tight the average risk premium on high yield bonds leapt to a recent high of percentage points above treasuries compared to junes record low of percentage points an almost seismic adjustment for the tortoise like debt market but unlike the seeming free fall in the mortgage market the waves of worry in the high yield arena have been more episodic far less fear than is needed to raise risk premiums to sensible levels tuesdays aggressive rate reduction by the federal reserve while perhaps desirable to shore up the economy complicates this adjustment process having now eased back to percentage points the high yield spread above treasuries remains well below the year historic average of percentage points below average premiums are too slender at a time of above average challenges how much danger lurks ahead like skiers who venture across the ropes into avalanche country investors in debt instruments today are dodging an unprecedented overhang of supply in the so called "golden age of private equity" wildly shorter than what pericles enjoyed and now in just a few short months a distant memory banks vied to commit to lend massive amounts of capital to private equity buyouts that would take months to close each new promise seemed to bring lower pricing ever loosening strictures "covenants" on the borrowers and fewer pre closing escape hatches for lenders as banks thirsty for fees scrambled for market share when the music stopped in july &# billion or more of these commitments was outstanding by comparison thats in the range of the total annual lending volume to similar borrowers as recently as only a few billion dollars of these commitments have come to market and lenders have been able to push them through with relatively modest sweeteners now more deals including a fistful of mega buyouts like first data and txu are beginning to close in a normal world perhaps the banks would succeed in offloading this paper as badly structured and mispriced as it is but one consequence of the turmoil in the housing finance market has been the shriveling up of securitizations the process by which banks package up loans and sell them in slices to investors in july and august new collateralized loan obligations known as clos in the parlance totaled about &# billion half the rate of the previous six months and with september issuance substantially lower much of that constituted offerings long in the pipeline meanwhile the high yield bond market the banks other major traditional outlet for debt has shrunk still further only &# billion of new paper emerged from wall street in august compared to more than &# billion in the previous seven months as intimidating as it may seem the supply overhang is not our biggest worry which is the prospect of many of these loans going bad the seminal reason for the collapse of the mortgage market never before in the history of capital markets has so much money been lent to so many challenged borrowers the statistics are indisputable in until the market effectively shut down more than of new lending was to companies planted on the lowest rungs of the credit ladder compared to in the previous peak according to jp morgan that brought these borrowers share of outstanding debt to above also a new high much of that debt was amassed of course by private equity buyers whose average leverage ratios for new deals in reached times cash flow another record so why given such seemingly incontrovertible worries have interest rates on junk debt stayed stubbornly low first for all the chatter about liquidity crises vast pools of uninvested capital remain in place in hedge funds and elsewhere eager for the next "buying opportunity " even amid the summer ugliness whenever trading values of outstanding debt appeared about to crumble "value" buyers emerged to prop them back up again still more capital is now being raised to invest in this debt some of it by the very banks whose imprudent practices helped create the problem debt buyers draw their courage from the solid recent performance of our economy housing excepted of course which has resulted in record few defaults by corporate issuers a microscopic seven so far this year some investors believe that traditional cyclicality has been tamed a difficult concept even for those of us confident that our economy is fundamentally strong now with hints of a softening economy raising the specter of slowdown or perhaps recession that courage may be challenged a wall street journal poll last week found that economists surveyed put the risk of recession at up from a month earlier for high yield debt investors history certainly provides little comfort research by edward altman of new york university shows that on average of "b" rated paper low but not the lowest quality defaults within three years of issuance for the growing amounts of ccc debt the track record is dramatically worse a default rate over three years to believe that this cycle will be different requires an ignorance of the past and a vivid imagination investors also take heart from what has been fondly known in financial markets as the "greenspan put" which after tuesdays rate cut may morph into the "bernanke put" starting with the stock market crash just weeks after he became fed chairman mr greenspan repeatedly provided massive liquidity when events like the asian crisis or the dot com hangover suggested a possible meltdown for this he has been praised but also criticized for interfering with the "moral hazard " the notion that investors should lose money when they are foolish so they dont repeat past mistakes many sages are vigorously and correctly defending this concept last week for example mervyn king the governor of the bank of england submitted a paper to parliament decrying the notion of providing "ex post insurance to institutions that have engaged in risky or reckless lending " but just one day later the bank operating in concert with the british government unveiled a bailout of northern rock one of the countrys largest mortgage lenders while its easy to visualize why even a hard nosed central banker would rescue an institution of such importance happily the resolve on this side of the pond has not yet been tested however those of us committed to preventing moral hazard should recognize that devising a means to funnel help to mostly innocent victims such as subprime borrowers without rewarding foolish lenders itself admittedly no easy matter will be an important ingredient in preventing more widespread rescue missions with all the attendant potential such bailouts hold for long term damage to the future pricing of risk so far in the face of a hopelessly muddled outpouring of exhortations often cutting across party lines the fed has discharged commendably its responsibility for preventing our financial machinery from seizing up a rate reduction was well justified not as a conduit for channeling relief to nervous investors but because recent statistics indicate clear weakness in the economy in the face of the housing collapse and its collateral damage to be sure maintaining economic growth may have the unintended consequence of keeping some overleveraged deals from going bad as quickly as they might have and unfolding events will test the wisdom of choosing the larger half point rate reduction which at least modestly undermined the goal of protecting us from moral hazard but lenders should beware that for all mr greenspans willingness to provide liquidity plenty of money was lost in the high yield arena in the early s and again in the post bubble swoon a decade later the rerun of that movie has barely begun to play out mr rattner is managing principal of the private investment firm quadrangle group llc
