uaw for now ends talks on trust fund gap of billions of dollars separates union gm as negotiations shift uaw president ron gettelfinger has for now ended discussions with general motors corp about creating a multibillion dollar trust fund to manage retiree health care obligations for hundreds of thousands on detroit auto workers say people familiar with the talks citing a several billion dollar funding dispute with gm mr gettelfinger on tuesday told the auto maker he wanted to begin discussions on a new four year contract that didnt involve this fund which has been a dominant goal for gm in these talks the gap was in excess of "several billion dollars " said one person briefed on the talks the union could bring it back for discussion at a later time all of detroits auto makers are pushing to close what they estimate is a &# &# hourly labor cost gap with asian automakers and the creation of a union run trust called a voluntary employees beneficiary association or veba is seen by the companies as a way to close much of that gap the uaw and gm didnt negotiate over the veba yesterday and instead turned to other proposals from the automaker such as wage cuts for active employees higher co pays for active workers cutting back on overtime outsourcing of jobs not on the assembly line and lower second tier wages for new hires ford motor co and chrysler llc after focusing for days on a veba based contract have begun to re evaluate and study their contract proposals and requests without a veba people familiar with the process say these new hires would also receive lesser health care benefits than current employees and wouldnt get the pensions as current workers said these people they said the uaw and gm could return to the veba later in the week or over the weekend the auto makers will also push to close more plants and move more work overseas than they had planned to do under the veba proposal earlier in the talks before the uaw chose gm to be its strike target or lead bargainer all three of detroits automakers made two separate economic proposals to mr gettelfinger and the uaw one with the veba and one without "the discussions will now be on all the ways to close the gap without the veba " said one person involved in the uaw talks one local uaw official briefed on the talks said the gap on ideal veba funding levels between the uaw and gm had been about &# billion earlier in the week even though talks between the uaw and the auto makers began nearly two months ago it has been about a week since mr gettelfinger first firmly indicated he was willing to consider discussing a veba if the funding was adequate since news of mr gettelfingers interest first became public gms stock recorded consistent gains but closed off about yesterday as it became evident that negotiations could drag on these negotiations are watershed for the uaw as it bargains away some of the benefits it has spent decades protecting the talks are also catching the union at a time when it is coping with transition that transition bloomed in when it spent months negotiating landmark health care concessions with gm and ford motor co followed by attrition agreements with gm ford and chrysler allowing the trio to cut more than jobs overshadowing all of this has been the unions contentious talks with former gm subsidiary delphi corp which filed for bankruptcy in october it took nearly two years to forge a resolution with the parts supplier abandoning the veba concept could be a blow to the big three just as it was banking on cash savings from such a move to boost bottom line performance the veba would shoulder more than &# billion in health care benefits the big three owe to hundreds of thousands of union retirees the complicated details of the trust have already slowed down the talks they said one holdup was that the complex computer models used by the two sides to calculate retiree health care liability and the necessary funding arent coming up with the same numbers these models take into account factors such as health care inflation trend rates actuarial assumptions about how long people will live and expected returns on the trusts investments the two sides have studied each others computer models to see whether that could help bridge the gaps these people said other complications involved what to do if health care inflation exceeds expectations the proper way to estimate the cost of providing benefits to an individual and whether the auto makers would get money back if washington enacts universal health coverage
