an abundance of dutch artistry the age of rembrandt metropolitan museum of art through jan new york theres a lot to look at in "the age of rembrandt dutch paintings in the metropolitan museum of art" the museums complete holdings of such pictures in fact most of them from the th century the so called golden age of dutch painting timed to celebrate a little late the th anniversary of the birth of rembrandt van rijn in the show is an impressive assembly that includes acknowledged works by rembrandt no mean achievement in an era of reattribution and downgrading by frans hals and five by johannes vermeer as well as a representative selection of landscapes and genre scenes by such luminaries as salomon van ruysdael jan van goyen pieter de hooch and gerard ter borch and a cranky retro s crucifixion by hendrick ter brugghen the rembrandts alone spanning the masters entire career would make any collection noteworthy they include such celebrated works as "man in oriental costume" "the noble slav" painted in when rembrandt was years old the seductive little "toilet of bathsheba" the peerless introspective "aristotle contemplating the bust of homer" the titianesque "flora" c with her crumpled linen her flower decked hat and her gleaming pearls a sober "self portrait" and a broadly handled portrait of the painter gerard de lairesse his features deformed by congenital syphilis painted about not long before rembrandts death in amazingly there is more added to this bounty are the deservedly renowned vermeers which range from the early "a maid asleep " c to the light washed "young woman with a water pitcher " c to the late "allegory of the catholic faith " c a magnificent uningratiating painting whose emblematic female figure historiated tapestry and depicted painting of christ on the cross make it as much a meditation on the language of painting as a musing on the mysteries of religion and lets not forget halss vigorous portraits and his roistering genre scene the bulk of this stellar collection has been installed as a special exhibition that places familiar works in new contexts and reunites paintings normally segregated in special galleries about works have also been hung in the dutch galleries to replace those moved to the show the new groupings encourage us to see paintings we know well freshly while the breadth of the selection both allows us to make new discoveries and offers a wealth of surprises had i ever paid attention to that enormous italianate "apollo and aurora" with its plunging horses and floating apricot draperies the combination of northern phlegm and southern opulence is strange enough the god and goddess look like the rather stolid children of some prosperous burgher in fancy dress but why hadnt i ever realized that this odd painting was by the pitifully deformed subject of that late rembrandt portrait as i said theres a lot to look at in this sumptuous exhibition but theres even more than meets the eye and the subtexts may prove to be the most interesting aspect of the show unlike most exhibitions which are gatherings of works accompanied by a document "the age of rembrandt" is a catalog accompanied by a show it coincides with the publication of the first comprehensive catalog of the metropolitans dutch paintings a massive beautifully produced profoundly informative two volume set written by walter liedtke the metropolitans curator of dutch and flemish paintings dr liedtke also organized "the age of rembrandt " installing the show not only to showcase the richest collection of dutch paintings in america but also to reveal how that collection was formed beginning with the initial purchase of a core collection of old master paintings mostly of the flemish and dutch schools bought by the newly formed museums vice president later scholarship downgraded some optimistically attributed or inferior works but about half of the original purchase remains at the met including dutch paintings since the show emphasizes both when works came to the met and from whom they were acquired the result is a fascinating history of taste we can marvel at the ambition of the mets gilded age benefactors legendary figures including j pierpont morgan h o havemeyer c p huntington samuel h kress and benjamin altman who collected old masters for themselves sometimes with the advice of experts and then gave them to the met altman and huntington in particular were responsible for some extraordinary works since about curatorial expertise has guided the mets acquisitions often with spectacular results such as the purchase of "aristotle contemplating the bust of homer" or more recently a much needed cool elegant church interior by emanuel de witte but happily enlightened benefactors are still with us we owe the addition of vermeers ravishing "study of a young woman" to the generosity of charles and jayne wrightsman the intriguingly organized "age of rembrandt" gives both the painting and its donors their due ms wilkin is the curator of "color as field american painting " opening this fall at the denver art museum
