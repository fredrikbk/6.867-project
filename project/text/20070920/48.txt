fuel prices threaten airlines recovery sustained higher costs could reduce earnings lead to consolidation rising fuel prices are threatening to unravel the airline industrys nascent financial recovery after years of cost cuts and restructuring sustained high prices could pinch profits choke off consumer demand or jump start stalled consolidation efforts oil prices have reached new contract highs above &# a barrel in new york futures markets this week due to supply concerns and expectations of growing demand the increase isnt expected to damp results for this year which is expected to be a banner year financially for an industry that took years to recover from the sept terrorist attacks on the u s but current oil prices could slow or stop that momentum if the price of jet fuel remains high and the economy weakens "then we have trouble " said john heimlich economist for the air transport association a u s trade group the international air transport association which represents more than carriers world wide monday lowered its industry profit forecast for next year to &# billion from its june estimate of &# billion citing fuel prices and the broader market credit crunch goldman sachs group inc last week raised its oil price forecast to &# a barrel in and &# a barrel in up from &# a barrel for both years recent modest fare increases havent offset rising fuel prices which have overtaken labor as the airlines largest expense moreover u s airlines on average have locked in or hedged only of their consumption at an average price of &# a barrel of oil this year according to a lehman brothers report last year of their consumption was hedged at &# a barrel john luth chairman and chief executive of seabury group a new york transportation investment banking and advisory firm said u s airlines already have used most of the tools available to combat the problem aggressive cost cutting capacity discipline and revenue enhancements airlines have also retired older fuel guzzling airplanes and taken smaller steps to conserve fuel like taxiing at airports on only one engine and installing lightweight beverage carts that means the industry might have to endure lower profitability and slowing growth then shrinking capacity and finally service reductions he said that adds up to higher unit costs the industry term for the cost to fly a seat one mile raising prices at the lowest fare levels could turn away the most price sensitive travelers meaning emptier planes and less revenue produced by fare increases he said david neeleman jetblue airways corp s founder and chairman said he doesnt think crude at &# or &# a barrel "is going to cause massive failures " but such a scenario he predicted would lead to lower airline capacity higher fares fewer travelers and the inability of airline workers to claw back the concessions they made in the last round of restructuring the ata estimates u s passenger airlines flew revenue passenger miles a paying passenger flown a mile per gallon last year up from revenue passenger miles per gallon in but fares have fallen nearly in the same period and jet fuel prices have more than doubled according to lehman brothers commodity research unexpected spikes in fuel prices "come straight out of our profits " said a spokesman for amr corp s american airlines the worlds largest carrier by traffic for each one cent increase in the price of a gallon of jet fuel americans bill goes up &# million on an annual basis airlines have been given some relief in what are known as crack spreads or the difference between the price of oil and jet fuel due to shifting economics in the refinery industry but cracks spreads are still higher than they were several years ago airlines like many other consumers of oil have been off the mark in predicting prices challenging postbankruptcy business plans delta air lines inc which left chapter bankruptcy protection this spring based its business plan on crude at &# a barrel ual corp s united which left court protection in february when crude was trading at &# a barrel developed a business plan that envisioned crude oil averaging &# a barrel through "at that time it made sense " said kathryn mikells vice president of investor relations united has adapted through higher than expected revenue performance domestic capacity reductions and programs to cut other costs at the airline she said the nations no airline by traffic yesterday raised its third quarter forecast for unit revenue growth but also boosted its cost guidance in recent days delta southwest airlines co and united have put in place fare increases which were matched to varying degrees by the rest of the industry "as fuel goes up you see fare increases " said stan gadek chief financial officer of airtran holdings inc parent of discounter airtran airways "if you dont increase fares you wont have airlines we have to cover our costs " pain from higher fuel costs could push u s airlines into consolidation following several failed attempts any combination would still face merger headaches particular to the industry as well as the credit crunch that has contributed to an overall slowdown in merger activity "soaring fuel prices may be the ultimate driver of consolidation " said mr heimlich the ata economist "with greater market concentration its easier to raise fares " some big players see consolidation as an inevitable and positive outcome ual and us airways group inc itself the result of a merger two years ago with america west airlines both outspokenly take that position but the problems associated with pairings and general public policy opposition led to only one major deal being attempted in the past year a hostile bid by us airways for delta that ultimately fell apart doug parker us airways chief executive remains a proponent but he said recently he doesnt believe mergers will happen unless the industry is forced into them by another downturn daniel michaels contributed
