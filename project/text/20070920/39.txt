emerging markets and oil bubble up will the fed rate cut turn overseas gambits into tech craze repeat now that the fallout from the downturn of the housing loan market has prompted the federal reserve to cut interest rates the race is on to find the next bubble emerging markets are a popular answer stock markets around the world rallied in response to the feds half percentage point cut on tuesday with shares in emerging markets generally defined as countries that have modest incomes but are growing fast posting the biggest gains mexicos benchmark ipc index on tuesday rose and brazils bovespa rose trumping the dow jones industrial averages gain yesterday asian markets which had been closed when the fed announced its rate cut joined the party with indias bombay sensex climbing to cross for the first time the rush into emerging market stocks is in part because of a belief that the feds rate cut as well as easier policy stances at the european central bank and the bank of england will end up bolstering fast growing emerging market economies more than any others proponents of this view say that in easy money flowed into fast growing technology stocks following the asian financial market crisis and collapse of the hedge fund long term capital management the belief that tech stocks were immune to any downturn helped fuel the dot com bubble "its like in reverse " says michael hartnett an emerging markets strategist at merrill lynch "a bubble is more likely than not but i think were only at the beginning of that process " he is bullish on emerging markets as a result mr hartnett isnt the only one to draw the analogy or point to the possibility of a bubble developing a month ago morgan stanley emerging markets strategist jonathan garner wrote that the current market environment is "the mirror image of " in early august christopher wood a hong kong based analyst at clsa group wrote that "just as first american tech stocks and then american housing finance were bubble beneficiaries of fed easing post ltcm and post nasdaq collapse so asia and emerging asset markets will be the likely bubble beneficiaries of the coming fed easing " a key reason emerging markets have become so attractive is that they have posted robust economic and earnings growth even amid rising u s interest rates this suggests that their economies have become less volatile and that their shares should carry higher valuations and in fact stocks in emerging markets long less costly than their developed market counterparts are becoming pricier at the end of last month the stocks that make up the msci emerging markets index were trading at times their earnings for the prior months in comparison the stocks in an msci index that tracks developed markets other than the u s and canada were trading at times earnings bulls on u s home builders made a similar point after the housing market remained robust through the recession they argued that home building stocks traditionally highly cyclical deserved higher valuations than in the past since the companies had broken out of the cycle and just as with the home builders everyone isnt convinced that emerging markets have escaped their dependence on the u s "maybe the fed is cutting so aggressively because they know something about growth in the u s falling off a cliff " says arjun divecha a portfolio manager at gmo llc who oversees more than &# billion in stocks in emerging markets "that cant possibly be good for emerging markets " but emerging markets at least so far have been remarkably well shielded from the downturn in the u s housing market and the credit troubles that have ensued gustavo dolfino president of whiterock group a wall street executive recruiter says he got worried about frothy u s credit markets six months ago and decided "i had to hedge myself " he turned to asia opening offices in shanghai singapore and hong kong where he has been placing bankers and traders into derivatives jobs he says he will bring in at least &# million to &# million in revenue in each office exceeding his expectations "i hired a recruiter to help us find more recruiters " he says what is striking says investment technology group economist robert barbera is that the idea that there could be a bubble on its way in the emerging markets is a cause for glee rather than caution "very few people are saying oh my god its a bubble " he says "theyre saying whoopee its a bubble " investors enthusiasm to get in early on the next bubble may come down to human nature in market experiments conducted by vernon smith a george mason university professor who shared in the nobel prize for economics participants invested in a dividend paying "stock" with a clear fundamental value and a bubble invariably formed if the experiment was repeated the bubble would form again and participants would say they were surprised they couldnt get out before the collapse "the thing about bubbles is that theyre rather fun when youre in them since youre making a lot of money " says julian mayo investment director at charlemagne capital a london firm that manages &# billion in emerging market stocks "if one thinks a bubble could emerge you want to fill your boots with the sector as long as you get out when valuations are overstretched " see related article "commodities report where crude goes now may depend on
