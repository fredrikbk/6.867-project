the accidental thief an editors unwitting journey into retail crime at kmart wrong box for the flip flops amid mounting theft and other merchandise loss in recent years retailers face a daily battle against scam artists but let the customer beware with security on high alert even law abiding shoppers can fall under suspicion i learned that on a recent family shopping trip to the kmart in bridgehampton n y by going through the checkout line with a pair of flip flops i had mistakenly placed in the wrong box i joined the ranks of thousands of shoppers detained or arrested each year in my case accused of trying to cheat the store out of &# pronounced guilty on the spot i soon learned there is no presumption of innocence in retail and thats pretty much how the system is intended to work according to the national retail federation u s retailers last year lost an estimated &# billion to "shrinkage" as the industry refers to shoplifting employee theft and other inventory losses up from &# billion the year before while total retail sales rose shrinkage as a percentage of sales fell just slightly to from which means retailers havent made much of a dent in stemming their losses some are getting more aggressive in loss prevention efforts in july wal mart stores inc seeking to put a cap on rising theft that has eroded its profit recommended that local store officials prosecute shoplifters at age and older rather than the prior age of what i did in the store albeit unintentionally could be construed as one of the most common forms of theft in retail "ticket switching" occurs when a shopper removes a price tag from an item and puts it on a more expensive one or switches an expensive item into the box of something lower price while many stores now use sophisticated radio frequency id tags and multiple tickets on an item to head off ticket switching tech savvy gangs can now print new tags on portable printers and slap them on merchandise right in the store for my part i had no intention of trying to pull a fast one on the store from which my extended family purchases prodigious quantities of household items kids toys and beach paraphernalia i needed a box because there was no box or price tag for my merchandise to begin with on this particular saturday in august i was looking through piles of flip flops most of them not in a box or the wrong size for their box with my step daughter in law and year old step granddaughter there was no employee around to help i found the perfect orange pair in size nine for another family member and looked around for their box the only box marked size nine had tiny toddler size shoes in it since they seemed to be in the wrong box i removed them and placed my nines inside i didnt look at the price on the box i dont scrutinize prices in kmart assuming they are a bargain compared to say neiman marcus while my two family members went to one register i took my haul including the flip flops to another counter between us we spent more than &# as soon as we stepped outside the store i felt a tap on my shoulder and turned to face a serious faced young man who identified himself as store security and asked me to step back inside when he said the shoes id purchased were in the wrong box i followed him inside promising my family id be right back instead i was led to a windowless security room in the back of the store detained for an hour and accused of deliberately switching a more expensive item into a cheaper box the adult flip flops it turned out were &# and the box had been for a childs size nine with a &# price my stunned protestations and explanations were summarily dismissed my drivers license and credit card were temporarily confiscated i was told to expect a civil notice of a fine by mail and finally i was advised never to return to the store though no law enforcement or court was involved i was effectively tried convicted and punished for a crime i didnt intend to commit as for my dismay at the way i was treated there was little i could do other than take my future business to wal mart or target and as i later learned from security and legal experts the store had acted reasonably and within its rights in treating me as a criminal a spokesman for kmart parent sears holdings corp to whom i described the events said that while it was "unfortunate" that id had the experience the stores security appears to have done its job correctly he added that i might have avoided the problem by telling the cashier that i wasnt sure the shoes were in the right box richard hollinger lead author of the retail federation report on retail shrinkage and a criminology professor at the university of florida says i fell into the "accidental trap" of engaging in actions that fit the profile of a ticket switcher even though i sorted through boxes in the open and made no attempt to conceal my actions "you were unlucky enough to repeat a pattern of behavior the store has been watching for " he adds typically the loss prevention staff doesnt prevent a cashier from ringing up customers suspected of ticket switching their job is to catch the culprit in the act "you innocently put yourself in jeopardy but you did carry out merchandise with a greater value than what you had paid " says charles sennewald a retail security consultant my explanation may have helped a bit "if they thought you were really trying to steal more often than not they will call the police " he notes according to the principle known as merchants privilege any merchant that believes a crime is in progress has the right to detain and question a shopper and to conduct a reasonable investigation of course overzealous security employees sometimes make mistakes which could present a legal risk to their employer says mr sennewald who is the author of "shoplifters vs retailers the rights of both " stores can also seek "civil recovery " a direct demand to consumers for damages or penalties without any court involved under state statutes for retail theft according to stuart levine chief executive of port washington n y security firm the zellman group whose attorneys help retailers pursue such fines the fines vary by state but generally are as much as five times the value of the act mr levine says stores often dont seek criminal prosecution for ticket switching defense lawyers can often show that many items in an average store are mispriced or markdowns werent taken on merchandise supposed to be on sale consumers who contend they have been wrongly accused can protest civil fines while detained in the store write a letter to the companys director of loss prevention or communicate with the law firm that sends a letter seeking a fine on behalf of the retailer the sears holdings spokesman says if the accused chooses not to pay "then the customer will have the opportunity to be heard as part of the legal proceedings that may follow " i am still awaiting my letter for their part security people in the stores have heard all the stories and they arent buying any of them amid my protestations to the young man who had detained me who gave his name only as brian i said that while i understood his job was to protect the store from loss i was a regular customer a professional and an upstanding citizen and my family had just spent hundreds of dollars in the store did i seem to him like someone who would cheat the store out of &# and risk this kind of treatment unmoved he told me that he had seen what i did and "people like you come in here all the time and do this " indeed security experts say professionals public officials prominent citizens and even celebrities are among those apprehended stealing items or switching tickets most bring up the case of winona ryder the actress who was convicted of shoplifting in beverly hills while detained i emailed my husband on the golf course with the message "ive been arrested at kmart" just a little dramatic license and called my stepdaughter in law to tell her i was ok finally brian who had initiated a futile search for the right box for my shoes came back with my drivers license and credit card i was so frazzled and eager to get back to my family that i signed the receipt he placed in front of me without looking at it thinking it was a charge for the extra &# as i gathered my bags he told me i couldnt come back to the store i assured him i had no intention of returning to any kmart ever at home when i ruminated about whether i had a case of wrongful detention my husband noted "well technically you did do what they say you did " finally when i went to give the flip flops to my stepdaughter i found they werent in my bags i called the store and found out the receipt i had signed was actually a credit for the &# plus tax that id paid kmart wasnt going to let me have those flip flops see related letters "letters to the editor retail security where customers are guilty until proven innocent" wsj sept
