apples ipod touch is a beauty of a player short on battery life in the hyper competitive world of consumer electronics its highly unusual for one branded product to dominate its market for years on end yet thats what apples ipod media player now approaching its sixth anniversary has managed to do one reason is that it has been reinvented continuously the latest ipod reinvention expands the line from three models to four priced from &# to &# with capacities ranging from one gigabyte roughly songs to gigabytes up to songs and that doesnt count the iphone apples much hyped cellphone which also includes a full blown ipod ive been testing the newest member of the ipod family the big screen ipod touch its a close cousin to the iphone that connects to the internet via wi fi wireless networking and replaces the famous ipod click wheel with a touch screen it starts at &# &# less than the iphone but with the same eight gigabyte capacity theres also a gigabyte ipod touch for &# like earlier ipods the touch is elegant and capable and works smoothly with apples free itunes software for windows and macintosh pcs as well as with its computer based online itunes store which sells far more downloaded songs and tv shows than any other legal outlet not only that but the touch introduces a mobile version of the itunes store its called the itunes wi fi music store and it allows you to buy right on the ipod any of six million songs for the same price youd pay on a computer this portable store will soon be made available on the iphone as well for all its beauty and functionality the touch has some quirks and downsides its the first ipod model ive ever tested that fell significantly short in my tests of apples battery life claims its also the first ipod that lacks any physical buttons for controlling music playback the touch looks at first glance like an iphone that cant make phone calls its a handsome thin black rectangle with a huge inch screen the same size and resolution as the iphones gorgeous screen but the touch is even thinner and a bit shorter like the iphone the touch has just one button on its face a home button which takes you to the main menu a series of beautiful square icons and like the iphone the touch has an on off button along the top edge most everything else is controlled by apples new "multitouch" touch screen interface which includes a virtual keyboard for text entry but unlike the iphone the touch lacks volume control buttons and a button on its earbuds for pausing or skipping songs so you have to play pause and skip songs by touching the screen this is made easier by a feature the iphone lacks so far if you double click the home button music controls appear on the screen even if the screen is turned off still you cant control your touch by touch when youre listening to music with the device in your pocket or purse in my tests music and video playback went perfectly and so did viewing photos the wi fi functions including the web browser a youtube video viewer and the new mobile store also worked perfectly the touch is missing some internet oriented features from the iphone that would work well over wi fi it lacks the iphones email mapping stock tracking and weather programs but its keyboard has a feature the iphone lacks as on a blackberry you can insert a period by double clicking the space bar apple says the touch was meant mainly to present typical ipod features not to replicate the iphone and it included the web browser only so users could get onto wi fi to use the mobile music store in certain places that required a log in screen but it seems ridiculous to me to sell a powerful device with wi fi and a huge screen and to leave out things like an email program even though you can use web based email programs i assume apple was concerned that the less costly touch might compete too much with the iphone if it had these features in fact if somebody can jam a voice over internet capability into the ipod touch it might be more of a threat to the iphone which is tethered to a single cellphone carrier at&amp t the company claims that the touch can play music for up to hours and video for up to five hours on a single battery charge even with wi fi turned on but in my tests using factory settings music playback lasted just under hours and video playback lasted just over four hours nearly every other ipod ive tested including the new nano handily beat apples battery claims also some early ipod touch units have had defective screens where images appeared too dark apple says this problem affected a small number of units and is being remedied my two test units displayed beautiful images despite these downsides the touch is a great media player and the ipod remains the best end to end portable solution for playing and purchasing music and video email me at mossberg wsj com find all my columns and videos online free at the new all things digital web site http walt allthingsd com
