politics &amp economics rangel expresses openness to corporate tax rate cut washington the democrat who is chairman of the house tax panel said he is open to cutting corporate tax rates if the lost revenue can be made up by eliminating existing provisions and loopholes used by businesses new york rep charles rangel said in an interview that his house ways and means committee will hold a hearing on corporate tax issues soon and he wants to discuss with treasury secretary henry paulson ideas offered by the administration for offsetting a reduction in the top corporate rate mr rangel said such a reduction besides being paid for would have to provide "incentives that are good for the country " if he is to support it his comments came after mr paulson and president bush have both said cutting corporate rates would improve u s competitiveness and as mr rangel is working on a broad tax bill now slated for possible house consideration in november the bill focuses on providing tax relief to individuals but including corporate components may ignite broader interest in the legislation which faces tough odds in becoming law this year and mr rangels new openness on a goal of many republicans may help him draw the bush administration into the tax debate or at least temper criticism that his efforts represent an assault on business interests a treasury paper released in july suggested that getting rid of many existing tax preferences now available to corporations would generate enough revenue to reduce the top corporate rate from to for example repealing an existing deduction for manufacturers that keep production in the u s would generate &# billion over years in revenue and simplify the code the treasury report said mr rangel didnt endorse any specific changes but said he would ask the treasury secretary about the issue "in order to find out better what hes suggesting " mr rangel is aiming to pass legislation that he says would simplify the tax code and reduce taxes for about million people the legislation would eliminate the individual alternative minimum tax which is starting to encroach on more middle and upper middle income people the bill also would beef up credits and deductions for lower and middle income people the changes would be offset as required under congressional budget rules by raising the rates paid by roughly one million other people mr rangels committee also has been exploring additional tax changes that may be included in the bill and some ideas have already prompted criticism from businesses and many republicans one proposal for example would increase the taxes paid by managers of private equity and venture capital funds as well as some real estate deals but including tax benefits for business could give the bill which faces steep hurdles greater momentum and while mr rangel has acknowledged the difficulty of moving broad tax legislation through congress this year particularly when senate democrats have shown little interest in such a move he is intent on proceeding "if the american people say have you lost it what are you doing then hell i have to back off and ask the senate something " mr rangel said but the senate hasnt "come up with anything since ive been chairman thats been so exciting that i feel compelled to ask them anything "
