business day sign up for the e mail here senate republicans yesterday blocked a floor vote on the bipartisan proposal widely seen as the best chance for altering policy on iraq maintaining president bushs broad latitude to run the war as he sees fit and underscoring how much the conflict will be tethered to the partys political fate next year the bill in question co sponsored by democrat james webb and republican chuck hagel would have increased the amount of time u s troops could spend at home between deployments to iraq and afghanistan thus potentially minimizing the size of u s forces devoted to a conflict that has already taxed american fighting power the vote to close debate on the measure fell short of the votes needed to avoid a filibuster and was virtually identical to the tally it received the first time around in july as the washington post notes despite the return of south dakota democrat tim johnson from a long convalescence last minute pressure by the white house and pentagon prompted john warner one of the most senior republican voices on defense issues to change his vote which as the post says deflated the legislations momentum and ensured its demise it was the los angeles times adds the eighth time this year senate republicans managed to block an antiwar measure from democrats who won their majority last fall on the back of widespread antiwar sentiment democratic strategists and party officials tell the new york times that majority leader harry reid and his colleagues "decided to stop trying to strike a deal with republicans after they found little interest on the other side and could not settle on a plan that would appeal to republicans but was tough enough to hold democrats together " after the vote sen webb whose son is a marine now in iraq promised that a "long and emotional debate" over the issue would continue "you are seeing as of a week ago the administration and some of the leading republicans in here talking about hey its o k that were going to be in iraq for the next years i dont think it is o k " he said the vote was seen as a key political test for the bush administration following last weeks testimony by gen david petraeus the commander of u s forces in iraq the wall street journal notes and the white house had deployed senior military officers to lobby senators attention will now shift to debate over a &# billion plus war funding bill the journal adds as well as a couple of proposed troop withdrawal measures that could get a vote today and tomorrow but arent expected to come close to the vote threshold democrats yesterday also failed to get past republican filibuster threats with a bipartisan effort to restore the right of terrorism suspects to contest their detention and treatment in federal courts highlighting what the post describes as the democratic majoritys persistent difficulty gaining traction against the administration on terrorism issues as iraqis want more say the two votes come as the pentagon for the second time this year put back its target date for yielding security responsibility in all iraqi provinces to iraqi authorities the associated press reports the delay to at least next july was reported in a defense department report to congress that "highlights the difficulties in developing iraqi police forces and the slow pace of economic and political progress in some areas " the ap says and it "hinted at the possibility of further delays " such delays which have grown ever more conspicuous since the u s turned over nominal sovereignty over iraq to iraqis in june could be further complicated by the growing dispute between americans and iraqis over the private group blackwater which handles substantial security tasks in the country on behalf of the u s government prime minister nouri al maliki yesterday demanded that the u s embassy replace blackwater because of its involvement in a weekend shooting incident in baghdad and he said the firms employees were also responsible for six similar shootings as the los angeles times reports but like so many other disputed issues in iraq resolution of mr malikis complaints may have to come from decisions in washington rather than baghdad bringing together nasdaq dubai omx in one of the geographically broadest surges of consolidation yet among the worlds financial markets nasdaq stock market and borse dubai today

comes at a time of greater geopolitical tension that has increased the scrutiny given to such cross border deals a person familiar with the matter tells the wall street journal that dubai was already less certain that it could take over omx on its own after feeling out swedish authorities and even ahead of the announcement washington was closely watching the deal which would make dubai part of the
