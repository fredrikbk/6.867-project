fiscally fit un confounding compounding terri teaches her year old son how his big boy savings account works online edition this month our year old son gerald took another big step in his introduction to the world of finance he withdrew money from his passbook savings account and invested it in a "big boy account" a certificate of deposit my husband gerry and i felt the timing was right for another lesson in saving and investing for a number of reasons geralds third grade math class is learning how to make change this month and as homework his teacher asked parents to let children pay for items and count change when out running errands three years after opening geralds passbook savings account his savings swelled to &# too much cash to be yielding a paltry plus we hoped that his graduation to what we referred to as a big boy savings account would foster a sense of accomplishment geralds savings comes from a number of places he gets an &# weekly allowance our rule of thumb is &# for every year of age gerrys also in the habit of dropping loose change in the piggy bank then there are financial gifts from family and friends and this summer gerald and his best friend matthew made surprisingly good money running an iced tea lemonade stand on a busy corner of our neighborhood as i explained in an earlier column we wanted gerald to learn the value of saving when hes young and by now he knows that by saving regularly his account balance will grow but the concept of interest was still foreign to him i once tried to explain it but i could see he wasnt grasping it i needed something more tactile to help him understand i had picked a one year cd offered by geralds bank because it had the best rate with the shortest term its extremely unlikely gerald will need his money in the coming year so i wasnt concerned about locking up his funds that long and with the federal reserve just lowering short term interest rates locking in at nearly may prove to be a better bet than saving in a high yielding savings account still to allow gerald to continue to save in his passbook account we left &# in it to keep the account open and deposited &# in the cd "before we open the big boy account we need to figure out how much money the account will pay in interest " i told him "your bank pays money so that you will save there and what they pay you is called interest " to keep it simple for geralds lesson on compounding interest i rounded his rate up to i told him that his new account would pay in interest and asked if he knew how much the interest would be "five dollars " he guessed i shook my head and told him wed play a game to learn how interest works and then figure out how much money hed make in one year in his big boy account i pulled all the coins from his bank and had gerald line up pennies on our kitchen counter by now he knows that pennies equals &# i asked gerald "how much is of &# " he looked at me blankly "you know that pennies equals &# right " i said and he nodded "well one cent equals of &# and two cents equals of &# and three cents equal " i pulled the coins away from the group as i counted "so whats of &# " "five cents " he said next i put the coins back and told gerald to imagine that each penny was one dollar bill then i asked "we know five cents is of &# so how much is of &# " he pulled five coins away from the group and counted out loud "one two three four &# " i asked again "how much is of &# " "five dollars " gerald said next i asked him to imagine that each of the pennies was a &# bill totaling the &# we would invest in his big boy account and that all those dollars added up to &# "so how many &# bills is of &# " i asked he counted each penny "ten &# " he said "right five percent of &# equals &# " i said "so if your bank will pay you to deposit &# in the big boy account for one year how much money will they pay you " he counted the coins again silently and replied "&# " i congratulated him and told him that at the end of the year hed have &# in his account but thats not the best part i told him if he continues to save that &# the bank would pay him interest on his interest "thats called compounding " i said and asked him to say the word to help him remember it calculating of &# was trickier and i knew if i got too involved showing him the math hed lose sight of what i was really trying to teach him so i punted and pulled out a calculator to show him how much his savings would grow through compounding interest "see this year you earned &# but next year youll earn &# because the bank pays interest on your interest " i said "whats that called " "confounding " he said another art linkletter moment again for the sake of simplification i didnt get into how frequently interest compounds in geralds cd my goal was to make him understand compounding itself when hes older and better understands the math ill explain how the frequency of compounding can have a big impact on investment returns over time as this bankrate com calculator shows a &# cd that compounds daily would yield &# while one that compounds quarterly would yield &# gerald was much more attentive at the bank when we opened his cd than he was when we first opened the passbook savings account and he gave the bank employee a brief lesson in finance "im going to give you my money and youre going to pay me for it " he said to the bank employee opening the account "its called interest " she made a big showing of being impressed i asked him what the bank is going to do with his savings next year and he replied a bit more tentatively "pay interest on my interest uh whats that word compounding " right so he gets it at least the gist of it our hope that gerald would feel some pride in moving to a big boy savings account also seemed to work out he couldnt wait to show my husband the certificate when we got home i plan on framing it and hanging it in his room to remind him how saving even a little each week can add up
