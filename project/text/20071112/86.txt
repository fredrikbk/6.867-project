reporter daniel pearl was secretly detained and interrogated by u s and pakistani intelligence agencies before he died earlier this year say u s and pakistani law enforcement officials the revelation about the suspect saud memon suggests that the interrogation may have played a role in his death say lawyers and human rights advocates who have accused the bush administration of colluding with islamabad in illegally arresting and detaining scores of suspected terrorists since the sept attacks memon was questioned both for his alleged involvement in pearls murder as well as his suspected role as a financier and facilitator for al qaeda including the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction according to a senior u s law enforcement official the official said the interrogation yielded intelligence that memon was aiding the terrorist organization to develop anthrax strains memon was "in a lot of the rooms where important things were being discussed he knew senior al qaeda people and was moving equipment and supplies " said the u s official who had access to intelligence files on memon the u s official wouldnt comment on where or exactly when the u s held and questioned memon he said the suspect was returned to pakistan because he was wanted for questioning in the pearl murder he also wouldnt say what if any new details the u s learned about memons alleged role in pearls death on april memon years old was dumped badly injured and weighing less than pounds in front of his karachi home according to his family and human rights groups five days later he appeared before the pakistani supreme court in islamabad in a wheelchair the associated press reported he died on may at a hospital in karachi from what doctors said were complications related to meningitis and tuberculosis legal aid and human rights groups have accused pakistans intelligence agency the inter services intelligence bureau of torturing memon during his detention in pakistan based on interviews with fellow prisoners a pakistani police official said memon was already in poor condition when the u s authorities delivered him to pakistan the central intelligence agencys director of public affairs mark mansfield said his agency "does not as a rule comment on allegations regarding who has or has not been in its custody " he added that the u s "does not conduct or condone torture " pakistani officials were unavailable to comment this weekend on whether memon was tortured in isi custody since his reappearance in april pakistani officials have never publicly acknowledged that memon was in their custody pearl was kidnapped jan while investigating a terrorism story in karachi and pakistani authorities say they believe he was murdered about a week later pakistani investigators called memon a prime suspect in the case because he owned a nursery compound where the journalist was held and killed witnesses alleged memon himself drove three men to the compound who subsequently killed pearl pakistani investigators say memon whom pakistani police described as a prosperous textiles merchant with an export business was regarded as someone who could have provided details about why the kidnappers decided to kill the journalist u s and pakistani officials say he was a significant player among many militant groups in pakistan believed to be conducting abductions in the u s treasury department named memon a financier of the al akhtar trust a self described islamic charity based in karachi which treasury called a supporter of al qaedas terrorist activities particularly in pakistan and afghanistan the treasury froze the organizations u s assets that year al qaedas captured former chief of operations khalid sheikh mohammed told u s military interrogators that he personally killed pearl in early but human rights groups argue he may have confessed under duress four other men were convicted in the case one was sentenced to death and three to life sentences they are appealing their sentences mr mohammed hasnt been tried in relation to the case pakistani police said they couldnt find memon for questioning in the months after pearls death since a rusty padlock secured the gate of the pakistani businessmans gray two story house in karachis middle class nazimabad district a stronghold of an outlawed islamist militant group called harkat ul mujahedin government and independent investigators looking into memons case said they believe he used a false passport to flee pakistan for mozambique after the murder of pearl from there he sneaked into south africa where he had friends a pakistani government investigator said u s authorities were ultimately tipped off to his whereabouts by pakistan which intercepted a call memon made to relatives the investigator said legal aid and human rights groups in pakistan that investigated memons disappearance said they have been told he was held at a secret cia detention facility in bagram afghanistan before being turned over to the isi early last year these groups said they had reconstructed memons movements through interviews with pakistani men jailed with the murder suspect inside pakistan memon returned to pakistan having "lost all his senses" and looking like "a skeleton " said a pakistani government investigator involved in the pearl case amina masood a human rights activist in islamabad claimed in an april petition to pakistans supreme court that memon was tortured while under detention by the isi in an interview ms masood said former inmates imprisoned with memon told her he was extensively tortured while under isi custody "i saw him with my own eyes his body looked like a year old boys he had completely lost his memory " says ms masood "it wasnt possible for him to survive he couldnt recognize his wife children " in recent months pakistans missing persons have become a major issue pitting president pervez musharraf against his countrys judiciary former supreme court justice iftikhar mohammad chaudhry who gen musharraf fired this month had been championing the rights of the disappeared and those being held without facing any formal terrorism charges gen musharraf declared a state of emergency on nov in part he asserted because of moves by the supreme court to free suspected terrorists who havent been formally charged "the lawyers have released scores of terrorists" who are "human missiles " ahmed raza kasuri a legal adviser to gen musharraf said last week in washington explaining pakistans need for emergency measures "we are only trying to stabilize the situation in pakistan " ms masood and other human rights activists say gen musharrafs moves against pakistans judiciary could ruin their efforts to learn the status of hundreds of men missing since since declaring the state of emergency gen musharrafs security forces have rounded up several prominent human rights activists who had been sharply critical of his policies and pushed the supreme court to take cases involving people secretly detained without trial among those detained include asma jahangir chairwoman of the human rights commission of pakistan as well as the commissions director i a rehman zahid hussain contributed to this article
