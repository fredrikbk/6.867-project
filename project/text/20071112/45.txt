at one point last week the canadian dollar bought more than &# a modern day record late friday in new york one canadian dollar known as the loonie for the bird pictured on coins fetched &# that means the loonie has strengthened about against the u s dollar since the start of the year far more than the euro or the british pound much of its ascent is attributable to a robust canadian economy as the u s has struggled with an ailing housing sector and credit woes canada has surged ahead high commodity prices have boosted demand for its natural resources especially oil the country boasts a trade surplus and unemployment is at a year low now the loonies rise is sharpening the line between those in canada who will benefit from a stronger currency and those who will struggle with its impact for canadians traveling overseas or canadian companies prowling for acquisitions abroad the pumped up loonie is a bonanza still it is causing increasing discomfort for certain parts of the economy such as exporters who have to contend with a currency that makes their goods less competitive it also is sending shock waves through the tourism industry and hitting retailers as canadians head south to shop

canada as a manufacturing base one of the reasons they built plants there to export to the u s and elsewhere was to take advantage of the formerly anemic canadian dollar those lower costs have now
