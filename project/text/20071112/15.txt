energy a special report investors futures shock big firms like goldman sachs and deutsche bank are using options to cope with wild swings in energy prices its getting pretty crowded in the crude oil options trading pit of the new york mercantile exchange with crude oil prices swinging wildly and trading of crude oil futures going mainstream with electronic trading a broader swath of traders and investors are turning to options these financial instruments which give the right to buy or sell crude oil futures at a certain price but no obligation to do so are increasingly being seen as an inexpensive way to insure against and bet on the big price moves in oil futures but because of the complexity of trading options the action is still taking place in the pit where traders shout and signal orders even though electronic options trading has been available since june brokers and independent traders now jostle for position in the crude oil and natural gas options pit while in the futures pits minutes can elapse between trades the bulk of that trading is now done electronically "in the futures pits youre looking at about a fifth of the people that used to be here " says raymond carbone a trader at paramount options with options trading he says "were bunched in shoulder to shoulder " nymex crude oil options trading volume on the floor grew by in according to nymex data so far this year through sept volume is up another by contrast futures pit volume in september was down from september the first month nymex allowed electronic trading of crude oil and natural gas futures during floor hours crude oil futures prices have tripled to more than &# a barrel in the past four years and moves in both directions have become bigger and faster given that volatility theres more chance futures prices will pass an agreed upon level and make it profitable to exercise an option and the high premiums sellers can charge means more can be made selling options "theres a newfound appreciation for how sensitive energy prices are to shifts in supply and demand" that is leading to more interest in options as a way to hedge against big moves in prices says tim evans an energy analyst with citigroup inc in new york "a small shift in supply and demand can have a very large impact on price so can any low probability catastrophic event such as a showdown with iran or major hurricane damage to production the price isnt going to move &# a barrel it is going to move &# " its not just commercial traders such as oil producers and users getting in on the action large financial traders such as goldman sachs group inc and deutsche bank ag are increasingly using options trading and placing bigger orders so are large hedge funds and other speculators attracted by the greater risk and reward potential pit traders say smaller investors also are piling in using crude oil options as a way to bet on moves in futures prices theres growing interest from traders outside the energy sector as well thanks in part to the popularity of crude oil futures electronic trading seasoned options traders from equities and other commodities markets in new york chicago and london are heading to the new york pit to capitalize on surging interest in energy trading and the relatively high volatility in the markets "were seeing firms in other spaces expanding their staff to reach into energy " says john mcnamara who runs one of the biggest options brokerage firms on the nymex floor mcnamara options and is vice chairman of the nymex floor committee people who trade their own money "in the equities field in chicago sooner or later want to expand into the energy market where there is a lot of volatility which is the key to trading and finding opportunity in options " mr mcnamara says helping the influx is the significant drop in the price of a nymex floor trading right which a person needs in order to get on the nymex floor the lease price has fallen to between &# and &# a month from more than &# a month when the floor was the only place to trade nymex futures during the busiest trading hours it makes the pit a much cheaper place to base options traders than it once was anyone can buy or lease one of nymexs trading rights when they become available as long as they get approval from nymex to trade options buyers purchase either a call option which is the right to buy a futures contract at a certain strike price by a certain date or a put option which is the right to sell by a certain date the selling price is influenced by a number of factors including how far the strike price is from the current trading price of the future and how long it is until the option expires trading strategies range from the simple such as merely buying a put or call option to the more complex ones that can involve both buying and selling of options with different strike prices and combining them with actual futures trades at the simplest level traders can bet on gains or falls in crude futures by simply buying an option for example a &# call option on a futures contract bought for &# a barrel becomes profitable when the price of the futures rises above &# a barrel with oil at &# a barrel the buyer is looking at a profit of &# a barrel if prices never make it past &# and fall a long way losses are limited to the &# a barrel buy price of the option if oil were to rise rapidly to more than &# in the event of some supply shock the seller who has an obligation to sell to the buyer at &# if the option is exercised can lose big money "im a long options trader i buy options because i want to sleep well " says paramounts mr carbone who also trades his own money "i dont want to have to wake up broke some time if some cataclysmic event happens and im short calls obligated to sell crude futures at a certain price if a call option is exercised with the market trading at &# " the growing popularity of options is an important factor for nymex holdings inc the owner of the exchange as it looks to cut costs by decreasing the size of its declining trading floor while most futures pits will be shrunk traders say the company is looking at boosting the options pits size nymex has said it is in talks with potential exchange suitors about being acquired this has led to speculation that it will merge with nyse euronext the owner of the new york stock exchange if that happens theres the chance energy traders would be moved to the emptying nyse pits and nymexs building in the world financial center would be sold as for growth in options electronic trading mr mcnamara says " of the options that trade are complex structures and we dont have the technology right now to display that information" efficiently on computer screens options trading "still necessitates a broker that can sift through a myriad of different structures and find the client what theyre looking for " he adds "thats not to say it wont happen just that were not there yet
