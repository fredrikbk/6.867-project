energy a special report producers pressure tactics proponents of enhanced recovery say it does double duty it reduces co emissions while increasing oil output to get their hands on hard to reach oil some energy companies are putting a new twist on an old strategy the basic idea known as enhanced oil recovery or eor has been around for decades companies take carbon dioxide which occurs naturally underground and pump it into oil deposits which makes the fuel easier to collect after the oil is gathered the carbon dioxide gets pumped into the ground now some energy companies and oil field entrepreneurs are using man made carbon dioxide to do the job theyre building pipelines to collect emissions from natural gas processing plants and other energy related sites and ship it to their oil fields only a handful of companies use this method but some in the oil business are trying to spread it further a number of companies have begun lobbying for government help to defray the daunting cost of building carbon dioxide pipelines and processing the gas in part theyre pitching the environmental benefits of the process eor they argue takes a potent greenhouse gas and pumps it underground where it cant do any harm of course the process ultimately produces oil which in turn will produce carbon dioxide when its burned but the oil companies say eor still helps the environment by removing the industrial carbon dioxide from the equation which makes a barrel of eor produced oil much "cleaner" than a regular barrel the classic image of oil is that it bursts from the ground in a gusher while new fields do indeed flow with intense pressure oil companies turn to eor when the projects reach middle age and the oil gets harder to collect a number of substances can be used in eor including water but carbon dioxide is one of the most effective because of its unique reaction with oil as carbon dioxide is pumped into oil deposits at high pressures the gas reduces the force thats holding the oil to the rock allowing more to be gathered for now more than three quarters of the carbon dioxide used for enhanced oil recovery comes from naturally occurring carbon dioxide domes vast geologic structures that are similar to those that hold oil and gas according to stephen melzer a midland texas consultant who specializes in enhanced oil recovery a number of issues often make man made carbon dioxide a more expensive proposition gas from some industrial sources such as coal fired power plants and petroleum refineries frequently contains nitrogen and other chemicals that must be separated out says tracy evans senior vice president for reservoir engineering at denbury resources inc an oil exploration and production company moreover many industrial sources of the gas may need five or six stages of compression to achieve a pressure that can be transported via pipeline rendering it twice as expensive as naturally occurring carbon dioxide says tim bradley president of the carbon dioxide division at kinder morgan energy partners that said some energy companies in need of additional carbon dioxide have undertaken major projects using man made emissions in for instance anadarko petroleum corp spent &# million on an eor project a mile pipeline ships carbon dioxide from an exxon mobil corp natural gas processing plant across wyoming where it is boosting output from a year old field anadarko estimates that through it stored million metric tons of carbon dioxide that otherwise would have been vented to the atmosphere in comparison the futuregen project a &# billion federal private partnership now under development to build the first near zero emission power plant is expected to store million to million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year denbury which specializes in exploiting mature oil fields has announced a series of ventures to purchase carbon dioxide from industrial plants the logic is simple to meet its oil production targets denbury will need to more than triple its carbon dioxide supply by its agenda includes construction of a mile carbon dioxide pipeline between baton rouge and houston that will cost &# million to &# million denbury whose operations are concentrated in the gulf coast plans to purchase carbon dioxide from a synthetic fuel plant in natchez miss that owner rentech inc expects to come on line in four or five years the company has also signed contracts to buy carbon dioxide from two other gasification projects in louisiana proposed by faustina hydrogen products llc denbury expects the higher costs of the man made carbon dioxide to be at least partially offset through the sale of carbon emission credits on the voluntary carbon market in essence denbury gets credits for taking pollution out of the air which it can then sell to other parties typically the buyers are corporations seeking to boost their image or financial speculators or other emitters who are playing the voluntary market in anticipation of a mandatory system denbury maintains that its eor ventures are economic even without additional revenue from the credits officials in the energy industry and government agree that boosting eor with man made carbon dioxide could bring enormous gains in domestic oil production a february department of energy study said the u s had produced only billion barrels of the estimated billion barrels of oil in place in discovered fields eor could be used to produce billion of the "stranded" crude remaining said the study which recommended tax policy modifications and other measures to encourage the practice while the report mentioned the potential of the process to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial sources it didnt estimate the total potential environmental benefit now some in the oil industry are lobbying for that help one of the most vocal advocates is blue source cos which sells emissions credits on the carbon market in april chief executive william townsend appeared before a senate committee in congress and called for "direct incentives and regulatory influence" to encourage eor using man made carbon dioxide he said at least miles of carbon dioxide pipelines could be built with favorable government policies mr townsend sees eor as the first step in a broader environmental plan called carbon sequestration if the government gives oil companies enough incentives he told the committee theyll build a vast network of carbon dioxide pipes to support eor eventually he argued the companies will have access to so much man made carbon dioxide that theyll be able to take a good chunk of it and simply "sequester" it thousands of feet underground not use it to get more oil so the process could ultimately save much more carbon dioxide than it releases for now though environmentalists are wary about the process some dont want to give incentives to a process that encourages the use of oil and think more proof is needed that the carbon dioxide wont seep out of the ground over time "to go to all the lengths to move something along thats going to cause additional damage doesnt seem like the best idea particularly when it comes to government incentives " says josh dorner a spokesman for the sierra club in washington adding that tax credits should instead go to renewable energy research and development mr biers is houston bureau chief for dow jones newswires he
