real time meet george jetson flying cars may not have materialized but other tech wonders are here now online edition i read a lot of science fiction as a kid most of it "space opera" imagining a future in which humanity had left the cradle of earth to seek its destiny among the stars if youre scoring at home thats two shopworn sci fi phrases in one sentence typically the human race would fall to quarreling after a couple of generations mining rights to the asteroid belt beyond mars were often a big contention then unite in the face of a hostile alien empire and get down to the business of conquering or being conquered parallels to rome and greece and persia abounded most of which went right over my head while i waited for starships to shoot at each other again the more detailed oriented of these space operas would begin or end with intricate timelines of the future which were often my favorite part theyd include the moon landing of course which led to permanent moon bases the first manned mission to mars mars colonies and so much more and id look at the dates and dream a permanent moon base in sounds about right ill be god is that old on the other hand its young enough to go to the moon isnt it sure it is yes then there was another influence one that makes space opera sound like real opera that of course was "the jetsons" the hanna barbera show featuring flying cars robot maids and space needle apartment buildings filled with rube goldberg labor saving devices i doubt the creators of "the jetsons" ever imagined how theyd influence kids growing up in the s the last episode of the original "jetsons" aired in the spring of but its real heyday came in syndication with the show playing on what seemed like continuous loop in the late s amazingly there were only "jetsons" episodes its a bit frightening to imagine how many times i must have seen each one and im not alone rolling stone just released another anniversary issue this one interviewing big names about the future of the music industry global warming politics and the like turns out a fair number of rolling stones famous interviewees spent their childhoods the same way i did watching george and jane and judy and elroy kanye west and bruce springsteen would like their flying cars already the future was "the jetsons " george clooney recalls it "meant getting into a silver costume with a ring around your neck and riding around in floating cars it was antiseptic and perfect " chris rock also grew up expecting airborne cars and moving sidewalks mr clooney finds it "funny that none of it really came around " but mr rock notes that flying cars aside "the jetsons pretty much came true my kid even has a mechanical dog that does flips " whos right ill get to that why such an influence for a show that was basically "the flintstones" in aerial houses which made it basically "the honeymooners" in aerial houses im sure a nation of grad students have emitted turgid narratives about alienated children finding a utopian sequel to jfk era space race america preferable to a dystopian continuation of the real s but at the risk of being no fun thats not it the appeal of "the jetsons" is much simpler it had easily identifiable characters often ripped off down to the same voice talent from other hanna barbera shows and comfortably well worn family sitcom situations with the addition of goofy gadgets that made kids laugh none of that has anything to do with the future "the flintstones" had the same goofy gadgets but with vaguely prehistoric animals as technology most importantly "the jetsons" was on all the time though it should be said that the brassy galloping theme song is totally great the only reason "the jetsons" is a touchstone for the future instead of just childhood nostalgia is that it was "about" the future which was bound to arrive because well thats what the future does you could spend your day comparing the future to " a space odyssey" as paul krugman does he tells rolling stone he wants his space hotel but not everybodys seen that "the jetsons " on the other hand is pretty close to a sure thing conversationally if for some reason daily life in the s included girl bands foiling not very frightening crimes those of us who watched too much tv years ago would spend a lot of time wondering why todays intrepid musicians werent more like josie and the pussycats the other thing about the future is it tends to arrive slowly so slowly that often we dont notice how thoroughly things are changing there are exceptions technological moments where its immediately obvious everything has changed the first week i used tivo i knew id never watch tv the old way again and i was right sports aside for me sports lose all their tension on time delay even if i dont know the outcome switching to google and itunes changed the way i used the net and listened to music and that was apparent very quickly there will be more such moments some of them revolutionary nanotech is discussed in such terms as is desktop fabrication but if such things do come to pass i bet theyll be exceptions to the rule the future will mostly arrive while were not looking i cant remember the day an atm card went from a backup way of getting cash to such a part of my life that having to talk to a bank teller is really annoying but it happened i cant pinpoint the date where it became reflex to pick up my cellphone instead of the landline to make a call or the night i started assuming a ringing phone is either a wrong number or a shakedown from a vaguely menacing police charity but it happened i didnt notice that my households e commerce spending had grown enormously or come to include so much mundane family buying but as i discovered recently it happened and these changes add up taking us from the world of bankbooks and tethered phones ringing in empty rooms and mall expeditions to a world of bank machines and phones in your pocket and buying things at your pc thats a long journey but it doesnt feel like one until we think back and are shocked by how different things used to be does that journey take us to flying cars and robot maids and then to slightly overdue moonbases and the stuff of space opera maybe yes and maybe no but i can reach into my pocket from most anywhere and call someone and not have to worry about that someone being in california or when the rates will go down i can pull out another device that contains thousands of pop songs which i zoom through with a fingertip i can go home and watch hundreds of hours of tv and movies when i want without having to be kind and rewind afterwards on a huge tv whose picture offers near hallucinatory clarity i can sit at my desk and publish my thoughts about the mets world wide or buy a coat or research most anything including tv shows i watched as a kid and im not a mad scientist or a google billionaire doing these things makes me in no way extraordinary i may not have a ticket to a moonbase quite yet but if you could send me back to the s to tell my nine year old self whats coming hed be thrilled to him for all intents and purposes i am george jetson what technological milestones have taken place during your lifetime what do you take for granted that your nine year old self would have never believed possible and what do you think the future holds join
