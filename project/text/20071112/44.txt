looking at clinton seeing themselves executive women identify with the scrutiny shes facing when valerie frederickson a silicon valley human resources consultant heard hillary clinton assert that she could "take the heat" after getting pummeled by opponents in a recent debate she recalled the times in her own career when a roomful of men disrespected her once at a national sales meeting for a large construction products company a male colleague passed around photographs of her in a bikini that hed secretly taken on a prior business trip "instead of quitting i focused on being better on outselling the guys three to one " says ms frederickson who later founded her own firm valerie frederickson &amp co ms frederickson has donated money to john edwardss campaign because she thinks he has a better chance of winning but shell vote for mrs clinton if shes the democratic candidate she identifies with sen clintons determination "to pick herself up when shes shot down and figure out how to be effective " and she notes "as professional women weve been through so much i feel like shes my big sister " a year away from the election sen clinton the democratic front runner has a lead with women voters over male candidates of both parties a wall street journal nbc news poll shows that when matched against republican rudolph giuliani she wins by to among female voters and loses among men by to against democrat sen barack obama she wins among women by to while winning among men by just to not all women are certain that mrs clinton is going to be the one to shatter whats been called "the last glass ceiling " executive and professional women with incomes over &# who might be perceived as having most in common with her support sen clinton in much lower numbers than do lower income women and they are slightly more likely to vote for mr giuliani than for her to but regardless of their political views and preferences mrs clintons campaign is stirring strong feelings among female executives about what it means to be a woman often the only woman seeking a position of power whether she is battling male opponents in debates having her hair and clothing scrutinized or trying to convince voters she is strong enough to do tough tasks the senator is publicly facing challenges that most female executives have grappled with privately throughout their careers her determination to win the white house is also prompting many women in business to reflect on their career goals and what price theyre willing to pay to achieve them "shes standing up there and taking all these arrows i identify with even if she doesnt represent exactly what i might want for a presidential candidate " says pat cook head of cook &amp co a bronxville n y executive search firm who is still undecided and politics is an even tougher arena than business because "you have to win or lose in public and youre always under the cameras " says ruth mandel at rutgers universitys center for american women and politics sandra peterson president of bayer ags bayer healthcare diabetes care and executive vice president of bayer healthcare agrees that "its hard not to identify with some of what hillary clinton is up against " although shes still an undecided voter when sen clinton was criticized in a newspaper column for showing some cleavage on the senate floor this summer ms peterson recalled the barrage of sexually suggestive "animal house" remarks leveled at her when she began her career some years ago at the american stock exchange today women are treated more equally thousands are managers in charge of employees and multibillion dollar businesses but their numbers drastically dwindle in higher offices with women occupying just of senior corporate jobs and about one sixth of boardroom seats those numbers are similar to those in the public sector where women now hold of seats in both the u s senate and house of representatives and of statewide elected offices nine of the state governors are female the numbers dont hint at the daily struggles women face in business and politics "theres still a narrower band of acceptable behavior for women than men " ms peterson says "the minute hillary steps out of line everyone jumps all over her " she adds missteps can include just laughing too loudly or showing a bit of cleavage "it makes my blood boil " says deedee towery president and ceo of proactive business solutions an oakland calif it company she says she gets so angry when she hears sen clinton attacked about her behavior that she avoids listening to the news "it reminds me of being told by my father when i was growing up that business was for men and women belonged at home " says ms towery who is a supporter of sen clinton catalyst the womens research organization has found that women face "an impossible double bind" when they seek leadership jobs when they act in stereotypical feminine ways showing "caring and concern for others" theyre judged less competent a recent survey of more than female executives found yet if theyre "assertive " theyre judged in performance reviews as "too tough " in addition the study found that women have to prove over and over again that theyre competent and they rarely are perceived as both competent and likable "were watching this double bind play out before our eyes on the campaign trail " says ilene h lang president of catalyst yet "playing the gender card" or complaining that theyve been attacked held back or discriminated against because they are women only makes matters worse many women say "sure theres still discrimination but women have to figure out a way to get around and beyond it " says kay koplovitz chairman of liz claiborne inc and a sen clinton backer "if you pull the gender card you just diminish your strength as a leader " following sen clintons rocky showing in a debate with six opponents in philadelphia two weeks ago one of her strategists complained there had been a piling on against her implying indirectly that her male rivals were beating up on the sole woman in the race but within a few days after a denial by sen obama and criticism from several political columnists that she was playing victim sen clinton corrected that impression "i dont think theyre picking on me because im a woman i think theyre picking on me because im winning " she said at a news conference at the capitol after filing papers to run in the new hampshire primary then she added in a reversal of a famous remark she once made about how she did not want to stay home and bake cookies "i anticipate its going to get even hotter and if you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen and im very much at home in the kitchen " other executive women say theyve also learned to distinguish between sexist remarks and tough criticism about their job performance and to accept that there are times when theyll be judged differently than men if youre a woman leader and youre giving a speech or being interviewed by the media "you are bound to be asked personal questions such as how you balance work and family or where you got your shoes " says cathie black president of hearst magazines a division of hearst corp and author of "basic black the essential guide for getting ahead at work and in life " "it comes with the territory and i dont think railing about it gets you anywhere " she adds her personal strategy she says is to "accept it " answer a few questions and then say firmly "ok thats enough lets move on " its the same in politics ms black says where a woman will have to convince voters shes the best candidate rather than try to seek sympathy if she is attacked "to run you need tremendous fortitude not just for one day but every day for months and you have to handle the daily battles " says ms black who hasnt decided whom she will back indeed some of the most successful women in business say theyve learned to stop worrying so much about gender and to focus on leading "the successful women i know in business academia and elsewhere think of themselves as leaders who happen to be women" not as female executives female college presidents or female politicians says nancy koehn a harvard business school professor the real challenge of course is to get everyone else to think of them that way as well email me at inthelead wsj com see related letters "letters to the
