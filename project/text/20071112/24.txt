solar thermal investment plans on the part of electric power provider fpl group inc which said recently it plans to invest &# billion over several years in solar thermal and renewable energy projects development of solar thermal power in california also is likely to be helped by a regulatory change the california independent system operator corp the agency that governs transmission planning has proposed allowing utilities to borrow money to build out transmission lines to areas rich in renewable energy potential and then get reimbursed by new developers as they start using the capacity currently the first developer to need transmission has to pay the cost for building it and then let others use it without paying for the development a significant barrier for developers of wind and solar thermal energy which is often in remote places "you cant transport the wind or the sun " says a spokeswoman for the california iso "thats why we feel this is needed " ms chernova and mr shieber
