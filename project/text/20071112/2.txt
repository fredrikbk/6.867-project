americas more trouble for chavez in december venezuelan dictator marcos perez jimenez held a plebiscite on his presidency by going through the exercise of a national vote he thought he would legitimize his rule which a military junta had handed him five years earlier in the event his government said he won but venezuelans werent convinced within a month a popular uprising drove him from the presidential palace and out of the country next month will mark the golden jubilee of perez jimenezs fateful december "triumph " which provoked his demise and opened a space for democracy to emerge in coincidentally the anniversary falls in the same month as a referendum called by president hugo chavez on constitutional reforms that will among other things allow him to rule for life like the last dictator mr chavez believes that if he can show that a majority of voters back his power grab his government will have won the imprimatur of democracy but now as then venezuelans are putting up a fight mr chavez has already consolidated his power by getting control of venezuelas political institutions but now he wants to close any remaining loopholes by writing his absolute rule into the constitution the trouble is that according to the document a major rewrite of the text can be carried out only by an elected constitutional assembly this process is designed to preserve some measure of democratic pluralism and by trying to skip it the president has provoked a firestorm of criticism mr chavez has been working to remove any counterbalances to his power for almost nine years now over that time he has met strong resistance from property owners businesses labor leaders the catholic church and the media but since the spring when university students of varying backgrounds began to lead an opposition movement against his crackdown on civil liberties many have wondered whether chavismo has begun to lose the support of the population more broadly in opposition to the dec referendum university students have redoubled their efforts in the streets and a number of the presidents heretofore backers have joined the chorus all of which has led to increased speculation that mr chavezs days are numbered its easy to see what mr chavez is after besides lifting presidential term limits the referendum proposes to allow the media to be censored and civil liberties suspended under a state of emergency to permit the government seizure of private property to mandate a six hour work day to increase presidential power over state authorities and to end central bank autonomy up to now the fiery orator has had a rather easy time of rolling over his opponents to counter their claims that he is taking venezuela down the cuban path he has simply sounded the battle cry of class warfare and pointed to the corruption of former governments the opposition has been fragmented and easily thwarted by a demagogue who promises to spread the oil wealth more equally but this year something has gone terribly wrong with the formula as evidenced by the dissent coming from previously supportive quarters mr chavezs decision to strip prominent media critic rctv of its broadcasting license earlier this year may mark the tipping point assaults on private property and the jailing of opponents over the year hadnt produced much of a response from university students but the clampdown on free speech set them off they poured into the streets amid tear gas and rubber bullets yet notably never called for mr chavez to leave office instead they chanted for "liberty " while they lost their bid to save rctv they gained respect with the public as a credible voice against one man rule now the students are back in the streets putting up a fight against the referendum in the past three weeks tens of thousands have marched to the congress the electoral council and most recently to the supreme court they are a problem for the president not the least because their leaders are from middle and low middle income backgrounds and cannot be dismissed as "elites " moreover their defense of civil liberties seems to resonate with an increasing number of venezuelans they say that they are opponents not of mr chavez per se but of the destruction of the countrys institutions that guarantee freedoms last week mr chavez suffered another political setback this time from his former minister of defense gen raul baduel who said that if the president gets his amendments it will amount to a "coup" against the democracy thats a serious charge from any member of the armed forces but coming from gen baduel it is devastating he was a key player in restoring mr chavez to power when others in the military had removed the president briefly in april his criticism raises questions about whether mr chavez is losing support within the barracks yet another high profile defector from the chavez camp is hermann escarra a constitutional law scholar and one of the architects of the constitution which mr chavez has so often cited as sacred mr escarra opposes the referendum has joined the students in their protests and has vowed that he will not retreat most university rectors also back the students if public support for mr chavez is waning it may not be due entirely to his politics inflation could finish the year above and milk and sugar are extremely hard to come by still analysts believe that the opposition is too weak to derail him at this time and that the referendum will be carried out regardless of its popularity nevertheless just as perez jimenez found holding the vote cant reverse mr chavezs political fortunes if he has fallen from grace surely he knows this and it is why he has been preparing for a showdown his supporters are armed as we saw on wednesday when students returning to the university from a protest march were ambushed by gun toting pro chavez goons one student was shot tragically if venezuelans decide mr chavez should go it is not likely to happen without more such violence
