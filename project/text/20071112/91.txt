this writers strike feels like a rerun from new technology is still big issue and viewers could be lost forever nineteen years ago when the writers guild of america last called a strike television was still in its pleistocene era dvds the internet time shifting and ad zapping didnt exist cable and home video were still relatively new "the cosby show" was no and much of the cast of "gossip girl" was barely out of diapers but the underlying issues in the strike were pretty much the same as they are this time new technologies and markets were out there but no one was sure what form they would take and by the end television had been set on a different course accelerating a shift in viewers to cable and an increase in unscripted programming tv writers are once again fighting for a greater share of an unknown future this time digital rights but shifts in the entertainment landscape over the last two decades from the explosion of original cable programming to the popularity of youtube may make the industry even more susceptible to drastic changes in viewing habits and programming styles this time around "the balance of power has changed so dramatically in that year period " says tim brooks a tv historian who worked at nbc during the strike "theres an enormous danger for the networks in the protracted absence of their high profile programming " a week into the new strike tensions remain high many writer producers who have stopped overseeing their shows have received threatening letters from their studios no negotiations are scheduled and some on both sides suggest a tipping point could be on the horizon if talks dont resume soon "right now i think saving face is as important to both sides as the economic questions " says john bowman head of the wgas negotiating committee bob daly who was the chief executive of warner bros during the last strike recalls similar reticence in "people dont want to blink first what im afraid of is it could happen here " he says among the key wga demands is an increase in payments for writers recycled or original work distributed on new media to an across the board rate of of revenue from varying rates depending on the use before negotiations broke down more than a week ago another key issue had been dvd residuals a category where writers believe they were shortchanged in previous contracts but the producers refused to budge on that and the writers took dvds off the table at least for now in the earlier strike the sabers began to rattle in late with the producers demanding that writers accept a sliding scale on residuals or payments when a writers work is recycled from domestic syndicated reruns of one hour shows citing a decline in syndication prices according to people involved meanwhile writers were agitating for a greater piece of another big revenue engine of the day foreign sales they also wanted more creative control over their scripts these people say neither side moved much on those central issues over the following months at a m pacific time on march the contract expired and the strike began a week later the timing is significant unlike the earlier strike which stretched through spring when tv production was winding down and summer when reruns were ubiquitous the current one is coming at the height of tv production in the networks managed to pad out their spring schedules with reruns and movies to make it through the end of the season relatively unscathed at a time when the notion of september premieres was much more important than it is today the schedule was delayed by about six weeks and some hour long dramas didnt start trickling back onto the schedule until december but the timing "softened the impact " recalls one network executive nonetheless prime time ratings for the three major broadcast networks fell that fall from a year earlier while they rose at ad supported cable channels according to nielsen media research the cable channels werent hurt by the writers strike because there was little original scripted programming on cable in those days "a lot of people saw that cable was a good alternative went there and didnt come back " says warren littlefield who was executive vice president of prime time programming at nbc entertainment at the time though the networks now have a reserve of reality shows they can rush into production the danger is amplified for them this time because cable offers much more original programming now and its scripted shows are completed further in advance to say nothing of the proliferation of online video alternatives in part the networks post strike schedules in were hampered by a hodgepodge of remakes prime time news magazines and other reality programming ted harbert a former abc executive who was responsible for strike planning decided to take old scripts from "mission impossible" and reshoot them in australia nbc converted its "unsolved mysteries" specials into a regular series cbs added "high risk " about people with dangerous jobs and abc showed such specials as "super model search" and "the special olympics christmas party " hosted by maria shriver and arnold schwarzenegger "the main job was to come up with as many specials and as many movies to fill the schedule as possible " says mr harbert now president and chief executive of comcast entertainment group the networks strike programming ended up having a long term impact the proliferation of what later came to be widely known as "reality" shows foxs "cops" made its debut later that season and unscripted series became increasingly popular in the s over the summer of some independent producers found a way around the strike by signing interim deals with the writers guild something that could conceivably happen again carsey werner co for example signed an agreement that among other things allowed it to return to work on a new show about an overweight "domestic goddess " the show "roseanne" went back into production over the summer and that season it upended "a different world" as the no show on tv as time wore on dissent grew among the writers they rejected a settlement offer that included greater creative rights from the alliance of motion picture and television producers "there was a lot of contention among guild members " recalls steven bochco who produced such shows as "hill street blues " "i used to go to meetings and listen to people shriek " a conciliator eventually entered the picture entertainment lawyer ken ziffren a familiar behind the scenes hollywood fixer toward the end of july mr ziffren conducted what people involved describe as "shuttle diplomacy " meeting with guild representatives and the chief executives of various studios as well as nick counter then as now the producers negotiator in early august after each side had agreed to soften some positions according to people involved mr ziffren met with them at the amptp headquarters in sherman oaks calif after about hours both sides finally compromised and struck a deal according to people present producers revised the foreign formula and writers agreed to a sliding scale on domestic syndication residuals for one hour series says tom wertheimer an executive vice president of mca at the time "everybody was happy to have it over " peter sanders contributed to this article
