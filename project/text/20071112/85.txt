the soft underbelly of europe though no longer the chief delinquent of europe and though not much thought is given to its strategic position germany is still europes center of gravity territorially contiguous to more nations than any state other than russia with compact interior lines of communication western europes largest population and europes leading economy facts like these assert themselves through every kind of historical fluctuation even if america now sees germany the way stop for airlifters en route to iraq and afghanistan as a kind of giant aircraft carrier with sausages but germany is no doubt the subject of far deeper consideration on the one hand by russia and on the other by jihadists the line from paris to moscow which has been traveled from west to east by the french east to west by the russians and in both directions by the germans is a road that invariably attracts continental powers on the brink of military predominance whether in fact or the imagination during the cold war it was responsibly fortified and blocked but no longer whereas in we kept in europe troops tanks operating air bases and combat aircraft we now keep approximately a fifth of that whereas the germans in could field a half million men and tanks they now can deploy less than half that number as the soviet union dissolved much of its military capacity followed it into oblivion but as western europe dismantles its militaries russia builds encouraged as much by european pacifism as by the russian view of americas struggle in iraq as a parallel to the soviets fatal involvement in afghanistan like germany between the wars russia is now eager and determined to reconstitute its forces and with its new found oil wealth it is doing so how fortuitous for it then that the united states is expending military capital without replenishment and europe has spiritually resigned from its own defense with germany for example now devoting only of its gdp to the task having been deeply humiliated in recent years russia is sure to seek redress if not in action then at least in the power to act nations behave this way it has always been so and as the balance of power in europe and the world is shifting germany the strategic gate to western europe and by its nature and position that which stabilizes or disrupts the continent sleeps and dreams unaware germany must fascinate the jihadists too not for displacing america as the prime target but as the richest target least defended though it will never happen they believe that islam will conquer the world and so they try unlike the u s europe is not removed from them by an ocean and in it are million of their co religionists among whom they can disappear and find support perhaps out of habit europe is also kind to mass murderers who if caught spend a few years in a comfortable prison sharpening their resolve before they are released to fight again in july the french sentenced eight terrorists connected to the murder of people to terms ranging from one year suspended to years in spain with dead and wounded the perpetrators will spend no more than years behind soft bars though in germany found a september th facilitator guilty of counts of accessory to murder and sentenced him to seven years hours per person he was recently reconvicted and sentenced to hours per person not counting parole but more importantly the variations in european attitudes and capabilities vis a vis responding to terrorism or nuclear blackmail are what make germany such an attractive target unlike the u s france and britain germany is a major country with no independent expeditionary capability and no nuclear weapons making it ideal for a terrorist nuclear strike or iranian extortion if iran is able to continue a very transparent nuclear policy to its logical conclusion though it is conceivable that after the shock of losing washington or chicago the u s or britain after birmingham france after lyon would even without an address certain release a second strike it is very unlikely that even with an address certain any nuclear power would launch in behalf of another nation nato ally or not absent an explicit arrangement such as the dual key structure during the cold war looking at germany then iran sees a country with nothing to counter the pressure of merely an implied nuclear threat jihadists see the lynchpin of europe easy of access and inadvertently hospitable to operations that will hardly punish those who fall into its hands and that can neither accomplish on its own a flexible expeditionary response against a hostile base or sponsor nor reply to a nuclear strike in kind thus the german government should be especially nervous about cargos trucked overland from the east what might be done nato could abandon the mistaken belief that europe having seen the end of history and the end of war will always be in the clear it could publicly make known to russia that for the purpose of maintaining the balance of power necessary to keep the gate to western europe closed and the prospects of war dim it will judiciously and proportionally match russian military expansion for its own protection and thus that of europe germany could more closely integrate and where appropriate reintegrate itself into the expeditionary and nuclear retaliatory structures of the u s britain and france without moving nuclear weapons forward to german soil end leniency for terrorists step up defensive measures as if it is just about to be hit and embrace limited missile defense against potentially nuclear armed iranian intermediate range ballistic missiles rather than accept the russian thesis that interceptors will perturb the nuclear equation what are the chances of this though the west comprises the richest grouping of nations the world has ever seen it has somehow come to believe not only that it is not entitled to its customary defenses but that it cannot afford them and looking ahead strategically so as to outmaneuver crisis and war has unfortunately long been out of fashion mr helprin a senior fellow at the claremont institute and a distinguished visiting fellow at
