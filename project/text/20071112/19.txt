energy a special report producers the big thirst ethanol producers face a huge challenge ensuring they dont deplete water supplies in the corn belt ethanol plants sprouting up across the corn belt have brought with them some of the best financial opportunities seen in those areas in a generation producers of ethanol have pumped nearly &# billion into a wide array of businesses and the resulting economic boost has created more than jobs since the corn based gasoline additive gained popularity two years ago at first glance ethanol may seem like a panacea for a weak economy in the midwest but critics point to hidden costs associated with the new ethanol plants rising corn prices for consumers gasoline that gets fewer miles per gallon and perhaps most ominous potential water shortages "we and lots of environmentalists are in a tough spot " says timothy male a senior scientist with the environmental defense fund in washington d c "biofuels have a lot of promise but theres an issue with waste and water " mr male says "any time youre putting a high water use industry in the middle of the desert its a concern " ethanol plants are going up in places "where there were already too many straws in the ground " he says the amount of water needed to grow the corn process the fuel and dispose of the waste at a small ethanol plant is about equal to the water needs of a town of about according to an environmental defense fund report and although the next five to years may not see major changes to the plains regions water levels long term implications could be severe says a study from the national research council a washington d c based public policy research institute the council and other scientific groups are worried about the declining ogallala aquifer an underground body of water that stretches from texas to wyoming water levels in the aquifer have fallen more than feet in the past years and may drop further as ethanol plants multiply in the region diminution of the ogallala beyond a certain point could begin to harm human animal and plant life in the region yet even staunch opponents of ethanols rising profile say that the fuel may be able to avoid seriously sapping regional water supplies if producers and policy makers focus on addressing the fuels thirst for drinkable water "as biofuels production expands and technology advances there is a real opportunity to shape policies to also meet objectives related to water use and quality impacts " the research councils report says the report made recommendations on tighter restrictions for plant locations and where corn for the plants can be grown the environmental defense fund too agrees that plant placement can have an impact and suggests that the viability of the ogallala aquifer could be sustained if fewer ethanol plants are concentrated in vulnerable areas ethanol producers say they are prepared for the challenges as the business expands and are ready to adapt quickly producers plant designers and water engineers are all teaming up to try to reduce water consumption says matt hartwig a spokesman for the renewable fuels association a washington d c based group that represents ethanol producers producers as small as newcomer us bioenergy of st paul minn and as big as archer daniels midland co of decatur ill have discussed measures to reduce their impact "historically ethanol plant constructors have tried to standardize the design and just bang them out like cookies " says paul greene global director food beverage and biofuels industries for siemens water technologies a division of germanys siemens ag "weve seen that you cant do that " ethanol plants currently require about four gallons of water to produce a single gallon of ethanol mr greene says as the size of plants increase from producing about million gallons of ethanol a year to million or million gallons a year a single plant will consume as much water as a city of mr greene says as plants are built outside the midwest increasingly encroaching on drought plagued states like florida and california the impact could be more severe mr greene says significant technical innovations are required to reduce the amounts of water that ethanol plants consume one ethanol plant designer delta t corp based in williamsburg va says it has created a system that will reduce consumption to just one and a half gallons of water per gallon of ethanol down from four gallons of water to further reduce the plants impact on drinkable water engineers also can route more low quality water even waste water to functions where high purity is unnecessary in the past two years demand for engineers experienced in this kind of work has skyrocketed in the ethanol industry mr greene says cutting the water needed to grow corn is a taller order still companies can do a better job of controlling run off from irrigation and reducing amounts of water contaminated by fertilizer developing more advanced ethanol made from crops other than corn may also lessen the burden on the water table still these fuels have yet to be produced in commercial volumes and may have unknown environmental impacts of their own despite concerns growing more corn and building more plants may be needed to keep up with u s mandates for renewable fuel according to ron oster a st louis based analyst with broadpoint capital inc the u s can currently produce about seven billion gallons of ethanol a year a little more than the amount required federally new production to come online by the end of this year and additions in the years that follow should increase capacity by about billion gallons by but if the energy bill pending in congress passes more than billion gallons of alternative fuel production will be mandated and with ethanol as the most easily available renewable fuel there could be a dramatic upswing in new cornfields and ethanol production facilities concerns over the ramifications of the bill have led to some unlikely bedfellows the national petrochemical and refiners association for example doesnt want to see legislation taking the place of market demand when it comes to determining how much ethanol should be produced the energy bills ethanol mandate could impact the bottom line of members of the washington d c based trade organization to help block such a mandate the group has joined the environmentalists and others expressing concerns about water "theres an impact in terms of both water quantity and quality " says bill holbrook a spokesman for the group mandated production also could drive ethanol supplies beyond the volume that the market is able to readily absorb he adds the ethanol industry for its part is quick to point out that failing to accept the mandate might still result in a drain on water canadian oil reserves seen as a possible source of conventional fuel for the u s produce a thick grade of oil that requires just as much if not more water for refining than ethanol does says mr hartwig "the water from that refining process is so toxic that it has to be put into holding ponds so large they can be seen from space and it takes years to separate " he
