st jude defibrillator wire gets scrutiny new accounts of patients with heart perforations are set to be published in the wake of a heart defibrillator wire recall by medtronic inc reports are emerging that some defibrillator wires made by st jude medical inc are in rare instances puncturing holes in the hearts of cardiac patients the devices in question the riata line of defibrillator leads from st jude are wires that connect defibrillators to patients hearts they are affixed to the heart wall and are designed to sense when the hearts rhythm has gone haywire the defibrillator then is supposed to dispatch an electric shock but in some reported cases rather than staying attached to the heart the riata leads are poking holes through the heart and in some cases nearly poking through the patients skin such events are potentially very serious when the lead cant sense aberrant heart rhythms the patient can die from the underlying medical condition or the heart can bleed into the pericardial sac surrounding it causing a lethal condition called cardiac tamponade in which pressure builds around the heart and it cant beat effectively such occurrences can happen with any defibrillator lead st jude said in its own monitoring of the riatas performance it hasnt seen anything to suggest riata leads are linked to more heart "perforations" than are any other defibrillator leads the most recent cases are the accounts of four patients in nebraska new york city and the czech republic expected to be posted online today by the medical journal pace these cases have been reported to st jude and to the food and drug administration in one case at montefiore medical center in new york the tip of the lead was within seven millimeters of the surface of the skin said an associate editor of the journal stephen c vlay dr vlay a cardiologist and heart rhythm specialist at stony brook university in stony brook n y described the case in an interview as "kind of scary " "there is a legitimate concern that the problem may be more than physician misadventure and that there may be an inherent design flaw at least in some models of the riata lead " dr vlay wrote in an editorial to be published online today st jude of st paul minn said it has created three "registries " or large studies of devices on the market that focus on patients getting the riata and others of st judes cardiac devices it has found in one such registry a rate of perforation of in patients implanted with all riata leads eric fain president of st judes cardiac rhythm management division said perforation rates with the riata leads implanted so far are at or lower than those reported for other defibrillator leads "youre looking at very low rates " he said "weve set up a system that actively encourages physicians to report" adverse events heart doctors stress these patients face a far greater risk of death from their underlying disease than from the possibility their devices might not work properly dr vlay however questioned whether manufacturers or the fda get a true picture of perforations from leads because doctors dont always report these experiences reports earlier this year published in the journal heart rhythm described higher perforation rates than those cited by st jude in april massachusetts general hospital reported a rate of perforations five out of with certain models of riata leads a subsequent letter to heart rhythm by mass general doctors reported three more perforation cases with other riata leads doctors from new york hospital queens also reported in a heart rhythm letter that they saw five perforations out of riata leads implanted those doctors ranjit suri and seth keller wrote "we have stopped using the riata lead " some cases of perforations with riata leads also were reported to the federal governments database of adverse events at least four reports of patient deaths in the database mention perforations and riata leads though some of the problems may stem from doctors actions the database which lacks detail in many cases contains several dozen other reports involving the riata and perforations in october the sprint fidelis defibrillator lead made by medtronic was pulled from the market after the company found it was fracturing at a higher rate than another medtronic lead the sprint quattro the sprint fidelis is a thin diameter model as are some of the riata leads an fda spokeswoman karen riley said "we are actively looking at whether lead size and configuration pose unique safety and performance issues "
