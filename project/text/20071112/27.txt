ethanol backlash like water seeping out of the giant high plains ogallala aquifer support for corn ethanol seems to be ebbing in congress as political news goes this is of the miracle variety but apparently the market distortions caused by ethanol mandates are finally having an impact "were in a strong position " says senator john cornyn the texas republican who is blocking a conference on the energy bill because the house version contains billions in new oil taxes to be spent on ethanol subsidies meanwhile in the house theres opposition to the senates mandate to increase ethanol production by billion gallons annually by lets review the house energy bill taxes oil to subsidize ethanol drawing senate opposition while the senate bill forces u s consumers to buy more ethanol drawing house opposition seems to us that the two chambers could simply agree that expanding on the already enormous subsidies for ethanol is a costly mistake and go home to enjoy thanksgiving dinner but we dont pretend to fully understand the ways of congress what we do understand is that opposition to corn based ethanol from environmentalists has speaker nancy pelosi seeking a rewrite of the senates mandate as the speaker attempts to fashion a stripped down bill that can move in both houses the houses tax and subsidy scheme for ethanol also doesnt appear to be part of the package and with good reason last month the national academy of sciences reported on the impact of ethanol production on water supplies a university of iowa professor chaired the report committee so big corn might have hoped for a home court advantage but nas reported that "in some areas of the country water resources are already significantly stressed increased biofuels production will likely add pressure to the water management challenges the nation already faces as biofuels drive changing agricultural practices increased corn production and growth in the number of biorefineries " when ethanol is criticized by scientists at iowas two largest state universities you have to wonder who is for it meanwhile investors are figuring out that these government policies are turning water into an increasingly scarce resource on which money can be made last week brought news that legendary oilman t boone pickens has purchased acres of water rights in the texas panhandle this will allow him to dip a straw into the ogallala aquifer portions of which "show water table declines of over feet since about the s " according to the nas report when oil barons decide theres money in drilling for scarce water in the american west its time for congress to stop subsidizing an inefficient and thirsty energy source that soaks up more of that water ethanol has prospered on taxpayer subsidies fed by political panic over oil prices and old fashioned congressional log rolling its about time that some in congress are finally stopping to inspect ethanols many and growing costs
