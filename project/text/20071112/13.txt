energy a special report consumers a new generation renewable energy increasingly begins at home two years ago after stan gelber had retired and started an internet company out of his home in santa cruz calif he took a good long look at his &# a year utility bill and decided to make a change "my electric bill was skyrocketing " he says "i really needed to get a handle on what was going out versus what was coming in " mr gelbers solution was to purchase a solar power generator for his home with rooftop photovoltaic panels he says that while concern about the environment played a role in his decision to go solar economics convinced him to take the plunge "im in support of anything that will address global warming and our power consumption " the year old mr gelber says "thats very important to me but i think thats secondary to the economics of it its going to pay for itself in eight to years and essentially i have free electricity for the rest of my life " as electricity prices rise and government incentives and technology improvements make renewable power systems more affordable a growing number of people are embracing self generation and while as much as of the demand for home solar power generation is in california the state with the most generous financial incentives the market is growing in other states including new jersey and new york and could take off nationwide if more states implement favorable rules and funding advocates say "this market wouldnt be happening without these government incentives " says lisa frantzis managing director of renewable and distributed energy at navigant consulting an independent consulting firm in burlington mass "theres a convergence with prices coming down concern about climate change volatility in the power market and people concerned about energy security " by far the most widely used home renewable power systems are rooftop solar panels that absorb the suns rays and convert them into electricity in california people who install their own solar power or other renewable generators can get rebates of as much as &# per watt of electricity produced residential customers of san francisco based pg&amp e corp utility pacific gas &amp electric co who install an average size system of about watts can expect to obtain a rebate of at least &# utility spokesman keely wachs says californias rebates are based on the electricity output of the solar generator the highest performing most efficient system would qualify for the full &# per watt rebate whereas systems on roofs that have heavy shade or smaller surface areas for example would qualify for a lower rebate amount such as &# &# &# or less per watt mr wachs says in the first nine months of this year requests for solar rebates from both residential and commercial customers covered megawatts of electricity generated the california public utilities commission has reported that is slightly less than the megawatts of solar power installed in california over the previous years the regulators said almost of this years applications are from consumers eager to generate their own electricity mr gelber says that after rebates his solar power system cost about &# to install the system which gets full sun generates about watts of electricity enough to satisfy mr gelbers daytime energy needs including multiple computers and appliances after dark mr gelber and his wife jean pierog rely on power supplied by pg&amp e mr gelbers system feeds electricity into the utility grid and any surplus is used as a credit toward the cost of power purchased from the utility on cloudy days or at night a process known as net metering if a resident like mr gelber produces more power than he or she consumes the homes utility bill is zero mr gelber says he ends up paying pg&amp e about &# a year installing a home solar power generator can take quite a bit of effort california requires extensive documentation before it pays a rebate and building permits are required to install a solar power system as are scheduled inspections by the local utility county and city mr gelber also had to replace the roof on his house to ensure that it would be able to handle the extra weight of the solar panels and converter "theres a lot of work putting them in " mr gelber says of solar power generators "its not a spur of the moment thing " in its northern california service territory pg&amp e charges tiered rates for electricity between cents and cents a kilowatt hour depending on usage a kilowatt hour equals the energy needed to run a watt bulb for hours utility spokesman john tremayne says the average pg&amp e customer pays about cents a kilowatt hour including surcharges and fees solar power generated with photovoltaic panels meanwhile will run a homeowner about to cents a kilowatt hour assuming a cost of &# to install a system that produces kilowatt hours of electricity over years according to barry cinnamon president and chief executive of akeena solar inc a solar power installer based in los gatos calif some customers have managed to cut their installation costs to as little as &# after state rebates and a &# federal tax credit which over a year period would produce power for about to cents a kilowatt hour according to mr cinnamon who says pg&amp e rates in his area are around cents a kilowatt hour after surcharges and fees californias incentive program is the gold standard among advocates of solar power when demand exceeded expectations last year regulators expanded the states self generation incentive budget to &# million from &# million this year the state earmarked &# billion for solar generation incentives over years with a goal of installing megawatts by new jersey has a rebate program too but it ran into trouble last year when demand far exceeded allotted funding new jersey consumers now have to wait sometimes a year or more for a rebate but the state has a separate funding program under its renewable power mandate for utilities that offers consumers cents to cents a kilowatt hour for their solar generation in return for those payments the local utility collects renewable energy credits that it can use to comply with new jerseys requirement that all power providers use renewables for of their retail power by the u s currently has about megawatts of installed generation from solar panels connected to the grid according to research by the consulting firm navigant that represents less than of all of the electricity generated in the u s about half of that generation comes from residential solar generators if state policies remain unchanged generation from solar panels in the u s both from commercial and residential generators is expected to grow to megawatts by with of those megawatts in california according to the research navigant compiled for the u s department of energy growth in the home solar power market wont take off until more states adopt favorable net metering rules advocates say not only do such rules help offset the cost of installing a renewable power system they also prevent electricity from being wasted if every state that currently limits the amount of self generated renewable power that can be sold back to the grid lifted those caps an additional megawatts of solar panel generation would likely be developed in the next eight years navigant said in its study for the doe a separate report published by new energy choices a nonprofit clean energy research firm in new york graded states on their rules for net metering and interconnection or allowing home generators to connect and send power to the grid as of september states had adopted programs and rules for compensating consumers for sending self generated renewable power to the grid according to the report which was produced with help from the interstate renewable energy council california new jersey pennsylvania and maryland garnered the highest marks for net metering while a number of states received low scores because of barriers in their policies such as requirements that force consumers to purchase extra equipment or pay extra fees to participate says shaun chapman a spokesman at new energy choices states without net metering rules didnt make the list at all mr chapman says those states include south dakota kansas south carolina mississippi alabama tennessee florida and arizona though the latter two states are working on adopting such rules "while its true we dont have rules most of our utilities now have net metering " says kristin mayes a member of the arizona corporation commission which regulates the states electric utilities small utilities that serve about of the state dont have net metering programs however "which is why were adopting statewide rules " she says ms sweet is a news editor for dow jones newswires in jersey city n j she can be reached at cassandra sweet dowjones com
