politics &amp economics u s says extended oversight of microsoft isnt necessary washington the justice department told a judge it sees no reason to extend restrictive antitrust oversight of microsoft corp countering a recent move by a group of states to extend oversight for another five years "there is no basis for the court to order a five year extension of the final judgments " the department said citing a lack of evidence that such oversight is justified last month u s district judge colleen kollar kotelly extended the oversight to january it resulted from a settlement among microsoft the federal government and some states in an antitrust case against the company judge kollar kotelly said the extension was necessary to have all of the parties arguments filed and reviewed microsoft is required under the arrangement to regularly check in with the u s district court for the district of columbia and to answer questions about its competitive behavior the oversight had been scheduled to expire today the extension to january followed a move in october by states including california and new york to extend the oversight to the states argued that microsoft still dominates the software market to an unsettling degree and thus requires strict monitoring but the justice department said that the states arguments are "inadequate and mutually inconsistent" and that microsofts dominance per se isnt cause for restrictions microsoft had been pursued by the justice department under the clinton administration over accusations of anticompetitive behavior the settlement reached despite the reservations of some states seemed to end the wrangling while ensuring that microsoft remained under close observation
