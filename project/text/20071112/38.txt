piece in his piano recital when his right hand began to wobble the japanese pianist now finished the edvard grieg piece with his left hand and collapsed he was having a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body "in an instant i lost all the music that i had accumulated inside me for over years " he says mr tateno still hasnt gained command of his right hand but after a long soul searching journey he is back on stage performing dozens of concerts a year he plays music composed especially for the left hand sitting on a custom made bench that stretches across the length of the piano to give his left hand full sweep of the keyboard he has appeared in several documentaries and has even played a duet with empress michiko "many people have told me i should just take it easy " says the soft spoken mr tateno "but i am not interested in taking it easy i dont even know how to i want to perform as i have done in the past years so i can share my music with others " mr tatenos drive to rebuild his career after a late life illness has resonated in japan in the rapidly aging nation where of the population is over millions are eager to find ways to make their last decades of life meaningful thousands of seniors have applied to the japan international cooperation agency the local equivalent of the peace corps in hopes of serving as volunteers in developing nations others are starting up new businesses or signing up to volunteer to help bedridden seniors and working mothers with young children hideo yasuhara a year old retiree who had a stroke three years ago attended one of mr tatenos concerts in september and was inspired mr yasuhara a former department store worker was already keeping busy taking computer and calligraphy courses at a community center near his house in western japan after the concert he decided to step up his rehab for his left hand signing up for an intensive three week session "mr tateno made me think i could do so much more with my life " mr yasuhara says born in in tokyo to a pianist mother and a cellist father mr tateno grew up in a home filled with music he had his debut as a classical pianist in tokyo and moved to helsinki in lured by the literature and the "pure and slightly sad" atmosphere of finland he married maria holopainen a finnish singer and they had two children mr tateno lived in finland but regularly performed in japan captivating japanese fans with the romantic music of grieg and jean sibelius over the years he gave concerts and made nearly recordings he had just celebrated his th anniversary as a professional pianist when he collapsed on stage in a town north of helsinki during the first few months after his stroke mr tateno assumed he would be back performing in a matter of months but once home he grew frustrated with the lack of progress he could move his fingers on his right hand but it was impossible to hit the same key repeatedly sympathetic friends suggested that he play the "concerto for the left hand" by maurice ravel one of the few widely known piano pieces for the left hand but the mere mention of ravel upset him he wanted to play with two hands playing that piece felt like an admission of defeat "i thought i would never play ravel even if i were dead " mr tateno wrote in a collection of essays called "the sea of sunflower" published in "i said to hell with music for the left hand " mr tateno spent his time going to rehab sessions and trying different masseurs in early mr tatenos son janne visited from chicago where he was studying violin janne tateno had found a few piano scores written for the left hand in a chicago music store but he didnt give them to his father right away afraid that he might be offended he left the scores on his fathers piano mr tateno didnt talk about the scores or attempt to play them while janne was visiting but one day he picked up one called "three improvisations for the left hand " by british composer frank bridge who had written the music for a friend who had lost his right arm during world war i mr tateno began to play and got so immersed he says that he forgot he was playing with just one hand "thats when i came to realize that music was music whether you play it with one hand or two hands or three " he says "that realization changed me completely " actually quite a few scores for the left hand existed many were composed for soldiers injured in wars the largest collection was written for pianist paul wittgenstein the son of a wealthy austrian industrialist who lost his right arm during world war i mr wittgenstein who later moved to the u s commissioned composers including ravel to write music for the left hand the ravel piece has also been played by leon fleisher an american pianist who temporarily lost the use of his right hand because of illness and gary graffman another american pianist performing with the left hand who also plays several left hand pieces commissioned for himself still many left hand pieces were short and not fit for the concert hall mr tateno asked a few old friends to help among them was takashi yoshimatsu a japanese composer of contemporary music known for his romantic style "when he first came to me he had a lot of anxiety not sure if he could go back to the stage with just one hand " says mr yoshimatsu other composers including music students pitched in creating a library of about pieces in the fall of mr tateno returned to performing with a series of small recitals in japan to give his left hand a rest and to make up for his short performance he talked with the audience at one event a woman asked whether he was frustrated that he couldnt play most of the music he knew "how can i be dissatisfied when i can express myself fully through music " mr tateno replied mr tateno recorded the first of several cds of music for the left hand and in tokyo in the spring of he performed ravels "concerto for the left hand " the piece he had shunned after his stroke during a performance last year mr tateno suddenly felt an urge to play a simple melody with his right hand he tried it and it worked mr tateno saw his wife maria sitting in the audience with tears in her eyes "when i play with the right hand i get a gentle feeling similar to new leaves coming out in the spring " mr tateno wrote in an introduction to his latest tour "they are still delicate but maybe in time they will grow strong " see related letter "letters to the editor healing with music grit" wsj nov
