the raffles lermitage hotel the life of the top democratic donor and self professed clothing magnate was coming unraveled mr hsu a slight year old immigrant from hong kong was under investigation for campaign finance violations an old grand theft charge had come back to haunt him sen hillary rodham clinton and other politicians had begun returning his donations he was so distraught that he sent off suicide notes before leaving his manhattan home for california still he appeared unruffled when he settled into the hotels cafe to comfort a nervous investor martin waters mr hsu was dressed in jeans prada shoes a black t shirt and a baseball cap "dont believe what you are reading " mr hsu said according to mr waters who owns a small clothing company and was owed more than &# million for deals he and his friends made with mr hsu "plenty of people are still supporting me " mr hsu assured him mentioning pennsylvanias governor who initially stood by him when news of his troubles broke

and election law violations accusing him of running a "massive" ponzi scheme that cost investors more than &# million mr hsus story has received considerable public scrutiny over the past few months but one question still looms large how did his classic immigrant pursuit of the american dream become so twisted an in depth look at mr hsus peculiar rise and abrupt fall reveals a man consumed with a desire to gain respect and wealth even as his scattershot business ventures failed at every turn in politics he found everything he seemed to be looking for glamorous friends acclaim and a measure of credibility that he used to help attract investors to his dubious business pitches his business failures and resulting deceptions required him to construct a facade to those who met him he seemed a success filled with confidence warmth generosity and sincerity but he was dogged by lawsuits and angry creditors once outwitting an intimidating debt collector nicknamed "shrimp boy" by telling police he was being kidnapped he would tap one circle of friends then disappear only to turn up later with new friends and new funding politics was a world where his schmoozing and fund raising talents were powerful currency he became a "bundler " someone who could induce hundreds of acquaintances to donate bundling has emerged as a major source of u s campaign finance abuse and mr hsu was in the thick of it he befriended mrs clinton and other democrats decorating his soho loft with their photos he displayed a saxophone autographed by former president bill clinton bought for &# at a red cross benefit he sported a chocolate brown leather bomber jacket with the presidential seal "bill clinton gave this to me " he told mr waters these connections sometimes helped as he pitched murky deals in an email over the summer mr hsu claimed to be financing the takeover of an unnamed maker of "some hardware which i am not at liberty to disclose " mr waters says he asked few questions before investing "i figured if hillary trusted him i could trust him " mr waters says in a july email about someone he felt had criticized him mr hsu wrote in his somewhat fractured writing style "some people lie when they have to and i can understand that because all of us may have force into those situation sometime in our lives some people are just born liars lying when they have no reason to lie it is their habit and become part of their lives " mr hsu now in prison in california declined to comment on his life or troubles his story was pieced together through interviews with dozens of friends investors and fellow political fund raisers as well as documents and emails from early on mr hsu made it clear to those around him that he wanted to be rich close friends arent sure where he was born a distant relative says he grew up in hong kong where he "lived modestly" before moving to the u s for college he got his social security card in and four years later received a computer science degree from the university of california berkeley he told fellow students he was an orphan and displayed an urn containing his mothers ashes in his apartment he married a chinese american woman and sold high end real estate in the san francisco bay area then moved to philadelphia and earned a business degree from university of pennsylvanias wharton school "he was a finance whiz " recalls larry richards who was president of mr hsus graduating class "he wanted to make money and he was confident he could " mr hsu bonded with democrats who were disenchanted with ronald reagans ascent "we all felt that the democratic party was in danger of losing its soul " mr richards recalls "norman was empathetic " mr hsu wanted to build his own business but was wary of venture capitalists "he said he wanted to keep control " mr richards recalls so he turned to novice investors in the early s mr hsu and some berkeley friends started laveno a company that bought clothes from hong kong and chinese manufacturers and sold them in u s boutiques under its own label mr hsu described the moderately priced clothing line as japanese influenced the daily news review a menswear publication now called dnr called him a year old "pioneer " but he soon stumbled the economy was in a slump "i made a lot of stupid mistakes " mr hsu told dnr he miscalculated delivery dates and to get around import quotas on certain fabrics he embraced linen buyers didnt "he didnt seem to be putting any effort into the operation and he was spending the money " says ernest ng another classmate and laveno partner mr hsu left the company and his partners lost money and wound down the business a few years later although several other ventures failed mr hsu "aspired to be a big player in the business " says howard ruben a former dnr reporter who now runs a public relations firm he rented booths at a big menswear trade show he frequented fine restaurants and zipped around in nice cars "he craved attention and money " says mr ruben "but its very expensive and difficult to make it in the clothing business " mr hsus enterprises were growing increasingly murky a couple who own a hong kong clothing company went into business with him then claimed in a lawsuit filed in los angeles in that he essentially stole &# million by opening secret accounts and writing phony invoices mr hsu didnt respond to the allegations and the case ultimately was dismissed his current lawyer was unaware of the case mr hsu asked mr ruben "do you know any investors " mr ruben introduced him to california real estate developer perry schonfeld who lost several thousand dollars and sued mr hsu in "i hired people to find him " mr schonfeld says "but we couldnt track him down " he dropped the case that

over by police "im being kidnapped " mr hsu told the officers according to police reports mr chow and two associates were arrested but mr chow denied the charges and mr hsu refused to testify so the

acquaintances he was investing in dot com companies real estate and apparel he began getting involved in democratic politics saying to friends his interest was kindled by the presidential election which he often claimed was "stolen" by george w bush in new campaign finance laws sharply reduced what individuals could donate suddenly politicians needed people who were good at raising lots of small donations and bundling them together according to public records in mr hsu donated &# to john kerrys presidential bid his first federal campaign contribution over the next year he gave so much that politicians began routinely inviting him to fund raising events in the final month of the campaign he poured more than &# into senate races and state democratic parties by he had graduated from writing checks to persuading others to do so since then he has collected well over &# million in small checks for candidates making him one of the biggest fund raisers in the nation "norman hsu would vow to raise a certain amount and he would always surpass it " says hassan nemazee who was mr kerrys new york finance chairman and is now a fund raiser for mrs clinton flying around the country in a leased jet mr hsu gave to the los angeles city attorney the governors of iowa and new mexico the massachusetts treasurer and senators from arkansas louisiana and california he became a leading donor in the democratic quest to retake control of the senate in the campaign at events he was quiet and self effacing sometimes standing alone in the room he spoke quickly mumbled and laughed a lot which made him a bit hard to understand his head occasionally twitched a tic he blamed on a long ago car accident he hosted a march fund raiser for freshman illinois sen barack obamas political action committee he threw a party in his soho loft for harold ford jr s senate bid in june at the st regis in san francisco he combined a birthday party for himself with a fund raiser for mrs clinton who was

raised more than &# for the clinton presidential campaign in his apartment he kept cds and dvds of mrs clinton making speeches and a fat envelope stuffed with her thank you notes although mr hsu seemed to enjoy the spotlight he was wary of press attention in an email to a friend he complained about being mentioned in the new york post as a host of an event "i always stay away from press " he wrote "never allow my name to be listed on the very top or as gbp " prosecutors now theorize that his reticence might have stemmed from his alleged use of stolen money to fund his political contributions some of the political donors he recruited including mr waters were also his investors some of them say they felt pressured to contribute for fear of being cut out of the next lucrative deal "im a republican " mr waters notes "i was a donor who had my arm twisted to make a contribution to hillary clintons campaign on behalf of norman hsu " one angry investor wrote recently to the clinton campaign demanding his &# back mr waters who opened a clothing business in the s started getting investment pitches from mr hsu a few years ago mr hsu said his companies components ltd and

donations to mrs clinton were coming from a mailman and his family who lived in a modest home outside san francisco and had links to mr hsu campaign finance experts said the donation pattern raised red flags suggesting that mr hsu might have been illegally reimbursing william paw and his family for donations they made the paws and mr hsu have denied any wrongdoing "we didnt know he was a cheater
