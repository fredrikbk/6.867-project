arnolds imperialism our future depends on us taking action against global warming right now " arnold schwarzenegger said at a press conference last thursday and so california has sued the environmental protection agency to force the epas hand on local laws that regulate carbon emissions from california automobiles "we sue again and sue again and sue again until we get it " the governor promised his vision of endless litigation is really an attempt to pull off an elaborate bait and switch experimentation in the states is good as long as a state makes its own taxpayers the guinea pigs but mr schwarzenegger and the environmental lobby want to impose the costs of their climate change gestures on everybody else both on citizens in the rest of the country who never voted for californian politicians and especially on detroit auto makers call it california as a laboratory of imperialism in california passed legislation to limit the tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases mainly carbon dioxide for all cars and trucks sold in the state by the end of the state got around to asking the epa for permission over the years california has been granted about waivers to the clean air act which allow air quality laws more stringent than national standards all the waivers addressed pollutants like nox and sox to combat smog say over los angeles carbon is different the epa has always considered co the natural and unavoidable byproduct of fuel combustion or for that matter human breathing the greens took the bush administration to their favorite policy venue the courts to reverse this longstanding position the supreme court obliged aprils massachusetts v epa broadly interpreted carbon as a "pollutant" under the clean air act basically because it goes into the air yet the court narrowly held that the epa "has significant latitude as to the manner timing content and coordination of its regulations " now california is demanding that the epa use this judicially invented power to give the state its way on co emissions theres a hitch though although the carbon content for gasoline can be modified with additives like ethanol once you pump a given blend into your car the carbon emitted per gallon is constant theres no viable technology that can capture or limit co as that gallon is burned when california says that it wants to "reduce" co emissions from cars then it actually means that it wants cars that get more miles to the gallon ring a bell that clanging noise is coming from congress which may ratchet up national fuel efficiency standards to miles per gallon such an indirect tax is pointless for reducing oil consumption or affecting climate change but at least congresss new auto mandates would be reached through a deliberative legislative process and applied consistently nationwide the so called "cafe standards" specifically pre empt state regulation mr schwarzenegger knows hes intruding on federal prerogatives so he is trying to jimmy the lock on the epa backdoor for the purposes of its lawsuit california claims that its not regulating fuel economy per se only co emissions thats a meaningless distinction because of fixed per gallon carbon content both measure the same thing and anyway what does supposedly world wide warming have to do with "clean air" in california the reasons for a uniform fuel economy standard are obvious the national auto market cant be sliced up into scraps each with multiple sets of rules it would be impossible to police and the auto makers would be compelled to adopt the most stringent mandate the federal government cant cede de facto control of environmental policy car design and pricing and interstate commerce to the latest whim out of sacramento but mr schwarzenegger is unbowed "the fact of the matter is what im saying is arnold to michigan get off your butt " he said at a speech at georgetown earlier this year the economic costs of course wouldnt be borne by arnolds blue state constituents but by the big three and their blue collar workers there is however one policy experiment that the governor could conduct that wouldnt require federal permission or hurt other states why doesnt he raise excise taxes so that gas costs &# a gallon in his state a direct tax on consumer consumption would definitely cut down co emissions then again californias gas tax is already the highest in the nation and voters dont like paying &# for gas now so well see if arnold gets off his butt for that one theres also a more dangerous regulatory snare hidden in his demands the epa pursuant to the supreme courts instructions is in the process of crafting a carbon policy but california cant get a waiver an exception to some rule if that rule doesnt exist the schwarzenegger lawsuit is partly a confidence trick to trap the epa into making an "endangerment finding" on co if the administration used its discretion to rule carbon hazardous it would be a major step toward a new and onerous global warming bureaucracy an agency under different political auspices could run wild the last thing the bush epa should be doing is paving this road for the next administration see
