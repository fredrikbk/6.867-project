energy a special report producers new money old assets asian energy companies are looking for diversification in an unlikely place u s oil fields that are often nearly tapped out asian energy companies are quietly expanding their presence in the u s picking up mostly older oil and gas fields to anchor a new global strategy that includes riskier pursuits in africa and the middle east in a series of predominantly under the radar deals over the past months japanese and korean oil companies have spent more than &# billion to gain a toehold in the u s formerly bit players outside asia they look at the u s as a steady source of both energy and cash as they seek to broaden the sources of oil and gas for their resource starved countries "in the past our core activity was in southeast asia and australia were looking for diversification " says haruo kumo head of the u s energy operations of japanese industrial conglomerate mitsui &amp co the new foreign entrants are stepping in just as many of the biggest producers in the u s are pulling out of older fields the big producers for the most part dont want to invest the ever increasing amounts needed to prolong the life of reservoirs that in some cases are nearly tapped dry the asian newcomers are small players in the exploration and production worlds but they are some of the worlds largest companies with financial resources to match and they are willing to spend what it takes for what they consider a vital strategic link dealmakers and industry experts are split however on how much of a future there is for asian investment in u s production oil and gas fields are more expensive to buy in the u s than almost anywhere else and provide lower profit margins and the largest potential group of asian buyers the chinese oil companies remain wary after political pressure in the u s sank a deal mr kumo wont say much about mitsuis future in the u s a year after his company bought a stake in natural gas fields off the texas and louisiana coasts "were not shrinking" is all he offers neither are at least nine other asian energy companies mostly japanese and korean they range from the state owned korea national oil corp to diversified japanese conglomerates like mitsui and mitsubishi corp deals range from relatively small purchases in the shallows of the gulf of mexico and in texas to a &# billion stake in a major deepwater oil project most of the new entrants say theyre just getting started itochu corp a tokyo based conglomerate has spent only of the &# million it plans to spend on u s gas fields through the acquisitions have mostly been in shallow water gas fields off the gulf coast territory that most major energy companies have been leaving over the past five years the wells there are running down with production dropping between and albeit to a still substantial billion cubic feet of gas a day according to the u s minerals management service but those fields should still be yielding four billion cubic feet of gas a day in almost entirely from wells that have yet to be drilled says bill gwozd vice president of gas services at ziff energy group a calgary alberta based consulting firm "the companies that are buying are not buying yesterdays production " he says "theyre buying potential for tomorrow " even new wells in the shallows produce about one third the amount of gas that a well yields in the deeper less extensively mined waters of the gulf but the shallows represent what sojitz corp an early japanese arrival in the gulf once called "blue chip blocks" sites that yield low margins on steady production that sort of predictable cash can then be put toward financing projects in libya for example a rapidly growing but riskier focus of japanese exploration the japanese government meanwhile is helping private companies finance expensive projects in the u s as part of its effort to guarantee a continued steady flow of oil and gas imports mitsui for example is a partner with the government in a gas field in the gulf that is difficult and costly to tap in return for financing the government can during a severe energy shortage require mitsui to send gas or oil to japan from one of its more established assets elsewhere in the world such efforts are designed in part to help offset setbacks japan suffered last year when it lost major supply contracts in iran and russia around that time the japanese government and to a lesser extent south korea started to more aggressively push private companies to look beyond traditional suppliers the japanese companies have "had some bad experiences " says adrian goodisman the houston based managing director of scotia waterous a calgary investment banking firm that advised sellers in two deals involving japanese buyers in the gulf of mexico earlier this year "a lot picked up exploration projects " he says but "some of these got delayed and theyre looking for existing producing volumes " but the asians also appear set to branch out from their ultraconservative initial purchases four asian companies spent a combined &# million in the government sale of gulf of mexico exploration rights in october up from a single &# high bid from an asian company in a similar auction last year in september sojitz became the first japanese company to move onshore with an &# million purchase of technologically challenging gas fields in texas mitsui is also looking onshore mr kumo says and other companies have put out feelers says mr goodisman "we think we have a great future in this market " says toshiyuki yamaguchi a spokesman for sojitz which spent &# million on stakes in three gulf of mexico oil fields in october some industry observers see limits for asian companies in the u s though while production has been falling drilling and servicing costs have jumped over the past five years although substantial reserves remain beneath the gulf shallows even companies that havent sold their assets there increasingly see them as too expensive to exploit "the cost structure is the highest production is the lowest it doesnt sound as rosy as earlier " say ziff energy groups mr gwozd the number of rigs drilling in the shallow water gulf has fallen to from a year ago according to baker hughes inc a services company that conducts a regular rig count onshore production is steady but only through a massive spending effort by producers which like their peers offshore have seen margins squeezed by rising service costs technologically challenging gas fields like the ones sojitz bought in september are seen in the industry as the last hope for new large scale production in the continental u s and that means little prime acreage is available to newcomers "most of the good acreage in these plays is leased to the larger u s based independents " says scott mitchell a u s oil and gas specialist with the consulting firm wood mackenzie in houston "its tough to see any big competitive advantage for a foreign entrant " but big quick profits rarely are the goal for the asian companies which stress the wider strategic value of owning production in the u s sojitzs mr yamaguchi describes his companys purchases as part of a global effort to exploit unconventional gas reserves mr kumo of mitsui says a presence in the u s helps the company establish connections in the energy industry that can lead to lucrative partnerships the landscape could change dramatically if chinese energy companies enter the mix chinas state owned giants were among the first to move aggressively outside asia and have entered countries through multibillion dollar deals where korean and japanese companies have inched their way in but where mitsui or itochu might see minimal political risk in the u s to balance high tension operations in the middle east or west africa the equation was reversed for the chinese by cnooc ltd s failed acquisition of unocal corp in "its easier to make money in the middle east and africa " says peter huang who represents china offshore oil engineering corp cnoocs oilfield services subsidiary in houston had the &# billion deal for california based unocal gone through cnooc would have become one of the largest owners of acreage in the gulf of mexico instead a political backlash from the u s congress over energy security concerns led to chevron corp acquiring unocal chinese energy companies have been skittish about acquiring an american company or assets ever since though interest never completely vanished "weve had chinese companies bid unsuccessfully on u s opportunities post unocal " says mr goodisman with scotia waterous who adds that the countrys tilt toward megadeals limits opportunities in the u s mr huang agrees that chinese companies are still looking to build a stronger presence in the u s and that an acquisition for under &# billion would have a greater chance of success than another unocal size purchase "chinese national oil companies should understand what kind of role size plays in the political game " mr huang says "in a smaller deal its harder for politicians to play " mr baskin is a reporter for dow
