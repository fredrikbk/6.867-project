democrats torture and upcoming elections how telling that alan dershowitzs main admonition to the democratic presidential hopefuls "democrats and waterboarding " editorial page nov is to be "seen as just as tough as republicans but a lot smarter on how to deal with real threats to our national interests " he effectively makes the case that to democrats just being seen as strong on national security is actually the genuine article thus he hoists them on their own petard lets hope the public understands this as well as mr dershowitz gives them credit for in his article our lives may depend on it arnold l goldman canton conn i am a card carrying democrat and abhor the present administrations blanket invocation of the war on terror as an excuse for its ill advised incompetent reckless foreign policy i am also an ex marine with a personal sense of what real war is and what it requires most of the time our democratic and republican leaders do not attempt to lead anyone they seek reelection and power by pandering to their power bases and resorting to facile sloganizing and sound bites in the midst of this political darkness alan dershowitzs piece on democrats and waterboarding is a brilliant ray of real thought not just a road map for democrats to get where they want to get the white house but a recipe for resolving a tough issue merely invoking the word "torture" should not decide what our countrys policies are anymore than repeating the empty mantra "war on terror " i do not recall reading such an in depth insightful discussion of an important political issue in decades is it too much to hope that some political leader a democratic candidate or anyone else is listening thomas h sear new york i am deeply surprised by the article by mr dershowitz no one could express better the way i feel about the posturing and hypocrisy of democrats on the judiciary committee during the confirmation hearings of judge michael mukasey no one except perhaps house minority leader john boehner who said a few months ago speaking of democrats "i wonder if theyre more interested in protecting the terrorists than protecting the american people " no doubt that if they persist in their interpretation of the constitution or they continue to invoke the "american people" to defend indefensible ideas they will lose the presidency in george naniche moraga calif alan dershowitz while passionately promoting the use of torture consistently fails to acknowledge how torture really works in the world his argument is based on a dramatic but purely hypothetical law school exercise the u s army field manual on interrogation the summary of our armys experience on effective interrogation under pressure of battle bluntly says that torture doesnt work and that humane treatment elicits more reliable information the national defense intelligence science board concludes that there is no reliable information that says that coercion is effective in interrogation but there is plenty of reliable information on its strategic damage to our nation our military leaders tell us that lowering the bar endangers our troops and citizens foreign affairs and defense experts say our actions have radicalized even more muslims willing to fight and kill americans we are failing to present a moral alternative to their own repressive regimes and our rationalizations for cruelty echo what they hear from the torturers in their countries i have worked with thousands of torture survivors over the years and seen overwhelming evidence that torture is effective at inducing false confessions there is no evidence of governments confining torture only to those "whom we really know" to be guilty be they dictatorships or democracies torture always becomes a fishing expedition and the torturer can always get a "confession" to justify their sin to their superiors and themselves it would be helpful if those proposing "realistic" policies in a dangerous world had a better grasp on reality douglas a johnson executive director center for victims of torture minneapolis see related letter "letters to the editor dershowitz replies" wsj nov
