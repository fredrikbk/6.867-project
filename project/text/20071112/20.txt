energy a special report regulators cutting edge is canadas approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions a breakthrough or a pr gimmick ottawa canada has set a new course for dealing with climate change one that its proponents say will both assist the countrys burgeoning oil industry in the west and give traction to emissions policies that dont discourage economic growth this spring canada became the first country to adopt a nationwide policy that seeks to reduce the rate at which carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are produced rather than the total amount of emissions produced taking a markedly different approach from the kyoto protocol which mandates cuts in emissions canadas new rules mean that producers of oil gas power iron steel chemicals cement and other materials can increase production and their total emissions as long as the ratio of their emissions to the basic unit of production in their industry declines for power generators say the ratio is per kilowatt hour for oil producers its per barrel of oil the rules are set to take effect in advocates say the solution is the best of both worlds it tackles global warming without sacrificing economic growth whats more they argue with the u s china and other key abstainers from the kyoto protocol now discussing similar measures plans like canadas could become an acceptable compromise approach but canadas policy has come under fire from critics who say its targets are too lax and wont result in any actual emissions cuts the canadian way these critics say isnt aimed at helping the environment its aimed at helping politicians the policy "basically allows industry to expand as much as they want " says mike hudema a climate and energy campaigner at greenpeace canada who dismisses the plan as a public relations gimmick "the government can send out this message the numbers on emissions intensity targets and pretend to be doing something and the public wont necessarily understand the distinction " the policy bolstered the so called sydney declaration outlined at the nation asia pacific summit held in september in australia in which countries attending agreed to reduce their "energy intensity" the amount of energy needed to produce a dollar of gross domestic product by the pledge was significant because it marked the first time that leaders of the u s australia china and asias other emerging economies had committed to any kind of emissions targets for canada meanwhile affirming the sydney declaration cemented a policy reversal from the former liberal governments participation in the kyoto agreement in two years ago canada also hosted a follow up conference to kyoto at which representatives of more than countries met in montreal to discuss what should come after the kyoto rules when they expire in then in january a national election ushered in a minority conservative government led by prime minister stephen harper mr harper said canada couldnt meet the cuts mandated by kyoto which would reduce carbon emissions to below levels without crippling the countrys economy so the government instead adopted the emissions intensity policy which will require large industrial companies in to have reduced their ratios of emissions by below levels and by each following year through no reductions in overall emissions are required but the government hopes its ratio targets will slow the pace of emissions growth enough that when coupled with other measures such as energy efficiency and renewable fuel drives canadas total greenhouse gas emissions will fall by a fifth by there is much support for the new policy in the countrys booming oil industry in the west indeed production in albertas oil sands sector is forecast to triple over the next eight years to more than three million barrels a day though second in size only to the reserves of saudi arabia canadas trove is predominantly bitumen a sludgy raw material from which it is difficult and expensive to extract oil oil from bitumen requires extensive processing before it can even flow through a pipeline let alone be handled by refineries and despite increasing efficiency from the industry its a dirty emissions intensive business driving a near tripling of emissions from canadas oil and gas sector since the oil sands are a major contributor to canadas gross national product underscoring the countrys growing awareness of its importance as a key energy producer and while proposed increases to albertas royalty regime could dent investment more than c&# billion us&# billion worth of projects are currently planned for the oil sands patch likely cementing canadas position as no crude oil supplier to the u s greenpeace canada is one of several environmental organizations to open an office in edmonton alberta recently seeking to lobby the provincial government to curb the environmental fallout from developing the oil sands the extraction of oil from the sands of alberta is "one of the worlds most environmentally disastrous projects " mr hudema says but albertas oil sands sector is naturally more welcoming of the federal legislation some argue that a program with the support of its participants has a stronger chance of achieving real change though its targets may be lower than environmentalists would like "were supportive of the emissions intensity policy it helps reduce emission but it keeps production strong " says john rogers vice president of investor relations at suncor energy inc which started the first commercial oil sands mine in "we have to be realistic about how we start these things " in fact large emitters dont have to make any emissions cuts to comply with their targets similar to provisions under the kyoto protocol they can compensate for exceeding emissions ratio targets by pursuing such approved measures as renewable energy projects or by trading carbon dioxide credits on the international markets and after it launches later this year on the domestic canadian market or they can pay a penalty starting at c&# per metric ton of carbon dioxide above their ratio target into a government managed technology fund this fund is popular among oil executives in part because it promises to help them better calculate their costs and although its not yet clear how the money raised will be used the prospect of using it to find a technology based solution for making their operations more efficient sits well with the industry "were very very keen on seeing the money reinvested in the country and particularly in the province where it was raised " says marcel coutu chief executive of canadian oil sands trust the calgary based trust is the major stakeholder in the syncrude consortium which followed suncor with the second oil sands development in the s steven knell energy analyst with london based consultancy global insight notes "its ironic the capital that we would divert toward new renewable projects is basically being generated through greater carbon use " mr coutu for his part believes canada has an excellent chance to become a leader in developing green technologies and exporting these around the world along with its crude high on the list is carbon sequestration a process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions and storing them in fallow oil and gas wells an approach that almost seems custom designed for alberta north west upgrading inc a calgary based company whose equipment will help convert bitumen into high value oil products recently signed a deal to channel the resulting carbon dioxide emissions into a sequestration project "id say kyoto was a good intentions club because it wasnt achievable " says robert pearce president of north west "something needs to be done but we have to do whats achievable and realistic " while mr knell the energy analyst reckons that any action is a positive step he fears the new focus on emissions intensity could complicate decembers u n meeting in bali to negotiate a post kyoto agreement "the whole argument for emissions intensity is that it doesnt set a cap it almost contravenes the program that the international community agreed on " he adds "to call it illegal is extremely strong language but its certainly not in the spirit of kyoto " some developing economies are excluded from the cuts called for in kyoto and oppose any efforts to have cuts imposed on them they have hinted that they may be more amenable to policies that focus on energy and emissions intensity ratios as suggested in the sydney declaration and in canadas new policy china which could overtake the u s as the biggest source of greenhouse gases this year is concentrating its climate change efforts on emissions intensity and is launching programs to encourage efficiency gains mexicos fernando tudela the countrys top climate change official at the ministry for environment and natural resources said recently at a u n event in new york "we will consider which sectors are ready for some kind of targeting efforts we may think in terms of intensity targets " ms lee is a reporter for dow jones newswires in ottawa she can be reached at hyunyoung lee dowjones
