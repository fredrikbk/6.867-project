vioxx settlements next big question how to split it up wall street largely hailed the &# billion vioxx settlement deal merck &amp co announced friday as closing an ugly and costly chapter for the company but plaintiffs lawyers reviewing the news questioned whether the deal would yield adequate payouts for some of their clients beth klein a denver plaintiffs lawyer who filed four vioxx suits in new jersey state court said that while the settlement provides a welcome opportunity to avoid litigation she would need a lot more information before she could recommend it "people are going to want to know the lowest amount they could get the worst case scenario before they agree to that settlement " she said that includes figuring out the cut that will go to health insurers and exactly how much her clients could get docked for having risk factors for cardiovascular disease right now she said "i dont have a handle on what the payout will be " the real question for clients says tommy fibich a houston plaintiffs lawyer with about cases is "well what do i get after you take your fees and expenses thats the only number theyre concerned about &# billion really is a meaningless number to me " merck pulled the widely used painkiller vioxx from the market in september because it was tied to higher risk of heart attack and stroke thousands of lawsuits ensued the agreement brokered by merck and plaintiffs lawyers aims to resolve the most serious cases those that resulted in heart attack or ischemic stroke the settlement figure is one of the biggest in mass product liability cases in recent years plaintiffs who participate in a global settlement may receive less than a jury verdict would have yielded but they eliminate the risk of trial and get money without having to wait for their case to wend its way through the courts christopher seeger a lead plaintiffs lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement estimates that depending on issues such as age and risk factors individual payouts would range from &# to &# on the low end to &# million to &# million on the high end with an average of above &# those figures are subject to attorneys fees and expenses liens from government entities like medicaid and medicare would also apply against awards he says plus in some instances private health insurers may also pursue payment an administrator will be assigned to help negotiate with the government and the plaintiffs steering committee aims to try a version of that program for private carriers mr seeger says paul rheingold a partner at a small plaintiffs firm in new york that filed vioxx lawsuits in new jersey state court said he "welcomed" the settlement though private insurers have already sent him letters giving him notice of their claims for a few of his clients "its a frequent and annoying problem that will be resolved late in the settlement program through the many precedents that already exist but it could eat substantially into what the clients get from the settlement because medical bills are so high " he says it may take years to sort out the claims of private insurers says roger m baron a law professor at the university of south dakota and an expert on health insurance reimbursement "just because someone was injured by vioxx doesnt mean of the medical bills will need to be reimbursed and thats just one of the things" that will be the subject of debate he says "its going to be a battle royal " merck can bail out on the settlement deal if fewer than of the eligible claims are enrolled in it though if the percentage ends up smaller the company could nevertheless decide to stick with the plan to avoid having to go back to square one w mark lanier a texas lawyer with more than vioxx clients says he believes that the enrollment requirement is "likely to be met " but "its possible this could fall apart " mercks co lead counsel theodore mayer says he is optimistic that "well meet and beat the threshold " plaintiffs lawyers have a lot invested in the vioxx litigation kim wilson a north carolina lawyer says she started advertising for vioxx clients in shortly after merck withdrew the painkiller from the market about people responded says ms wilson who hired three extra staff members to handle the deluge of calls she signed up about clients most of whom had suffered a stroke or heart failure "in light of tort reform we only took cases where we felt like if we got it before a jury it would be a slam dunk " she says ms wilson estimates that she invested &# in the litigation a significant outlay she says for a firm of partners she hopes that through the settlement some of her clients will take home as much as &# she declined to estimate her own earnings one of ms wilsons clients harry black a year old retired south carolina factory worker filed suit in after suffering a heart attack that he alleges was caused by taking vioxx last year he says he traveled to new jersey to be deposed for hours about his injuries "i was relieved when i heard about the settlement " as for the hundreds of plaintiffs lawyers involved in the case some estimate they will share in excess of &# billion in fees not including expenses the number is unclear because the percentage of a payout that goes to lawyers will depend on the lawyers agreements with their clients and state laws there is an arrangement built into the settlement to provide extra compensation out of the total fee pot to attorneys who did more legwork in the case mr lanier the texas lawyer estimates that he will recover as much as &# million in fees as well as more than &# million in expenses distributing the legal fees could prove difficult in some instances mr lanier says several law firms claim to represent the same client the confusion he says could stem from the fact that some vioxx users signed up multiple lawyers and some attorneys he adds may have shopped their clients to several law firms without clarifying which firm ultimately would handle the matter "you can find a case that five different lawyers think they have " he adds "when vioxx was pulled in all of sudden the plaintiffs lawyers came out like mosquitoes on a hot august night " a provision in the settlement that experts call unusual requires any plaintiffs lawyer with a client who enrolls in the settlement to recommend it to all of his clients legal ethics experts have expressed concern saying this could create a conflict of interest if the attorneys feel some clients might not benefit says deborah rhode a legal ethics professor at stanford law school the u s supreme court has held that in settling cases lawyers need to be sure that she says the "interests of individual plaintiffs arent sacrificed for the good of the whole which not coincidentally serves the interests of the attorneys " mercks mr mayer says the settlement isnt a one size fits all approach but rather provides differing payouts depending on the severity of a claimants injury "we have crafted a program that law firms should feel very comfortable recommending to all their clients " he says many of mercks lawyers have already pocketed substantial earnings those firms include hughes hubbard &amp reed llp williams &amp connolly llp dechert llp omelveny &amp myers llp and bartlit beck herman palenchar &amp scott llp the company set aside &# billion for litigation costs "not including any payouts to plaintiffs" and has spent &# billion of that so far though that wasnt all paid to lawyers mr seeger says when one adds up the time invested by plaintiffs lawyers "they work for a lot less than defense lawyers "
