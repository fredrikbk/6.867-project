investors fear growth will fail to revive stocks a new fear is helping fuel the latest stock market rout that booming global growth for years the engine of the worlds financial markets may have trouble pulling u s markets out of their swoon this time around over the summer when shaky credit markets first sent u s stocks lower strong economic growth in china india and europe together with intervention by the federal reserve reassured investors and sent them back into stocks pushing u s market indexes to new highs now big financial companies like citigroup inc merrill lynch &amp co morgan stanley and wachovia corp are taking multibillion dollar write offs linked to the credit market turmoil the fed meanwhile is warning that the nations economic growth is likely to slow europes growth prospects have weakened and oil has continued to climb toward &# a barrel those factors have left investors to wonder whether the feds skill in adjusting interest rates and chinas economic power will be enough to save u s stocks from a steeper selloff money managers overseeing billions of dollars at hedge funds pension funds and mutual funds have been hunkering down their pullback helped send the dow jones industrial average down in the final three days of last week to the sharpest three day plunge since in new york richard rosen who oversees &# billion at a subsidiary of new york life investment management has been trimming his holdings not only in merrill lynch and wells fargo &amp co but also in oil related stocks he once favored in washington wayne wicker whose vantagepoint funds oversee &# billion launched a new investment fund which immediately used futures markets to bet that the standard &amp poors stock index would continue to fall in chicago jack ablin whose harris private bank oversees &# billion has been shifting some money out of u s stocks and into commodities like oil and copper fears are spreading that more bank write offs could be in the offing as the nations housing market continues to weaken and securities based on low quality mortgages keep going bad the fed which has cut interest rates twice since mid september is signaling that it mightnt be comfortable cutting rates every few weeks to maintain order growth in europe and japan is slowing and fears are spreading that investors in china and india may be contributing to stock bubbles in those markets "we have been relying on global growth to pull us along but that was in the face of mild head winds now the head winds seem to be getting stronger " says ethan harris chief u s economist at lehman brothers for this years third quarter economists had expected to see annualized u s economic growth of a little more than instead initial government estimates showed a expansion rate as booming global growth offset the initial effects of u s credit market woes american multinationals including coca cola co procter &amp gamble co intel corp and cisco systems inc benefited from strong global demand meanwhile dollar rich middle eastern and asian investors were big buyers of u s securities helping keep u s markets afloat as this year has progressed however lehman brothers has cut growth projections not only for the u s but also for europe and japan "there are more countries in the caboose now than the engine " mr harris says technology companies have also sounded alarms cisco has warned that flagging demand for its networking equipment from big financial companies could hold back sales growth last week allen sinai chief economist at research firm decision economics inc concluded that the risk of a u s recession has risen to from he doesnt foresee recessions in china or india but he thinks their stock markets have "gotten ahead of themselves " mr sinai sees chinas economic growth slowing to or next year from this year indias to or from and brazils to from as much as this year some economists now fear a recession in japan where the economy contracted in the second quarter most projections are for a return to growth in the third quarter but domestic demand remains weak leaving japan dependent on exports to the uncertain global economy "falling u s home prices and asset values mean consumer psychology will weaken and consumer spending will weaken" in the u s mr sinai says as write offs eat into banks capital "they will have to cut back on lending " meaning companies will cut back on investment "this looks like feels like smells like a bear market" for stocks meaning the start of a decline of or more mr sinai adds for now at least stocks are far from such a severe slump the dow industrials are down since finishing at a record on oct just one month ago broad indexes still havent fallen as heavily as in the summer and arent back to their summer lows although they are getting closer many investors remain hopeful recalling other sudden swoons over the past two years each time u s stock markets bounced back and hit new highs as low interest rates and global prosperity generated huge amounts of money that found its way into shares but a growing number of investors are hedging their bets fearing there is no guarantee that stocks will bounce right back this time "the combination of merrill lynch and citigroup both announcing write downs that were more than expected was an eye opener " says mr rosen of new york lifes mainstay funds "most of wall street expected that when chuck prince " citigroups chief executive left the company "the stock would go up a whole lot " he adds instead the stock fell heavily mr rosen didnt sell citigroup shares though he says he wishes he had at least in the short run but he scaled back his holdings of wells fargo a major mortgage lender and merrill lynch as well as fannie mae and freddie mac which invest in mortgage loans he invested some of the proceeds in companies without mortgage exposure such as drug stocks he says he also pulled back from stocks in general boosting his cash holdings by tens of millions of dollars to a range of to of the money he manages up from between and "it just seems like the rout cant be concentrated just on financials " he says "it feels like it is going to start spreading into other areas " that feeling helped him decide to trim his holdings of oil drillers and big integrated oil producers which have been riding the world economic boom and whose stock prices have approached his target levels he says he also is considering cutting back on stocks of raw materials producers which have soared along with chinese demand for their products apart from the bank write offs mr ablin at harris private bank says he was disturbed to see retailers reporting last week that october was one of their worst months in recent years suggesting that rising gasoline prices and trouble getting loans may finally be hitting consumer wallets most big chains from wal mart stores inc to j c penney co to upscale nordstrom inc missed wall streets modest sales expectations and major chains overall reported a sales gain of just for the month down from a year earlier the nordstrom news "was an ominous sign " mr ablin says because it implied that even the wealthiest consumers were less eager to spend on top of that came a warning to congress from fed chairman ben bernanke that the u s economy is likely to slow further before it recovers "it seemed like a turning point " mr ablin says "it showed this is not just a subprime phenomenon " limited to those who invested in securities backed by low quality mortgages mr ablin says harris is shifting some money out of u s stocks across the board and moving into commodity index funds he hopes to take advantage of rising oil prices and protect clients from a weakening dollar since the price of oil and other commodities tend to rise when the dollar declines vantagepoint funds in washington which invests money for city and county employees retirement plans launched a new global fund on oct the fund invested &# million in the ensuing days it bought swiss and german stocks but sold futures contracts on the s&amp p betting on more u s stock declines it also sold the dollar betting it will keep falling and bought u s treasury bonds a common refuge in times of trouble on wednesday vantagepoints chief investment officer mr wicker visited colleagues in minneapolis who manage some of his firms investments that day the dow industrials plunged more than points "as the selloff was gaining momentum in the afternoon i showed up in the office some folks were saying we ought to re evaluate the portfolio " mr wicker says they discussed the risk that the fed could be caught between the need to cut interest rates to protect the economy and ease the credit crunch and the need to avoid rate cuts in order to prevent oil fueled inflation and support the dollar reducing interest rates by another half to three quarters percentage point mr wicker told the others might help the economy "but it would put the dollar in an even worse position " mr wicker says the conversation reinforced his pessimism and his desire for the fund to bet against u s stocks while most peoples worries now focus on u s markets fred dickson chief market analyst at brokerage firm d a davidson &amp co in great falls mont has begun to worry that countries that rely heavily on exports to the u s could suffer from cooling u s demand roughly one quarter of chinas exports are shipped to the u s according to moodys economy com mr dickson also worries that u s investors risk aversion could make them trim holdings of high flying foreign stocks for most of the year mr dickson advised the brokerage firms clients who have total investments of about &# billion to put of their portfolios in developing country stocks in late october he sent out a note to about clients recommending that they cut their allocation to those stocks in half anita raghavan and scott patterson contributed to this article
