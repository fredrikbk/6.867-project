no laughing matter the writers strike that has brought the entertainment industry to its knees has left the public angry and confused wondering when it will next hear teri hatcher say something clever many view the set to as a tiff between two sets of spoiled infants who already earn far more than the average american but to be fair the public is unfamiliar with the grievances that have brought the warring parties to this impasse nor are they aware of the catastrophic effect the walkout could exert on the american economy for starters let us recap the conflict to date writers condemn tv studios for imposing unprecedented "hilarity quotas" on sitcoms such as "the king of queens" and "how i met your mother " insisting that they will only pay for jokes that are funny rejecting the longstanding tradition of paying comedy writers by the word not the guffaw this policy is tantamount to detroit only paying auto workers for engines that run and gas tanks that do not explode writers on "mad tv" and "saturday night live" routinely go home with paychecks of less than &# a week and several writers from the kelsey grammer vehicle "back to you" report that they actually owe the studio money after producing only six gags in the first few weeks of the programs existence the studio insists that when they paid for six jokes they were being generous a more serious grievance is outsourcing because foreigners work cheap and theyve figured out how to use the internet it is now possible for studios to obtain top flight material from foreign scriptwriters particularly canadians for peanuts since canadians are not especially funny they are rarely hired by american comedy shows though they do sometimes provide material for kathy griffins tv specials but because the canadian health industry is a mess there is always plenty of top shelf surgical material that can be adapted for shows such as "greys anatomy" and "e r " for similar reasons "c s i miami" and "law and order special victims unit" have been outsourcing scripts to croatia and chechnya where downsized militiamen retrained as scriptwriters supply a steady flow of forensic pathology material there are even rumors that the notorious cheapskate ellen degeneress monologues are translations of routines previously delivered by solange labarriere the doyenne of belgian talk show hosts the studios for their part are furious at the writers for refusing to give an inch on the issue of featherbedding for example "the view" has writers on staff but because of guaranteed no show jobs only three report for work on any given day this explains why joy behar has not said anything funny since march why elisabeth hasselbeck has not said anything intelligent since august and why rosie odonnell had to leave the show instead of reporting to the office each morning the rest of "the view" staff moonlight elsewhere some punching up margaret warners witty ad libs on "the newshour with jim lehrer " others ghost writing outraged emails for jack cafferty on "the situation room " a few even write witty quips for paul begala the writers counter that tight fisted studios are deliberately operating skeleton staffs at most of the new sitcoms often using interns retirees or non unionized gag writers furloughed by mike huckabee at "rules of engagement " the talent pool is spread so thin that there is literally no comic material left over for david spade after his two co stars have had first crack at the inventory this explains why mr spade once one of the most beloved sitcom stars in america is now only slightly more amusing than lou dobbs be that as it may it would be unwise to dismiss this strike as nothing more than a lovers spat an estimated million americans now work as content providers many on network and cable tv the writing profession is notorious for its low wages with writers often living from paycheck to paycheck this is where the seeds of disaster have been sown according to the government accountability office more than six million tv writers are now saddled with adjustable rate subprime mortgages they are in no position to pay off during an economic downturn if the strike continues millions of these writers will default on their loans worsening an already bleak mortgage industry situation and conceivably sending the economy into a tailspin of great depression magnitude from which it may never recover thus if a year from now the american economy lies in ruins we can blame it all on a bunch of selfish knuckleheads who put their own interests before those of the american people think about it hollywood think about it long and hard and then haul your sorry tails back to that bargaining table lets not see an entire society go down in flames just because somebody was too cheap to fork over a few extra bucks to make jimmy kimmel seem funny mr queenan is the author most recently of "queenan country a reluctant anglophiles pilgrimage to the mother country" picador see related letter "letters to the editor writers subtle slow down preceded the strike" wsj november
