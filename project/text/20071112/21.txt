energy a special report regulators one step forward one step back u s policies will reduce dependence on foreign oil unless they increase it in its efforts to set the u s on the road toward energy independence congress may be constructing a detour the house and senate have passed separate energy bills and are now working on combining the two into final legislation that could come up for a vote by the end of the year both bills are designed to lessen american reliance on foreign oil in part by mandating far greater use of corn based ethanol and so called cellulosic ethanol which is made from biomass like grasses and wood chips the senate bill also calls for higher fuel economy standards heres the catch anything that creates uncertainty about demand for gasoline over the long term means less incentive for refiners in the u s to expand their capacity and that means greater reliance on gasoline imports in the near term at least until ethanol becomes a mainstream fuel and that of course is the opposite of energy independence "its safe to say that our imports of gasoline will be steadily increasing over the next several years " says adam robinson an energy research analyst at lehman brothers "the big question is whether or not we can make that silver bullet jump to cellulosic and also whether or not we can develop the downstream systems to deliver the ethanol " already imports are satisfying an ever larger share of americas thirst for gasoline as of august imports stood at of demand up from in the same month in and in july and while the largest foreign suppliers of gasoline are nearby canada and the virgin islands a growing proportion of imports is coming from refiners in other locations like europe that have a greater choice of places to send their gasoline that makes them less reliable sources since theyll ship their product elsewhere if they can get higher prices for it alternative fuels may not provide relief any time soon while biofuels have attracted massive investment cellulosic ethanol has yet to be produced on a commercial scale but the senate bill depends on cellulosic ethanol to provide billion gallons of fuel a year by with the first mandated volumes in critics are skeptical that the technological breakthroughs necessary for mass cellulosic production will occur so soon critics also question whether the country can supply the billion gallons a year of corn based ethanol that the senate bill mandates by without substantially raising the cost of food or whether the supply can be relied on in drought years in the first six months of this year ethanol accounted for three billion of the billion gallons of fuel used by cars and trucks in the u s even if the production targets for alternative fuels can be reached vast additions to the fuel delivery infrastructure new pipelines and storage tanks for starters must be built to accommodate much larger volumes of ethanol all that could delay the emergence of ethanol as a mainstream fuel meanwhile refiners in the u s are re evaluating expansion plans u s refiners now plan to add enough capacity by to process just over one million barrels of crude oil a day joanne shore a senior adviser at the u s department of energys energy information administration told congress earlier this year thats down from an estimate last year of million barrels according to the national petrochemical and refiners association current u s crude processing capacity is million barrels a day the push in congress for alternative fuels and greater fuel efficiency is only the latest disincentive for refiners tax incentives to encourage increased refining capacity are losing political support and engineering and construction costs for refineries continue to rise not long ago at hearings and press conferences lawmakers called on refining companies to increase capacity in the u s after the devastating hurricanes of hobbled a number of gulf coast refineries and sent pump prices soaring and there remains some support in congress for such an expansion "were going to become dependent on foreign refineries " sen orrin hatch a utah republican warned at a finance committee hearing earlier this year "if we cant refine oil others will do it for us and its foolish if we dont wean ourselves off imports " but refiners see the political winds shifting "if you want to add refining capacity here how can you have the president advocating reduced consumption " says greg king president of valero energy corp the largest independent refiner in the u s "its a mixed message " mr king says he is concerned that incentives to encourage expansion are in jeopardy the house version of the energy bill doesnt extend beyond a provision from the energy policy act of that grants refiners tax savings on of the costs of investments that increase capacity by at least at any one refinery the bill also would take away from refiners a tax deduction granted to other u s manufacturers "we think the legislation might continue the trend of incremental increase" in gasoline imports mr king says meanwhile the cost of expanding the capacity of refineries is climbing west coast refiner tesoro corp canceled and sunoco inc and valero delayed or downsized multimillion dollar expansion plans last year citing rising costs for construction and engineering and while two even more expensive plans for expanded crude processing capacity have moved ahead another has stalled as for new plant construction the last new refinery in the u s was built in and there may not be another one soon there are plans for three new refineries in the u s and another three in canada but they are tentative at best one new plant planned for yuma ariz has been in the works since the project obtained key federal and state permits several years ago but has failed to secure commitments from investors a project in louisiana exists only as a memorandum of understanding between the state and kuwait to study the construction of a refinery backers of a recently announced third project in the upper plains region havent disclosed financial details or a final location the three prospective canadian plants havent advanced beyond the proposal stage meanwhile refiners in other countries are forging ahead saudi arabia is gearing up to start four refineries each able to process barrels of crude oil a day kuwait has approved plans for a barrel a day plant and a barrel a day facility will soon be processing in india "it will be difficult to build a new refinery in the united states " says lehmans mr robinson "there are significant investments coming on line in the world that will in addition to this whole ethanol craze continue to de incentivize building new refineries in the u s " bill wicker is a spokesman for sen jeff bingaman the new mexico democrat who chairs the senate energy and natural resources committee and is one of the chief proponents of the proposed biofuels mandate mr wicker concedes that the energy policies in the senate bill might increase gasoline imports if cellulosic ethanol technology doesnt produce on schedule the billions of gallons the mandate requires but he urges the energy industry to join the effort to steer the country away from oil based fuels "there are big oil companies that are also looking at investing in ethanol refineries " mr wicker notes "they are energy companies not oil companies and if the market is trending towards domestic grown or produced energy i certainly hope that the industry sees that and acts accordingly " mr talley and
