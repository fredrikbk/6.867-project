wests mining deals put china in a bind bhp billitons bid for rival resources giant rio tinto shows how western mining companies are increasing their clout as the worlds commodity boom marches on a trend that stands in stark contrast to developments in the oil business the trend could also put china the worlds fastest growing source of new demand for minerals in a bind while state controlled companies might be more willing to ramp up production to meet demand western companies are often leery of adding too much capacity too fast to commodity markets bhp monday said its proposed takeover of rival rio tinto would deliver annual synergies of &# billion including &# billion in annual cost savings in the third year after completion and further earnings enhancement of &# billion a year in the seventh full year driven by the acceleration of volumes to customers bhp said it would carry out a &# billion buyback if it successfully completes the takeover rio tinto has rebuffed the bid for all of their big profits western oil companies have seen their long term prospects dim in recent years that is because much of the worlds remaining oil is controlled by foreign governments which are tightening their grip on supplies the national oil companies and governments of countries such as saudi arabia and venezuela have seen their influence grow often at the expense of the west as oil prices soar some governments have moved to have a greater say in mining but many mining deposits are in more accommodating countries that is one reason mining is increasingly dominated by a handful of western companies that are consolidating to create supply juggernauts bhp billiton rio tinto cia vale do rio doce of brazil and anglo american plc of the united kingdom control many of the worlds biggest mines notably in australia chile and canada and western capital is funding much of the exploration needed to add supplies in the years ahead the trend enhances the earnings potential of western mining companies but it also complicates the economic outlook for resource hungry economies particularly chinas where high demand has helped drive the global commodity boom "a bhp rio tinto merger could cause commodity prices to remain stronger through greater supply discipline and reduced competition for market share " john meyer a resources analyst at investment bank fairfax is in london wrote in a note if these western companies move slowly to expand output as they have during the current boom it could put china and other big metals consumers at a disadvantage western market dominance is most pronounced in iron ore with three companies bhp rio tinto and cvrd controlling roughly of international trade the companies are also strong players in copper coal and some other commodities bhp and rio tinto already own more than of the worlds largest copper mine the escondida deposit in chile and western companies are behind the development of many of the largest new sources of nickel copper and iron ore china is especially vulnerable in the case of coal although domestic companies produce enormous quantities of the commodity they havent always kept pace with chinas rocketing demand earlier this year the country became a net coal importer helping push prices to record highs unlike oil supplies much of the coal that china could tap is produced by western outfits including bhp "simply put when these two mining giants consolidate with each other they could have more say in the minerals product market and have a great impact on the international minerals market " says liu jianming a professor at the chinese academy of sciences chinas leading mining companies are taking steps to lift their output and some are accumulating capital that could make them more formidable competitors but it could be years before they come close to rivaling the western giants several weeks ago coal producer china shenhua energy co pulled off the second largest initial public offering world wide this year behind petrochina co raising almost &# billion on the shanghai stock exchange it has said it is looking for overseas acquisitions including in southeast asia some of chinas resource companies are already expanding overseas anshan iron &amp steel group corp has a &# billion joint venture with a company in australia to develop iron ore deposits there zijin mining group co recently acquired u k listed monterrico metals plc and aluminum corp of china recently announced an &# million deal to take over peru copper inc of vancouver canada aluminum corp and its listed arm also known as chalco have projects in various stages of development in vietnam guinea and australia but many of the chinese companies remain small compared with western counterparts "theyre still a long way from having an impact on the market " says gerard burg a commodity market forecaster at national australia bank in melbourne "they also face the same obstacles as other producers including accessing the labor and accessing the equipment " he adds sue feng kersten zhang and alex wilson contributed to this article
