pakistan moves up vote musharraf attempts to blunt criticism of emergency rule islamabad pakistan pakistani president pervez musharraf announced a timetable to hold national elections by jan earlier than expected in an apparent effort to blunt opposition to his imposition of emergency rule but the military backed leader dashed prospects for a quick end to a clampdown that has resulted in the recent detention of hundreds of political opponents gen musharraf said emergency rule would be needed to ensure that parliamentary elections were "free and fair" and to beat back islamist militants who have escalated attacks against the government in recent weeks political opponents challenged gen musharrafs efforts to justify emergency rule "how can we hold free and fair elections " said ahsan iqbal a spokesman for the pakistan muslim league aligned with exiled former prime minister nawaz sharif who was ousted in the coup that brought gen musharraf to power "our entire senior leadership is in jail in exile or in hiding " gen musharraf in his capacity as armed forces chief declared emergency rule amid the widening insurgency in the countrys northwestern border region with afghanistan and speculation the supreme court might rule the generals re election as president last month invalid gen musharrafs government suspended the constitution forced out supreme court judges it opposed and pulled the plug on private television stations those moves have inflamed political tensions at home and strained ties with the u s and other western allies benazir bhutto a two time former prime minister and the leader of pakistans largest political party has criticized the developments and has pledged to lead public protests against emergency rule ms bhutto called the election timetable a "first positive step " gen musharraf said he hoped many of the jailed politicians and activists could be released before the parliamentary elections but warned political opponents against creating disturbances in his first news conference since declaring emergency rule gen musharraf said parliament would be dissolved thursday followed by provincial assemblies five days later to clear the way for national elections that he said would be held by jan that date is more than a month earlier than a feb deadline for elections announced by gen musharraf last week gen musharraf defended emergency rule as necessary to quell mounting violence from insurgents and to overcome a "state of semiparalysis" facing his government because the supreme court hasnt validated his re election "i have put the derailed part of democracy back on the rail " said gen musharraf arguing that emergency rule was needed to ensure "law and order" in the run up to the parliamentary ballot meanwhile mr sharif who was sent back into exile in saudi arabia after attempting to return to pakistan in september has sent a letter to ms bhutto expressing his willingness to join an opposition movement against gen musharrafs government according to the party spokesman pakistans security clampdown has prompted angry responses from several western governments including the u s senior bush administration officials have said they would review the aid pakistan receives but they also have acknowledged a reluctance to undermine support for a country that is seen as playing a pivotal role in combating terrorism secretary of state condoleezza rice said that gen musharrafs announcement of earlier elections was a positive sign and urged him to lift the state of emergency "as soon as possible " on friday ms bhutto was confined to her residence in islamabad for more than hours ahead of a planned protest march which subsequently fizzled the move marked a deterioration in ties between the former prime minister and the president who had been in talks about working together to ensure a smooth transition to civilian rule ms bhutto was later allowed to leave her home yesterday ms bhutto flew to lahore ahead of plans to lead another protest from that city to islamabad her party has condemned the mass arrests and treatment of its detained leaders and workers especially women since emergency rule was imposed ms bhutto could come to power again if her pakistan peoples party wins enough votes in parliamentary elections and a ban on anyone serving three terms as prime minister is lifted at his news conference when asked if he considered ms bhutto an ally or an opponent gen musharraf said he would be "neutral" in the parliamentary balloting and questioned the extent of her popular support saying that for her to become prime minister again she has "to win the election first " he ruled out the reinstatement of pakistans now dismissed supreme court chief justice which ms bhutto has demanded gen musharraf said the chief justice had abused his office and was guilty of "personal corruption " gen musharraf dressed in his civilian dark suit and blue tie described emergency rule as a "bitter pill to swallow " after consulting a broad spectrum of groups from business to the military he said he concluded that his government had become paralyzed by challenges to his election before the supreme court he contended the impasse also had hurt the economy and had "demoralized" security forces trying to combat the islamist insurgency gen musharraf said some foreign leaders who he declined to name had expressed understanding of his decision to impose emergency rule after he explained his rationale the pakistani president said the military is planning to strengthen its campaign against militants with regular army units taking the lead from paramilitary forces in areas along the border of afghanistan and pakistans northwest frontier province "the military operation will continue until we defeat terrorism " he said zahid hussain contributed to this article
