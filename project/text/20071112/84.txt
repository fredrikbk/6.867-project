the morning brief a hollywood story without an ending online edition the wall street journal online the morning brief a look at the days biggest news is emailed to subscribers by a m every business day sign up for the e mail here in hollywood the west coast capital of conventional wisdom several theories about the writers guild strike are widely held the longer writers and their production patrons stay away from the negotiating table the harder itll be to come back no side is likely to emerge unscathed and a lengthy disruption of storytelling at the heart of film and television could help alter an already rapidly evolving media ecosystem what nobody claims to know is how as the second week of the strike begins layoffs have already spread across parts of the tv sector and hostility is growing with the pain expected to widen next month when the networks and studios can begin to apply the "force majeure" clauses in many contracts and thus walk away from deals and cut actors pay as variety reports "because force majeure clauses usually require six weeks after a strike has started to kick in theres a lurking suspicion that the companies wont push for a quick return to the bargaining table " variety says the guild told star strewn supporters to hit the studio lot picket lines again at a m following up on the strong rally outside foxs century city headquarters on friday fox in particular has drawn the writers ire thanks to a comment from peter chernin president of parent company news corp who suggested to analysts during an earnings conference call that the strike could "probably be a positive" for the company as the los angeles times reports "we save more money in term deals and you know story costs and probably the lack of making pilots than we lose in potential advertising " he said and the times notes that mr chernin is probably right at least in the short term since foxs reliance on reality shows like "american idol" puts it in a better position than rivals as in many labor standoffs the striking writers despite the evident wealth of some picketers may inspire public sympathy by facing off against corporate masters but that isnt likely to last as damon lindelof co creator and head writer of abcs "lost" wrote in the new york times "i will probably be dragged through the streets and burned in effigy if fans have to wait another year for lost to come back and who could blame them " said mr lindelof who is also at the top of the writing hierarchy as one of the shows producers "public sentiment may have swung toward the guild for now but once the viewing audience has spent a month or so subsisting on americas next hottest cop and celebrity eating contest i have little doubt that the tide will turn against us " mr lindelof and other showrunners do pretty well financially but many of their picket line comrades as the n y timess david carr notes earn just "a decent but not spectacular living by making people laugh or cry " and if mr chernins comments galvanized the writers the hard line taken by some strike leaders may cause dismay as well david young chief guild negotiator and a strategist behind the strike may find little sympathy from the many production workers now out of a job with such a half joking but unapologetic quip as he made to the l a times "i just lay back and look at the havoc ive wreaked " as mr lindelof noted the strike to writers is all about getting their fair share of revenue for the works they create once those works have been recycled in digital media that werent a factor when the last writers strike hit the industry in but if the likes of dvds tivo and streaming media have altered the playing field since then "the underlying issues in the strike were pretty much the same as they are this time " as the wall street journal points out "new technologies and markets were out there but no one was sure what form they would take and by the end television had been set on a different course accelerating a shift in viewers to cable and an increase in unscripted programming " the likes of youtube "may make the industry even more susceptible to drastic changes in viewing habits and programming styles this time around " the journal adds adding to the uncertainty are doubts not only about the viewing platform but about ad revenue models maurice levy chairman and chief executive of publicis and an eminence grise of the ad industry argued over the weekend that too many new media firms are competing for too few advertising dollars the financial times reports "everyone is seeing advertising as the manna " mr levy told a media conference in monaco "far too many people are building plans based on advertising and they may well be disappointed because there is not enough money for everyone " still at some point the revenue doubts will settle until the next big change which to some writers translates into more pressure to bargain now "because when television finally passes on there will still be entertainment there will still be shows and films and videos right there on a screen in your living room " mr lindelof wrote "and just as the owners of vaudeville theaters broke down and bought hand crank movie cameras the studios will figure out a way to make absurd amounts of money off of whatever is beaming onto whichever sort of screen " nailing down the siv rescue fund after weeks of wrangling over details of a plan to help the most petrified sector of a semi frozen credit market and themselves bankers from citigroup j p morgan chase and bank of america have agreed on a structure for the &# billion fund people familiar with the situation tell the wall street journal "the superfund is aimed at providing a fresh option for off balance sheet entities called structured investment vehicles that have run into trouble amid a lack of liquidity in the credit markets " the journal explains "these sivs which issue short term debt to buy assets that generate fatter returns have been stymied by market upheaval that has left debt investors sitting on the sidelines " the financial times reports that senior managers at the banks and credit rating agencies must still sign off on the plan before it takes effect but that officials "are optimistic the fund could be up and running by the middle of next month as originally hoped " since the banks first began working on the rescue plan at the instigation of the treasury department in september it has been criticized by some investors and other banks as self serving and of questionable value to the credit market beyond what it does for sivs and some analysts and big investors say the latest version of it probably wont help much the new york times reports "it may help calm the turbulent credit markets by preventing a sharp sell off of securities though analysts say the fund will probably not be able to offset the deteriorating prices of" the sivs the times says though it could "delay their demise "
