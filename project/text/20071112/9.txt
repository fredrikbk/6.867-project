bottle curve p&amp gs push into perfume tests a stodgy marketer giant woos designers tailors sales model valentinos rose garden rome at his lavish th anniversary bash here in july couturier valentino garavani feted hundreds of a listers from uma thurman to mick jagger hanging with the bejeweled elite were executives from procter &amp gamble co maker of tide detergent and pampers diapers p&amp gs presence was part of the companys unlikely campaign to become a major force in the luxury perfume business by pairing with valentino and other designer brands such as hugo boss gucci and dolce &amp gabbana p&amp g now rivals beauty titans loreal and chanel in premium fragrance sales around the globe prestige fragrance or perfume sold in high end retailers is one of the fastest growing segments of p&amp gs &# billion beauty division with annual sales of about &# billion the company says by years end total world wide premium fragrance sales are expected to total &# billion up since according to euromonitor international but competition is keen especially at the high end fragrance counters are increasingly crowded as beauty companies jostle for counter space and flood the market with new offerings last year there were more than premium fragrance launches more than in the s and s combined says karen grant an analyst with research firm npd group for cincinnati based p&amp g navigating in fickle style circles hasnt been easy the consumer products giant is compulsively methodical famously process driven the valentino camp is more quirkily creative and impulsive despite such differences the two have survived a learning curve that has required cultural adjustments on both sides with mass market goods for instance extra savings usually can be achieved by downgrading aspects of the packaging not so with designer fragrances where nuance such as discreet bottle seams and smudge proof boxes truly matters "luxury is a very finicky world to understand " says graziano de boni valentinos president of sales marketing and retail world wide "its a careful balance of image quality and scarcity " in contrast to launches for household products which call for quickly flooding thousands of stores with a new item fine fragrances typically debut at one or two tony department stores the point is to suggest exclusivity by getting valuable early adopter buzz typically fine fragrance makers craft elaborate launch campaigns for new scents only to have them fade away within about a year this prompts them to come up with yet another new fragrance p&amp g known for its vast cupboard of decades old household brands is trying to sustain its fragrance brands over time too "we need to find ways to do brand building " says hartwig langer p&amp gs president of global prestige products to give its scents a better shot of lingering at a time when store counters are overcrowded with bottles p&amp g is deploying one of its famous pantry techniques so called consumer segmentation just as it tweaks different versions of its household products to suit various customers p&amp g has set out to develop brand extensions within its fragrance lines "theres a risk of commoditization in this industry " says markus strobel p&amp gs vice president of global fine fragrances "we are aiming for fewer bigger and better launches " valentino rock n rose which targets young women is the companys biggest scent segmentation project to date since fragrances are often consumers first experience with a designer brand valentino hopes this line will help attract the next generation of luxury buyers to its wares after launching valentino rock n rose eau de parfum for &# late last year p&amp g will this month introduce a more intense parfum version called rock n rose couture at &# next spring p&amp g plans to offer yet another iteration of rock n rose called pret a porter this third installment a lighter eau de toilette will be the least expensive of the trio on a smaller scale in p&amp g and valentino used a similar strategy launching "v" in two different iterations that line targeted the labels middle aged constituency most designers roll out scents under different names a way to hit multiple audiences by using the rock n rose name across an entire line of fragrances p&amp g hopes to gain brand traction among young shoppers while achieving some economies of scale on the packaging and marketing fronts but three closely related scents could cause even more shopper confusion at jammed fragrance counters says arnold aronson a retail consultant at kurt salmon associates and a former chief executive at saks fifth avenue "the customer has got to be able to tell the difference and decide that the difference is worth paying for " he says sales of valentino fragrances have increased ninefold since p&amp g acquired the license in according to the company private equity group permira acquired a controlling stake in valentinos parent valentino fashion group spa in may p&amp g says it will continue to develop fragrances with the companys new owners meetings between p&amp g and the valentino team take place on valentinos turf including its plush art filled offices in rome inside a th century palazzo near the spanish steps before mr garavani stepped down as head designer in september they also met at the fashion maestros extravagant homes in milan and london and even aboard his foot yacht the t m blue one "the best way you can absorb from the designer is by working in their own setting " says sumit bhasin head of p&amp gs fine fragrance research who cut his teeth working on brands such as pantene shampoo and vicks throat drops "the more we met the better we could understand why he wants bottles that are perfect spheres we can understand the richness of his taste " time spent with mr garavani helped p&amp g tackle the challenge of formulating a rose fragrance roses are an important source of inspiration for the designer whose chateau outside of paris boasts a garden of nearly one million buds p&amp g worried that the rose scent was too commonplace and old fashioned "but as we talked to him about flowers we discovered that what he really liked was the sensuality of the rose rather than the actual scent " recalls mr bhasin that subtlety led p&amp g perfumers to take liberties when developing the rock n rose line despite its name it has only a hint of rose among other notes such as bergamot sandalwood orange blossom gardenia and muguet the concoction is intended to "evoke the velvetiness of the rose " rather than the smell of one says mr bhasin a biochemist the final scent meant to slightly modulate with subsequent versions pleased the designer who chafes at perfumes that "pinch the nose " the original bottle posed its own challenges mr garavani envisioned a glass sphere "it should be nice to see and feel heavy in the hand " he says he told the p&amp g development team the designer also had a few technical requirements "it cant hurt any part of your finger when you push the spray button " he said p&amp g engineers puzzled over how to mass produce large uniform glass spheres and keep them from rolling off the assembly line after considering one mold they realized it left a wide seam along the sides "i figured no one would notice it and we were able to get the mold at quite a good price " says iain stevenson a section head for p&amp gs fine fragrance development the valentino team with their practiced eye for detail immediately spotted the seam and rejected the prototype so another more expensive mold had to be used given the various production feats p&amp g suggested that the cap should have a simple rounded design but mr garavani and his business partner giancarlo giammetti both wanted a sharply pointed top to contrast with the bottles shape in making their case mr giammetti says he took a page from p&amp gs famous focus group approach rather than summon a formal group of panelists though he gathered three "very fashionable young women" and asked their opinion the chic consensus was for a pointed top mr giammetti says to keep the rock n rose cap from tipping over when its removed from the bottle p&amp g added a hidden weight to its base the black front of the perfumes cardboard box has a special matte finish to prevent fingerprint smudges even the cellophane wrapper was scrutinized "listen it doesnt crinkle " says mr bhasin crushing the plastic overlay mr de boni had pushed p&amp g to spritz new fragrances exclusively at neiman marcus group inc s dozens of stores rather than spray them around macys hundreds of locations so the first version of rock n rose debuted at neimans in november of about five months later it wafted downmarket to department stores such as macys and dillards while p&amp g enjoys considerable clout among many big retailers such as wal mart stores inc it is slightly disadvantaged in more high end settings at stores like saks fifth avenue and neiman marcus top fashion labels such as gucci and valentino have more sway since they also sell high end clothes and accessories p&amp g relies on the designers leverage to help negotiate better positioning on the sales floor and grab all important window displays "of course its a no brainer that we have more weight with stores " says mark lee ceo of gucci groups gucci brand which renewed a fragrance licensing agreement with p&amp g last year "p&amp g doesnt but thats changing " for its second version of rock n rose p&amp g was determined not to reinvent the wheel and wanted to stick largely to the same packaging and marketing themes some adjustments however were necessary both p&amp g and valentino were anxious to preview the new rock n rose couture at the designers th anniversary celebration the valentino house wanted to embellish the basic bottle to coordinate with its couture runway show which took place the same july weekend "the collection is full of feathers " says mr giammetti "we wanted feathers on the perfume too " researchers from p&amp g scanned suppliers around the world to find feathers sturdy enough to withstand packing and shipping any dyed varieties had to be stable enough so that the perfume when sprayed wouldnt cause the feathers colors to run the task proved too difficult "we tried everything but nothing worked without seeming tacky " says mr bhasin months later a compromise was reached p&amp g found a hand sewn black silk flower that passed muster with mr garavani and would look crisp for three to five years of use the length of time p&amp g believes that consumers hold on to a luxury perfume in another adjustment the body of the original bottle would be dressed with a stocking since p&amp g knew little about textiles it sent a researcher to a lingerie fair in paris to study the stretching capacity of different types of lace and fishnet stockings after debating whether fishnets were too "moulin rouge" for the valentino brand p&amp g and the fashion house ultimately settled on a lace design selected by mr garavani for the couture marketing campaign p&amp g recycled images from the first rock n rose photo shoot snapped by fashion photographer craig mcdean they feature a nude model strategically covered in rose petals the scent itself is similar to the first with a deeper richer floral bouquet at valentinos lavish anniversary celebration in rome p&amp g and valentino wanted to have celebrities royalty and leading socialites from around the world try both rock n rose fragrances dismissing gift bags as too lowbrow for their haute couture runway show valentino asked p&amp g to place the rock n rose products in the vips hotel rooms they were accompanied by pink champagne and deep pink cezanne roses which had been shipped to rome from a valentino approved florist in london the designers th anniversary weekend bash included dinner in romes temple of venus and a lavish gala at the villa borghese where celebrities and other guests were serenaded by annie lennox stationed in the restrooms of both events bottles of rock n rose couture in early september messrs garavani and giammetti announced that they would be stepping down from the fashion house in p&amp gs fragrance team meanwhile is gearing up to launch the third lowest priced installation of their franchise rock n rose pret a porter also developed under the designers watch it is scheduled to hit stores next spring p&amp g declines to say much more about the fragrance but the bottle shape isnt a surprise round
