energy a special report a consumers guide to going green how much energy do you save by switching light bulbs should you replace your refrigerator we answer these and other commonly asked questions about what you can do to make an environmental difference we hear the message day in and day out its time to go green but figuring out where to start can be daunting when you look for advice you often find wildly impractical schemes about remaking your entire life to reduce your "carbon footprint " or you end up having to sort through heaps of perplexing statistics about power usage and efficiency meanwhile it can be tough to track down what most people actually need a clear statement of the carbon consequences of say switching your light bulbs and youll rarely find out if youll save enough on your energy bills to recover the cost of buying new appliances or changing your habits with that in mind here are some answers to some commonly posed questions about what to do and what not to do to get greener what are the simplest and cheapest things i can do to cut emissions the most important thing to remember as youre getting started is that you dont have to change your whole life to make a difference "you can go crazy and get lost in the details and completely miss the point that every little bit helps " says carl zichella regional director in sacramento calif for the sierra club so where do you start here are just a handful of things that may be obvious and yet so many people dont do them heat or cool your home less drive or fly fewer miles run electrical equipment less and use less water since pumping water takes a lot of electricity buy more locally grown foods and goods that are manufactured nearby theyre typically made with cleaner u s manu facturing processes and companies use less fuel to transport them plus buy the most energy efficient devices you can afford for instance look for appliances with the environmental protection agencys energy star label since the program started in the epa says it has helped americans save &# billion on energy bills and cut emissions equivalent to those of million vehicles the epa now includes more than four dozen types of products in the program everything from dvd players to air conditioners the epa has a useful calculator www epa gov climatechange wycd calculator ind calculator html that allows you to create a customized plan for reducing your environmental impact id like to start small how much energy can you really save with light bulbs a lot a watt compact fluorescent produces about as much light as a watt conventional bulb but uses only one quarter of the electricity because of that the environmental protection agency estimates that the average watt compact fluorescent will save the equivalent of pounds of carbon dioxide per year thats about as much as a car generates driving miles assuming it gets a typical miles per gallon and compact fluorescents wont cost you an arm and a leg in california for instance utility rebates and volume discounts have driven down the cost of a four pack of watt compact fluorescents to about &# versus &# or more for the watt equivalents in prices have gotten so low that some compact fluorescents pay for themselves in energy savings the first month it seems like my refrigerator is a big energy hog but its such a costly item to replace when does it make sense to buy a new one and should i pay extra for an energy star model first lets clear up a misperception compared with other household systems refrigerators dont use that much electricity in fact they account for only of an average households annual electricity use behind items such as water heating and theyre dwarfed by real hogs like climate control systems with that in mind heres a rough guide to replacing your fridge if your unit was manufactured before its probably time to make the move todays energy star models are twice as efficient as the average older unit according to the epa and will make up for their higher initial cost within five years in places where energy costs are high they may completely pay for themselves in energy savings within years on average youll likely save &# to &# annually in electricity bills plus a new unit that uses half the power of an older unit is responsible for about half the greenhouse gas emissions of course the actual environmental impact depends on where you live states with a lot of coal fired power plants have higher carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt hour of power consumed than states that rely more heavily on nuclear power hydroelectricity or natural gas fired plants how much energy can i save by turning down my thermostat on winter nights a rule of thumb is that a two degree reduction in the temperature setting on your furnace cuts energy use by the epa says moreover houses that are well sealed and insulated including heat ducts use less energy because the furnace doesnt have to run as hard you might also consider replacing an old furnace replacing a s furnace with an energy star model costing &# could produce &# in net savings for a new england family according to an epa calculator at energystar gov index cfm c furnaces pr furnaces the move would also cut lifetime carbon dioxide emissions by pounds equivalent to the output of a car for years i drive a gas hog but i cant afford a hybrid any other options i should consider if you want to cut emissions from your car the simplest answer is just to drive less and walk or use public transportation when you can if you must drive you could carpool as much as possible but if you think a new car is warranted look for one with better fuel economy even small steps are meaningful every increase in fuel economy of one mile per gallon cuts carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated pounds per year according to the government remember a car with gas mileage puts out pound of carbon dioxide per mile with gas hovering at about &# a gallon theres also the obvious financial benefit after all going from miles per gallon to miles per gallon means a gallon tank of gas goes miles instead of miles a improvement there are several handy online calculators to help you make your choice for instance theres www fueleconomy gov a web site run by the epa the site allows you to plug in information on the vehicle you drive now and compare it with vehicles you are considering it also invites drivers to enter fuel economy calculations based on their own experiences and compare them with what other drivers report another very good tool both for households and corporate fleets is available at the advanced fuels and advanced vehicles data center www eere energy gov afdc hev calculator single php lets say youre weighing whether to buy a saturn vue as a standard or hybrid model and you plan to own it for years the calculator lets you figure out which is the better deal for your wallet and for the environment in this case the tool shows that the higher cost of the hybrid an estimated &# would be covered over years by the increased fuel economy city and highway for the hybrid versus and respectively for the regular car that assumes city driving miles driven annually and &# per gallon gasoline on the environmental front the hybrid would cut carbon dioxide emissions by pounds over that year period thats roughly equivalent to what two average passenger cars put out in a year assuming they drive miles apiece and get miles to the gallon does recycling household waste cut emissions yes recycling reduces landfill gas generated by decaying matter such as newsprint and cuts down the industrial energy needed to manufacture new products recycling aluminum cans for example cuts the energy needed to make new cans by so a four person household that recycles all its newsprint aluminum steel plastic and glass could cut its greenhouse gas emissions from solid waste by to pounds from pounds according to the epa calculator for comparison that saving is nearly of an average households carbon dioxide emissions in a year excluding transportation i keep hearing the term "daylight harvesting " how much energy can that save commercial daylight harvesting systems adjust the intensity of artificial light to complement the amount of natural light entering a space for instance manufacturer axis technologies group inc says it expects its systems to cut energy use by to depending on the amount of ambient light available the next wave of daylight harvesting equipment will allow utilities or companies to override the automatic settings and dim lights even further in emergency situations when the grid is stressed is it better to drive miles or fly miles often its better to fly than drive the average domestic commercial flight in emitted pound of carbon dioxide per passenger flying one mile according to federal statistics whereas the average u s passenger vehicle emitted pound per mile in other words a person flying miles is responsible for pounds of carbon versus pounds driving assuming the standard benchmark of miles per gallon but there are a couple of factors to consider the airline emission statistic is an industrywide calculation based on all flights and miles traveled while the car statistic doesnt take into account the number of people in a vehicle so a full car could produce less carbon per capita for instance with four people in the car emissions per person drop to about a quarter of a pound per mile according to the epa moreover flights dont get people to their final destinations so you have to figure airline passengers will likely do some driving to reach or leave the airport taking away a bit more of air travels emissions advantage weve become such a throw away society how do you fight it the epa says solid waste per person has nearly doubled to pounds a day from pounds in the past years filling up landfill sites and wasting materials that could be reused to save natural resources and energy although recycling is important it isnt as effective as reducing the use of materials from the get go one way to do this is to buy goods in concentrated dry or bulk form to reduce transportation and packaging costs favor refillable or reusable items pick flexible packaging materials instead of rigid packaging since flexible packaging typically takes less energy to make and transport pick goods with the highest ratio of product weight to packaging weight when possible example tuna in a foil pouch rather than in metal cans these options are getting easier to find matt hale director of the epas office of solid waste says retailers are pushing for improvements in packaging to cut transportation and materials costs as well as to use materials that can be readily recycled and thus cut costs again in broader terms jeffrey harris of the alliance to save energy a coalition of business environmental and government interests thinks more people should ask "how much do we need to live a quality lifestyle " he thinks that question inevitably leads to others such as "do we really need oversized cars and oversized houses " he believes peoples focus needs to move beyond energy efficiency even if conservation is necessary "the focus has to be on consumption " he says "because the atmosphere doesnt care about efficiency it responds to the volume of greenhouse gases put into it " how many years does it take solar power systems to pay for themselves and how much carbon dioxide do they offset first lets lay out the numbers involved a watt solar power system a typical size for many homes costs roughly &# after a federal tax credit and can meet about three quarters of many families electricity needs by one estimate it cuts carbon dioxide output by an equivalent of three quarters or about tons per year that assumes a household needs kilowatt hours of electricity per year and gets from its panel system as for payback time it depends on where you live some areas such as the southwest offer stronger more consistent sunlight and make solar systems more effective meanwhile some states offer tax credits and incentives for solar systems while others dont plus many people get long term financing from lenders for solar electric systems so they are cash flow positive from the start for example they pay &# a month for a lender financed solar system that saves them &# a month in energy heres a general guideline in states with hefty rebates like california and new jersey the payback period is seven to years it may be twice as long in states without local incentives or in places where theres less sunlight on photovoltaic panels how can i promote reductions in carbon intensity in my community support policies that result in reductions in energy use even if theyre a side benefit for example the federal government is encouraging "transit oriented design " in which cities encourage mixed use developments around transit hubs such as commuter rail stations residents say they like the convenience of transit options and having shops and restaurants that are within walking distance of course society benefits from the increased density if more people walk bike or take mass transit it also may leave more land as open space ms smith is a staff reporter in the wall street journals san francisco bureau she can be
