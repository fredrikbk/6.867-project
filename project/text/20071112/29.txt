eyes on the road auto makers wean themselves from costly sales incentives getting better at balancing supply and demand but will they stick to it online edition maybe you dont feel it just yet but its that magical time of year when kids of all ages dare to dream the leaders of big car companies have visions dancing in their heads too but not of sugar plums theyre dreaming of higher prices sales are sluggish and consumers are worried about the impact of high energy prices on their bank accounts or their businesses but strangely enough the auto industry sees this as a good time to try to end a multi year slide in real prices adjusted for inflation and new equipment what detroit and rivals in tokyo and frankfurt wants to do is convince consumers that the sticker price is the price or at least closer to a fair price than in the recent past surprisingly the auto companies appear to be having some success at least in the short run after years of declines new vehicle prices have been flattening out since last december says ford motor co chief economist ellen hughes cromwick eight of the nine biggest car makers in the u s market managed to push up their average transaction prices for vehicles during the third quarter from the same period a year ago the power information network reported in its pin insights newsletter friday gm increased average retail transaction prices by to lead the group on average transaction prices for the nine manufacturers rose during the third quarter from a year earlier pin reported the power information network gathers pricing data from thousands of u s dealerships both general motors corp and ford reported losses last week in their north american auto businesses but the losses would have been far worse if the two companies hadnt succeeded in pushing up prices largely by reining in discounts at ford higher prices narrowed the third quarter loss in north america by &# billion or about &# more per vehicle world wide ford netted &# billion in higher prices for its vehicles compared to a year ago "im very encouraged by the discipline of the industry right now " says ford chief executive officer alan mulally "all of us are on that path now to balance production and demand " for most of this decade detroits auto makers did a poor job of balancing production with actual consumer demand the reasons are many starting with the fact that car makers book revenue when a vehicle is sold to a dealer and ordinarily that "sale" is booked whenever a vehicle is built never mind that a car could be "sold" and then sit for weeks in a parking lot before a real customer showed up throw on top of that the old united auto workers union contract that compelled the detroit three to pay u s factory workers whether they built cars or not and then season with a penchant for rosy scenario sales projections and inwardly focused market share targets and you get the toxic combination of perverse incentives that resulted in endless rounds of distressed merchandise discounting selling new cars as if they were leftovers at a cheap electronics store helped to tarnish the images of detroit brands and perpetuate weak resale values that drove customers to brands such as honda or lexus or bmw by contrast the strongest of the european and japanese auto makers rely less on panicky deals because they are more disciplined about keeping inventories down toyota motor corp for example has had a rough patch with sales the past few months resorting to very detroit like deals to shift its big tundra pickup even so toyotas total inventory of unsold vehicles in the u s is just a day supply as of oct compared to days days and days for gm ford and chrysler llc respectively among the big european names bmw is running the tightest ship with just days supply as of halloween mercedes benz is at days and audi at days detroits giants are catching on to this supply and demand thing the process is lumpy and imperfect theres a reason why industry executives talk about discounts using the language of addiction as in "we have to get off incentives " as with booze or cigarettes it sometimes takes a crisis to convince the addict that change will be less painful than muddling through on the sauce in detroits case the crisis came with financial losses that among the three total more than &# billion since of course theres also the continuing downward spiral in market share but equally bad is the dwindling share of mind detroit brands have among influential and affluent consumers when your vehicles are synonymous with rent a car youre in a bad place now that a new uaw contract makes it less costly to idle unneeded assembly lines the detroit companies are curbing production and whittling down the volume of vehicles they sell at big discounts to rental car fleets there are signs that the discipline and some improved designs are paying off gms cadillac division has just days supply of its new cts model a direct competitor of the bmw series gm has just days worth of its buick enclave crossovers to sell and gm is offering almost nothing in the way of discounts as a result as my colleague john d stoll reported last week gm is cutting a shift of production at the plant that builds the enclave and two similar vehicles sold through the gmc and saturn brands to avoid a potential glut if the market slows ford doesnt have anything quite as hot as the enclave on its lots but the company is managing to stabilize and even raise prices for its mid sized fusion according to data from the power information network which crunches transaction prices from several thousand dealerships a fusion sold for about &# in october according to pin compared to &# in september for the model year fusion prices bounced around in a range between &# and &# ford is limiting bulk sales to fleets which sacrifices market share in favor of bolstering resale values for new cars sold to consumers what all this means for consumers is that the game of cat and mouse between manufacturers and shoppers could get more challenging if what you want is a big rebate or a no interest loan december is traditionally a good month for deals on luxury models and leftovers from last year and its likely that custom will continue the wild card is how much the soaring value of the euro against the dollar will dampen the holiday spirit at the german brands even if you hate lexus you should thank them for keeping your bmw more affordable longer term the ability of the mass market car makers both american and japanese to forswear crazy deals will depend on whether the effort to hold prices starts to cost too much in terms of sales volume unfortunately for the manufacturers and their shareholders the underlying causes of weak automotive pricing a glut of car making capacity world wide and the status of the u s as the open market of choice havent changed its hard enough to walk the straight and narrow path its even harder when the whole world is against you send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
