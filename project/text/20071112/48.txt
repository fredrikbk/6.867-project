intel shifts from silicon to lift chip performance a fundamental shift in chip manufacturing technology is bearing its first fruits a collection of intel corp microprocessors that is getting impressive early reviews intels latest chips being formally announced today at an event in san francisco were built with new manufacturing materials intel is building transistors in the chips from a material called hafnium instead of silicon dioxide an industry mainstay since the s "its one of the biggest changes in the last years " said david perlmutter senior vice president and general manager of intels mobility group new production processes routinely bring technical and economic benefits shrinking the size of transistors and other features lets chips store more data and perform other functions at lower cost earlier in this decade however chip makers began running into power problems without changes to the materials used in chips electrical current began leaking as parts of those tiny switches became smaller and smaller a problem akin to a faucet that wont shut off reliably getting performance increases by the conventional method of boosting clock speeds a measure referring to the timing pulses that coordinate activity on a chip began to consume too much electricity and generate too much heat so intel and rival advanced micro devices inc began competing by squeezing two or four electronic brains on their products offering what they call dual core or quad core microprocessors intels new process makes it easier to add more such features it shrinks circuitry dimensions to nanometers or billionths of a meter from nanometers the new materials for making transistors meanwhile can increase their switching speeds by more than while reducing their power consumption by about intel estimates intels latest chip designs have other features to raise efficiency performance increases compared with earlier models average to at the same clock speed mr perlmutter says but gaming enthusiasts are equally excited about the prospect of greater increases in clock speeds to make programs run faster intels new &# quad core model for high end pcs called the core extreme qx is being introduced at an initial clock speed of three gigahertz but kelt reeves president of gaming pc maker falcon northwest said he has been able to use a technique called overclocking to operate the chip at four gigahertz boosting performance by a third with little increase in power consumption that suggests intels manufacturing process has "headroom to burn" in developing faster models later he said besides the gaming version intel is announcing xeon models for server systems priced from &# to &# with clock speeds of up to gigahertz corrections &amp amplifications intel corp uses hafnium instead of silicon dioxide as an insulator in transistors built with its latest manufacturing process an article yesterday incorrectly said intel is building transistors from hafnium a photo caption accompanying the article also should have referred to a core extreme chip and compared it to a nail that is million nanometers long the caption incorrectly referred to a xeon chip and compared it to a fingernail million nanometers thick wsj nov
