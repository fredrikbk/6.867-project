theory &amp practice selling sales forces on a merger careful planning helps keep both customers and top performers when competitors merge melding sales forces can be a tricky but crucial task salespeople accustomed to stealing clients from one another must learn to cooperate "this has a very significant impact on the success of the combined business " notes mike moorman a managing principal for zs associates a management consultancy in evanston ill the experience of lafarge sa offers a possible blueprint for successful integration the french concern bought british rival blue circle industries plc in a deal that created the worlds largest cement maker about of lafarges customers were also blue circle customers says jim braselton senior vice president of marketing and sales for lafarges cement operation in the u s and canada executives feared losing customers if the integration wasnt handled well but mr braselton says careful planning helped the combined enterprise keep of clients previously served by blue circle and lafarge in the region a torrent of takeovers suggests that more companies will need to integrate competitive sales forces the world wide value of mergers and acquisitions so far in is a record thomson financial reports full year u s activity seems likely to exceed s level of &# trillion based on the &# trillion of deals struck through nov recent deals involving competitors include bank of america corp s purchase of lasalle bank last month and the pending acquisition of reuters group plc by thomson corp most corporate marriages involve rivals says mitchell marks associate professor of management at san francisco state university however "close to of mergers fail to achieve their financial or strategic objective " he estimates after cb richard ellis group inc acquired trammell crow co last december the commercial real estate services firm lost star sales brokers in certain locales trammell crow defectors resented how the new owner carved up their turf crimping commissions one real estate industry executive recalls cb richard ellis spokesman steve iaco says attrition met expectations "and for the most part the stars have been kept " lafarges strategy for blending its person sales force in the u s and canada with blue circles salespeople was focused on avoiding such problems the rivals had competed intensely along the boston to washington corridor where they mainly served small family owned makers of concrete the merged company created a sales force integration team including the best sales performers from both companies that began work the day the deal was completed salespeople dont usually participate in integration task forces says gerald adolph head of the mergers and restructuring practice at booz allen hamilton lafarge included salespeople in the integration team because "we feared the loss of customers" if the integration faltered mr braselton remembers executives also wanted help from the salespeople "in spreading the word to everybody else " he says hoping to minimize turf fights and work force anxiety lafarge hired zs associates to analyze its combined customers needs in addition the consulting firm helped lafarge assess each salespersons performance competency and client relationships the "us versus them" mentality soon dissipated because "the lafarge guys didnt say were going to make all the decisions " mr moorman recollects "they were trying to pick up the best practices of both organizations " the joint team used the consultants findings to revamp the sales force organization alter customer assignments craft a fresh marketing strategy and reassure clients lafarge sought to ease the financial impact for salespeople given new assignments by doubling the proportion of compensation based on bonuses according to mr braselton the revised compensation plan sought to equalize "earning opportunities by job role " mr moorman says lafarge avoided mass job cuts preferring to weed out poor performers less than of each sales force was laid off initially others chose early retirement "we made some people happy and other people not so happy " mr braselton admits the unhappiness was spread across both of the former sales forces each concern has kept just under half of its staffers since overall "lafarge did the sales force integration very professionally " says frank lore jr a former blue circle regional sales manager who had competed against lafarge mr lore says he initially was anxious about the merger he now handles accounts down from the he oversaw before and reports to a younger boss but mr lore says he makes more money under the revised pay plan in combining rival sales forces "we didnt try to do everything overnight " mr braselton emphasizes lafarge spent three years refining the new marketing strategy not every step went smoothly mr braselton believes that he and his colleagues failed to adequately explain a new method for handling price changes in mid he says it took months twice as long as anticipated before district sales managers fully supported the plan
