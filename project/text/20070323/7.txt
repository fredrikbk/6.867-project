successes all the reporting lines run up to mr james and even though mr james joined blackstone only five years ago yesterdays filing states that when mr schwarzman steps down "it is his current intention to recommend" that mr james take over associates say mr schwarzman has been pushing the idea of going public more than anyone else in the firm mr james has been more cautious worrying about life in a fish bowl as a public company and whether blackstone might become more of a lightning rod as a loyal no though mr james is making all the preparations for the listing studying how another famed partnership goldman sachs group inc went public and mr james has been entrusted with making sure the division of the ipos spoils isnt too contentious a merger whiz kid mr james who goes by tony instead of his given name is a veteran wall street executive in the s in his s he headed the merger practice at dlj and was profiled in a wall street journal page one article as part of a new breed of workaholic "merger whiz kids " he famously chartered a learjet at a m to make it to a meeting after an all night negotiating session "i cant resist the temptation to say &# million sounds like a lot of money but its really not " he said at the time "no ones going to shed any tears for us but the fact is its easy to make &# million and not accumulate a lot " back then mr james fantasized about entering politics after making his millions on wall street instead he stayed on wall street and helped build dlj taking the firm public in the mid s and started its merchant banking business of taking stakes in companies he then used the buyout business to help kick start the investment bank financing companies through the high yield market then creating an ipo platform and a merger advisory

equity firm blackstone dlj put about &# million equity in the deal and underwrote a high yield bond for about &# million at a time when market conditions were far from ideal dlj ended up sitting on &# million of the issue with capital at the time of a paltry &# million that year some of the firms star deal makers were paid bonuses in those undesirable bonds among those receiving the bonds were mr james himself and garrett moran one of a large number of former dlj executives now at blackstone mr moran recalls eventually the bonds were sold and traded at more than cents on the dollar close relations between dlj and mr schwarzman at blackstone were solidified investment pays off five years ago with blackstone growing a torrid pace mr schwarzman decided he needed a no several people suggested he look at mr james who had helped sell dlj and was a top executive at its new parent the then named credit suisse first boston credit suisse paid a big price for dlj in at the top of the market but the business suffered after many people bolted adding to its misery it handed out packages to keep bankers which increased its cost base during the market downturn mr schwarzman spent hours

business that invests in real estate another in hedge funds and debt it is also a provider of merger and restructuring advice mr james has spent a lot of time building up the mergers and acquisitions advisory business arguing successfully to corporate executives that blackstones advice is independent in contrast to the conflicts inherent in the large investment banks in the small but fiercely competitive world of private equity firms mr james is on good terms with his rivals for instance one of mr jamess close friends is david bonderman the co founder of tpg the big buyout firm formerly known as texas pacific group every year the two disappear for a week of fly fishing this year they went to the amazon last year they trekked out to mongolia mr james no amateur ties his own flies and
