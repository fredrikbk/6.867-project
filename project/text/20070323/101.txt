weekend journal catalog critic an easter basket hunt for the most part wed never recommend putting all your eggs in one basket for easter its a different story especially if youre a kid or a retailer this spring upscale catalogs we wouldnt normally associate with sentimental holiday geegaws such as garnet hill and williams sonoma are offering stylish easter receptacles that can be personalized with a childs name cute we thought and a good way to spice up the annual egg hunt on april we ordered five examples all prices include any personalization fees slapping various childrens names on everything from baskets to a bucket to a shoeshine style caddy with the exception of the caddy which featured a cartoon child dressed as a bunny they were surprisingly sophisticated many could be reused as decor in a childs room we especially liked the galvanized metal bucket from pottery barn kids in blue and yellow or pink and green it was nostalgically chic like an old fashioned sand pail still we knew we werent the best judge for these easter containers we sought the opinion of two second graders one girl and one boy who thanks to us may now have an inkling that the easter bunny sometimes buys his supplies online as we suspected they couldnt have cared less about chicness the girl adored the bunny girl character on the wooden caddy the children wanted to know two things could the products carry a satisfactory amount of treats and were they light enough to haul around during an egg hunt both agreed that the wicker basket from aspecialgift com had the ideal volume to weight ratio its our best overall the metal bucket came in second though both kids thought it a bit awkward to carry and though the fabric covered paperboard basket from williams sonoma disappointed us the printed letters werent as crisp as we would have liked the testers loved its cheery color a note these baskets do not come filled youll need to supply your own goodies some of the larger containers including our top two choices and the caddy require a great deal of easter grass and filler lest it look as if the easter bunny skimped this year how we shopped we had to buy early to meet our
