the afternoon report home sales surprise online edition federal reserve policy makers say that the housing "adjustment" is "ongoing " but some investors could be wondering if what really needs adjusting are their bifocals after home sales came up hot last month u s home resales actually advanced during february to a million annual rate the national association of realtors reported today trumping forecasts of a decline that came amid worry that buyers might be having problems securing financing for those tuned into the subprime scarefest that may seem a truly puzzling result but the encouraging headline reading may just be the rustling of vultures wings as scavengers descend on the market amid a decline in home values the median home price declined in annual terms during february the seventh consecutive month that prices have eased also troubling more homeowners appear to be dumping their homes on the market which means prices may decline to an even greater extent the inventory of existing homes for sale surged during february to million a backlog that would take more than six months to work off at the current sales pace economists say that means anyone looking to celebrate the end of the housing correction may want to keep their streamers in storage steven wood the chief economist at insight economics wrote that the inventory problem needs to be eliminated first that could be a tall order easy credit is drying up fast thanks to the unraveling of the subprime mortgage sector herding a pack of potential buyers out of the market and eliminating them as candidates to sop up all that extra supply even the reliably optimistic david lereah the chief economist for the realtors thinks the subprime fiasco could wipe out a quarter of a million home sales in

pricing pressure among homebuilders and other participants in the new home and resale markets " with a number of subprime lenders going into the tank or no longer dishing out new loans the squeeze may get even worse some economists believe that the national data may be masking acute problems in particular markets as well joseph brusuelas of ideaglobal pointed out that a very strong condominium market in new york city that is being bolstered by fat income gains for the wall street set may be obscuring "the real problems in miami las vegas and several other urban areas at risk when the condo sector unwinds " and other say that balmy winter weather may also have caused some funny business in the data omair sharif strategist at rbs greenwich capital pointed out that the existing home sales are recorded at contract "so februarys data mostly reflect transactions that occurred in january " temperatures during the first half of january were downright tropical by normal northeast standards and mr sharif wrote that that "likely contributed noticeably to the surge in sales in that region " tech stocks sputter the home sales report was just the excuse that some investors needed to dive in
