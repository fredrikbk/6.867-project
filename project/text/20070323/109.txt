weekend journal taste de gustibus conspicuous virtue and the sustainable sofa lance armstrongs ubiquitous yellow "live strong" wristbands have become a world wide phenomenon more than million have sold since one of the greatest successes in nonprofit fund raising history with the proceeds going to cancer related causes no doubt some wear the bands in solidarity or for inspiration but that said the wristband conceit was simply ingenious it allowed people to make a show of their virtue they could give to a good cause and they could advertise their caring to everyone else not for nothing did john kerry flaunt a live strong when he reported for duty at the democratic national convention for a perspective on the forces at work here click back for a moment to the gilded age in the norwegian american academic thorstein veblen published a humorless sociological tract called "theory of the leisure class " the book introduced "conspicuous consumption " a concept that the author defined as the "specialized consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength " veblen everywhere detected distinct class structures and he believed that people spent ostentatiously to show where they ranked for consumption to be conspicuous it had to exceed the basic needs "throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure " veblen wrote "runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumers good fame i e reputation it must be an expenditure of superfluities " serving a fine scotch might constitute conspicuous consumption no one needs it per se but it reflects taste connoisseurship and deepness of pocket h l mencken thought "theory of the leisure class" contained "a cents worth of information wrapped in a bale of polysyllables " which is about right the book did articulate the sensible economic insight that consumers spend for appearances as much as anything else and cent no it recognized that there is a wealth of status data encoded in our houses clothes diets transports pleasures etc conspicuous consumption stays with us today but increasingly it seems to me many consumers are not seeking an outright demonstration of wealth instead they consume to demonstrate their innate goodness they spend not to suggest the deepness of their pockets but the deepness of their hearts we inhabit to update veblen an age of conspicuous virtue a trip to the supermarket is instructive for some time everyday food has groaned with every sort of moral sentiment all natural sustainable cage free free range organic organic organic foods like these are more than mere sustenance they commodify values making them real material in the world they are virtuous goods to consume a virtuous good is to make a statement it is not only to do right whatever that might mean but to announce that you are doing so thus we encounter the extreme specialization of virtuous consumption upscale boutique grocers like whole foods market and trader joes base their identities and marketing strategies on giving people a way to eat so that each of us may demonstrate where we rank in the virtue standings the "holistic thinking" of whole foods market for instance could not be fully expressed in a "vision statement " so the store is governed by a posted "declaration of interdependence" as well trader joes actually makes a point of advertising that it does not kill baby seals in the procurement of seafood such consumption becomes more and more specialized and presumably rare this newspaper recently reported that furniture designers are producing couches and chairs upholstered with "organic or sustainable leather " meaning leather made "from free range cattle that is treated with vegetable dyes and isnt processed with heavy metals " to be sure veblens notion of "superfluity" is bound up in this evolution of shopping no one would go to wal mart in search of conspicuous virtue only the reasonably affluent can afford to align their products with their beliefs take toyotas hybrid auto the prius studies consistently show that fuel savings do not justify the price premium of a gasoline electric power train people who can afford the gesture continue to buy the prius anyway largely because it certifies personal enlightenment in the matter of global warming the original design was adorned with cues to distinguish it from a normal car such as a tapered rear end and skirts over the back wheels even without these particular elements the prius remains distinctive or bulbous enough for everyone to recognize for those who disagree about the desirability of the virtue in question conspicuous virtue can assume a hectoring quality some of us would like to eat a hamburger without having to worry about what happened to the cow or to sit on a couch without wondering if it is sustainable it is more irritating when the consumption cancels out the virtue using less gas by driving a prius reduces the demand for oil and hence its price causing in turn other people to consume more ben &amp jerrys sorry unilever is said to make socially conscious ice creams but even the u n says that milk cows and other livestock "emit" more greenhouses gases the dreaded methane per year than do cars most fundamentally though conspicuous virtue reflects a kind of cultural entrepreneurship and its popularity tells us something intriguing both about the culture and about entrepreneurs culturally it addresses a continuing fussiness even conflictedness about materialism in america conspicuous virtue offers to those with guilty consciences a way to feel ok about consumerism a fine scotch is vulgar a "fair trade" scotch is righteous yet we also have here a tidy illustration of a robust market economy at work if consumers desire the specialized production of goods as evidence of moral strength hell theyll get it but there may not be any deeper meaning than that mr rago is an editorial page writer for the wall street journal
