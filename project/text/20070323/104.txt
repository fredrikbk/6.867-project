weekend journal review books go ahead make up your mind i am a strange loop by douglas hofstadter basic books pages &# consciousness what on earth is it most of us if pressed on the matter would confess a vague dualism there is we would say mind stuff and matter stuff though nonphysical mind stuff can push matter stuff around somehow especially when it comes to the human body further mind stuff comes in discrete units each attached in some inextricable way to the brain of a human being where it is aware of itself as a consciousness a soul or in douglas hofstadters preferred usage an "i " whatever consciousness is the is have it in the past quarter century or so speculations about consciousness have passed from the domain of philosophy into that of science with evidence coming in from neurophysiology zoology evolutionary biology and information theory there is even since a journal of consciousness studies it is ever more plain that the folk naive model of consciousness that mind stuff and matter stuff dualism bears no more relation to reality than the notion of the sky as a crystal dome mr hofstadter has been thinking about consciousness for a long time from early childhood he tells us he was fascinated by self reference the idea illustrated by utterances like "this sentence contains five words " it is treacherous territory mined with paradoxes "this sentence is false " the puzzles are by no means solely linguistic mr hofstadters best seller "goedel escher bach " contains photographs of some of the odd patterns you get when you turn a closed circuit video camera on its own monitor in that same book mr hofstadter suggested a theory of consciousness based on the idea of a strange loop the ability of any sufficiently complex hierarchical system language closed circuit tv certain musical forms to "turn back" on itself refer to itself observe itself in "i am a strange loop " he picks up that theme and attempts to fill out the theory considering the complexity of the brain one isnt especially surprised that at the higher levels it seems to become aware of itself too but it is a strangely paradoxical achievement in mr hofstadters view as he notes we often suspect that there is something incompatible between the laws of physics and the "vague shadowy" thing we call "i " our sense of ourselves being aware of ourselves our brains own mirror like looping back can feel like something "extra " inhabiting a separate self generated realm it is possible mr hofstadter wonders that self awareness is a kind of illusion if so to what does the illusion present itself there is no obvious answer to that question perhaps consciousness is merely as mr hofstadter puts it "a hallucination hallucinated by a hallucination " if so our vaunted "i" looks rather hollow mr hofstadter uses for his central analogy the strange loop that logician kurt goedel in a paper found in alfred north whitehead and bertrand russells "principia mathematica " the authors of that book set out to build all of arithmetic from a handful of logical symbols "and " "not " "there exists" and so on and a few simple rules the infinite hierarchy of theorems thus generated theorems about theorems theorems about theorems about theorems would they assumed be complete it would include all true arithmetic statements goedel showed that this was not so and could not be so in any such system in mr hofstadters words goedel made "principia mathematica" "twist around and look at itself " generating strange loop theorems that asserted their own un provability the mind may work in roughly the same way the difficulty faced by any new theory of consciousness is the strong attachment we have to our naive intuitive models of the "i " it does not help that these models are built into our very language think of all those smug pronouns mr hofstadter acknowledges the problem comparing the modern state of consciousness studies to the condition of physics before the great revolutions of the early th century relativity and quantum mechanics changed everyones viewpoint of the difficulty of convincing even himself of the validity of his ideas he remarks "its frustrating to feel myself constantly sliding back into conventional intuitive classical views of these questions when i know that deep down my view is radically counterintuitive quantum mechanical " "i am a strange loop" is by no means drily abstract all through far from it the book contains enough "human interest" material to get the author a spot on the "oprah winfrey" show mr hofstadter writes movingly of the sudden death of his wife carol at age and of the effect this event had on his thinking about selfhood had carols consciousness entirely ceased to exist he argues that it had not since by the closeness of their understanding carols "i" was instantiated not only in carols brain but in dougs brain too albeit in a partial "low resolution" or "coarse grained" form my self my "i " is not impenetrably fenced off from others there is seepage and replication mr hofstadter believes no man is an "i" land entire of itself at about this point i reflected that this is the second book i have read recently that has a title beginning "i am " the other was tom wolfes novel "i am charlotte simmons " and there is some overlap in the ideas of the two books the novelist is of course concerned with the "i" in its social context with the way that an "i" can be deformed by great social stresses mr hofstadters approach is quite different but at the end of his book he finds himself in novelists territory nonetheless facing the great truth that no inquiry into human nature can avoid we are social animals and so i was surprised to come to the conclusion that what seems to be the epitome of selfhood a sense of "i" is in reality brought into being if and only if there is along with that self a sense of other selves to whom one has bonds of affection in short when and only when generosity is born is an ego born theorizing aside there are many pleasures in "i am a strange loop " the authors trademark use of clever word play to convey his argument is amply on display for example he discusses alzheimers disease as the slow disappearance of an "i" from its original container while "low resolution" copies of it yet glow in the minds of others this is he says analogous to what happens when the moon passes in front of the sun at the moment of maximum occlusion the suns glowing corona remains plainly visible so he says alzheimers is a sort of soul ar eclipse you may groan but the analogy and the pun help to make the authors point unforgettable is the account of consciousness given in "i am a strange loop" a plausible one i think so if you read mr hofstadters fascinating book you will at least come away equipped with some original and thought provoking new analogies even if you decide at last that mr hofstadter is not a person you can see "i" to "i" with mr derbyshire is the author of "prime obsession bernhard riemann and the greatest unsolved problem in mathematics" and most recently "unknown quantity a real and imagined history of algebra "
