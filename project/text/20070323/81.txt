soon made in china high tech products intel investment shows how nations economy is climbing value chain beijing china is demonstrating a surprising ability to parlay its dominance in low end manufacturing into a new strength in producing sophisticated high tech goods already the place where many of the worlds computers and mobile phones are put together it is expected to become home to a multibillion dollar integrated circuit plant run by intel corp the worlds biggest maker of computer chips the speed at which china is moving into more complex manufacturing is a sign that its transition from a low wage economy making cheap goods to a high wage economy producing valuable ones may not be as difficult as once thought chinas government said last week it had approved intels application to build a &# billion integrated circuit manufacturing plant in the northeastern port city of dalian intel of santa clara calif is expected to announce details of its plans on monday in beijing intel spokesman chuck mulloy said "we have said for many years that we would be interested in putting a fabrication facility in china but we have nothing more to say about that at this time " the electronics business is one of the main areas in which the transformation of chinese manufacturing is taking place and foreign investment is crucial for those changes this deal also illustrates the force behind that transformation the critical mass that china has built up in the labor intensive but relatively simple assembly and manufacturing of many products is now allowing it to attract higher value parts of those businesses china assembles much of the worlds home electronics such as dvd players having attracted manufacturers with its low land and labor costs and its efficient ports and transportation infrastructure their investment has made china the place where the parts are put together but not usually the source of the parts themselves or of the designs which are often the most lucrative segments of the business but now an increasing number of key components are being manufactured domestically as companies see the benefits of putting that production close to the point of final assembly more and more integrated circuits are being produced here a decision by intel to build a chip fabrication facility in china its first in a developing country is likely to accelerate that trend chinas evolutionary push also reflects worries that low cost assembly and manufacturing isnt a sustainable business model economic growth is pushing wages and living standards ever higher so chinas government and industry arent assuming that its competitive advantage in low cost labor will be permanent and they are working to establish different strengths "yes china has a lot of labor but at this moment we still have a skilled labor shortage and in coastal areas the labor costs have been rising in india labor costs are even lower than in china " said qian wang an economist with j p morgan chase &amp co "when labor costs rise again in the future labor intensive products may not be that advantageous anymore " chinas investment boom of the past couple of years has helped speed the shift high profits and cheap bank loans have allowed companies to build new factories and install higher quality equipment reducing their need to buy from more advanced economies that has in turn expanded the nations trade surplus and contributed to frictions with the u s and european union "china is going to continue to move up the value chain but the u s isnt static " said john frisbie president of the u s china business council an advocacy group "our economy continues to innovate everyone said japan was going to eat our lunch but they didnt " ed pausa a semiconductor industry specialist at pricewaterhousecoopers said that contrary to popular belief china isnt the cheapest place to run an integrated circuit operation the philippines for example could be cheaper but logistically he said china is irresistible "if you already have a factory making laptops or cellphones here you want to have your supply chain as integrated and tight as you can " mr pausa said the pattern in electronics is also seen in other industries chinese steelmakers have recently begun producing types of high end processed steel that previously had to be imported the car business has gone from near total reliance on imported parts to heavy use of components made and designed at home there is still a technical gap intels plant while advanced by chinese standards is expected to be two generations behind the state of the art at the time it opens probably in a couple of years it is unlikely to manufacture intels signature microprocessors the calculating brains of a computer the chinese governments announcement said the plants main product will be chipsets which play a supporting role "its certain that intel is not putting its most advanced technology in china where the semiconductor industry is still in an early but growing stage " said mo dakang a chinese semiconductor industry consultant u s export controls and other restrictions are likely to continue to restrain international semiconductor companies from using top level technology in their china facilities he said intels decision to go with a lower level technology was probably based on two main considerations protecting trade secrets from competitors in china and obtaining u s government approval to move the needed technology into the country it could also help limit the political backlash in the u s in washington the concern on capitol hill in recent years has chiefly been with chinese investments in the u s intels investment would be outbound and so fundamentally different so far it has attracted little attention among politicians but in the current political climate there is always a risk that u s lawmakers may raise alarms as the deal gains wider attention of concern would be the potential risk of transferring to china civilian technologies that could be adapted for military use or that might eventually put u s companies at a long term competitive disadvantage greg hitt in washington and zhou yang in beijing contributed to this article
