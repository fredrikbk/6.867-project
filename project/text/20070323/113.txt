worlds musuems lawrence kayes personal taste runs to art such as the lithograph of a jeep stuck in a new england snowstorm that hangs in his office or the mexican folk art that decorates his home professionally his tastes run richer as one of the most successful attorneys in the newly crowded field of art restitution he has reunited clients with works by durer cranach and degas mr kaye is at the forefront of a growing force in art and law lawyers who promise to reclaim family art lost during the world war ii years or looted by nazis or soviets such cases have long been viewed as a token of overdue justice but as the art market booms and auction houses help scour for looted works restitution has become big business the number of cases has soared in a dynamic that echoes past law industry booms asbestos and tobacco litigation securities class action suits a confluence of factors has tipped art restitution from a boutique practice of a decade ago to a mini industry museums are putting their archives online and the number of online art databases is growing making it easier to locate potentially looted works as art prices reach further uncharted territory lawyers are accepting jobs that wouldnt have paid off in the past top cases yield nine figure payouts the legal fights have consequences for the museum going public some of the art worlds treasures are traveling a reverse migration pieces once seen in high profile places from amsterdams rijksmuseum to the museum of modern art in new york and the kimbell art museum in fort worth texas have come off the walls once theyre returned to the heirs the pieces are often auctioned to wealthy collectors to pay the legal fees in recent years dozens of museum pieces have come to rest in private collections at least big u s museums are grappling over war related art claims in court or in quiet negotiations the metropolitan museum in new york and the national gallery of art in washington among others are locked in a stalemate with ukrainian and polish institutions claiming ownership to their albrecht durer drawings an heir to a german banker has laid claim to a landscape by old master henri met de bles now at the museum of fine arts boston which the heir says the banker was forced to sell by nazis these cases may be the tip of the iceberg from to the nazis were believed to have plundered artworks while countless more war trophies were taken by the soviet army some nazi plundered art objects are believed to be hidden or missing world wide according to a u s presidential commission on holocaust assets museums have called the rise in claims a bloodletting that has forced them to gird up on lawyers a troubling development for institutions that typically say they received works in good faith and hold them in public trust survivors and heirs hail the restitution lawyers and collectors relish the chance to buy once unattainable masterworks and auction houses for whom these marquee works generate big commissions appreciate that such suits can transform works with uncertain provenances into pieces with clear title sothebys holdings sold restituted works last year it sold none a decade ago christies international sold more than &# million worth of restituted art in the last year including works by gustav klimt and ernst ludwig kirchner monica dugot the director of restitution at christies applauds the work of lawyers such as mr kaye "im just part of larrys fan club " a decade ago mr kaye was among a handful who routinely took such cases now the lawyers committee for cultural heritage preservation a two year old washington based group of attorneys interested in looting issues counts members and includes former prosecutors and longtime civil litigators the field is attracting young attorneys as more than a dozen law schools including those at stanford harvard and columbia have added courses in art law it comes as art world types are remaking themselves as art attorneys virginia rutledge a former los angeles county museum of art curator is now with cravath swaine and moore in new york and last year robert goldman a prosecutor and a consultant to the fbis art squad joined philadelphias fox rothschild to head its art law practice seattle litigator stuart dunwoody known for his work on a dispute to give barney the dinosaur the rights to sing a song called "i love you " is currently on the hunt to reclaim a &# million pissarro and in new york prosecutor turned dot com lawyer john byrne turned to art five years ago because his new firm wanted him to "boost their litigation " mr byrne filed a suit that resulted in a &# million blue period picasso owned by the andrew lloyd webber foundation being pulled from an auction last spring the case is ongoing christies called the lawsuit "reckless " another major player is e randol schoenberg of los angeles who left a securities law firm in to help a friend of his austrian grandmother fight for five paintings by gustav klimt at viennas belvedere gallery an austrian arbitration panel ruled on behalf of his client last year and last november four of the paintings were auctioned for &# million mr schoenberg who received around &# million in the settlement is now handling five restitution claims mr schoenberg says he recently gave a lecture at usc gould school of law and was bombarded afterward by students considering restitution as a specialty "i told them go find some clients " he says while attorneys who take such cases sometimes charge by the hour they increasingly seek contingency fees financing their research and court costs up front in exchange for a cut of any winning proceeds industrywide fees can range from to of the arts value a one third cut is standard one of the fields original repo men is mr kaye a year old from brooklyn and a partner at new yorks herrick feinstein firm he was introduced to the field in as a summer associate at the now defunct hayes sklar &amp herzberg when he was asked to help represent an east german museum seeking two durer paintings that had resurfaced in a u s private collection in a u s court decided the works should be returned mr kaye and his legal partner howard spiegler now have at least art restitution cases under their belts mr kaye concedes hes not fighting nazis but dispassionately sorting through a postwar landscape that may no longer include bad guys "in the past people tried to say we were on a mission but were not " he says "were lawyers we take on cases if we can win " in one of his biggest cases the dutch government sided last year with mr kayes client a former ice skating champion in connecticut agreeing that in the nazis had looted the artwork from the clients father in law jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker the netherlands agreed to send the heir old master paintings from of its museums including amsterdams rijksmuseum christies will sell off of the paintings estimated to bring in up to &# million the first batch will be sold april in new york faced with the flood of challenges some u s art institutions are fighting back the detroit institute of arts and the toledo museum of art recently went on the counteroffensive after a group of heirs challenged the provenance of a van gogh in detroit and a gauguin in toledo an attorney for the museums assembled a case that rebutted claims of looting but the heirs stood firm the museums took the unusual step of suing the parties first for challenging their ownership a judge in detroit threw out the heirs claims the toledo museums suit is still pending museums are also proceeding cautiously in making or accepting works that may end up in a legal thicket as it was assembling an exhibit last fall the met decided against borrowing a moma painting by george grosz a german expressionist who fled germany just before hitler took power because the artists estate claimed it owned the work moma says it bought the work in good faith from a german immigrant in but the met exhibited a different grosz instead until recently few war victims held hope for art restitution after world war ii allied soldiers and museum curators known as monuments men returned hundreds of thousands of pieces of plundered art some survivors won compensation for pieces that were deemed destroyed or lost after the s when statutes of limitations for restitution in most european courts ran out heirs who discovered their works had surfaced in museums or private collections had little recourse the renewed interest in restitution dates to the s when the soviet union fell and more war booty was flushed from eastern europe several new scholarly books on nazi loot effectively indicted the art world for a lack of due diligence for the first time survivors and heirs have been able to search online rather than hire researchers to scour far flung archives and in part as a result of a conference on nazi looted art in washington insurers governments and nonprofits began creating what now number online databases of stolen and missing works afterward a dozen institutions including the national gallery of art in washington d c and the detroit institute hired provenance researchers some members of the american association of museums have since listed works that changed hands in wartime into a nazi era provenance internet portal the list exceeds works up from last year when the met conducted an internal tally several years ago it found that of its european paintings had changed hands in europe when the nazis were in power so far it has returned one work a monet garden scene to an heir the piece which disappeared from its owners german bank vault in the s was believed to have been taken from berlin to the soviet union a private party bought it from a new york art gallery in and later gave it to the met two years ago insurance company aris created title insurance policies to protecting art owners against legal claims of ownership allowing wary collectors to buy artworks with unresolved provenances but still be protected so far the company has sold a handful of policies auctioneers have also stepped up vigilance in the late s christies and sothebys created departments that guard against unknowingly offering looted works and with their contacts in a community of heirs and attorneys auction houses restitution departments also have an eye out for works that may be restituted and eventually sold both operations also pay the art loss register a london based organization that lists missing lost or stolen objects including nazi war loot to backstop the auctioneers own due diligence art loss register has employees in india who scour the auctioneers catalogs for looted or lost art the number of claims has jumped in new york the holocaust claims processing office a pro bono branch of the states banking department was created in and is now juggling art claims the oldest claimant is one of mr kayes ongoing cases illustrates the tangled world of jurisdiction and historical circumstance that challenge those in the field in spring new yorks solomon r guggenheim museum mounted a landmark exhibition of paintings by kazimir malevich a series of white canvases with black squares and red rectangles that established the artist as a founder of abstract art fourteen of the works were appearing in the u s for the first time on loan from the small stedelijk museum in amsterdam around malevich established himself in moscow with his a radical version of cubism "suprematism " arguing that colorful geometric shapes could convey supreme emotion europes art community agreed and in on the eve of his th birthday he was invited to exhibit most of his oeuvre at the great berlin art exhibition during the exhibit the soviet government demanded malevich return to st petersburg the artist left the works behind with two acquaintances according to court records malevich was not allowed to return to germany and he died in war in europe separated germany and the soviet union and malevichs heirs scattered across europe and canada in one of the works custodians a german architect turned dozens of works over to amsterdams stedelijk museum while the city of amsterdam says its museum bought the art in good faith mr kaye argues that the donor didnt own the works the works mr kaye argued on behalf of malevichs heirs had been wrongfully separated from the artist if sold the pieces would sell for at least &# million his cut could be roughly one third as the works were poised to leave the u s in january he made an unusual bid for a u s trial filing suit in washington against the city of amsterdam the stedelijks owner amsterdams lawyer christopher curran of white &amp case declined to comment by bringing suit in the u s rather than in amsterdam where the works resided mr kaye sent a shudder through the art world while the works werent seized in the u s they returned to amsterdam the move threatened to crimp european museums willingness to loan works to u s institutions and hurt domestic museums chances of promising immunity from litigators historically european courts have sided with current owners who can prove they acquired looted art in good faith courts have also bestowed "good title" on looted works when the current owner had been in possession for several decades u s courts dont consider that good title art with a cloudy history has still been able to travel here to secure foreign art loans the u s state department can essentially promise international museums that visiting works wouldnt be seized opponents accuse mr kaye of venue shopping on a global scale thaddeus stauber a litigator with nixon peabody in los angeles who has represented the los angeles county museum of art in art claim cases says mr kaye should have tried the malevich case in the dutch court system before pressing it in the u s especially in light of state department promises "it just shows how far he and the families are stretching to make the u s courts work to get art back " mr stauber says "theyre basically bootlegging claims " last month mr kaye and opponents appeared in a u s district court in washington d c where a judge now weighs whether the case will be heard here heirs were absent from the trial rooms grazyna kusmierz the granddaughter of malevichs brother and a retired electrical engineer tracks the case from warsaw her relatives she says are scattered across eastern europe and beyond and as a child she saw none of her great uncles works in the s she traveled to st petersburg and saw malevichs "black square" a black square on a white canvas and later saw his paintings in berlin "it was such a strange feeling seeing this property " she said by telephone from warsaw "thanks to this case weve discovered all of the family we were divided by war but now we are united "
