weekend journal the finicky traveler taking a vacation from floridas scene calm hotel is accessible to south beach parties fire alarm tests upside floating in one of three outdoor pools at the new oceanfront acqualina resort in sunny isles fla i hear only the splash of the water and the wind in the palm trees im peacefully imagining i have the whole place to myself until a loud argument starts on one of the terraces in the story high rise yet thats nothing compared with the decibel level about miles south the overpriced overhyped scene in miami beachs south beach district i still have nightmares about the room i had there in directly above the shore clubs nightclub even at the relatively low key ritz carlton south beach where i bunked three months ago during the art basel miami fair the revelry from neighboring beachfront hotel parties kept me awake into the wee hours add the jacked up rates during peak weekends &# for a small king bedded room during the art fair the pool and beach congestion the noise that drifts up to even the highest floors and the fun fades fast its getting easier to enjoy some of the south florida sizzle without being in the middle of the frying pan acqualina which opened late last year with hotel rooms and suites and residences is just the first of several new hotel condominium projects planned along the strip of coastline that includes miami beach and its south beach neighborhood sunny isles had a heyday a few decades ago then faded into obscurity as a quiet beach hamlet with kitschy affordable motels recently developers including donald trump moved in and began razing the motels for new high rises another trump jules a real estate developer with no relation to the donald owns acqualina despite concerns about an oversaturated market the area continues to attract new properties starwood is opening a new st regis in june on the beach in fort lauderdale and even farther up the coast developers recently agreed to pay over &# million to convert the briny breezes trailer park community to a condo and hotel development from the causeway that crosses the intracoastal waterway and links the mainland to sunny isles acqualina looms like a las vegas version of a mediterranean villa its tower colored mustard yellow and terra cotta brown is surrounded on the ocean side by nondescript high rises steel construction frames and giant cranes and on the waterway side by low rent strip malls but once you pull up the elevated driveway you can easily forget the surroundings acqualinas gleaming marble lobby soaring ceilings massive chandeliers and oversized flower arrangements while a bit over the top look cool and elegant the hotels operator rosewood hotels runs luxury properties such as dallass mansion at turtle creek and caneel bay on st johns in the u s virgin islands acqualina has an outpost of new yorks famous il mulino italian restaurant and a two story square foot spa and the hotel is exactly five minutes i counted by car from bal harbour home to floridas toniest shopping mall during a recent two night stay the hotel was still suffering some growing pains it was testing its fire alarm system which meant alarms going on and off inside and out the spa wasnt open yet and when i returned to try it a month later it still didnt have the proper permits for its separate outdoor pool and hydrotherapy bath but the snafus worked to my advantage because of construction issues and the fire safety testing on one of the floors the room size id booked wasnt available resulting in an upgrade from my &# a night oceanfront room to a sprawling one bedroom apartment besides a full kitchen with granite countertops and a dining nook it included a small office area with an extra daybed as well as a massive marble bathroom and a separate half bath decorated in shades of ivory and taupe the apartment had intricate moldings dark wood furniture and silk damask drapes contemporary artwork big flat screen tvs in the living room and bedroom and a gigantic terrace overlooking the pools and ocean the suite was so new it had a few kinks of its own there was no light fixture over the dining room table which meant that the seating area was plunged into darkness as soon as night fell the motion detection light in the closet never went on when i walked into the closet only after id gotten out of it but i loved the big marble bath with the whirlpool tub though as in all rosewood hotels the shampoos and toiletries come in refillable large unwieldy acrylic bottles that tend to slip out of your hand in the shower florent gateau managing director of acqualina apologized for the glitches when i spoke to him after my visit as usual i dont disclose my wall street journal affiliation during my stay and said everything including the spas outdoor areas is operating the acre property also has a beachfront grill and a kids program focused on marine biology though acqualinas not cheap its rates beat comparable high end accommodations in south beach by a mile rooms range from &# for an intercoastal view room to &# for an oceanfront suite by contrast rooms in south beachs luxury hotel setai range from &# for a city view studio to &# for a one bedroom with a partial ocean view mr gateau says that guests like being able to keep south beach at arms length they can partake of its life and "come back here for a little peace and quiet " depending on traffic the trip to south beach can take minutes or or he adds they can just stay on the premises use the spa and dine in style if you dont want to get in a car staying on the premises is probably a better idea right now with sunny isles still a big construction zone i walked down the beach to check out some of the old motels like the monaco thatched sun huts outside and a funky beach bar as well as rates that start at &# in april but the wind was stirring up construction debris from the adjacent building projects walking back along the street was even worse with traffic noise and too many billboards with the donalds face on them as for local nightlife one big event is sunny isles free sunny serenade concerts with live music a dance floor and local vendors selling refreshments i met friends for dinner the first night at acqualinas il mulino but the quality of the food didnt quite measure up to the original in new york another friend and i had a better experience at the hotels other main restaurant the uncrowded aaria which offered mediterranean cuisine in a tranquil soaring space with a grand piano facing an oceanfront veranda where guests can dine on nice evenings a pleasant and attentive young waitress took care of us serving fresh barramundi fish and copper river salmon with spaghetti squash and pine nuts we also loved the unusual dessert a goat cheesecake with dried fruits though breakfast on the veranda outside the restaurant was a lovely setting the next morning the raspberries were moldy and the eggs undercooked our waiter eventually replaced them for us the spa operated by british spa treatment company espa especially impressed me it has teak panels tinted glass mosaics slate floors and a dimly lit lobby with a zen like ambience in a separate waiting area facing the pools i sipped a mango apple smoothie and nibbled on trail mix while waiting for my espa "time" treatment the two hour ritual started with a foot bath and massage followed by a salt and oil body scrub and a hot stone body massage afterward i tried out the european steam room with its iridescent mosaics and an adjacent ice chip machine i couldnt actually figure out how to turn on the soaring circular shower with its spiral wall with mother of pearl glass tiles supposed to emulate the inside of a shell when it was time to check out i figured i was close enough to take a swing through south beach and see the action on its action packed ocean drive i only got as far as the bal harbour mall however a sale at neiman marcus was too good to pass up maybe next time
