the evening wrap another iraq impasse online edition the house of representatives pushed through an iraq withdrawal timetable on the coattails of a war spending bill this afternoon and president bush replied by saying that the lawmakers had "abdicated" their responsibilities to soldiers the house voted to approve legislation that provides &# billion to finance military operations in iraq and afghanistan for the rest of this year but also calls for the withdrawal of nearly all combat forces from iraq by september the measures passage was hardly a sure thing despite the democrats stance that they had been returned to power with a mandate to bring a stop to the now four year old war some more liberal members of the caucus wanted a bill that would start a withdrawal even sooner while others of a more conservative bent believed that setting out timelines was a dangerous gamble that would undermine commanders in the field ultimately however speaker of the house nancy pelosi kept her flock unified she said in the closing debate that "benchmarks without deadlines are just words and after four years of war words are not enough the american people do not support a war without end and neither should this congress " house republicans showed their unity as well with just two breaking ranks to support the bill republican whip roy blunt called the bill "a poorly assembled wish list of nonemergency spending requests wrapped in a date certain declaration of defeat " the narrow majority that the measure attracted ensured that it wouldnt stand up to a veto and president bush quickly went in front of the media to make it clear that he has absolutely no intention of signing the legislation "a narrow majority in the house of representatives abdicated its responsibility by passing a war spending bill that has no chance of becoming law and brings us no closer to getting the troops the resources they need to do their job " mr bush said after all the votes had been counted "these democrats believe that the longer they can delay funding for our troops the more likely they are to force me to accept restrictions on our commanders an artificial timetable for withdrawal and their pet spending projects this is not going to happen " furthermore the president said posturing by the democrats could get in the way of delivering resources to soldiers fighting in iraq if a spending bill isnt signed into law by april mr bush said troops and their dependents "will face significant disruptions " the senate plans to start up debate on the measure starting next week and it faces considerably longer odds in the upper chamber where previous iraq bills have been held up by parliamentary maneuvering democrats there will need to scrape up votes in order to get the measure through meaning that they will need the support of about a dozen republicans though certain republicans in the senate like nebraskan chuck hagel have been some of the most thunderous critics of the bush administrations iraq policies scrounging up republicans willing to go along with the houses withdrawal timetable seems a pure fantasy senate republicans shot down another withdrawal plan last week meanwhile the senate passed a five year balanced budget plan that would try to force congress to offset the cost of extending mr bushs tax cuts a home sales surprise u s home resales actually climbed
