weekend journal hollywood report tom cruise tom hanks and shia labeouf spielberg bets big on kid from disney channel an indiana jones role while watching the cutesy walt disney co drama "holes" a few years ago steven spielberg made a mental note of the movies doe eyed child star shia labeouf the memory stuck these days mr spielberg is virtually a full time employment agency for the little known actor casting him in most of the a list directors major projects this year after spending his early teens grinding away in childrens television mr labeouf is being heralded by mr spielberg as the next big thing he scored the main role in next months "disturbia " a thriller from mr spielbergs dreamworks skg and before starting production on "disturbia " mr labeouf landed the lead in a big popcorn movie due out this summer "transformers " which mr spielberg is producing now mr spielberg is considering making it a trifecta by casting the year old former disney channel regular in one of the most anticipated movie projects in recent memory the upcoming revival of the "indiana jones" franchise mr labeouf would play the son of the archaeologist and adventure seeker once again portrayed by harrison ford mr spielberg has rarely given that kind of endorsement to a young actor the director has worked with only a handful of hollywood stars so often he cast a young richard dreyfuss in both "jaws" and "close encounters of the third kind " tom cruise took the lead in "minority report" and "war of the worlds " and tom hanks starred in "saving private ryan" and joined forces with mr spielberg on the television series "band of brothers " this hasnt escaped mr labeouf "the pressure is enormous " he said in an interview "if i screw up its not just me im letting down but the modern day hitchcock " mr spielbergs seal of approval certainly brings many challenges one is making a successful transition from child actor to hollywood star in the glare of the public spotlight something that tripped up the likes of macaulay culkin another is navigating the risk of burnout or overexposure that has rocked other actors on the brink of a list stardom like jude law after being spotted by mr spielberg and cast in "artificial intelligence ai " mr law was inundated with offers he went into overdrive appearing in six movies in alone several of them nonstarters at the box office including "sky captain and the world of tomorrow" and "alfie " for mr labeouf the scramble has already started most of the big hollywood talent agencies have made a run at him mr labeouf has so far stayed loyal to his original agent and manager although he agreed to take on a second agent from endeavor which represents hollywood heavyweights such as matt damon and martin scorsese rather than jumping at every big offer he gets mr labeouf says he is trying to be strategic he has turned down numerous roles including one in last years horror movie "snakes on a plane " even though people close to the project say it would have earned him a nice salary it was a good decision the movie came up short of expectations at the box office mr labeouf isnt exactly the classic hollywood hunk instead he has lured filmmakers with his raw charm and "two of the most expressive eyes " says "disturbia" director d j caruso "hes that everyday kind of guy " says "transformers" director michael bay "thats very appealing to a mass audience they can relate more to that person " during the production of "transformers " mr bay says he often compared him to a "young tom hanks" when discussing the dailies with mr spielberg mr caruso agrees "he has the kind of accessibility that made tom hanks who he is " thats something mr labeouf has worked hard at the only child of struggling "hippie" parents he had his first break at as the sweet curly haired misfit on the disney channel show "even stevens " disney took a big leap casting the unknown who had found an agent by looking one up in the yellow pages and impersonating an adult to get a meeting "he had to carry the comedy " says rich ross president of disney channel worldwide the show was a hit and marked the start of a turnaround for the disney channel it also earned mr labeouf a daytime emmy award he went on to make a few movies for disney but says he never "fit in there " in fact he quickly began trying to distance himself from the disney stigma in "project greenlight " ben affleck and matt damons movie making reality series he got the opportunity to show an edgier side to his character something he enjoyed after years of playing the innocent boy next door but escaping "even stevens" wasnt easy will smith reached out to him personally for a role in his movie "i robot" after mr smiths kids became fans of the disney channel show mr labeouf opted next for a role that was as far removed from disney as possible in last years "a guide to recognizing your saints " he played a kid growing up in new yorks borough of queens he curses fights and talks dirty to his girlfriend the films writer director dito montiel didnt even want to consider mr labeouf at first "shia was the kid from even stevens and that wasnt the kid i had written this role for " says mr montiel mr labeouf wouldnt take no for an answer and convinced the director to change his mind "hes smart hes got instincts and hes got guts " says mr montiel such persistence hasnt paid off in every case he made a strong play for an upcoming movie starring brad pitt called "the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford " but he was deemed too young for the role and it went to an older actor casey affleck when "disturbia" came up messrs caruso and spielberg didnt take much convincing to cast him as a troubled teen mr caruso was particularly impressed by his "natural acting rhythm" and ability to improvise in one scene in which the character confronts the girl of his dreams mr labeouf went entirely off script to describe his emotional state "he came so prepared and he was so grown up doing it " the director says shooting on that movie hadnt even begun before mr spielberg was recommending him for his next "transformers " based on the line of robot like toys mr bay says he brought mr labeouf into his santa monica calif office to read from the script as he did for all the actors he auditioned mr bay asked his assistants to check him out as he came in "their initial reaction was er i dont know but then they saw the tape and they fell in love with his charm and humor " says mr bay still it was a "nerve racking decision" because the movie hangs on that role mr labeouf says he is trying to avoid the pitfalls that have sent many actors of his generation off the rails although he admits to partaking in some of the party hijinks common to kids his age "i dont have many actor friends " he says pausing between profanity laced observations he does concede not knowing how to censor himself "sometimes this whole child actor thing is so watered down im an individual and i have opinions "
