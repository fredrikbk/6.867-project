corn battle ethanol reaps a backlash in small midwestern towns residents fight plants on water air fears farmers boycott stores cambria wis with empty storefronts on the main drag and corn stubble stretching for miles in the surrounding hills this fading farm town seems like a natural stop for the ethanol express not to john mueller though the year old stay at home dad has led a dogged battle to prevent a corn mill from building an ethanol plant up the hill from the village school concerned about air pollution the water supply and the mills environmental track record mr mueller and his group cambrians for thoughtful development have blitzed the villages residents with fliers packed public meetings and set up a sophisticated web site the mill has fought back with its own publicity campaign and local corn farmers have taken to the streets in tractors to show support now as the mill races to build the &# million plant the matter is headed to the federal courthouse in madison miles southwest nuclear plants garbage dumps and oil refineries have long faced opposition from neighbors ethanol was supposed to be different the corn based fuel has a reputation for being good for farmers the environment and rural economies ethanol which already receives a cents a gallon federal subsidy figures prominently in president bushs goal of reducing gasoline consumption by over years but a backlash has been brewing in towns across the midwest fights have broken out in indiana illinois missouri nebraska kansas and several towns in wisconsin opponents complain that ethanol plants deplete aquifers draw heavy truck traffic pose safety concerns contribute to air pollution and produce a sickly sweet smell akin to that of a barroom floor in southwestern missouri a webster county citizens group is suing to stop a plant proposed by closely held gulfstream bioflex energy llc of mount vernon mo the detractors say the million gallon a year plant would use more water than the rest of the resident county an "unreasonable" use of the areas underground water supply "this is not about water " protests bryan o wade an attorney for gulfstream "this is about a group of people who simply do not want an industrial facility near their homes " just outside rockford ill people who live near the site of a planned million gallon ethanol plant have filed lawsuits against winnebago county questioning the procedures by which it granted a rezoning to wight partners a schaumburg ill based developer last october wight filed a &# million lawsuit against the residents claiming they have abused the legal process merely to delay the project industry officials concede that ethanol plants have had problems with smell and toxic emissions in the past but say new technology has largely remedied that "generally communities look at these plants as local economic engines " says robert dineen president of the renewable fuels association a washington trade group the plants bring jobs and have dramatically raised corn prices and farmland values many ethanol plants have paid rich dividends to investors who often include local farmers and other residents but experts hotly debate whether renewable fuels offer a panacea for the worlds energy needs as with ethanol derived from corn which slurps up water many alternative fuels are creating environmental problems of their own in indonesia malaysia and canada forests are being slashed for energy yielding crops or other unconventional fuels in india environmentalists say water tables are dropping as farmers boost production of ethanol yielding sugar as the rush to build ethanol plants continues in the u s there are in operation under construction and many more in planning stages clashes with locals are multiplying cambria certainly looks like it could use an economic boost two canning facilities run full tilt around harvest time but slow considerably in winter the downtown strip features a cafe two bars one called the dump a bank a barbershop and a furniture maker but a supper club tattoo parlor grocery store and sandwich shop are shuttered many residents work in madison or other nearby towns a row of grain silos towers over the villages southern edge at the didion milling inc corn mill there locally grown corn is dried ground sifted and mixed into different products didions biggest seller is a mix of corn soy and nutrients that the u s ships overseas as emergency food aid the company generated about &# million in revenue from its government food aid programs last year in november didion sent letters inviting cambria residents to a public meeting about its plan to build an ethanol plant the letter said the plant would allow didion to "buy more corn from local farmers increase revenue for the local economy" and create new jobs today the company says the million gallon plant would offer jobs with salaries averaging &# a year and increase the companys annual property tax payments to various local entities to &# from &# in kneeling on the dusty mill floor to scoop out a sample of milled corn dale drachenberg didions vice president of operations says the company believes it will be able to make ethanol more efficiently than competitors most plants start the ethanol making process with whole corn kernels but didions mill separates the starch thats the most vital ingredient in ethanol "its a natural progression that will allow us to continue to grow our business " he says more than people crowded into the village hall for the first public meeting many of them farmers eager to sell corn to the ethanol plant also attending were mr mueller and a few others who questioned didion about safety emissions traffic and water later mr mueller huddled with some residents who had posed questions three already had formed cambrians for thoughtful development mr mueller joined the group which has about a dozen active members and put up its web site he and his wife who works at the university of wisconsin archives had moved to cambria from madison in an elfin man with a long gray beard and pony tail he had decided to quit his job at a lock and security company years earlier to raise his daughter now "there are just so many things i didnt want to miss with her " he says when mr mueller heard about the ethanol plant he says he feared for the character of the quiet town where hed bought a cozy house a few blocks from the school and an old mill pond scouring the internet he read about other places that had succeeded in blocking ethanol plants it was at once encouraging and daunting "we were just coming in from madison " he says "i thought wed be the only ones asking questions " the activists began plotting strategy at each others homes sarah lloyd a doctoral student in rural sociology who later got herself elected to the columbia county board says she initially thought ethanol was a good thing but she concluded that small midwestern towns were being asked to accept what amounts to new chemical plants in their midst in the national drive to clean up big city auto emissions and reduce dependence on foreign oil "we were really being asked to take one for the team " she says mr mueller filed open records requests with the wisconsin department of natural resources and the environmental protection agency he discovered that didion had repeatedly run afoul of federal environmental rules grain processing like ethanol production is subject to such rules because it creates tiny airborne particles that can cause respiratory problems and aggravate heart conditions in didion had paid &# to the epa to settle allegations that the company expanded a grain barge loading facility without obtaining permits or controlling particulate emissions didions mr drachenberg says the expansion amounted to some portable equipment brought in to help meet peak demand at harvest the company settled rather than go through costly litigation he says didion also had expanded its cambria milling facility without proper permits according to a notice from the dnr by adding to storage capacity and increasing the amount of grain processed the plant had come under tougher emissions rules the notice said the infraction was considered a high priority violation under epa rules carrying penalties of &# per violation per day mr drachenberg says the company had merely tried to build enough permanent silos to avoid storing grain on the ground at harvest he says the company had an exemption from the state but the official who had granted it left and others in the dnr interpreted it differently one sunday a few weeks after the first public meeting the activists fanned out in the village to distribute to each home a flier listing didions alleged violations and asking "is ethanol production in the village of cambria the development that we want " this set the stage for a tense meeting the next night at the school gym amid images of the school mascot the hilltopper a pickax wielding mountain climber residents and farmers packed the bleachers as speakers struggled to be heard through the faltering pa system chet stringfield then the villages president talked excitedly about the economic opportunity the plant represented as the night wore on the exchanges grew more heated mr mueller recalls at one point one of didions project contractors drew laughter with his assertion that the plant would help america defeat terrorism "it was heartening to me that even at that point some people found that outrageous on the face of it " mr mueller says that saturday local farmer brian jung fired up his eight wheeled steiger tractor and pointed it toward cambria there he joined about farmers in tractors and trucks in a parade down the main street in support of the plant the event was organized by the wife of republican state rep eugene hahn who raises corn wheat and lima beans near cambria for years he has championed state legislation to support ethanol mr hahn recalls a time when cambria had three grocery stores and a car dealership "thats all kind of dried up " he says of the people opposing the plant he says "its a bedroom community to them " the community split farmers frustrated with the opposition started an informal boycott of village businesses "i think the overall feeling when cambria was so against everything a lot of guys they just didnt participate in town " says mr jung the local chamber of commerce decided to back the plant only after serious debate meantime mr mueller and his fellow activists filed suit in columbia county circuit court to nullify a variance didion had received on building height restrictions and they garnered enough signatures to persuade the village council to put a referendum on the plant on that aprils ballot didion shot back with several direct mail appeals to residents including one that accused opponents of "trying to scare the people of cambria and to divide our community " cambria voters passed a referendum to bar ethanol from the town or its surroundings to effectively killing didions chances of building in the town plans for a plant were on hold until last april by then president bush had exhorted the country to wean itself from its "addiction" to oil and scores of new ethanol plants had sprouted across the midwest didion announced that it would again seek to build a plant this time on a small parcel it had acquired directly across the road from its previous site and just outside cambrias border the new site remained close enough to the mill that didion could trundle its corn starch over by truck or conveyer belt out of cambrias regulatory reach for mr mueller the new application brought "a sinking feeling like the beginning of a recurring nightmare " this time despite continuing objections from mr muellers group and cambria officials didions rezoning applications to columbia county and courtland township sailed through "it was unanimous that we thought that this would be a good thing " says courtland supervisor joann wingers whose family farms acres of corn and soybeans near cambria as for the opponents she says "if we could go back at least years thats how theyd like us to stay farming the economy doesnt allow that were trying to be progressive and economically beneficial to the entire area " didion broke ground on the plant in october and was soon embroiled in more controversy on dec the state issued a notice saying didion hadnt abided by a new air permit covering both the mill and the ethanol plant "there was a misunderstanding between my engineer the dnr and didion " mr drachenberg says over how much didion could use the corn drier at the grain mill before the ethanol plant came online the company has applied for a revised permit and scaled back work to comply with the current permit the opponents have not given up on feb lawyers for mr muellers group served didion days notice that they would file a federal lawsuit in madison under the clean air act citing the history of alleged environmental violations at the mill including the one noted in december christa westerberg a madison attorney who represents cambria and other wisconsin citizens groups battling ethanol plants says didions latest troubles are "part of this pattern of doing whatever it takes to get the permit then either dont live up to it or try to get it changed " if successful the lawsuit could lead to didion paying millions in penalties and require them to get new permits whether that stops the ethanol plant "depends on how didion reacts " she says mr drachenberg who lives near madison says didion plans to have its ethanol plant operating by november he says the company is in compliance with all federal rules and has worked to resolve any issues when they came up he was surprised at the intensity of the opposition four years ago he says and "im still surprised "
