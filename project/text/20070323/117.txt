recipes by home cooks meanwhile were relegated to the sort of spiral bound editions put out by church groups and hospital guilds but now amateurs are muscling in on the pros in a growing category of

scallops wrapped in thin strips of raw zucchini so they stay moist while being grilled but other creations arent likely to appear at sophisticated dinner parties velveeta fudge for example from the "red hat society cookbook " primary ingredients lb of the processed cheese lb butter lbs confectioners sugar and cup of cocoa "definitely fun to make " reads the accompanying note "let your chapter judge whether its fun to eat " critics complain that much of this folksy fare is just plain bad and bad for you high in sodium and overly reliant on processed foods but others say it is a welcome break from the hard to find ingredients and esoteric techniques that have been dominating much of the culinary scene and applaud the challenge to the snobby food hierarchy "we live in the great golden age of the amateur " says christopher kimball founder and editor of cooks illustrated and cooks country magazines recipe sharing he says is part of our anyone can do it culture from "american idol" to "dancing with the stars " mr kimballs company plans to publish a cookbook of "lost recipes " made up of entrees sent in by readers americans have a big appetite for cookbooks they bought million in up more than from the year before according to nielsen bookscan recipes by home cooks represent a low cost way for publishers to tap into the popularity of reader driven content that has become a fixture of recipe web sites and blogs and made taste of home magazine with about million subscribers the most popular cooking magazine in the country released last fall "the taste of home cookbook" has more than one million copies in print and unlike big name food writers like marcella hazan or thomas keller who might receive sizable advances contributors to reader recipe cookbooks get a byline or a short bio and a copy of the cookbook "a lot of people just want the recognition " says vickie hutchins a co founder with jo ann martin of gooseberry patch some repeat customers "vie to be in every book " she says ms paffenroth is a serial submitter her recipes are in about gooseberry patch books "sometimes five years later ill make the same recipe and tweak it " ms paffenroth says then shell

collections go back to the th century during the civil war women raised money for bandages and other medical supplies by selling homemade books of recipes says jan longone a curator of american culinary history at the clements library at the university of michigan ann arbor by the s she says "every state in the union had charity cookbooks " about the same time newspapers and magazines started to ask readers to contribute recipes which were published in the periodicals and then collected into books a practice continued to this day gourmet magazine editor in chief ruth reichl believes the current popularity of reader recipes reflects a desire for community "theres a huge segment of the population that takes great comfort from cooking and knowing that a recipe is not from a professional cook but from someone just like them " she says taking a page from online recipe sites and blogs publishers of reader recipe books often print snippets of stories that writers send in with their recipes and encourage connections among contributors and readers thats how ms paffenroth met fellow gooseberry serial contributor kathy grashoff of fort wayne ind both mentioned having sons in the military in notes with their recipe submissions and the gooseberry owners introduced them via email the two are now pen pals while cooking magazines generally have their own test kitchens the recipes in gourmet for example are tested repeatedly before they appear in the magazine many cookbooks arent so thoroughly vetted often its up to the writer or editor to make sure that the recipes "work " the gooseberry patch recipes are tested on an ad hoc basis at company potlucks that seems to work well enough ms hutchins says but only about to of the dishes in the "red hat society" cookbook were tested according to editor geoffrey stone he says the books recipe editor was experienced enough to be able to eyeball the recipes and tell whether they would work or not but adds "we cant guarantee that all the recipes are perfect " nor are they all recommended for the diet conscious "these recipes are not based on good cooking or good cookbook writing " says nach waxman owner of kitchen arts &amp letters a manhattan bookstore "you can destroy your health just by reading them " in general says nutritionist suki hertz who examined several of the cookbooks for weekend journal
