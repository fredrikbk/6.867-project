tangled web the past few weeks have seen a chilling crackdown on internet freedom by american allies an egyptian appeals court upheld a four year prison term for abdel kareem soliman a blogger who outraged religious authorities while a turkish judge ordered that internet companies block youtube citing videos that disparage the memory of turkeys founder ataturk this is nothing new bahrain where the u s th fleet is based has been hounding bloggers and internet activists for the past three years while the united states has focused its attention and outrage on china internet censorship has become a problem with friends and foes alike adapting the u s approach to china elsewhere would mean singling out u s allies for opprobrium at a time when america needs all the friends it can find the smart alternative is to shift from a bilateral approach to making the promotion of freedom on the web a genuinely global policy the internet has been hailed as a technology that empowers average citizens to make their voices heard its dispersed nature most assume makes it difficult to control yet countries generally route internet traffic through a small number of checkpoints allowing governments to efficiently monitor and control what happens on the web many have placed responsibility for promoting internet freedom squarely on the companies that provide internet services in turkey the target is google which owns youtube google is constrained by local laws often forcing the company to choose between complying with crackdowns or pulling out of countries entirely yet being complicit in censorship efforts is certainly unpalatable as well something google founder sergey brin admitted last year when he noted that his company was still wrestling with it how it is approaching chinese censorship and left the door open for reversing course at the same time googles withdrawal from the market is likely to have limited effects domestic providers such as bahrains telephone and internet monopoly batelco cooperate with government officials in censoring the web when corporate leverage is limited governments must step in u s efforts have so far been anemic the global internet freedom task force the highest profile effort launched so far has been little more than a talk shop congress has attempted to step in but its foreign policy tools are blunt and leave too little room for creative diplomacy real action has to come from the top washington should not go so far as to bar u s companies from operating in states like turkey but it should make clear that its diplomats will not actively facilitate it investment from u s firms in countries that are repressing bloggers and restricting freedom of speech on the web making investment in information technology dependent on good web citizenship has the potential to encourage meaningful change in emerging economies like turkey and egypt as well as small but important countries like bahrain leaders in all three countries are hungry for silicon valley to invest in their economies the u s should also exert global leadership a first step would be to sponsor a united nations declaration of internet and electronic freedom to be sure the u n s enforcement mechanisms are hopelessly weak but the declaration can serve as a standard against which countries can be judged using universal standards set forth in the new u n declaration the state department should include a status report on internet freedom in its annual report on human rights around the world the burden of course should not fall entirely on washington turkey in particular can be influenced by the european union which many turks still aspire to join given that ankara has already begun negotiations with brussels for turkeys accession to the eu it is unlikely that internet freedom can be added to the agenda still in the negotiations europe can insist on a broad interpretation of freedom of expression to gain additional leverage with the turks on the issue the transformative nature of the internet is well documented but it is not impervious to authoritarian leaders intent on limiting debate global internet companies like google yahoo and others should not be left alone at the messy junction of ethics business corporate citizenship and technology washington must lead the way both in establishing global standards for internet freedom and implementing a policy to encourage compliance with those principles messrs cook and levi are fellows at the council on foreign relations
