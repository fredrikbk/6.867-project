world bank job when paul wolfowitz took the helm of the world bank in june he pledged to root out corruption in the banks &# billion lending portfolio his member board seemed to approve but that was before his anticorruption unit began exposing fraud in bank projects and he tried to cut off funds to those who got caught then some members of the board especially its french and british members tried to rein in the anticorruption effort lest it interfere with their desire to feel good about themselves by shoving money out the door leaks began to appear in the washington post and financial times criticizing mr wolfowitz which meant he was doing something right now the bank has issued a new anticorruption policy paper that looks on balance like a victory for the good guys while mr wolfowitz and his band of reformers will have to seek board support to cut off entire countries from world bank lending they will still be able to drop individual projects without board approval meanwhile mr wolfowitz has tapped paul volcker the former federal reserve chairman and u n oil for food investigator to lead a probe into world bank staff complaints that the banks "institutional integrity department" is too zealous in demanding integrity mr volcker is well known for believing that corruption is an obstacle to economic development which is supposed to be the goal of the bank mr wolfowitzs predecessor james wolfensohn established the banks oversight committee on fraud and corruption in a january independent review led by former u s attorney general dick thornburgh recommended that the committee be upgraded to "a true policy making body for addressing fraud and corruption " so mr wolfensohn created the institutional integrity department since mr wolfowitz has taken over the department has become well more dedicated to its mission earlier this year the investigative unit released its integrity report for fiscal years and the findings are exhilarating or depressing depending on your point of view and all the more eye popping because the probers lack subpoena power over the two years the department completed investigations that led to sanctions for fraud and corruption and the banning of firms and individuals from competing for world bank contracts some of these were big fish the german engineering firm lahmeyer international was barred for seven years and acres international of canada for three years for misbehavior at the lesotho highlands water project the french company thales consulting and engineering received a one year suspension in a case in cambodia to its great credit the integrity department hasnt been shy about publicizing its work a photo in the integrity report shows a "trust fund conservation project" that was supposed to build a hot springs spa for ecotourism with days left to completion and more than of the funds disbursed the site remained a muddy hole in the jungle its web site at worldbank org integrity features illustrations of corruption cases it has uncovered one photo shows a school where "children were still attending lessons in an overcrowded thatched hut while their new bank funded schoolhouse just a few hundred meters away was being used by a local official to store onions " over the corruption units work also resulted in the termination or barring from rehire of world bank staff this does not mean that most bank staff which number including consultants are corrupt for in fact the integrity department says of its allegations and tips about bid manipulation kickbacks bribery and other charges came from bank staff and consultants one help here has been confidentiality agreements to protect the identity of whistleblowers also helpful are the "voluntary disclosure program" which allows contractors involved in misconduct to fess up and amend their practices and the "detailed review process " which goes after fraud in the bid and management of bank projects alas this is precisely the kind of accountability that has been met with indignation by some bank staff who have a sense of entitlement after decades of limited oversight the other threat to traditional bank culture is mr wolfowitzs view that the bank should cut off lending where corruption is systemic do that everywhere in the world quips one longtime world bank watcher "and there will be no place to send any money the bank couldnt make any loans in any poor countries " yet this is all the more reason to take a hard line against corruption we always thought the point of the world bank was to get money in the hands of the poor not to lend for the sake of the bank staff or board members the only way to reduce corruption is with rigorous oversight and consequences for bad behavior
