weekend journal tastings kosher for any wine lover a world of wines worth discovering riojas and pinotage we have been conducting broad tastings of kosher wines for almost a decade we have found that anyone who keeps kosher no longer has to settle for simple sweet wines and anyone who loves wine shouldnt avoid the kosher aisle we routinely include kosher wines in our general tastings and some of them have been among our favorites in a tasting of midrange american cabernet sauvignon for instance hagafen cellars was one of the best way up there with jordan vineyard &amp winery to get a sense of the international flavor of kosher wines these days we bought more than kosher wines right off the shelves as always that we felt demonstrated the great breadth of kosher wines today red and white sparkling and still dry and sweet they were from all over the world from argentina to italy in the past we have written about kosher wines made from the most common grapes chardonnay merlot and so on so we focused this time on imported wines that some people might not expect to find in the kosher aisle such as rioja from spain some wines are kosher some are kosher for passover and some are mevushal most kosher wines are kosher for passover the most notable exception is one part of the manischewitz line manischewitzs sweet concord is the kosher wine many of us grew up with a spokeswoman for constellation brands which makes manischewitz says it is still the no kosher wine in america with more than a million cases produced each year from the end of december through passover the company produces kosher for passover wines for the other eight months of the year in its kosher wines manischewitz uses fructose a sweetener derived from corn which is forbidden at passover the company urges customers looking for kosher for passover wines to read its labels closely some wines are both kosher for passover and mevushal a mevushal wine is one that can be handled by the general public such as a non jewish waiter and still remain kosher once its open a mevushal wine is heated in seconds by flash pasteurization we are often asked if the mevushal process harms the wine in our tastings through the years we havent found a consistent difference in taste between mevushal and nonmevushal kosher wines in this tasting we liked two thirds of the wines that were nonmevushal but only one third of the wines that were but our favorite red and our favorite white a new zealand pinot noir and an alsatian gewurztraminer were both mevushal the tasting would be an eye opener for anyone who still doubts the range of kosher wines earthy portuguese reds italian pinot grigio south african pinotage you name it youre likely to find a version thats kosher in the attached index we have listed a few of our favorites as examples of the kinds of wines that are out there we also saw a more interesting selection of kosher wines from israel this year including a pinotage which is a grape usually associated with south africa it was made by barkan and while not among our favorites was good and worth trying we even tried a couple of wines from the republic of georgia which werent among our favorites but were still interesting and well made now about getting them we understand that some places have a far better selection of kosher wines than others but thanks to the internet and the burgeoning number of excellent wine stores willing to deliver to many states its possible for most people to order good kosher wines binnys in chicago binnys com lists about wallys in los angeles wallywine com around and wine library in new jersey winelibrary com about if you might be interested in ordering wine online drop us a note at wine wsj com and well send you our column about how to do it and the names of some stores that have good general interest wine web sites there are still some people around the country who are out of luck the state stores of pennsylvania for instance have a limited kosher selection almost entirely from israel a spokeswoman for the pennsylvania liquor control board told us that "currently the plcb has a kosher wine program focused on increasing the kosher wine selection in anticipation of passover and other jewish holidays " actually in many places the selection of kosher wines tends to grow as passover nears in fact the one caution flag wed raise is that some places seem to hold on to their kosher wines far longer than they should so every year we see old tired bottles that should have been given away or poured out long ago be sure to look at vintages carefully wine stores still generally keep the kosher wines in a separate section which is fine if youre specifically looking for kosher wine but probably means that too many people are passing them by next time youre in a wine shop even if you dont keep kosher you really should take a look you can contact us at wine wsj com a kosher sampler to get an idea of the broad range of international kosher wines on shelves these days we bought more than from all over the world these were some of our favorites listed from white to red and from lighter to heavier we have chosen these not only because they are good but also because they demonstrate the wide variety of kosher wines available today as always it would be frustrating to look for any specific wine but these will give you an idea of how broad the selection is these days vineyard vintage rashi moscato dasti italy price &# tasters comments its hard to go wrong with any moscato dasti as an aperitif or after dinner
