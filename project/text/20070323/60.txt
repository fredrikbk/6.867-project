conrad black the year old media mogul on trial in chicago on fraud and racketeering charges "guilty or innocent " a patron of the pub in the capital city asked for john ryan a year old computer technician from guelph the point goes beyond mr blacks guilt or innocence "hes a megalomaniac " mr ryan said what rankles mr ryan isnt so much that mr black and other former hollinger international executives are accused of diverting more than &# million from the company into their own pockets its that he acted so un canadian his attitude is widely shared by his countrymen who are obsessed with the trial but whose feelings toward the disgraced newspaper magnate reflect the nuances of their national identity from the yukon territory to nova scotia mr blacks trial in chicago which featured opening arguments this week is billed as "the trial of the century " canadians are being bombarded by coverage canadian tv radio and newspapers will be staffing this every day for the estimated three months of the trial macleans canadas leading magazine devoted a special issue to the saga many of canadas best known journalists are there including lisa laflamme a correspondent for ctv news who has covered wars in afghanistan and iraq hurricane katrina and the tsunami she was in chicago for the trial this week but is scheduled to head back to afghanistan on april "its a drag that it had to happen at the same time " she said standing in line to get a courtroom seat recent stories in the media blitz a globe and mail reporters experience sharing a lobster dinner with mr black in toronto before the trial and many dissections of the black familys attire at the trial along with detailed explanations of each step of the courtroom drama canadian network ctv newsnet last week began airing a new program called "the verdict with paula todd" four nights a week using the trial to launch what it envisions as a long running show about legal issues "he is such a central figure to canadian life " says colin mackenzie managing news editor for the globe and mail a national newspaper based in toronto "there is just an endless appetite for the story " born in montreal the son of a brewery executive mr black in gave up his canadian citizenship to become a british lord taking the title lord black of crossharbour he hobnobbed with the likes of henry kissinger margaret thatcher and the princess of wales split his time between residences in london new york palm beach and toronto and married the glamorous canadian conservative columnist barbara amiel black starting with the purchase of a small community paper in quebec he built the worlds third largest newspaper company by circulation at one point operating more than newspapers including the daily telegraph in london the jerusalem post in israel the chicago sun times and canadas national post since mr black was ousted in the company has been scaled down now operating under the name sun times media group inc it owns the chicago sun times and several community papers in the chicago area mr black along with three former executives of hollinger international is accused of skimming millions of dollars from the company through selling off newspapers and without board approval taking fees from the buyers in return for promises not to compete mr black who has written a biography of franklin d roosevelt and another soon to be published of richard nixon speaks and writes bombastically "i am not prepared to reenact the french revolutionary renunciation of the rights of nobility we are proprietors after all beleaguered though we may be " he wrote to former colleagues in an email defending his use of a corporate jet even his chicago lawyer edward genson told jurors this week that mr black has an "arrogant attitude " he went on to say "other than a bad attitude you arent going to find a single thing wrong " asked why the trial is capturing so much attention in mr blacks native country mr genson said in an interview "possibly not very much happens in canada " in canada mr blacks rise to prominence is a source of pride on some level "he was our prince " says peter c newman a prominent canadian journalist who wrote a book about mr black "we wouldnt want too many like that but its nice to have one especially someone as colorful and as quotable " like any celebrity mr black has a certain cheering section t shirts being sold around canada say "free conrad" and "conrad will win " mr black also gets some sympathy for being a canadian on trial in canadas richer flashier neighbor to the south mr blacks toronto lawyer edward greenspan a legal celebrity known as "fast eddie" who is a bestselling author and host of an award winning tv show says attorneys from all over the country have been calling him to wish him well however underneath the occasional patriotic sentiment is strong resentment a recent poll of canadians found that wouldnt feel sorry for mr black if he is convicted the phrase that keeps turning up is "tall poppy syndrome " translation when a canadian becomes conspicuously more successful than his countrymen its expected he soon will be cut down to size canada isnt alone in this notion australians also members of the british commonwealth who consider themselves anti aristocratic use the expression and in japan there is the expression "the nail that sticks up will get pounded down " you can read these either as instincts toward egalitarianism or something less generous "if someone gets too big or too wealthy it makes life unbearable for the average guy " says michael harris a talk radio show host in ottawa who says calls are running four to one against mr black "this country is about everybody getting enough and those people who get a great deal are suspect " accordingly wealthy canadians generally understand the code of conduct to which they are expected to adhere stay humble dont draw too much attention to yourself and give something back to the community even canadas rock stars are understated says paul stubbing a doctor who lives in nunavut "joni mitchell neil young the tragically hip theyre all low key " he said "rich people in america are outspoken and over the top the wealthy in canada are supposed to keep quiet " one recent example of this attitude last year at the winter olympics in turin italy the canadian womens hockey team was a great source of pride then they began beating opponents by and goals on their run to the gold medal public opinion began to build against them canada fans were concerned their team was showing up other countries this prompted a joke "what does a canadian do when he wins a gold medal in the olympics hes so happy he has it bronzed " "where else but in canada would that happen " says andrew cohen an author whose book "the unfinished canadian the people we are" is due out in may "the word elite is a dirty word in canada were a very watchful people that way " write to emily steel at emily
