seal hunters fight long cruelty label canadians urge europe to undo product ban fur as an eco fabric in a marketing twist that is infuriating animal welfare activists a government backed coalition of canadian sealers is trying to cast its industry long associated with images of blood and death in a new and more favorable light green the message is simple while the canadian seal hunt isnt pretty it is sustainable regulated and humane the seal hunters are courting european politicians hoping to defeat a seal product ban now being debated in the european parliament a sealers group is contributing to an ad campaign from the fur council of canada that calls fur "the ultimate eco fabric " the campaign aims to firm up support for the industry at home by tapping pride in canadas year fur producing history and emphasizing the close relationship between hunters and the land the international fur trade federation based in surrey england ran a similar campaign in the united kingdom and europe this winter that included ads in elle vogue and wallpaper "we have been doing this for hundreds of years " says jean claude lapierre president of the sealing association of the magdalen islands in eastern canada which accounts for about of the canadian seal hunt newfoundland accounts for most of the rest "this is a hunt there is nothing wrong here but this is the first time we fight back " the u s banned all seal products in a few years after the first images of the seal hunt including seals being clubbed to death and skinned were broadly distributed today most seals are shot while others are killed with a club which veterinary associations and the canadian government say kills humanely europe banned the sale of pelts from white coats seals under three weeks old just over a decade later in the wake of those bans the seal market tanked but as fur has returned to the catwalks of milan and paris in the past years and demand from china and russia has increased the seal market has quietly come back last year hunters drew a record canadian dollars us&# per pelt generating about c&# million for canadas seal hunters but the ban of all seal products now being debated in the european parliament following a ban passed in belgium and another pending in germany could sink the seal fur market again with a catalog of gruesome images large groups like the international fund for animal welfare and the humane society of the united states have set the terms and emotional tone of the dispute since the early s but starting late last summer when it became clear support for the european legislation was gaining a broad canadian coalition including the fur institute of canada the fur council and other groups began aggressively trying to subvert those images with a greener perspective the fur council alone spent about c&# million this winter to take out ads in newspapers and magazines such as town &amp country the campaign calls to mind canadas rich trapping heritage and champions the term "ultimate eco fabric " aiming to contrast fur with less insulating petroleum based synthetic materials the canadian government footed the travel bill for a group of european journalists to meet and greet sealers and seal processors this winter in newfoundland and quebec the groups are even fighting to reframe the bloody images that have long defined the battle the canadian government which monitors the seal hunt says the vast majority of seals are killed quickly and most hunters follow regulations designed to ensure humane kills seals twitch after they are dead like chickens with their heads cut off making it appear that they are being skinned alive said phil jenkins a spokesman for the canadian department of fisheries and oceans "to the untrained eye it looks like they are suffering theyre not " mr jenkins says "but were up against very cunning marketers of emotion " to combat those images and firm up support among the canadian public which polls from both sides show is divided over the hunt the fur industry is playing up the heritage angle the first european trappers who came in the th century occupy iconic status in canada condemning that image even implicitly can stir resentment those feelings are hinted at gently in the fur councils ad "from the snowy wilderness of the great north come the most beautiful furs in the world " the tag line "beautifully canadian " animal activists say it is spin "the canadian government is trying to get people to rally around the flag but it wont work " says rebecca aldworth director of canadian wildlife for the humane society of the u s "at the end of the day its still the largest slaughter of marine mammals in the world " animal activist groups there are several dedicated to ending the seal hunt claim it is far from humane they also say it is unsustainable now more than ever because global warming has shrunk ice floes making it harder for newborn seals to survive "there are all these complex sets of rationalizations to excuse treating animals cruelly " says wayne paselle president and chief executive of the humane society of the u s "our job is to stop it " the society is promoting a boycott of seafood from canada until the seal hunt is abolished mr jenkins of canadas department of fisheries and oceans counters that seal hunt opponents may have a less noble motivation raising money animal rights groups continue to focus on seals rather than other less attractive animals because they are cute and the graphic pictures motivate donors he says when paul mccartney spoke out last year against the hunt the humane society drew &# in internet donations following his comments mr paselle says but he notes that the organization has millions of supporters and the seal campaign is one of many hunting doesnt make sealers rich they typically string together several seasonal jobs to make ends meet mr lapierre of the sealing association says that if all else fails he and his sealers are considering an end run around activists seeking bloody pictures after the seals are killed the hunters will take them back to a factory instead of skinning them on the ice "no blood no pictures " he says dryly "no more problems "
