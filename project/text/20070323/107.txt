weekend journal review theater at low ebb a broadway talents last musical new york ive never seen a musical that tried so hard to be likable as "curtains " or an audience that tried so hard to like it fred ebb who wrote most of the lyrics died unexpectedly in leaving john kander and rupert holmes to finish the show on their own mr kander and his longtime partner were one of broadways most admired songwriting teams and everybody wanted their last musical to be great me too but it isnt though the production and performances are so immaculately professional that you can almost fool yourself into thinking that "curtains" is something more than an unrisen souffle even at their most successful kander and ebb werent so much songwriters as witty genre parodists just as their best shows "chicago" and "cabaret " are meta musicals whose real subject matter is musical comedy itself likewise "curtains " a backstage farce about a mediocre show called "robbin hood " whose unloved star is murdered during the opening night curtain calls forcing lt frank cioffi david hyde pierce a stage struck boston cop to lock the rest of the cast up in the theater in order to figure out whodunit you could do worse for a premise but the cunningly self reflexive spoofery of "the drowsy chaperone" and "urinetown" has raised the bar for anyone seeking to play the postmodern game on broadway and "curtains " unlike its predecessors simply isnt smart enough to play in the big leagues mr holmess book based on an idea by the late peter stone consists of lame jokes strung on a predictable plot while the score is so thin that you can see "chicago" right through it mr pierce gets top billing which is no surprise since he stole the show in "spamalot " fans of "frasier" will doubtless flock to see him though the charm of his acting is compromised by his maladroit boston accent every other vowel is wrong the rest of the cast is sensational especially edward hibbert debra monk and karen ziemba scott elliss staging is slick anna louizoss sets nifty william ivey longs costumes properly gaudy rob ashfords choreography lively but a bit too self consciously vulgar what does it all add up to next to nothing im afraid except for one song the brassy "its a business " a cynical antianthem to the stuff producers dreams are made of "the not for profit theaters dont need to turn a buck so give them lysistrata and i wish them lots of luck " the rest of "curtains" is straight out of the recycling bin you want art ill give you art propeller edward halls all male shakespeare troupe is back in brooklyn for the third season in a row this time performing "the taming of the shrew" and "twelfth night" in repertory at bam harvey both productions played on the simplest of tour friendly sets are fast fresh funny and full of surprises "the taming of the shrew" is thought provoking while "twelfth night" shimmers with magic no matter how much shakespeare youve seen lately youll come home buzzing about the bard as if youd just discovered him if you have to pick one play make it "twelfth night " which is a perfect introduction to the way propeller works the man company covers all the parts and makes its own music playing everything from piccolo to accordion the staging is dense with comic touches but the laughter never undercuts the poetry the men who play women mostly steer clear of full tilt drag style female impersonation opting instead for subtle and varied evocations of femininity the scenes are run together in elizabethan style punctuated by homemade incidental music and ingenious sound effects that smooth the scene to scene transitions and help to heighten the atmosphere imagine a decaying banquet hall whose rough furnishings are covered with dusty sheets a tramp carrying a fiddle wanders in from the wings he plucks the strings idly and all at once the stage is full of masked men in black suits singing a wordless minor key refrain later on the same refrain will be used to accompany "twelfth night"s most haunting lyric "come away come away death and in sad cypress let me be laid " the tramp rips the sheet off one of the chairs revealing an actor who speaks the speech that sets the play in motion "if music be the food of love play on " if that doesnt hook you youre unhookable i liked "the taming of the shrew" somewhat less partly because the comic effects are so closely packed that the staging feels busy and partly because mr hall has superimposed an obtrusively anachronistic interpretation of his own on the original text petruchio dugald bruce lockhart is turned into a monstrous caricature of masculinity while katherine simon scardifield becomes a battered acquiescent wife thats not what shakespeare had in mind to put it very mildly but mr scardifields plain spoken acting is so blessedly free of affectation that he pulls you on board anyway such is the mystery of great theater even when its wrong its still right bob glaudinis "jack goes boating" is an embarrassingly unfunny working class romantic comedy in which philip seymour hoffman plays yet another shambling depressed slacker type this time a dope smoking limo driver whos never had a girlfriend no wonder some seem to have found it amusing but i couldnt stop looking at my watch not even when daphne rubin vega took off her clothes id hate to think how many good scripts mr hoffmans labyrinth theater company could have produced for the money it cost to build david korinss fancy schmancy set spare yourself two hours of squirming boredom and go see propeller instead mr teachout the journals
