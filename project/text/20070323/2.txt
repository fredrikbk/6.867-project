after the deluge state farm said sorry read the fine print you accuse me of colluding with attorney richard scruggs to extort an insurance settlement from state farm in a conspiracy worthy of a john grisham novel "mississippi justice " review &amp outlook " march i might agree if you mean "the rainmaker " a grisham story about an insurance company that bilks its clients year after year mississippi property owners paid millions of dollars for homeowners insurance that company agents told them would cover hurricane damage state farm agents repeatedly assured many of them especially those with residences above the hundred year flood plain that they did not need additional flood coverage then after katrina struck these good people were told by state farm adjusters that the fine print of their contracts excluded flood damage and predictably that all of their damage was caused by flooding "flooding" was claimed to be the cause even though the damage was from wind or wind driven water entering buildings located where floods never reached the convenient coincidences dont end there when insurance company adjusters examined homes covered by federal flood insurance they quickly concluded that flood damage had occurred and the damage usually approximated the amount of the policy limits but when damage exceeded federal flood insurance coverage or there was no such coverage and homeowners looked to their state farm policies these same adjusters were said to be insufficiently qualified to determine how much state farm should pay for wind damage usually claiming to be "unable" to tell the difference between wind and flood damage you ignore much relevant information in arguing that our case against state farm was premised on their denial of flood claims for example one state farm engineering report found that wind caused damage to a policyholders property while a second report procured by state farm written eight days later attributed the cause to flooding a fair representation of the case would note that state farm hid the first report and denied payment of the claim based upon the second report a fair representation would also note that the first report included a post it note from a state farm adjuster saying "do not pay this bill do not talk about this " i investigated this sort of conduct and presented a case including information provided by confidential informants to a grand jury most corporate crime is discovered by insiders who with their private attorneys bring evidence of the crimes they have discovered to law enforcement officials the use of confidential informants to expose criminal conduct is legal commonplace and crucial to law enforcement you claim that my resistance to returning certain documents to state farm and their adjustor was a scheme to deny state farm access to evidence it needed to defend itself in fact both state farm and e a renfroe always had the documents we merely had copies provided by the informants and even though state farm had the documents all along the copies would have been turned over to them in the ordinary course of discovery in any civil or criminal proceeding so why did state farm sue to recover documents already in their possession it was nothing more than the companys attempt to obtain grand jury information that otherwise would not have been available at that stage of the proceedings and more importantly to intimidate the informants it was no different than any other threat against a states witness in a criminal matter we defend grand jury witnesses legally and aggressively against attempts at intimidation whether the threats come from hoodlums with guns or corporations with lawyers in the face of evidence provided by our informants as well as other evidence state farm agreed to settle the case we were bringing against them as always it takes two sides to reach a settlement state farms interest was in avoiding exposure to uncertain criminal and civil penalties our interest was securing fair payment to the policyholders and bringing some stability to the insurance market in mississippi your statement that "mr hood exerted pressure on state farm to settle not just with the state but also with mr scruggs " is wrong it was state farm that insisted that any settlement with the state include the release of claims by mr scruggss private clients i am sworn to protect the interests of all mississippians whether or not they have private counsel so i certainly had common cause with mr scruggs but that interest is a far cry from the corrupt collusion you imply attorney general jim hood state of mississippi jackson miss
