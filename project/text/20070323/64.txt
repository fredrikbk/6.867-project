politics &amp economics giulianis private sector burden business ties may haunt former mayors presidential campaign former new york mayor rudy giuliani brings to his presidential campaign a heroic image following the world trade center attacks he also comes with a five year crisis management business consulting career and political rivals are mining his list of clients for questionable ties one mission of the candidates firm giuliani partners and its giuliani security and safety llc unit is helping firms in trouble and it has been involved with many an airline working through bankruptcy financial firms under investigation and a nuclear power plant facing questions about security from terrorist threats theres no evidence mr giuliani had a role in any of his clients woes but the democratic national committee regularly emails to reporters a file on "rudys known controversial dealings " including what it calls "war profiteering" from his firms investment in a small security company with iraq contracts and press reports are popping up with increasing frequency portraying his private sector work in an unflattering light for example bracewell &amp giuliani llp a law firm that mr giuliani joined two years ago as a partner counts citgo petroleum corp among its clients the venezuelan state owned company is technically headed by president hugo chavez a longtime bush bete noire the citgo relationship predated mr giulianis arrival at the firm and he says he never had any direct dealings with the oil company but after recent news reports on the matter the giuliani campaign released a statement "mayor giuliani believes hugo chavez is not a friend of the united states " mr giulianis business associates defend the propriety of his client list "we are very serious about who we represent " says michael hess a managing partner with giuliani partners "we represent great american companies " but the citgo flap highlights a problem for many executives turned politicians on the hustings business dealings can be harder to defend than political records profit a virtue in business often is cast in the political arena as greed several democratic presidential hopefuls including hillary clinton barack obama and john edwards have faced questions about private sector activities such as investments and jobs similar questions are likely for republican candidate mitt romney the former massachusetts governor and erstwhile head of venture fund bain capital llc got such treatment during a failed senate campaign years ago mr romneys rival ran ads highlighting the layoffs that resulted from a bain directed takeover of an office equipment company mr giuliani is at risk of a similar attempt by democrats to link him to job losses a giuliani partners client delta air lines inc slashed numerous positions when it filed for bankruptcy protection in may all presidential candidates will have to file reports with the federal elections commission about their private sources of wealth mr giuliani suggested he would make his business interests public only to the extent required by federal law public reports show that through his companies mr giuliani has represented a variety of businesses among them is purdue pharma lp maker of the painkiller oxycontin in purdue found itself facing additional regulation for the drug which the government said was being widely abused and led to at least deaths purdue hired giuliani partners and mr giuliani helped formulate a strategy to rehabilitate the companys image a potential political vulnerability may be the consulting agreement that ties giuliani partners to a pair of nuclear reactors known as indian point the reactors located miles north of midtown manhattan and owned by a subsidiary of entergy corp of new orleans have long evoked safety concerns which surged after the attacks when the reactors were seen as potential terrorism targets in then new york gov george pataki a republican hired james lee witt head of the federal emergency management agency under former president clinton to study site security at indian point in mr witt released an assessment that the security plan was "not adequate" to "protect the people from an unacceptable dose of radiation in the event of a release from indian point " entergy hired giuliani partners to conduct a security assessment "he had that single experience from that drove him to the top " says entergy spokesman jim steets "all youve got to do is look at the polls if he says the plant is safe people are going to believe him " shortly after signing a contract in mr giulianis company oversaw a mock terrorist drill at the site and pronounced it safe an assertion mr giuliani repeated to reporters in november when entergy applied for a year extension of its permit to operate "our view is that indian point is as safe as a facility can be and a pretty good model if not an excellent model for not only other nuclear power plants but other industries " mr giuliani said but indian point has had troubles in it emerged that deadly nuclear material had leached into the groundwater under the plant the reactors have been unexpectedly shut down at least five times since the beginning of in december the federal nuclear regulatory commission said some plant workers feared retribution for raising safety issues and in february an inspection found a cracked fuel rod a situation that could conceivably lead to a loss of nuclear material the nrc says the plant is safe mr giulianis firm remains a consultant at indian point both companies say the giuliani security assessment was objective but the seeds for political attacks may have been planted recently by mrs clinton who owns a home near the reactors in february she submitted a bill to congress calling for an "independent assessment" of safety at indian point a spokesman for mrs clinton said she doesnt consider mr giulianis assessment to be an independent one mr hess says the analysis performed on indian point was one of several the firm did for entergy plants in the northeast he says the analysis was independent
