citigroup may be pondering a bid for abn global holdings would mesh but an approach is difficult given barclayss exclusive talks a faction within citigroup inc is pushing chairman and chief executive charles prince to bid for abn amro holding nv according to people familiar with the matter the dutch banking giant based in amsterdam announced earlier this week that it is in exclusive talks about being taken over by barclays plc of the united kingdom in a transaction that would value abn amro at about &# billion that would be the largest banking deal ever topping the &# billion merger of citicorp and travelers group inc that formed citigroup according to thomson financial an offer by citigroup could assuage some of the problems that have plagued the worlds largest bank by market value but it would be difficult since abns negotiations with barclays are exclusive any move by citigroup would have to be unsolicited and might be considered hostile still citigroup has been studying how well abn would fit as a possible acquisition target these people said the two banks have complementary businesses in the u s and latin america and a deal would give citigroup a stronger foothold in continental europe there also is the possibility that citigroup could push for part of abns assets such as chicago based lasalle bank or banco abn amro real sa of brazil each of which contribute about to abns overall revenue citigroup declined to comment hostile takeover bids in the banking industry are difficult to win and hostile deals of all stripes are particularly tough in the netherlands where companies enjoy many defenses that arent allowed elsewhere the dutch central bank has already said it would frown on such a situation mr prince who has been focusing recently on an internal growth strategy is still trying to earn back investors trust after many years of scandal and tumult rocking various corners of citigroups vast empire only recently has it ventured back into deal making with a &# billion bid for nikko cordial corp of japan in which citigroup already holds a stake citigroup is playing the role of savior since nikko was rocked by an accounting scandal still citigroup has been laboring to win over nikko investors it has already raised its bid once by nearly even though no other bidders have emerged abn amro has big businesses in brazil holland and italy but its large wholesale banking and investment banking business a division that focuses on fixed income products and is based in london has been struggling barclays fixed income division barclays capital is considered one of the best in the business one of the few capable of turning around abns operations citigroup also has a large fixed income investment banking operation but taking over abns money losing group would be another management challenge of the sort that has plagued the company in the past an acquisition of abn also would allow mr prince to meet the demands of a number of constituencies including those inside citigroup who would like him to bolster its u s presence at the same time mr prince has made it a priority to generate of the banks revenue from overseas currently citigroups foreign businesses account for up from in mr prince also has said that any acquisition must be accretive in the first months over the past year citigroups stock which trades on the new york stock exchange is up about that compares with a rise of for rival bank of america corp s share price and an increase of for j p morgan chase &amp co over the same period in p m trading yesterday citigroups shares traded down cents to &# giving the company a market value of more than &# billion abns unwieldy global franchise which has proved difficult for ceo rijkman groenink to integrate could be a better fit for citigroup which overlaps with abn in several countries abns recent acquisition history dates to the s and the purchase of lasalle bank in chicago it bought a u k corporate broker and banks in the u s hungary brazil and thailand in the s on top of that it acquired stakes in several italian banks in and analysts who have run the numbers say there is plenty of opportunity a review of abns international u s product lines including businesses such as lasalle and private client work found that of citigroups product lines overlap with of abns products or service groups the results are similar for hsbc holdings plc and j p morgan barclays actually offers a more favorable overlap of according to san francisco research firm revere data llc but the cost saving and overlap opportunities for citigroup also are much greater than they are for barclays in the u s the ownership of lasalle would bolster citigroups u s retail franchise which lags behind both bank of america and j p morgan barclays has a small card business in the u s as well as a growing capital markets business but it doesnt own a retail bank franchise should citigroup acquire lasalle its market share for u s deposits would rise to from according to research firm snl financial citigroup also could take a big step in brazil which offers latin americas biggest economy by gross domestic product and population while citigroups emerging market focus lately has been on russia and asia research firm creditsights noted in november that latin americas demographics offer revenue opportunities in credit cards consumer banking and private banking "we would not be surprised to see citi complete a major m&amp a transaction in the region " the report said citigroup appears to have telegraphed its interest in abn almost every major investment bank is now on one side or the other in the barclays and abn talks with the exception of mr princes bank that puts citigroups own merger bankers on the sidelines those bankers wouldnt be able to represent other bidders if citigroup is considering its own bid
