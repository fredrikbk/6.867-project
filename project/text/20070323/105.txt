weekend journal review film sandler battles grief glibness in spotty reign tale of loss shows wit ambition flaws shooter misses target "reign over me" opens to the strains of graham nashs "simple man " while a spectral figure head encased in huge headphones buzzes through the streets of nighttime manhattan on a scooter that resembles a motorized skateboard disheveled and intense the scooterist resembles a younger bob dylan his name is charlie fineman he is played by adam sandler and hes anything but simple like many of mr sandlers characters charlie boils with inchoate rage beneath a simpletons placid exterior the difference here is the source of his distress his wife and children were on one of the planes that hit the world trade center on and losing them has turned charlie once a successful dentist into a sort of rain man shut off from the world this is not a simple picture its serious disarmingly funny at times and certainly ambitious yet diminished by some of the traits that have made the standard sandler characters so popular the film which takes its title from the song by the who was written and directed by mike binder the man responsible for "the upside of anger " the fine comedy about female rage his new one a raunchy hymn to the power of friendship co stars don cheadle as alan johnson a prosperous cosmetic dentist who roomed with charlie in college refreshingly race doesnt enter into the picture the script is color blind fourteen years after dental school and half a decade after alan chances to see charlie scooting by catches up with him and discovers why his old friend dropped out of sight moved by his plight alan becomes the instrument of charlies renewal his possible renewal since alan is only an amateur therapist treating a patient who could pass for a paranoid schizophrenic in a new york story thats hollywood heavy with healers and healing liv tyler plays an earnest shrink one hand must therapize the other so charlie also serves as the instrument of his friends liberation from alans own emotional opacity and from the tedium of what he calls "putting phony teeth on phony people " as the movie wears on though charlies behavior grows not only repetitive mood swings between violent and sweetly passive rageful and contrite but increasingly reminiscent of the sandler archetype a sly peter pan who persists in being lovable indeed charlie goes beyond childhood into a cloying infantilism thats only partly explained by regression in the face of unmanageable tragedy you wonder how he ever worked with a probe and drill don cheadle is as always a quietly commanding star with an engaging quick witted presence still his character like much of the movie suffers from a case of what seems to be communicable infantilization alan is an educated man with a lovely wife played attractively by jada pinkett smith and bright children yet he like others around him cant seem to grasp let alone articulate the gravity of charlies condition thus the drama keeps lapsing into conventional comedy which sometimes works well when it isnt converting charlies grief and alans frustration into the borderline bathos of buddies who are both wounded birds saffron burrows is eerily amusing as donna remar a troubled beauty with nymphomaniacal tendencies but donna too falls into the prevailing pattern of being healed and more alarming still helping to heal only paula newsome as melanie a receptionist in alans office gets to play gleefully well a cynic whose delicious cynicism stays unsoftened melanies a real person with real teeth and a real bite shooter mark wahlberg stars as the peerless marksman of "shooter " an updating and downgrading of stephen hunters popular novel "point of impact " betrayed by his beloved marines after a covert mission in the horn of africa goes bad bob lee swagger leaves the military for the life of a mountain man until hes seduced into quasi governmental service soon hes betrayed yet again by a shadowy cabal that awakens his dormant patriotism then frames him as a presidential assassin the result is lots of gunplay and explosions governed by little logic plus some tantalizing factoids about things that a sniper must consider before sniping at a target a mile away including the coriolis effect which involves the rotation of the earth if theres an organizing principle at work in the film which was directed by antoine fuqua its that everyone in government is corrupt the bad guys include a strangelovian character in a wheelchair so "shooter"s covert intent could have been satire overtly though its definitely about shooting betrayal and shooting in that order pride terrence howard is a singular star firmly grounded never flashy yet formidably intense and capable of communicating passion with a poignant glance and "pride" is a tale that needed to be told its the story of jim ellis an inspirational coach who founded an inner city swim team in philadelphia in the early s and who continues to this day bringing young african americans to competitive swimming despite mr howards best efforts in the role though the film rarely realizes its subjects potential the first signs of trouble appear in the opening credits four writers and preposterously producers its impossible to know which of these cooks did what to the scripts thin broth but the telling of a relatively straightforward story is semicoherent and the hero is written so sketchily that he barely has a life outside the run down recreation center where he works and which he rehabilitates for the benefit of the neighborhood kids what a waste and not only of a shot at genuine uplift or of bernie mac a gifted comic actor who seems baffled by his perfunctory role as the rec centers janitor "pride" chooses to airbrush the authentic black anger of the period in the course of dramatizing the clash between jim elliss team and the bigoted whites they swam against yet all isnt lost terrence howards participation confers authority on the production and elliss young swimmers have their own unquenchable exuberance "keep your focus " the coach tells them they do and so does he even though the film cant offside by any conventional measure "offside " a film from iran by jafar panahi falls somewhere between small and slight yet this charming comedy takes on a big subject with great zest it concerns the plight of iranian women wait wait this is no earnest feminist tract who happen to be soccer fans but who are excluded from the nations stadiums even though they may be equal to iranian men in their passion for the sport the heroines are a diverse group of young tehrani women whove been busted for trying to crash a world cup qualifying match against bahrain most of the action takes place in a stadium holding pen where boobish boys in military uniforms seek to explain the logic of the policy they enforce they dont know what theyre talking about of course but the delicately subversive mr panahi makes his subjects perfectly clear the stupidity of authority and the hypocrisy of discrimination "offside" is surprisingly entertaining and edifying to boot dvd tip adam sandlers dark side was put to brilliant use in "punch drunk love" paul thomas andersons one of a kind comedy of anxiety and explosive delusion mr sandler is barry egan the addled lover of the title and emily watson is lena the woman of barrys dreams jon brion did the percussive and inimitable soundtrack
