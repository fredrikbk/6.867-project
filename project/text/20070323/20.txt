d c con if youve visited the district of columbia you may have seen the license plates declaring "taxation without representation " this isnt a gripe about taxes which they love in d c its a complaint about the districts lack of seats in congress the rest of the country might have more sympathy if d c s politicians were seeking representation according to the u s constitution that isnt true of legislation poised to pass the house that would provide the district residents with official representation in congress they currently have a "delegate" who has full committee rights and can vote on floor amendments as long as it doesnt change the outcome supporters claim the vote is about "democracy " with republican co sponsor tom davis from nearby virginia going so far as to suggest that residents of baghdad have more rights than d c residents mr davis hatched this deal with d c delegate eleanor holmes norton under which gop leaning utah and the democratic district would each get a house seat bringing the total number to more than a few republicans have bought into the idea that one new seat for each party is fair meantime theyre getting media praise for voting to remedy what supporters call a "civil rights" issue savvier republicans understand that utah a state with three congressional seats is growing fast and so is likely to gain a new seat anyway after the census utahs gain then could easily come at the expense of a northeast or upper midwest state that leans democratic so as a partisan matter the davis norton deal is a net gain for democrats as for the "civil rights" argument the district has never had seats in congress no matter the racial composition of its voters most of all the bill runs over the constitution which says in article i section that the "people of the several states" shall elect members of the house the district is not a state and ergo is not entitled to representation this seems cut and dry however d c vote supporters point instead to the constitutions district clause in article i section which says congress can "exercise exclusive legislation" over the capital including they say the power to grant a house seat the same d c clause does not say however that congress can ignore the rest of the constitution including such details as election standards under this sweeping reading congress would also be allowed to suspend free speech in the district or allow unfettered search and seizure the framers were well aware of the d c question and as david rivkin reminds us none other than alexander hamilton noted during debates over new yorks ratification of the constitution that giving the district a vote might make sense but hamilton also said itd require a constitutional amendment amendments take years to pass however so the democratic majority would prefer to pass this political deal that would allow them to take credit while the courts are left to sort out the legalities we hope the senate doesnt fall for this line and in any case the white house is threatening a veto meanwhile the house vote is another lesson in how politicians run roughshod over constitutional principles when it suits their narrow purposes
