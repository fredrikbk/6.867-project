ice capades behind travel mess new rules for sleet airlines faa battle over safety standards defining heavy pellets most of the usual suspects figured in this winters air travel fiascoes wicked storms jam packed planes and missteps by airlines but this year the problems were exacerbated by an obscure meteorological condition ice pellets concerned that ice pellets also known as sleet were a larger hazard than previously thought the federal aviation administration in late adopted strict limits on planes taking off in such icy conditions this year the number of sleety storms leapt sharply the ice pellet rule loosened somewhat last fall allowed planes to land but in some cases barred them from departing the result was a crowd of jets on the tarmac with insufficient gates to handle them a situation that wrecked carriers schedules during the march storm on the east coast alone airlines canceled flights the faas restrictions have set off a blistering battle between airlines and the agency as well as between individual carriers the result has been two years of instability as the faa revised its guidance and airlines grappled with differing interpretations of the various rules the confusion is one reason behind the recent misery experienced by airline passengers airlines which want to keep their planes in the air as much as possible say the pellet rule is based on poor research and gives them too little flexibility in deciding when its safe to take off in other weather conditions they operate under more flexible guidelines this winter the policy contributed to "extreme delays and cancellations " says the air transport association the industrys trade group the faa which is charged with keeping the skies as safe as possible defends the rule and the research behind it "obviously we think it was adequate to do what we did " says margaret gilligan a senior faa safety official she says the agency will conduct more research and might modify or clarify parts of the rule ice pellets are tiny chunks of frozen water that often start as snow descend through a band of warmer air melt then freeze again as they hit colder air before landing as miniature bits of hail meteorologists referred to this type of precipitation as sleet until a few years ago when a united nations agency renamed it to avoid confusion between nations varying definitions of the term the worry as with most wintry weather is that ice pellets will stick to a planes wings and throw off its aerodynamics with potentially catastrophic consequences for years however sleet was of little concern to airlines and regulators because it was thought to occur infrequently and rarely last long a thorough de icing with chemicals and a treatment of anti icing fluid was deemed sufficient to prepare a plane for takeoff especially when coupled with a visual inspection of the wing just before departure the visual check subjective by nature was interpreted differently by pilots airlines and regional faa offices about three years ago the faas pittsburgh office which oversees us airways operations base there decided planes couldnt take off in pellet conditions even if the wings were clear continental airlines faa inspectors in houston decided the opposite saying it was acceptable to take off precisely because there were no rules to the contrary cargo airlines such as ups airline and fedex express cant fly in pellet conditions at all because most of their planes dont have windows that would allow pilots to see the wings pilots groused about the lack of clarity while cockpit crews felt under pressure to stay on schedule some airlines were allowed to use pilots observations instead of official weather reports the airlines asked the faa for guidance but without presenting a united front as a result faa officials set about creating new rules the faa and its canadian counterpart transport canada conducted tests in and that showed how pellets could become embedded in anti icing fluid and remain frozen in and faa research concluded that the human eye was "very poor" at detecting ice formation and human touch "was only marginally better " the faa also believed weather patterns had changed in a way that made pellets more prevalent in october the faa stunned the industry by issuing a formal notice banning takeoffs amid falling ice pellets the airlines had predicted the rules would be more lenient after all pellets havent been blamed for a crash of a big modern passenger jet "ground operations in ice pellets and other icing conditions are a very serious concern to the flight standards service " the notice said continuing to fly in these conditions "must be considered a direct threat to the safety of flight " the industry howled all the more so because transport canada didnt change its rules the canadian agency typically focuses on ice and snow on the plane rather than whats falling from the sky faa officials relented a bit permitting airlines in conjunction with individual inspectors to establish procedures allowing pilots to sometimes make their own calls airlines started to complain that the standards werent enforced uniformly some for example thought they could operate in sleety conditions as long as they didnt use a de icing agent or if they had determined there was no ice on the wings "a number of carriers kept operating while we were sitting there telling passengers we couldnt fly " says ron thomas a us airways pilot and director of flight technical operations "i told the faa this is ridiculous research should be done before something this drastic comes up " in december the faa reiterated that all carriers had to comply "it has come to the attention of the air transport division that a number of air carrier operators are continuing to dispatch in ice pellet conditions " it said the faa "does not have sufficient data at this time to approve such operations " the notice continued calling such takeoffs "potentially hazardous " in february the air line pilots association the u s s biggest pilots union weighed in with its own alert it urged pilots to use "extreme caution" because "even momentary exposures to ice pellets may result in a layer of clear ice" on wings that could be hard to detect to fight back united parcel service inc commissioned a study from anti icing materials international laboratory a body affiliated with the universite du quebec a chicoutimi upss louisville ky operations had been badly hampered by an ice pellet storm in the study concluded that a plane could safely take off up to minutes after anti icing chemicals had been applied ms gilligan the faa safety official says the agency was sensitive to complaints that it had chosen "a heavy handed or more severe reaction" than was necessary early in it decided to see for itself if airlines could take off safely in ice pellet conditions the faa transport canada and the quebec lab performed another series of studies they looked at the interaction of ice pellets and anti icing fluids in a freezing environment they flew a business jet with lab created pellets sprinkled on its wings during limited testing the pellets slid off as the plane became airborne in october after months of debate the faa amended the ice pellet ban and gave the airlines minutes from the start of anti icing to get their planes into the air but only in "light" pellets showers anti icing alone takes minutes or more the agency barred departures altogether if pellet showers were heavy or mixed with other forms of precipitation although it didnt define what constituted a "heavy" shower the revised ban left open the possibility that airlines could check a planes condition from the outside with a ground worker stationed on a lift truck at the end of a runway until last week continental used that approach at its newark n j and cleveland hubs where a pilot actually touched the wings to detect the presence of pellets the faa recently told the airline it could no longer do that even though inspectors in houston had approved the arrangement pilot groups and some carriers didnt like the revised rule either arguing that it was also based on inadequate research "they threw some ice cubes at an aluminum tray and said oh look they stick " complains one airline operations chief most carriers would like to return to the pre procedures the amended rule "is kind of unrealistic because pellets typically are mixed with something else " says david fuller director of flight operations for jetblue airways many airlines now must take the most conservative approach and cancel flights to avoid violating faa rules he says roy rasmussen an atmospheric scientist working with the faa says that of the time ice pellets are mixed with other forms of precipitation such as rain or snow that suggests that the new rule would only help the airlines a third of the time moreover says mr rasmussen a senior scientist for the national center for atmospheric research a federally funded boulder colo research center it isnt even certain that ice pellets have become more common hes currently researching the question for the faa the theoretical argument turned into a giant operational headache during a valentines day storm in the northeast according to pilots and airline officials faa officials at new yorks john f kennedy international airport barred airlines from taking off because of the kind of pellets falling that day american airlines opted early in the morning to cancel flights and delay boarding planes but it was too late for jetblue the airline had already committed to loading up planes based on its long standing reluctance to cancel flights and on a faulty assumption that conditions would improve jetblue has admitted to blundering in several ways but says the pellet rule exacerbated its mistakes "we had airplanes arriving in pellets that couldnt depart " says john ross jetblues vice president of system operations adding that ice pellet conditions are "very difficult to predict " by the time flights on the ground were canceled jetblue had no gates available so planes sat on the tarmac for hours the problems cascaded for the next several days due to breakdowns in crew scheduling understaffing and a dearth of workers to handle the crowds at jfk the airline ultimately scratched about flights in a six day period besides antagonizing travelers flying during pellet storms is expensive completely de icing and anti icing a boeing jumbo jet can cost more than &# in chemicals not counting the extra fuel burned while waiting repeated de icing can deplete airports chemical stocks as happened at jfk during the march storm that noreaster which pummeled the east coast from boston to philadelphia underscored the industrys dilemma if the pre rules had been in place "we would not have had to cancel operations " because planes could have been de iced leaving pilots to rely on a visual check says capt thomas of us airways instead the airline shut off departures from its philadelphia hub from in the morning to p m "it paralyzed us " he says having learned its lesson jetblue canceled of its flights well in advance of the storm ice pellets fell from noon to p m that day making departures impossible at certain times to avoid tarmac gridlock the airline erred on the side of caution spoiling thousands of consumers travel plans midwest storms in late february and on march caused one big carrier to "spend various amounts of time not moving " says one operations manager "you get into a never ending cycle " he says "de ice cancel back to the gate " additional research could provide a breakthrough dan sicchio a us airways captain who heads a de icing study group for alpa the pilots union thinks "the faa wants the whole issue to go away " agency managers are "looking to get this off their plate " he says because whatever they do "its going to make some powerful people very unhappy "
