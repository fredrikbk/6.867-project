the daily fix college hoops fans enjoy trio of sweet thrillers online edition three games five points that was the margin of error in the sweet last night memphis texas a&amp m ohio state tennessee kansas southern illinois oh and ucla pittsburgh as predicted kansas had trouble with southern illinois as the salukis tenacious defense derailed the jayhawks high octane offense and forced them into the hoops equivalent of trench warfare which they won barely thanks to being bigger "kansas trailed by four with minutes remaining and you could see it the jayhawks were drenched in sweat and frustration " writes joe posnanski in the kansas city star "everybody knows that kansas can run with any team in the country they score with any team in the country they can even play defense with any team in the country but nobody was quite sure how they would handle a team that just comes at them like cool hand luke in the jail yard and southern illinois was every bit as relentless as expected " in the chicago sun times jay mariotti offers the salukis kudos he knows they dont want "ive never been more impressed by a losing team in march " he writes "but i still think of southern as lovable and cuddly an upstart from the other end of our elongated state coach chris lowery and his guys proud but upset want no part of such blather in their minds they didnt get the job done which should remind us how far theyve come as a program to simply call them the gonzaga of the midwest probably is understating the new standards in carbondale where basketball always has been the identity but never more boldly than now " for texas a&amp m the cause of death was simple fatigue the aggies were up by with seconds left as acie law went for a layup only to come up a bit short at the other end memphis missed and missed but kept coming up with rebounds then saw antonio anderson get fouled and go to the line mr anderson was just for from the line in the game and on the year but he calmly hit free throws for the tie and the win and now the tigers would like some respect if you please "a year ago memphis made it by beating bradley and the skeptics said they got lucky " writes geoff calkins in the memphis commercial appeal "this year they made it by beating texas a&amp m and the skeptics will say what can anything possibly be left enough with the conference forget about the schedule the tigers played one of the best teams in the country in front of of its fans they did it with andre allen struggling with chris douglas roberts limping and with robert dozier and joey dorsey sitting out vast stretches of the game with foul trouble and they still won " the dallas morning newss jean jacques taylor isnt forgetting the conference or the schedule but hes got plenty of respect for the winning team "you shouldve remembered this is a team with a proud and storied history " he writes adding that "in the end with the game on the line memphis wanted it more that doesnt mean a&amp m didnt play hard or try hard but three different memphis players grabbed offensive rebounds in the final seconds thats desire they refused to walk off the court with a loss now memphis is one win away from the final four pretty good dont you think for a conference usa team " more than a few folks in ohio meanwhile probably woke up this morning with a start of fright before remembering it all came out ok ohio state trailed tennessee by points late in the first half and appeared headed for a demoralizing exit to be followed by several million whither greg oden stories and mr oden looked headed for an earlier exit still with three fouls at the half but the buckeyes persevered their shots started landing while the vols shots started missing and as time expired mr oden sealed the comeback with a rejection of a desperate ramar smith shot in the columbus dispatch bob hunter urges buckeye fans to stop worrying about off court dramas and just enjoy the ride if you can enjoy an experience this white knuckled "probably not since the days of jerry lucas and john havlicek has ohio state had a basketball season when so much was expected of it yet it has come at the same time a vicious learning curve was being applied " he writes "in light of that the buckeyes successes have been impressive an undisputed big ten regular season championship the conference tournament title the no ranking and a no seed even if those arent the prizes that most everybody today focuses on the lasting image of this young team will be what happens in the tournament which is why the victory last night was so important they were a footer from a second round loss to unranked xavier which would have been crushing they were a couple of more tennessee baskets from being blown out of the tournament like a no seed now they are one win from the final four the expectations are beginning to meet the reality and its a sight to behold " overshadowed by that trio of thrillers was uclas win over pitt as the bruins shut down the panthers aaron gray and hit their free throws for a comparatively easy advance to the elite eight "the similarities between ucla coach ben howland and his former protege pittsburgh coach jamie dixon include their appreciation for the finer points of defense their restlessness on the sideline and on thursday extended to their choice of identically dark suits worn over light blue shirts and patterned ties " helene elliott writes in the los angeles times "the difference between them though is significant howland knows how to guide a team through a defining moment out the other side and into the elite eight dixon though undeniably bright and capable of coaxing a lot out of a limited lineup has not achieved that breakthrough " so college hoops doesnt exactly lack for drama right now but theres more anyway kentuckys tubby smith is leaving the wildcats last seen being ousted by the jayhawks last weekend for the head coaching job at minnesota for once a big coaching change comes without a lot of rancor "this is absolutely the best and most pleasant way the story could end tubby smith proudly takes his sparkling resume to a university of minnesota program that is ready to welcome him as if hes the reigning coach of the century " writes rick bozich in the louisville courier journal "and the university of kentucky gets its opportunity to recruit a replacement who can maneuver the wildcats program back into position to soar and run and entertain and hang around the ncaa tournament for more than one dull distressing weekend " "for those of us who became tired of the tubby bashing it was great to see him pull off such a fabulous spin move and find a place where a coach of his stature will be appreciated probably even liked where alumni and fans wont turn up their nose at winning games and going to the ncaa tournament " michael wilbon writes in the washington post "how great it must feel after being told for the better part of eight years that youre not wanted to tell big blue you dont want them id tell him congratulations on getting out of lexington with an ncaa championship his money &# million and his dignity the nerve of the kentucky people is stunning how they think any season that doesnt end with a final four trip is utter failure and a reason to roast the coach like a marshmallow " ok theres a little rancor found a
