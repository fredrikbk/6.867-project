further loss of confidence if the company doesnt find a more profitable course soon in january mr zander signed a five year employment contract with motorola mr zander denied in an interview wednesday that his job is on the line "ed zander is absolutely in charge of the company " said a spokesman who added that with the management changes "he has strengthened his management team " members of the board couldnt be reached to comment motorolas no spot was eliminated after the departure of mike zafirovski now chief executive of nortel networks corp the appointment of a board member as acting finance chief suggests "there definitely is a tightening of the leash" on mr zander said jeffrey sonnenfeld a senior associate dean at yale universitys school of management "the board is showing its responsive to performance issues " mr sonnenfeld added "they are paying attention to the business but they have not lost faith" in their chief executive motorolas financial performance has been spiraling downward for the past six months primarily because the schaumburg ill company badly miscalculated product mix and pricing in the highly competitive handset market while the company has sold more than million razrs the phones price has fallen so far that some wireless operators are offering it free meanwhile consumers are shunning some of motorolas new products because they resemble the older razr wednesdays management shake up follows the resignation in mid february of ron garriques then president of motorolas handset division motorola appointed two people co heads of the division while it looks for mr garriques successor mr zander and other motorola officials have acknowledged the company has operational weaknesses talking to investors earlier this week mr zander said the company needs to do a better job of streamlining technology and cutting manufacturing costs especially in the lower end handset category he also admitted the company needs to offer consumers a greater variety of high end products much of the responsibility for solving those problems will fall to mr brown who has gotten decent marks for running the motorola unit that sells telecom equipment to operators like at&amp t inc and sprint nextel corp in the past year he successfully integrated the divisions government and network businesses he also is credited with motorolas acquisitions last year of symbol technologies inc and good technology inc which both focus on business customers mr brown who joined motorola in early already has begun to tackle issues in the handset division he visited the division wednesday afternoon immediately after motorolas announcement of discouraging financial performance according to a company spokesman mr brown also spent time there yesterday some analysts and investors have questioned whether he will be able to solve motorolas formidable problems he lacks experience in the handset business and has yet to build any of the critical relationships hes going to need with wireless operators in more than countries mr brown did "a very good job" in his initial motorola role running its government and public safety business earning a reputation as a very polished smart and articulate executive said someone familiar with the situation his reputation doesnt include being a risk taker this person said for instance mr brown turned down a chance to run motorolas handset business a few years ago because he saw that job "as too much of a risk " this person said mr brown wasnt available to comment yesterday motorola declined to comment being promoted to president and chief operating officer makes mr brown a natural possible successor to mr zander but mr brown has never talked about his chief executive ambitions at motorola according to his eldest brother richard brown the former chief executive of electronic data systems corp a computer services concern in plano texas "he always had the philosophy that you get ahead from the job youre in" rather than by lobbying for "the job you want " said the older brother who is now retired the younger mr brown also has operational experience from running micromuse inc a software company based in san francisco mr meredith the new acting chief financial officer has served on the motorola board since early the former chief financial officer at dell inc from to he is a general partner of meritage capital l p an investment management firm that he co founded specializing in multimanager hedge funds mr meredith also is chief executive of mfi capital mr meredith has known mr zander since
