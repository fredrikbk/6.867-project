weekend journal taste houses of worship prayer behind the partition as a little girl i was both enamored of the womens section at the back of my orthodox synagogue and tormented by it i lived for saturday mornings when my mother and i left our brooklyn apartment and walked around the corner to sweet friendly young magen david and the cozy partitioned area reserved for women only it was its own world intimate charming a place that encouraged friendship as well as prayer safe at last id think as i put the rough schoolweek behind me id take a seat next to my mother behind the wooden filigreed divider with clover shaped holes my immigrant congregation made up of families who came from the middle east was so small that it was easy to follow the service from our area and when the torah scrolls were passed around youd see womens hands poking through the holes to touch the holy scrolls yet i also bristled at the divider and longed to escape to the mens section the men seemed to have such fun taking part in the sacraments and being counted as part of a "minyan " or quorum of necessary for the service the purpose of a divider or "mehitzah " as it is known in hebrew is to make sure that men arent distracted from their prayers the custom of separate seating dates back to the second temple in jerusalem when congregants became so lighthearted at a jewish festival that it was deemed necessary to segregate the sexes fast forward to th century america where the reform and conservative movements made a point of allowing families to sit together the mehitzah all but vanished from their grand new temples sprouting in suburbia with the rise of the womens movement the divider became almost a symbol of female oppression antiquated and vaguely contemptible even some orthodox shuls did without a formal partition according to rabbi tzvi hersh weinreb of the orthodox union in new york theyve made an odd and tortuous comeback these dividers fueled in part by a resurgence of orthodox judaism some other branches of judaism including ones that did much to try to include women are hurting while orthodox judaism is booming "people in this crazy world are looking to be anchored they are looking for greater discipline " says rabbi marc schneier who runs the hampton synagogue in chic westhampton beach in the past few years the orthodox union which oversees hundreds of synagogues in america formally decreed that any congregation calling itself orthodox must have a formal divider the ous decision has been convulsive in some places congregation agudas achim in columbus ohio thought of itself as orthodox yet didnt have a mehitzah when confronted on the issue by the ou it engaged in a passionate debate according to its rabbi jason miller and ultimately refused to put in a divider it even switched to the conservative movement these days says rabbi miller the thriving agudas achim is " egalitarian " beth tfiloh in baltimore went in the other direction years back when it relocated to the suburbs from downtown the congregation decided on separate seating but no partition the concern was that a divider might alienate young families lured by synagogues where everyone sat together but the tide has turned says rabbi mitchell wohlberg and a new more observant generation would have left if it were not for the partition at the same time he adds congregants "didnt want to see women move to the back of the bus " the solution a "tasteful" mehitzah made of glass wood and brass rabbi wohlberg is impatient with complainers "many of the people who say they want to sit with their husbands and wives at services they dont play golf together they dont have weeknights together " he remarks "all of a sudden they cant live without each other when they come to service " the ous partition policy calls for women to sit apart from men with a "tangible physical separation " but debate rages should it be six feet tall or four should it be opaque or allow for some transparency meeting the requirements of jewish or halachic law isnt as daunting as it seems says westhamptons rabbi schneier his mehitzah is so discreet as to barely be noticeable rabbi raphael benchimol of the manhattan sephardic congregation points out that the partition isnt only important for men "women shouldnt be distracted either " yet i learned early on that dividers did little to stop flirting between the sexes and have often wondered if separation didnt encourage romance i mean what is more desirable than a forbidden object the person you glimpse beyond a divider these days with no little shul around the corner and no mother to lead me there i have the choice to go and pray anywhere i can go to one of those vast and fashionable egalitarian temples yet i choose to attend the same type of intimate service i did as a child i am always on a quest for the ideal womens section i may have found it in my little shul chabad of southampton jewish center on long island a few plastic potted plants make up the divider its halachic but not intimidating when i come in the rabbi waves hello i put the rough workweek behind me and begin to pray ms lagnado a journal
