the secs fuzzy math almost of u s public companies announced a record financial restatements in it was a record but continues an accelerating trend of financial restatements from in and more than in these restatements impose large costs on the capital markets the gao estimated that between july and september the market capitalizations of restating companies decreased by a total of &# billion in the days immediately following the initial restatement two academic studies have shown that stock prices decline not only for the restating firm but also for its direct competitors presumably because of fears about the financials of the whole industry more broadly as the sec has noted "restating financial statements of prior periods may dilute public confidence in financial statements and may confuse those who use them " the initial spurt of restatements during to was related partly to the more intensive reviews of internal controls mandated by section of the sarbanes oxley act however sarbox is not the main problem from to there was a decrease in the number of financial restatements by the larger public companies required to perform internal control reviews under section according to a glass lewis study yet for the same period that study found a increase in the number of financial restatements by smaller public companies not yet required to implement section the main problem is that many public companies are being forced to restate their financials for technical accounting reasons of dubious significance to investors on march for example a nasdaq company called isle of capri casinos announced a delay in filing its sec reports to complete the restatement of its financials for the prior three years because of adjustments to the amortization of its space leases yet standard &amp poors concluded that "we do not believe the issue causing the restatement and the filing delay to be material " no wonder ordinary investors are confused how should they react to a financial restatement caused by an accounting adjustment to a non cash item which is declared immaterial by an expert firm to be sure some financial restatements are certainly justified most importantly those resulting from the negligent or intentional misapplication of well established accounting standards nevertheless others are the result of significant reinterpretations of complex accounting standards that could not realistically have been foreseen by company executives while such reinterpretations may be an appropriate response to changing markets or new accounting perspectives they should be adopted only with advance notice by the regulators together with an opportunity for public comment moreover significant reinterpretations of accounting standards should be applied prospectively not retroactively to reduce the number of unnecessary financial restatements that damage companies and confuse investors the adoption and amendment of u s accounting standards occurs through a formal process led by the financial accounting standards board this process which often takes several years involves the promulgation of a detailed draft a lengthy period for public comment and careful decision making by a board of distinguished members by contrast significant changes in interpreting existing accounting standards have episodically been announced through speeches or informal communications by the sec staff without any advance notice or public comment for example a speech by the secs chief accountant followed by a letter in february of articulated a significant reinterpretation of the accounting standard for leases this speech led to a wave of financial restatements by retailers restaurant chains and other companies with a substantial amount of leased space indeed revisions to lease accounting were the most frequent cause of financial restatements in then all these companies were cited by their auditors for material weaknesses in their internal control systems because the companies had not previously applied this new perspective on lease accounting in the sec settled an enforcement case with fannie mae based on its misapplication of fas a standard requiring companies to recognize quarterly changes in the value of derivatives used for hedging although fannie mae had undoubtedly committed material violations of fas this standard is so lengthy and complex that there is much debate about its application in many situations in settling with fannie mae the sec included a few sentences about its views on the proper interpretation of certain aspects of fas this precipitated a round of restatements at other financial institutions over the last decade the sec has unilaterally imposed significant reinterpretations of accounting standards by issuing staff accounting bulletins sabs most dramatically sab changed the widely accepted practice that the materiality of an accounting error should be judged by a quantitative test i e whether the impact of the error exceeds of a companys net income for the relevant period according to sab even quantitatively immaterial accounting errors should be considered material and therefore would require a restatement if they had certain qualitative effects e g they would allow the company to meet analyst earnings consensus or avoid a debt covenant violation this change alone has led to hundreds of more financial restatements as explained to me by a former head of the secs enforcement division "i couldnt believe that the staff replaced years of accounting cases based on the objective test with a subjective approach that had no clear boundaries " everyone agrees that financial restatements are necessary to correct errors in applying established accounting standards where the results are material to investors however the recent flood of financial restatements includes many that are not actually material to investors or that flow from new interpretations of existing accounting standards two changes need to be made to restrain this latter category the sec should accept the net income test for the materiality of accounting errors and it should follow the procedures for rulemaking in the administrative procedure act including advance notice and opportunity for comment before introducing a significant reinterpretation of any accounting standard mr pozen is chairman of
