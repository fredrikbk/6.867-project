weekend journal review television martyrs and pilgrims those seeking to understand better the enmeshed political and spiritual fervor of many iranians will find historical rationales in "wide angle"s "pilgrimage to karbala" monday p m edt on pbs but some viewers will still struggle to fathom the respect for martyrdom that runs through segments of irans culture the documentary follows a group of pilgrims from tehran on a mile bus trip through war ravaged iraq to hallowed shia ground their destination is karbala site of an epic bloodbath in which hussein grandson of the prophet muhammad was struck down with his companions by the tyrant yazid the theological narrative of karbala this program asserts helps to shape irans political embattlement and its sense of alienation from the west the former shah george w bush tony blair and israels "criminal prime minister" are invoked by irans leaders as avatars of yazid iran itself in this reckoning is the martyr hussein despite being citizens of a modern metropolis and having as much to lose as you or i do the pilgrims here approved for travel by the islamic government crave entry into a war zone in which they will make a juicy target for insurgents all in order to kiss the ground at karbala kamran a transport manager and veteran of the iran iraq war believes that "to die in a pilgrimage would be a blessing " though he leaves behind a fiancee and a comfortable home two veiled schoolgirls are permitted to ride the bus the obvious dangers notwithstanding and a schoolteacher beatifically fearless leaves her crying children at the bus station another pilgrim is the murshed director of a gymnasium at which shia men "spiritually prepare to fight invaders " his proteges were arrested or killed by the shahs police and his world view is karbala centric he sums up the philosophy of husseins followers "it is better to die a bloody death than to live the life of a coward " as tensions have mounted between the u s and iran president mahmoud ahmadinejad too has bolstered his rhetoric against the west with the themes embodied in husseins tale noting that "a people that believes in martyrdom cannot be enslaved " the murshed concurs although his logic is ungainly "how come bush allows so many people to be killed " he asks "cruelty is the reason yazid is bush and bushs friends are friends of yazid and england is a friend of bush " the program deftly explores ways in which the story of the powerful but immoral yazid has helped to move political mountains in irans recent past the ayatollah khomeini whose picture hangs in the mursheds gym and on the pilgrims bus despised the mighty shah for his decadent ties to the west brutal security forces and attempts to emancipate women the program deploys striking footage of khomeinis return to power and of the iran iraq war which ushered in a wave of violent self sacrifice that still eludes our comprehension a charismatic singer is shown arousing the religious passions of doomed young soldiers who beat their chests mesmerized by his melodies for eight years during their war with iraq iranian parents sent their sons to the front there are moving scenes of young men fodder on the eve of battle sobbing hugging and asking for forgiveness as they embrace death despite the sweetness of life a woman shouts at a parade of passing soldiers "caravan of karbala ill give my five year old and year old " whether she was a propaganda plant we may never know but her apparent willingness to sacrifice her children is chilling its reassuring to learn that there is scope even in a theocracy for personal choice and that iranians dont march in lockstep "pilgrimage to karbala" doesnt shy away from the pilgrims stark views but also includes interviews with dissenters kamran the transport manager may welcome martyrdom but his mother smoking and dressed western style with her head uncovered before the camera is opposed to his trip for the obvious reason that she doesnt want him to get hurt the conflict between liberalism and religious orthodoxy is everywhere apparent in one scene pilgrims gently disparage their imam chaperone for sleeping late some are queasy on the subject of martyrdom when kamran reaches karbala we see that "paradise on earth" is a scruffy hub with the atmosphere of a religious theme park the well fed kamran struggles to crawl across the square while back in tehran his mother fretfully works the phone and prepares soup for his safe return having sent her son off to fight once she worries about the future "the next war will be worse than the last one " she says in an ominous sound bite "because the next war will be against america " for those who missed the programs premiere earlier this week msnbc will rebroadcast "war zone diary" sunday p m edt richard engel went to baghdad as a free lancer for abc news and is now with nbc he is billed as the only network news correspondent to remain there for the duration of the war his personal account of his tour of duty has been promoted as a raw backstory and it does offer unscripted scenes of street and barracks life in a place thats up for grabs but the program also addresses a quandary faced by news executives how can we cover a war when we cant even leave our bunkers in safety yet equally how can we fail to cover so dire a conflict mr engel answers by example theres no choice he believes but to roll the dice and hope not to be killed or kidnapped he shows up for work though his marriage fails under the pressure and he worries that he may be recording his own obituary dorothy rabinowitz is off this week
