treasury prices post decline investors keep eyes on yield curve inversion run ends the federal reserves move to soften its bias toward raising interest rates ended a seven month long yield curve inversion one of the longest seen in u s markets the reversal of the benchmark yield curve the gap between and two year yields was immediate from negative percentage point just before the statement wednesday when the two year yield was and the year rate stood at the curve hit a positive percentage point within minutes yesterday the benchmark year note ended down at with a yield of while the two year note was down at with a yield of yields move inversely to prices an inverted yield curve is a bond market anomaly in which short term rates are above long dated ones in the past this has signaled a recession but policy makers say that is no longer the case pointing to an array of factors including global capital flows that have kept long term interest rates low for some investors wednesdays steepening yield curve seemed the first step in a long predicted trend which they expect to gather pace as the fed starts easing policy rate cuts tend to pressure short term yields most and with the european central bank also getting close to neutral it is tempting to conclude that years of global curve flattening will soon come to an end there is no clear consensus among investors in the u s there are as many cheerleaders of renewed flattening as steepening the direction of the european and japanese yield curves also seem opaque for the u s the steepening bet boils down to a wager that the fed will ease policy in coming months most likely in june that was a conclusion many jumped to after the fed removed from its statement the warning that inflation pressures meant rates "may" need tightening but most economists warned that the central bank was simply looking to maximize its flexibility as a result there are many like lena komileva g economist at tullett prebon who expect renewed u s curve inversion ms komileva expects rates in the u s to remain unchanged at for most of the year trapped in the "unfavorable" position of having inflation above its comfort zone as the economy slows in fact even the post meeting curve flattening may have been overdone given that the feds policy hasnt changed said jack mcintyre associate portfolio manager at brandywines &# billion global investment management fund "i think people made so much money in the flattening trade that theyre just unwinding" it he said mr mcintrye said he would be hesitant to make a clear bet on any of the big three yield curves japan europe and the u s thats even as it might make sense to expect the japanese yield curve currently at a positive percentage point to flatten as the bank of japan tightens interest rates short term rates tend to rise with policy moves while long term yields generally climb more modestly sometimes even stay steady or fall as tighter policy dims inflation fears
