boss talk accountings crisis killer tumult eases for pwcs nally does he do his own taxes when dennis nally took over pricewaterhousecoopers llp in the u s in the accounting world was reeling from a series of corporate scandals and the demise of arthur andersen llp the remaining big four accounting firms soon faced new rules a new regulator and an investing public that had lost some confidence in auditors today the sense of crisis has diminished market shaking corporate meltdowns have been on the wane the big four pwc deloitte &amp touche llp ernst &amp young llp and kpmg llp have adjusted to their new regulated environment and they have actually seen business boom thanks to work heaped on them by new rules meant to clean up a mess that some critics say they helped create mr nally years old is in his second term as chairman of pwc the biggest u s accounting firm by revenue generated from auditing companies the son of a federal bureau of investigation agent mr nally was born in washington d c and went to college at western michigan university in kalamazoo deciding on a career in accounting during his senior year an avid boater mr nally keeps a foot powerboat in florida which he calls his biggest extravagance with the firms today on surer footing mr nally now finds himself dealing with numerous nettlesome long term issues which he discussed during an interview in his firms new york headquarters fearing potentially catastrophic litigation he argued that firms should get special protection from lawsuits mr nally also said the public needs to better understand auditors responsibility when it comes to catching fraud and he expressed willingness to consider publishing accounting firms financial results something these private partnerships dont now do in a nod to this possibly increased transparency mr nally disclosed details about pwcs profits no other big four firm has ever publicly disclosed such figures in fact the firms until recently even balked at disclosing revenue figures for their u s arms he answered other questions as well excerpts follow the wall street journal there are four accounting firms that audit companies with about of the worlds stock market value is this a problem mr nally i think it could be a problem if you see one of the major firms fail and if you see the second tier firms not having the ability to grow or develop their capabilities to effectively compete in the global marketplace wsj do you see a need for increasing competition beyond the big four mr nally i dont think we have an issue theres a tremendous amount of competition among the four firms today its important to go back to why the firms came together the way they did thats all about trying to create the scale the critical mass to serve some of the largest companies in the world wsj why are the firms pushing for a limitation on liability for auditing public companies mr nally there is a concern that without some form of liability relief over time you run the risk that one of these firms ultimately fails there is a catastrophic loss that cant be dealt with every one of these firms is a partnership and having the ability to sustain this profession over time is making sure that the liability question is addressed wsj in your fiscal year that ended last june pwc in the u s generated nearly &# billion in revenue how much of that was profit that could be distributed to your firms partners mr nally between &# billion and &# billion wsj its tough to assess the risk facing the firms because as private partnerships theres no financial information available at what point do the firms have to say here are our financial statements just like public companies do mr nally i would think dependent upon where all of this conversation goes if there is to be some form of liability relief there obviously would have to be more transparency around that wsj is it an auditors job to try and find fraud mr nally absolutely we have a responsibility to perform procedures that are detecting fraud just like we have responsibilities to perform procedures to detect errors in financial statements wsj you seem pretty certain but the firms as a whole often eschew some responsibility for finding fraud especially in court mr nally the audit profession has always had a responsibility for the detection of fraud the debate has always gone toward how far do you carry that what type of procedures do you have to develop and in what environment the classic issue becomes the cost benefit of all of that and this is why i think there is this expectation gap wsj there are more than companies under investigation over backdating of stock options as was the case with the enron and worldcom debacles that has given rise to the question where were the auditors mr nally if the public has a view that the auditors report on a set of financial statements is designed to provide absolute assurance that is not what the auditing profession and the auditing literature requires today were providing reasonable assurance theres a big difference between absolute and reasonable wsj last summer it emerged that pwc was being audited by the irs the first time the firm was subject to an audit is that audit still ongoing mr nally it should be complete next week the outcome is an immaterial adjustment that deals with technical tax issues a classic review of the firms tax returns looking at different types of items from a deductibility standpoint some related to interpretations of capital gains ordinary income disallowed expenses all resulting in a clearly de minimis adjustment wsj last year due to problems related to the quality of audit work at pwcs affiliate in japan pwc was forced to start a second firm there the original affiliate recently announced it was closing leaving pwc with a very small presence in this key market how does that impact the global pwc brand and the u s firm mr nally japan is a great example of the need to look at our network and how to make sure that we have the ability to deliver a consistent level of quality services everywhere were doing business wsj how could things have gotten so bad under the firms watch that pwc would have had to cut its affiliate in japan loose mr nally it goes back to having a clear understanding of what is required in different parts of the world around auditing standards the culture around the auditing profession and its important to have that degree of understanding in terms of what actually occurred in japan the environment in japan has historically been very different from the environment from an auditing standpoint in the western world theres a move afoot by the japanese regulators to make changes into that marketplace which we fully support and encourage and thats part of this as well wsj like the other firms pwc has supported the sarbanes oxley law and the controversial rules that require auditors to sign off on companies control systems for preventing accounting mistakes and fraud some critics have said this is because youve used the fees generated by the law to offset revenue lost due to another post enron rule that barred accounting firms from selling consulting services to audit clients mr nally obviously ive heard that and i have to doubt that its the case when the rule was issued i think pwc and the other firms tried to apply the standard as best as they could and the new standard was issued very quickly and not surprisingly created a lot of angst and stress in the system i think there was a real attempt to apply that standard in the best way possible and thats what pwc did wsj do you think small companies with stock market values of less than &# million should be subject to checks on their internal controls or exempted as some have called for mr nally there ought to be a consistent approach whether a large company or a small company if the argument is that the standards will result in a process that is just not cost efficient for these smaller companies we ought to just exempt those companies and let the investors know that but i dont think that we ought to have two types of standards wsj do you do your own taxes mr nally i do not we actually have a program we make available to all partners to have their taxes done its a lot easier a lot more efficient i used to do my own i probably did my taxes up till about five years ago hammering away at problems key goals in the words of dennis nally year old chairman of pricewaterhousecoopers on fraud "we have a responsibility to perform procedures that are detecting fraud just like we have responsibilities to perform procedures to detect errors in financial statements " on standards "there ought to be a consistent approach whether a large company or a small company " on liability caps "there is a concern that without some form of liability relief over time you run the risk that one of these firms ultimately fails there is a catastrophic loss that cant be dealt with "
