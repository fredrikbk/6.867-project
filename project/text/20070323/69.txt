pact ushers in competitive skies u s eu accord invites mergers and lower fares charting winners losers under the new "open skies" pact deregulating air travel between the u s and the european union continental airlines inc delta air lines inc and northwest airlines corp get potentially lucrative new trans atlantic access while amr corp s american airlines british airways plc and ailing alitalia spa are likely to face intensifying competition the approval of the deal yesterday by transportation ministers of the eu states will have broad ramifications for air travel between the worlds busiest aviation markets immediately opening the door to greater competition lower fares and new services in the longer term the agreement also promises to fundamentally change the way airlines are regulated and encourages european airlines to more aggressively compete in each others home markets it also raises the possibility of a wave of international airline mergers that are prohibitively difficult though restrictions over foreign control of u s airlines remain continental delta and northwest will for the first time have the right to serve londons popular but restricted heathrow airport irelands aer lingus group plc and british midland airways ltd also stand to win big because of the new freedom they will have serving the u s market "this offers better access to the most important european market " london said jim whitehurst deltas chief operating officer "the new competition should lead to a substantial reduction in ticket prices and thats good from a customers perspective " british airways and american airlines will be forced to battle increased competition at heathrow italys alitalia could face an invasion of better run rivals in its rich home market the outcome had faced some uncertainty british authorities were hesitating because the deal allows increased competition at heathrow which is already operating near capacity italy also balked fearing the deal could upset its privatization of alitalia both countries ended up endorsing the agreement after winning a five month delay in its implementation which will now be march after the opening of a large new terminal at heathrow and italys target date for selling alitalia the deal doesnt need u s congressional approval and president bush has already given his support u s and eu officials expect to sign the pact at a summit in washington on april under the agreement any european carrier will be allowed to fly to any city in the u s and u s carriers will be granted access to all airports in the eu until now permission to fly was granted on a bilateral basis between individual countries rules dating to the s largely prohibited a carrier from one country from selling tickets on flights between two other countries some carriers have already signaled they hope to capitalize quickly on the new rights britains virgin atlantic airways ltd recently said it would consider launching services to the u s from other european countries competing directly with local carriers continental says it is seeking "blanket open skies authority " to operate in all european union countries u s cargo giants fedex corp and united parcel service inc also stand to gain from the new freedom to fly freight between european airports ual corp s united airlines which sold its new york to london route to delta last year said it hopes to boost service to europe via its hubs in chicago washington denver and los angeles "now we can fly to whatever cities we want " said united senior vice president michael whitaker over the long term the biggest fallout could come from european carriers being allowed to much more aggressively compete with each other in europe threatening financially weaker national carriers in large markets such as italy greece poland and scandinavia analysts say the competition could come even sooner through the worlds three airline alliances star alliance skyteam and oneworld within these groups one airline can put its customers on a partners plane allowing fliers to buy tickets more easily on many routes today for example northwest airlines can fly between its detroit hub and amsterdam not only with its own passengers but also fliers who have bought tickets through klm starting next year klm will have the right to sell seats on northwest flights between the u s and destinations all across europe not just amsterdam officials from the two carriers said they would consider doing this but announced no specific plans american said the accord opens more opportunity to work with marketing partner british airways through the oneworld alliance but chief executive gerard arpey also recently conceded that having more airlines flying into heathrow "by definition is not good for us " the new deal also relaxes aviation rules requiring that a carrier from any country be owned and controlled by citizens of only that country a stipulation that impeded cross border airline mergers under the new agreement the u s will treat the eu as if it were one country one immediate beneficiary of the change will be air france klm which has faced lingering regulatory uncertainty over air frances acquisition of klm british airways chief executive willie walsh has attacked the eu as "naive" for granting the u s free access to heathrow before securing more access to the u s market mr walsh called the pact "a missed opportunity" and pressed u k and eu officials to extract more from the u s in a second phase of deregulation talks set to start within months the rights necessary to land at and depart from congested heathrow at a specific time called "slots" are also expensive and difficult to obtain costing as much as &# million each nonetheless delta plans to offer service to heathrow from march "its all a matter of price " mr whitehurst said paulo prada melanie trottman and william echikson contributed to this article
