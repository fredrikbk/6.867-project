u s soccer league finally hopes to score german league alliance tournament with mexicans more tv and beckham for years major league soccer has been working on a massive project slowly building up u s interest in the worlds most popular sport then on one frenzied day this past january the league added some very sexy curb appeal david beckham the year old british midfielder and global marketing icon but the glitz is worthless without a strong foundation in the months since mr beckham signed his five year incentive laden contract with the los angeles galaxy mls has quietly solidified its infrastructure and laid the groundwork to expand in the u s and abroad the moves include a wide ranging alliance with germanys top soccer league a new tournament pitting mls teams against mexican

deal "a lot of people questioned our investment in soccer over the years but now were starting to see this pay off " says shawn hunter president of anschutz entertainment groups sports division which operates the galaxy and two other mls teams of course mls is still dwarfed by the "big four" of american sports the national football league national basketball association major league baseball and nascar when it comes to tv ratings merchandise sales and sponsorship revenue franchise values for mls teams are still lower than those in the struggling national hockey league and average attendance at mls games has hovered at around fans for the past seasons but in the wake of mr beckhams signing a number of developments point up u s soccers rising profile at home and overseas earlier this month mls announced a partnership with the bundesliga germanys top circuit that calls for the leagues to establish closer promotional links and share expertise in areas like stadium construction tv production and youth marketing the german league has the highest average attendance in europe but its foreign tv revenue lags behind that of englands premier league and spains la liga in a statement bundesliga ceo christian seifert said the league has spent the past months studying the american soccer market and was impressed with u s tv ratings for last years world cup which attracted an average of three million total american viewers on english and spanish channels the final between france and italy was watched by about million u s viewers outdrawing the final game of the world series in an effort to spur hotter rivalries on this continent and reach out to millions of latino fans mls and mexicos top domestic league have teamed up to start a new tournament dubbed the superliga the competition is an attempt to emulate europes champions league which pits top clubs from different countries against one another and generates billions of dollars in tv rights and sponsor deals for the inaugural edition this year four teams from each country will square off during july and august with most of the games held at soccer specific stadiums in the u s all the games will be televised in the u s exclusively on spanish language channel telefutura which is owned by univision communications inc "we need to get the spanish speaking fan very engaged in mls " says mls commissioner don

april and espn announced yesterday that its entire game mls schedule will be available in high definition mr beckhams pending arrival has also spurred a merchandising push target will promote mls gear at more than of its stores and adidas has already presold more mls branded apparel this year than it did in or arsenal the year old london soccer franchise that inspired the best selling book "fever pitch " is also angling for a toehold in the u s last month the club announced an alliance with mlss colorado rapids which is operated by stan kroenke owner of the nbas denver nuggets and the nhls colorado avalanche as part of the "strategic relationship " the british team will establish a youth training center at the rapids new facility in suburban denver send coaches to the u s to supervise clinics and develop an arsenal branded youth tournament the arsenal and bundesliga deals are in sharp contrast to past u s efforts by foreign teams which often tried to drum up interest with haphazard summer tours says paul swangard executive director of the university of oregons warsaw sports marketing center now "theres a recognition that mls is a viable piece of the global soccer business " he says "its a credibility statement for american soccer " european clubs are expressing their interest in on field talent as well a record americans are now playing in europe including in englands
