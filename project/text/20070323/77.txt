private lenders face more scrutiny on student loans as colleges send out their acceptance letters for next fall and parents ponder how to pay the tuition bill university financial aid offices and the loan companies that do business with them are under unprecedented assault from state and federal authorities yesterday new york attorney general andrew cuomo ratcheting up a probe of the student loan business sent a letter to education finance partners inc a san francisco based student loan provider saying that he intended to file a civil fraud lawsuit against the company it would be the first of what new york officials expect to be many such actions mr cuomo accuses the company of paying undisclosed kickbacks to schools for a spot on their coveted lists of "preferred lenders " he said as many as schools have received such payments and named including such well known institutions as boston university philadelphias drexel university and pittsburghs duquesne university the payments the state said take the form of "revenue sharing" in which education finance partners promises to pay back to the school a percentage of the loans it makes to students in one case &# a year for a single school such arrangements can be against the interest of students and their families if the school is selecting the lender in order to receive the payments instead of choosing another lender offering better terms the action comes as the federal government is turning up the heat on the student loan industry too earlier this week sen edward kennedy the massachusetts democrat who is chairman of the health education labor and pensions committee sent a letter to student loan lenders asking for information on their practices the u s department of education has also said it wants to examine preferred lender lists in a statement tamera briones the founder and chief executive of education finance partners said the company was "surprised and dismayed" that new york intended to sue and said the lender had been "fully cooperating with his office " ms briones said many schools use revenue sharing to pay for student aid programs that the agreements dont affect costs for borrowers and that the company discloses the arrangements to students schools typically pick a number of lenders to recommend to students ostensibly on the basis of price and service and offer borrowers materials and links on their web sites about of students including many from new york pick loans from the preferred lender lists the attorney general said mr cuomos offices notice gave education finance partners five days to respond and give a reason not to be sued "a preferred lender ought to mean that the lender is preferred by students for its low rates not by schools for its kickbacks " mr cuomo said yesterday mr cuomo and federal officials are targeting an especially fast growing and relatively new part of the &# billion u s student loan market education finance partners founded in makes private loans that arent backed by the u s government financial institutions made &# billion in such loans in the academic year up from &# billion a decade before the reason less expensive government loans and outright grants increasingly arent enough to pay for rising tuitions the business is far less understood and regulated than the federal loan programs rather than offer set government regulated rates private loans providers make loans based on a students or a familys credit score the field includes lesser known players such as education finance partners and big commercial banks as well as slm corp the student loan giant known as sallie mae the attorney generals office began its investigation in november requesting information from sallie mae nelnet inc education finance partners and educap inc in february the office asked for information from the college board the nonprofit best known for administering admissions tests and finance company cit group inc mr cuomo also sought information from public and private colleges state officials say they are investigating more than schools nationwide and that they are considering taking legal action against colleges and college aid administrators as well as loan companies mr cuomo has said lenders pay for trips for financial aid officers and their spouses to high end resorts in pebble beach the caribbean and elsewhere the sharp words from mr cuomo have left many financial aid officers feeling under siege dallas martin president of the national association of student financial aid administrators in washington said many are upset that their integrity is being questioned he called revenue sharing agreements "normal business practices " the letter sent yesterday to education finance partners from mr cuomos office details the following
