recommend your book in messages to fans and offer a deal buy the book today and youll get downloadable "bonuses" supposedly valued at thousands of dollars such as recordings of motivational speeches and contact information for important people orchestrating even book purchases in a single day can drive a title from obscurity to the top of the charts rick frishman who oversees the campaigns for ruder finns planned television arts also is a client his book "networking magic" went from a sales rank of on barnesandnoble com the morning it was published to no at p m he has a poster in his office showing the sales chart he briefly topped "im a nobody but i was somebody for a day " he says a decade after they were introduced online book sales rankings remain an object of obsession for authors because theyre unrestrained by shelf space the web stores give millions of books a ranking these are updated hourly and displayed on the books sales page and on best seller lists this "democratic" potential is celebrated by compulsive watchers of the numbers cindy ratzlaff vice president of brand marketing for rodale books has noticed that amazon seems to refresh its numbers minutes after every hour and she makes it a point to check the page soon after every hour during the workday "its really pathetic and extremely addictive and we all do it " she says but if this is the democracy of bookselling vote buying is an option ruder finns best seller program is one of several online aimed at new authors entrepreneurial sorts do it themselves suzanne falter barns sent me the eight page journal of her own personal amazon day as she calls the time an email campaign sent her book to no on the list "life is good i think as i watch the sun rise over lake champlain " she wrote of learning she was an online best seller amazon says little about how it calculates its rankings though scholars and publishers have attempted to reverse engineer the system to determine how a sales ranking translates into actual sales one major quirk used and new book sales are counted equally so an author anxious about his sales ranking could put a few dozen of his books for sale for a penny apiece and ask a friend to buy them all this all adds up to numbers that are ubiquitous closely watched and of dubious value the targeted marketing campaigns contribute volatility to sales ranking numbers that are inherently unstable outside the top or so of books few sell multiple copies a day so little separates books with rankings tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands apart morris rosenthal an author and publisher based in springfield mass who has studied the amazon charts says a day without a sale can send a book ranked to as low as on charteo us a free web site that tracks the ebb and flow of amazon rankings daily dozens of the books currently tracked rise or fall by or more each day online sales can be throttled quickly by national media mentions author appearances on "oprah " "larry king live" and " minutes" accounted for some of the most dramatic increases measured by charteo us in the past couple of months according to the publishers "we think of amazon as the instant gratification indicator for us " says ms ratzlaff publishers also say they look to amazon rankings as an indicator of future sales potential for authors along with rankings from nielsen bookscan the new york times the wall street journal and others that cut across retailers publishers can chart books rankings on sites such as charteo us and titlez the planning shop a publisher that developed titlez to track its own books plans to start charging for the service later this year hence sales pitches such as those from mr frishman to new authors eager to become best sellers if only for an hour and only on a single site "everyone wants to call themselves a best seller if they can " he says even if it means doing so by luring would be buyers with bonuses "its a made up number " mr frishman concedes of the bonus value theres little incentive for amazon and barnes &amp noble to discourage these campaigns because they drive sales representatives for both sites declined to comment on how they calculate their numbers and how others try to juice them critics of such programs say they muck up amazons recommendation system because some people buy the promoted books just for the bonuses not for reasons of taste and encourage new authors to obsess over volatile numbers and pay for marketing tools to boost them "these campaigns arent really effective they dont lead to sustained word of mouth or sales " says steve weber a writer and seller of used books on amazon "but new authors have no way of knowing what a scam this is " email me at numbersguy wsj com read daily commentary about
