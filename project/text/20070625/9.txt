behind amaranth a broken system senators find gaps in energy market oversight the cftcs uphill climb and the enron loophole a senate report contends that gaping holes in the regulatory oversight of energy markets allowed one large hedge fund to game natural gas futures prices in increasing risks for other participants and causing utilities to incur unnecessarily high costs last summer the report by the permanent subcommittee on investigations which calls the oversight system "broken " provides a birds eye view of trading at amaranth advisors llc which lost more than &# billion last year in the largest hedge fund failure in history a hearing on the findings is set for today it also highlights concern in washington that financial markets in energy and other sectors are outpacing regulators ability to keep up the commodity futures trading commission which regulates energy and other futures markets has an enforcement budget that is about th the size of its cousin the securities and exchange commission in addition a part of the energy market doesnt fall under the cftcs jurisdiction potentially making it more vulnerable to manipulation after amaranths collapse in september the senate subcommittee and federal regulators started examining what happened the hundreds of pages of data and analysis in the senate report show what many traders suspected but couldnt prove before amaranth went under the investment fund held as much as of all open bets on gas contracts at the new york mercantile exchange a unit of nymex holdings inc that is the worlds largest energy marketplace by virtue of its size amaranth had the power to influence market dynamics and the closing prices of some contracts the subcommittee said more important it contends amaranth built greater market dominance with bets on an over the counter energy trading venue the intercontinentalexchange inc that neither nymex nor federal futures regulators could see the report detailed massive purchases of contracts july on both nymex and the intercontinentalexchange or ice that day the spread or difference between gas for delivery in march and april rose sharply the move contributed to the collapse of another fund motherrock lp despite a heat wave that also affected prices the report alleges the "clearest explanation" for the "extreme magnitude" of the swing was amaranth a georgia electric utility has told the committee that during the spring and summer of it made trades to lock in prices for gas that ultimately cost it &# million this "resulted in higher natural gas bills for their customers " which it contends is a "premium" forced on them by amaranth and other speculators according to the report amaranth released a critique of the senate report by chicago economic consultancy lexecon inc saying the statistical analysis was "based on spurious correlations and incomplete data analyses" and failed to establish that amaranth was the cause of the big price moves amaranth also said it didnt "dominate" or "distort" natural gas trading that many economists reject the theory that speculators can control prices and its closure occurred without major repercussions in the broader markets sen carl levin the michigan democrat who heads the permanent subcommittee and sen dianne feinstein d calif are expected to cite the senate reports conclusions to bolster a pending bill to do away with the "enron loophole " that is a provision congress inserted into the commodity futures modernization act in at the urging of the former energy merchant to exempt electronic energy exchanges from most aspects of federal regulatory oversight while at the time the loophole benefited enron it has more recently aided the growth of ice an exchange popular in part because of the anonymity it offers traders ice wasnt required last year to routinely provide the cftc with data on traders positions as is the case with nymex ice began providing it to the cftc under a special order after amaranths collapse a bill sponsored by sens levin and feinstein among others would make that data sharing permanent any further scrutiny of ice also could impact the consolidation taking place among world financial exchanges ice and chicago mercantile exchange holdings inc are battling to take over the owner of the chicago board of trade cbot holdings inc both proposals mostly are stock based so any new rules or findings that hurt ices stock price would make the chicago mercs offer for cbot look relatively more attractive in front of a july shareholder vote the senate subcommittee said it wasnt accusing amaranth or anyone else of manipulating energy prices which requires showing that someone intended to create an artificial price and succeeded in doing so yet it said amaranth held a tight grip on some markets holding nearly of the open bets on nymex for gas for november delivery for example in february nymex has strict rules limiting how many contracts a trader can hold when they are close to expiration but it has no set position limits in contracts months or years away from closing out the subcommittees minority republican staff cautioned in a dissent that while they supported regulatory reforms they were less certain of some findings and that "at least at times amaranth was responding to the market rather than driving it " nymex said the report highlights "the advantages of working within a regulated marketplace " and it kept an orderly market during the period of amaranths trading the cftc said it will testify on the report july an ice spokeswoman said regulatory controls could push traders to less transparent markets for privately negotiated derivatives "where no reporting or antimanipulation obligations exist " amaranth is fighting an investor lawsuit and is the subject of unresolved regulatory probes including one at the cftc its founder and former chief energy trader are trying to start new hedge fund businesses the report also detailed the reluctance of amaranths biggest rival john arnold of houston hedge fund centaurus energy lp to bail out the fund when it was looking to unload quickly crashing contracts in september kara scannell contributed to
