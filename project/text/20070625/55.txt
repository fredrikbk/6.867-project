small business a special report profits on the side take a charity add a franchise outlet the result more money for the mission as executive director of washington vocational services lynn van vactor spends her days helping people with disabilities find jobs then every so often she really gets down to business twisting dough at the auntie annes pretzel franchise her nonprofit agency bought in in an outlet mall near seattle "i love to go in every once in a while roll up my sleeves and work next to these teenagers " says ms van vactor when it comes to making pretzels "im not very good " she admits but sales at the for profit shop are booming providing an additional &# in revenue last year to fund her agencys programs plus the pretzel shop routinely employs disabled students many of whom are making the transition from high school to work "its been a very good match " she says while charity and fast food may seem like an odd mix more nonprofit groups are looking at national franchises as a way to boost their income and support their mission profits from their franchise outlets go to the coffers of their nonprofit organizations the strategy part of an emerging sector dubbed "social franchising" has become increasingly palatable as competition heats up for government funding foundation grants and philanthropic donations experts say "social franchising is part of a larger and increasing phenomenon of earned income by nonprofits " says james e austin emeritus professor of business administration at harvard business school in boston who has studied the blending of nonprofit and commercial enterprises in the past nonprofits have ventured out on their own to run bookstores thrift shops day care facilities and even low income housing projects now nonprofits with limited business acumen are checking out the cookie cutter franchise model as a way to earn extra cash "it has the attraction from the nonprofits standpoint of providing infrastructure product administrative systems and a proven marketplace " mr austin says "its a risk reducer " thats what share our strength a charity based in washington d c that fights childhood hunger around the world hopes as it prepares to open its first winestyles shop by years end near dupont circle in washington the organization has long paired with restaurants to host taste of the nation events with top gourmet chefs to raise money for its cause at first share our strength planned similar fund raisers with winestyles inc a margate fla franchiser that claims to "demystify" wine shopping by organizing wine in its stores by color and taste instead of varietals and regions then billy shore executive director of share our strength realized his charitys donors and winestyles customers both had sophisticated tastes and in fact were likely the same people mr shore says he had long "wanted to create a nonprofit that was not always begging for money" and decided the wine business paired well with his nonprofits mission "this is a model we liked " he says executives at winestyles which has stores nationwide were at first skeptical about allowing a nonprofit agency to buy and operate one of their stores "this is not a gratis type of thing " says robert spuck chief executive of winestyles who went forward with the deal after making sure share our strength could handle the &# franchise fee and other costs associated with opening a store which typically are big shops up to square feet he also insisted that the charity hire a manager with retail experience to run the store "just like any other franchisee if they dont have the proper training and if they dont implement the system the way it was designed they wont be successful " he says "if you want to be one you have to act like one " in fact many franchisers are not keen to work with nonprofits chiefly because the nonprofit isnt your typical small business owner whose passion and financial commitment help ensure success says ben litalien president of social franchise ventures a washington d c consulting firm that promotes the social franchise concept the firm started in as an offshoot of share our strength is currently matching about nonprofit clients to franchises "its really not a nonprofits core mission to launch a business " mr litalien says share our strength for instance will always be more concerned about eradicating hunger than selling wine but a nonprofit can bring to the franchise system a "distinct competitive advantage " he says sometimes that advantage is a physical asset such as a facility where a franchise operation can be built but often its the nonprofits "sphere of influence " mr litalien says a deep knowledge of a community plus a stellar reputation that can be helpful when a franchise wants to open in a new market with their potential to complement each other "its amazing these two sectors have not found more interesting ways to engage than they have " he says ben &amp jerrys was one of the first franchisers to court nonprofit owners creating "partnershops" in which typically are operated by youth development and job training organizations ben &amp jerrys now a unit of the anglo dutch consumer goods company unilever plc waives its &# franchise fee and monthly royalties for select nonprofits which currently run of its ice cream shops "weve seen partner shops open and close through the years " says jennifer shewmake partnershop program manager for the south burlington vt company "what weve found is that the model is complex and meeting the demands of the double bottom line is a challenge " yet "financially for us its still a sensible business decision " she says one of the partnershops last year was listed as one of the companys top caterers while another won ben &amp jerrys "heck of a year" award for having a significant sales increase not every partnershop ends up being profitable but each fits well in ben &amp jerrys social mission a key part of the companys marketing strategy she says still because failure is always a real possibility nonprofits interested in running a shop need to show they are "committed to taking a risk in a venture like this " she says indeed running a franchise has been "a whole different ballgame for us " says judi bishop executive director of the ywca in forth worth texas which opened a ben &amp jerrys shop in and has yet to turn a profit the ywca which specializes in helping low income individuals find work started looking at for profit enterprises in as a way to earn extra income for its programs when it heard about partnershops and the focus on providing job skills to youths "it was a great opportunity for us to do our mission related work in a venue where we could generate income " she says still there have been growing pains that have forced the ywca to lower its financial expectations for starters the company lost &# in its first nine months of operation and then an additional &# in the next months but much like any small business owner ms bishop knows its too soon to give up "we know what its going to take to turn it around " she says "we are experiencing what the ben &amp jerrys franchisees are experiencing you just have to get out there and beat the bushes " ms debaise is an editor at smartmoney com she can be reached at cdebaise smartmoney com
