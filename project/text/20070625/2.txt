americas proof of life maybe the argentine electorate is not willing to march lock step off a cliff behind the authoritarian socialism of president nestor kirchner after all that possibility was raised yesterday when mauricio macri of the center right pro party appeared to be on course to defeat mr kirchners minister of education peronist daniel filmus in the buenos aires mayoral election runoff mr filmus was mr kirchners hand picked candidate and the president mobilized every advantage of his office in a country where transparency is nearly nonexistent to favor his man even so the peronist faltered as we went to press the final results werent in but exit polls suggested a strong macri victory pundits still expect either mr kirchner or his wife cristina fernandez to run in and win the october presidential election but the failure of the presidents proxy in the capital city ballotage yesterday suggests that his days of uncontested power are over argentine pluralism and democracy may be making a comeback and none too soon that portenos as denizens of the port city are known said "no mas" to mr kirchner yesterday is also a positive development for the cause of stability peace and growth throughout south america only a decade ago argentina had substantial geopolitical relevance so much so that the u s qualified it as "a major non nato ally " but since mr kirchner came to power in the countrys international profile has been reduced to banana republic status it has allied itself with the menacing president of venezuela hugo chavez supported the anti democratic agenda of bolivian president evo morales picked a nasty fight with its neighbor uruguay broken gas contracts with chile and invested enormous political capital in skewering foreign investors it is an understatement to say that mr kirchners argentina has not been good for the region while mr macri who also happens to be the president of argentinas championship soccer team the boca juniors is considered "center right " the city that just elected him cannot be classified as any such thing in it elected the hard left anibal ibarra who allied himself with the kirchner wing of the peronists this time the vote has gone the other way and its worth asking why some are blaming the kirchnerista loss on mr filmuss weak candidacy and the victory of the boca juniors last week at latin americas most prestigious soccer tournament yet there is no denying that anti kirchner sentiment also played a role with the president so actively involving himself in the campaign the election became as much a referendum on the national government as it was a mayoral race booming argentine growth ought to have put strong winds at mr filmuss back but locals have been reminded in recent weeks by natural gas shortages in a winter that has started off unusually cold that perhaps all is not right with mr kirchners economic model the government has had to ration gas supplies to industry and taxis in order to meet residential demand this is putting pressure on business petrochemical chemical and steel operations are all being affected reuters reported last week that three steel companies which asked not to be identified said layoffs were possible as a result of the energy shortages it would not be surprising if energy turns out to be only the canary in the coal mine of the argentine economy scarcities do not occur in market economies because as supply is constrained prices rise tempering demand consumers can then get all they want at the new price level more important higher prices stimulate new supply as producers have a greater incentive to invest and innovate to bring product to market and get paid since the end of the peronist economic agenda has rejected these simple laws of the market in favor of economic populism in december of that year the government reneged on its debt establishing an uncertain environment for capital that continues today in it further alienated investors by abrogating utilities contracts and imposing price controls these decisions were taken before mr kirchner assumed the presidency but his government has made things worse by broadening the scope of the price controls and pursuing an almost irrational vendetta against the private sector creditors and profits the kirchner legacy has also spread an anti property rights ideology throughout the country local legislatures in catamarca and corrientes provinces are now contemplating the seizure of ranch land owned by foreigners reinforcing the message that investing in argentina is a risky proposition the costs for this nonsense are now showing up consumers are hungry for a variety of artificially low priced products from gas to foodstuffs but supply is going in the opposite direction as investors are nowhere to be seen ergo shortages in the energy sector the problem is particularly acute barclays capital warned last week that "the inelasticity of supply in an industry whose output faces continued declining rates makes the lack of investment in exploration and production of oil and gas concerning " the countrys "unorthodox economic policy framework might be reaching its limits " the report said shortages are also showing up in milk and other dairy products still the economy is on track to grow by at least this year which suggests that yesterdays anti kirchner vote may have been driven by other issues too the list could include electoral disgust with a massive public works corruption scandal the firing of personnel who refused to "adjust" national inflation statistics financial investigations of government adversaries and double digit inflation the presidents penchant for alienating neighbors and his four year effort to revive the divisiveness of the dirty war have also invited much criticism from educated argentines whatever the cause the macri victory suggests cracks in a government machine that until now has handily steamrolled its opposition the outcome in buenos aires might even point to a nascent but profound shift in argentine politics
