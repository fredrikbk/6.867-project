eurolinks daily view russia banks on plane deal u s auto makers look to europe online edition recently russia has been questioned for staking a state claim on oil fields now the kremlin is taking to the sky at last weeks paris air show fighter jet maker sukhoi lined up foreign buyers for its superjet russias first new civilian airliner since the fall of the soviet union as andrew osborn reports the deal is more than a commercial coup its a test of the kremlin industrial policy that combines state ownership with foreign technology and investors in an attempt to revive heavy industry the policys success is critical to kremlin efforts to diversify its economy away from oil and gas besides aviation the shipbuilding nuclear military industrial and space technology sectors are all being reshaped according to the same recipe many of these industries were only partially privatized in the s but the firms struggled as stand alone companies now the government is consolidating these assets into large holding companies that officials say will improve efficiency and create global competitors the superjet is a key test of whether this aerospace giant can deliver modern products that have appeal beyond russias borders sukhoi has turned to a stable of foreign partners for technology and assistance on the project hoping their experience will help win over demanding foreign airlines and allay concerns about its inexperience in the civilian market in time uac hopes the superjet will spawn a family of planes that will help russia rebuild its share of the world aviation market so far though the kremlins enthusiasm for creating industrial giants isnt matched by a track record of building winners vladimir potanin a prominent russian industrialist last week surprised an investment conference by complaining that government interference in russian industry was undermining efficiency and last year the organization for economic cooperation and development said in a report that the russian state had a "poor" record as an owner of companies arguing that it tended to lead to lower efficiency corruption and slower growth read andrew osborns report http online wsj com article sb html miles per gallon model with global warming a concern for citizens and lawmakers alike car makers in the future will likely have to build fleets that average about miles per gallon what kinds of cars and trucks will gasoline guzzling americans drive to achieve that average the answer would seem to lie in europe where more than half of vehicles meet the magic average of mpg but there are aspects of the european model that for now make it less likely to work in the u s as mike spector reports for one thing cars in europe are more expensive and typically far less powerful than the vehicles americans have come to expect in the u s today about of cars and trucks sold sport six or eight cylinder engines in europe of vehicles sold have a four cylinder or smaller engine the upshot for u s consumers american showrooms could increasingly feature more small cars gasoline electric hybrids and diesels but it could also mean smaller engines and decreased performance in big trucks industry observers say while auto advertisements in the u s increasingly tout fuel efficiency consumers still appear to put a priority on size and power in a recent consumer reports survey said they plan to seek a more fuel efficient vehicle but only about half said they would sacrifice size or performance in that quest auto makers also contend stricter u s mileage rules will force them to build less safe vehicles the crux of the argument being that lighter vehicles fare worse in crashes the national academy of sciences in the u s says technology exists to improve fuel economy without sacrificing safety but notes that high costs could motivate car makers to downsize vehicles to meet higher fuel mileage targets read mike spectors report http online wsj com article sb html treading on thin rubber the list of problem products made in china keeps growing toothpaste pet food toys and now tires as timothy aeppel reports a fatal auto accident in pennsylvania highlights a major safety issue with thousands of imported tires a cargo van carrying four passengers allegedly experienced a tire tread separation the type of problem that sparked the big firestone recall of causing the driver to lose control and crash killing two passengers the tires u s distributor foreign tire sales inc of union n j says it discovered that a safety feature it had specifically asked the manufacturer to include was omitted from as many as of the tires imported from chinas hangzhou zhongce rubber co since fts has notified u s federal safety officials that a recall may be necessary and that it believes other u s distributors have been selling identical tires which could account for up to an additional half million tires unlike other potential recalls involving tire makers with a major presence in the u s this case involves a chinese manufacturer selling through u s distributors and raises questions about the effectiveness of u s safety regulations as they relate to such imports in this case fts is the "importer of record" for the tires which makes it responsible for making sure the tires meet u s requirements fts says the tires do still meet minimal u s safety requirements the distributor says it doesnt have the resources to pay for the recall itself and that it cant even clearly identify the specific tires because the chinese manufacturer has failed to provide fts with the identification numbers of the tires that were manufactured with the missing safety feature read the report by timothy aeppel http online wsj com article sb html china fires back it seems that chinese corporations cant catch a break when they arent being criticized for product safety issues or labor abuses theyre facing complaints on pollution as yee kai pin reports a recent dutch government commissioned report identified china as the worlds top producer of carbon dioxide emissions overtaking the u s for that dubious honor during two days of world economic forum talks in singapore china has been battling back against criticism from other countries "do not assume that your model for emissions standards is suitable for all countries " chinese aviation businessman chen feng told a wef panel discussion in remarks aimed at western critics mr chen the chairman of chinas hainan airlines co said environmental problems have their roots in industrialization in the west more than a century ago and chinese citizens are now paying the price for pollution caused by the iron and steel sectors one delegate suggested that the u s which remains the worlds largest per capita co emissions contributor as well as australia could be considered hypocrites in calling for reduced pollution as both refused to accept the kyoto protocol treaty on reducing greenhouse gas emissions beijing is a signatory to kyoto but as a developing country it is exempt from emissions reductions an anomaly often cited by washington and canberra for their not accepting the treaty some asian business leaders also accused rich countries of hypocrisy on another front saying they are taking advantage of cheap labor in developing countries and then blaming them for global warming read yee kai
