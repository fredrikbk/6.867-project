hard lesson mainstreaming trend tests classroom goals disabled children join peers strain teachers we need more help scranton pa when school started last august veteran first grade teacher patricia mcdermott made sure to place one student year old andrea gavern in a seat beside her own desk andrea suffers from a rare genetic condition called williams syndrome which causes learning disabilities and medical ailments such as heart problems and difficulty eating knowing that andrea had disrupted her kindergarten classes a year earlier ms mcdermott wanted to keep her new pupil under close watch the strategy backfired one morning andrea swept an arm along the teachers desk scattering framed photos of ms mcdermotts family across the classroom a glass frame shattered and another hit a student in the arm though no one was hurt ms mcdermott says she lost hours of instruction time getting the children to settle down after the disruption from the first weeks of school ms mcdermott found andreas plight heartbreaking "no no no " she remembers her student screaming at times "want mommy want mommy " "she looked at me like she was saying help me and i couldnt how could i possibly give andrea what she needs " years ago students like andrea would have been taught in separate classrooms today a national movement to "mainstream" special education students has integrated many of them into the general student body as a result regular teachers are instructing more children with severe disabilities often without extra training or support this year ms mcdermott counted students in her class at whittier elementary school five had disabilities including attention deficit disorder and delays in reading and math the teacher worried that she was failing all her students especially andrea "it used to be a joy to go to work " she says "now all i want to do is run away " in scranton and elsewhere the rush to mainstream disabled students is alienating teachers and driving some of the best from the profession it has become a little noticed but key factor behind teacher turnover which experts say largely accounts for a shortage of qualified teachers in the u s each year about of teachers quit their jobs either leaving the profession or moving to another school according to recent u s department of education surveys of those cite difficulties with mainstreaming special education students as a main reason for their dissatisfaction according to an analysis of the data by richard ingersoll a professor of education and sociology at the university of pennsylvania "its a red flag " prof ingersoll says "mainstreaming is putting pressure on teachers and the proponents of this reform are going to need to address it sooner or later " neil hunt a seventh grade math teacher in the fairfax county va public schools recently quit his job in part because of mainstreaming "i dont feel i can do whats necessary for these kids " says mr hunt a former navy lieutenant who plans to return to the service in a civilian job "and some of the kids behavior is such a distraction for the rest of the class that theyre losing a lot of time too " in arizona tom horne the states superintendent of schools says mainstreaming special education students with behavior problems can be "extremely destructive" to teachers morale and "a big factor in teachers leaving " also known as "inclusion " mainstreaming reverses a once common practice that congress determined was unjust the segregation of disabled children in settings without proper instruction many educators say children learn more through mainstreaming because they are taught by better qualified teachers and gain valuable social skills from their peers by about of special education students were taught in "fully inclusive" settings spending or more of the school day in a regular classroom up from in pennsylvania has been a major battleground in the national wars over special education litigation here helped lead to the federal legislation now known as the individuals with disabilities education act which requires a "free appropriate" public education for children with disabilities the law fostered mainstreaming by mandating that disabled children when possible be taught in the "least restrictive environment " despite its key role pennsylvania was slow to embrace inclusion until when the state and the public interest law center of philadelphia received court approval to settle a decade old class action case brought on behalf of special education students who demanded inclusion in regular classrooms districts that arent sufficiently inclusive risk losing funding but even some advocates of inclusion say it isnt working as they had hoped judith gran the plaintiffs lead attorney on the case says that some districts arent mainstreaming but "main dumping" packing classes with disabled children without adequate staffing "you hear a lot about it from teachers " she says "they are the ones on the front lines and they arent getting support " the scranton district has students of whom are in special education about half have learning disabilities such as dyslexia others struggle with problems that include intellectual impairment autism and emotional disorders until most of these students were set apart in about special education classes by last year the system had eliminated most of those classes which generally had students a special education teacher and an aide last year of students with disabilities in the scranton school district spent of their day or more in regular classrooms up from in the shift has sparked fierce opposition from the scranton chapter of the american federation of teachers which has long been critical of mainstreaming the issue is expected to be an important part of negotiations next year when the teachers contract expires in a recent union survey of scrantons teachers two thirds of those responding listed inclusion as their no or no complaint outranking all other concerns the survey didnt ask about pay and benefits "inclusion doesnt work unless class sizes are greatly reduced " wrote one teacher "children are suffering due to lack of support " wrote another "we need more help " added a third janet strelecki president of whittiers parent teacher association says she was inclined to favor inclusion because she runs a home for the developmentally disabled but when her own daughter miranda who has no special needs was placed in ms mcdermotts classroom last year ms strelecki changed her mind she says miranda often felt frustrated because she didnt get much attention from ms mcdermott whom she calls "a wonderful teacher " ms strelecki says as many as whittier parents have complained about inclusion "the general consensus is that it doesnt work having all these kids together " she says some however praise inclusion sarene omalley says her dyslexic daughter jessica felt "ashamed" when she was in a separate special education classroom educators say thats a common sentiment among children with learning disabilities through the inclusion program ms omalley says jessica who just graduated from scranton high school won new friends and confidence and plans to go to college next year "she never would have gone on this path" without inclusion ms omalley says michael sheridan scrantons school chief says he sees only "pockets of resistance" to inclusion for evidence that the policy is working mr sheridan cites the systems overall results last year standard &amp poors the bond rating agency listed scranton as one of only pennsylvania school systems that were "outperformers" in state tests of reading and math proficiency for each of the preceding four years mr sheridan says that president bushs no child left behind law requires that all students take the same state tests and be instructed by a teacher "highly qualified" in each subject in his view inclusion is the best way to meet the demands of both no child left behind and the federal disabilities law still many teachers complain that they lack training and support when scranton started the program three years ago teachers say they received about three days of training primarily in "differentiated instruction " which often entails breaking up classes into several groups and using different sets of materials for each administrators say principals often provided more training including sessions on autism and other disabilities special education instructors assist in regular classrooms and pull students out for extra help but there are few to go around scranton has specially trained instructors along with a support staff of speech and language experts psychologists and others together they must serve roughly special education students in schools under the teachers union contract the district is supposed to place no more than two disabled students in each classroom "where possible " but despite that wording principals often use their discretion to place more special education students in certain classes ann langan a ninth grade teacher at scranton high school teaches a basic science class this year she had children in one class of whom were in special education another of her classes had with disabilities jennifer zaleski a fifth grade teacher had students half of whom were in the special education program she says the iqs in her class range from to as far as understanding how to teach disabled children she says "how much knowledge did i have probably zip " last october the union filed a grievance with the school system alleging a violation at the high school of the teachers contract administrators told the union they would divide special education students more evenly this fall few have struggled more with inclusion than ms mcdermott who teaches at whittier elementary a century old red brick building perched on a hillside with views of downtown scrantons faded storefronts and factories ms mcdermott tries to maintain a bright welcoming classroom with shiny laminated paper apples hanging on strings from the ceiling a "birthday train" marking each childs big day with a cake and a candle and a picture of martin luther king jr by the door the daughter of a fireman and a scranton schools secretary ms mcdermott wanted to be a teacher since she was in kindergarten in she graduated from penn state with a degree in elementary education then worked as a substitute teacher until she won her own classroom a decade later "i ran to work " says ms mcdermott now years old "i couldnt wait to get there i loved being in charge of this world of learning " whittier which is housed in two buildings several blocks apart has only one special education teacher and two aides for the entire school leaving ms mcdermott largely on her own larry miner whittiers principal says he tends to concentrate special needs students in one classroom for each grade to make it easier to schedule services he acknowledges that ms mcdermott has an unusually large number but to handle those children he says he looks for the most capable instructors ms mcdermott "is a very gifted teacher " he says "she is very patient " from the start of this year ms mcdermotts biggest challenge was andrea along with williams syndrome andrea has sensory processing disorder also common among autistic children the first grader who gets nourishment from a feeding tube in her stomach hit other children screamed for hours pounded computer keyboards with her fists and tore up worksheets according to the teacher mr miner says the school system offered to have her attend one of the districts few separate classrooms for the severely disabled her parents philip and johanna gavern recall no such offer based on the report of a private psychologist they hired they believed that andrea could make academic progress in a mainstream classroom as long as she had a full time aide trained in special education they asked the school system for one but were refused mr miner maintains that the approach wouldnt have made "much difference " the schools special education aides he says have only high school diplomas and scant disability training andrea did get full time classroom assistance from a local mental health agency paid for by the state but that aide has no education training and was present only to help andrea stay focused and perform basic tasks andrea received hours of special services a week these included speech and language support and occupational therapy mostly in half hour or one hour pullout sessions according to andreas individualized education program or iep the legal document that outlines what the district must provide after school andreas family privately arranged for her to spend afternoons receiving a variety of physical music and social group therapies ms mcdermott has no expertise in handling williams syndrome or any of the other disorders she must manage each day so she improvised finding a number board with tiles that engaged andrea and with her own money buying kindergarten reading primers soon after the start of the school year ms mcdermott started keeping a journal recording her time with andrea to document what she considered an intolerable situation ms mcdermott wrote of andrea touching and hitting other students albeit gently with a kind of slapping motion that didnt pose any threat andrea also threw papers and tore up assignments her behavior could be unpredictable and unnerving "at story time andrea turned to children next to her on either side and was making forceful spitting sounds into their ears " she wrote in an entry for aug "i cant listen because of andrea " shaun hopkins a general education student said recently andrea who can be quick to smile and laugh and wears a neat part in her short blonde hair loves computers and at home enjoys listening on headphones to the lion king and other disney movies but even when happily ensconced on a terminal in the back of the classroom she could grow frustrated on sept she banged the keyboard with her fists took off her headset and threw it down on the keys her aide from the mental health agency took her out of the room on sept andrea who had been moaning quietly launched into a full throated scream which lasted from p m to p m according to a journal entry ms mcdermott didnt know why andreas aide moved her into the hall and then to a room in the basement though the class could still hear muffled cries the teacher says the school called her mother to take her home ms mcdermott says she still remembers ms gavern picking up her screaming child and carrying her legs dangling past other parents gathered for pickup ms mcdermott says she later learned that andrea was feeling pain from her feeding tube through december or january ms gavern says she would have to pull andrea out of school and take her home once or twice a week usually in the late morning ms gavern used to work as a property manager for the rental units she owns with her husband a real estate agent the couple had to hire others to do her job so she would be available to pick up andrea "i couldnt do anything because i was waiting by the phone " ms gavern says tensions grew between teacher and parent ms gavern says she became convinced that ms mcdermott didnt want andrea in her class and at a fall iep meeting expressed her concerns "i dont think she has the knowledge " ms gavern says of ms mcdermott "i dont think she has the support its not entirely her fault she was overwhelmed the school system was not there to back her up i blame them too " ms mcdermott says she agrees with that assessment adding that "the system was not set up for children like andrea " on may ms mcdermott planned an art project painting flower pots for mothers day "oh no oh no " andrea shouted stamping her feet and waving her arms before being led out of the room andrea had wanted to spend more time on the computer with the art assignment finished andrea dressed in an embroidered blouse a pressed khaki skirt and pink sneakers returned to her place in the back of the classroom where she sat next to her mental health aide the two worked on their own while the class did a reading lesson "do you know six minus three " her aide asked "no " andrea replied with the help of her attendant andrea copied the numbers and from a workbook "very nice " her aide said later andrea briefly rejoined the class andrea raised her hand volunteering to read a book out loud in front of the class "all fall down " andrea read clearly though from a book simpler than those of her classmates "good job " ms mcdermott told her despite such glimmers of hope the gaverns have given up on scranton this month due to their dissatisfaction with andreas school they sold their house and moved to nearby clarks summit the family had heard positive reports from other parents about the school system which may put andrea in a separate class for at least part of the day "it just hasnt worked out at all " says mr gavern surrounded by packing boxes "inclusion sounds great on paper but the scranton school system isnt prepared " with the school year just over ms mcdermott says she feels tremendous relief and the migraine headaches that once afflicted her almost weekly have disappeared but she is still struggling with her own future ms mcdermott has decided to stay through the end of next year her st as a teacher when she can quit with full health benefits and start a new career "its the end " ms mcdermott says "i dont have it in me any more i used to think id stay forever until they kicked me out its sad its too sad "
