the fdas mean devices what do you do when youre a small company in colorado a federal regulator is after you and its hard to get anyone in washington to answer your phone calls that was the question facing tmj implants whose disagreement with a division of the food and drug administration is due to be decided by agency administrative judge daniel davidson in the coming days the companys plight is an all too familiar tale of a government bureaucracys power to destroy anyone who challenges it tmj implants produces a single product line a series of jaw replacement devices that has been around for decades the fdas center for devices and radiological health regulates medical devices based on patient outcome data an inexact science and heres where the difficulty comes in according to the fda the company failed to file the proper paperwork to account for adverse events related to its products tmj ceo robert christensen disagreed with the divisions finding and followed the prescribed procedures he appealed the judgment through the fdas internal forum and waited for the case to be heard and waited and waited when he finally heard from the fda it was to inform him that the appeal would be rejected because the device division had just filed a &# "civil money penalties" against the company for the same issue that was waiting on appeal as it turns out while the company was waiting for judgment on its appeal the civil money penalties case was being developed in the fdas back room end running tmjs ability to challenge the complaint this amounts to a denial of due process that is explicitly written into law to make sure regulatory agencies dont become unaccountable dictators most of the time a bigger company in a similar situation would have settled the issue and chalked it up to a cost of doing business but for small businesses with a single product line and their reputation at stake conceding is not an option facing the possibility of financial ruin tmj continued to fight taking the case to the fdas administrative law judge for resolution theres a history here in utah medical which produces a range of ob gyn devices won a judgment in federal court after the fdas device division spent years pursuing the company over documentation errors unrelated to the quality or safety of their products though the fda never alleged the products were unsafe the allegations hung over the company putting it at competitive disadvantage and leaving it with millions of dollars in legal fees that decision was the fourth consecutive defeat for the fdas device bureaucrats in federal court but even so companies that have successfully fought the agency have often done so at the cost of their own survival according to fda review editor jim dickinson of the last three companies to fight the division one no longer exists another closed its u s operation and took its business overseas and the third was nearly forced into bankruptcy and now refuses to discuss the matter lest it recapture the fdas attention even after utah medical won in court the fda continued to publish discredited inspection reports on its web site further damaging the companys reputation all this highlights a widespread suspicion that the device division is operating largely unsupervised lack of management review seems to have contributed to abusive behavior decisions made by low level investigators are seldom challenged by fda higher ups even when those judgments have been met with well founded objections from the companies they target theres also the problem of the breadth of devices regulated by the division which have taxed the analytical abilities of its junior staffers the judge in the utah medical trial noted that the device units style of regulation has "the virtue of generality and the vice of imprecision " president bush and congress are always citing the importance of small business but small businesses are especially vulnerable when regulatory agencies go after them they have neither the means to fight back nor to draw attention to their complaints political accountability is part of the answer here thats why fda commissioners are appointed by the president and approved by congress in april republicans on the house energy and commerce committee asked the fda to provide more transparency for its process for reviewing appeals to warning letters but so far fda commissioner andrew von eschenbach has given no sign that hes paying attention small businesses like tmj need to know that they cant be ruined merely for exercising their right to challenge the fda bureaucracy
