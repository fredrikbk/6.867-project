small business a special report editors note about four years ago we devoted an entire small business report to franchising the basic premise franchising isnt as easy as it seems yes having a formula to follow may look simple but it took an enormous amount of work and brains to make a go of it owning a franchise wasnt something you could do in your spare time well maybe you can dont get us wrong franchisees have to work just as smart as ever to make a living maybe even smarter given all the competition out there these days but they may not always have to work quite as hard as wendy bounds and raymund flandez report in their cover story owners of some franchises can run a business in their spare time they can run it from home and they can even run it while holding down a full time job whats more some franchisers allow owners to get started with a lot less cash than before easy money the answer is the same as it was four years ago no way but easier work thats becoming a different story
