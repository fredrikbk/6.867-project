top brass try life in the trenches to promote understanding firms require executives to perform entry level jobs atlanta by a m one recent day carolyn kibler had been on her feet for nearly six hours shuttling among dialysis patients at a davita inc clinic here her lower back ached from the unaccustomed strain ms kibler is a vice president of the nations no dialysis treatment operator earning a comfortable six figure salary while overseeing other clinics for three days this spring however she helped treat seriously ill patients alongside technicians working up to hour days for an average of &# an hour "the job is definitely more physically demanding than i had imagined " the year old executive admits thats precisely the point according to davita chief executive kent j thiry who created the immersion program for his senior managers in "the experience changes their view of the world " he says "they are better leaders as a result " davita is among a growing number of big businesses including walt disney co continental airlines inc sysco corp and amazon com inc that require some of the top brass to walk in front line workers shoes the notion is not new but "is gaining in popularity " thanks to a new breed of hands on ceos keen to stay closely in touch with their troops and customers says edward lawler head of the center for effective organizations at the university of southern california an empathetic leader "gets better information about whats going on " he adds about officials of loews hotels must spend a day every year in an entry level job at one of its u s and canadian hotels they share impressions with employees in their temporary departments and solicit ideas for making those jobs easier one result installation of handle bars on room service carts so they are easier for waiters to push "its smart management" when bosses gain a ground level perspective on improving customer service observes jonathan tisch chief executive of the loews corp unit the program grew out of his appearance on the tv reality show "now whos boss " assuming roles such as bellman pool attendant and housekeeper at a florida hotel mr tisch sweat so much in his polyester uniform that he ordered the style and material altered but such programs can increase cynicism among the rank and file mr lawler cautions executives rare appearances in the trenches may suggest "these people really are out of touch " he says a close look at davitas reality immersion program shows how one company tries to ensure that newly sensitized managers retain leadership insights gleaned from the front line the el segundo calif concern requires managers to attend two days of classroom training before working in a clinic and surveys participants after their visits davita plans to expand the program to middle management this summer and is mulling an annual refresher program for executives like ms kibler the outgoing and talkative former nurse knew little about dialysis clinics before she joined davita last october dialysis takes the place of nonfunctioning or poorly functioning kidneys in flushing wastes from the body treatments typically last four hours many patients require three or more treatments per week ms kibler arrives at buckhead dialysis center for her first day of reality clinic experience just before a m outside it is still dark inside the brightly lit facility however technicians laila tanferno and daniel mainer have already been at work for an hour or more setting up dialysis machines each beige metal machine is the size of a three drawer file cabinet on wheels with flashing lights and blaring alarms two gray haired men have been waiting almost minutes the cheerful ms tanferno greets each with a hug before beginning dialysis for an elderly woman with an amputated leg she carefully arranges a blanket and tv set the way the patient likes "i see these patients more than i see my real family " ms tanferno says ms kibler quickly feels the stress of the job she must don a close fitting surgical gown and plastic face visor "its real hot " she says while wearing the protective gear she helps ms tanferno monitor patients blood pressure check other vital signs watch the machines water purity and complete paperwork technicians absorb occasional patient complaints lindsey pryor a year old retired teacher undergoing dialysis recently raised a fuss because staff meetings delayed completion of treatments clinic officials adjusted the meeting times "none of us wants to be here but it dialysis is keeping us alive " he says to ms kibler death too is part of the job dialysis patients typically suffer from multiple ailments and roughly die annually ten patients of the buckhead facility have died since january some during treatment in march a year old man whom ms tanferno treated on a friday unexpectedly died over the weekend from an inflamed pancreas "i cried for a whole week " she tells ms kibler after her hectic three day stint ms kibler describes the technicians as "some of the most empathetic caregivers i have ever seen " davitas prosperity depends on front line troops aiding patients "band aid by band aid piece of tape by piece of tape and alarm by alarm " she continues back in her office in another part of atlanta ms kibler tries to integrate the lessons from her clinic experience into her leadership of a roughly employee division "i am more conscious of the power of my words and my actions and the impact they have down in the organization " she says so ms kibler is more lenient when clinics fall behind on paperwork due to staffing shortages she praises a nurse who skipped a conference call to discuss a clinics quality report so she could fill in for an absent employee caring for patients "when something like that comes up i have a picture of the treatment floor everyone scurrying around and patients waiting in their chairs " ms kibler says "patient care comes first " at an evening staff meeting in another clinic on june she thanked workers for "the gift of life they had given to each patient they had touched that day " she also is trying to plan better so last minute deadlines dont distract clinic administrators and technicians on aug davita will change its procedures for drawing patients blood to prepare for the switch ms kibler set intermediate goals for her lieutenants "im forcing them to do it in small bites " she remarks the immersion experience prompts changes far from the clinic floor harlan cleaver davitas chief information officer felt terrified when dialysis machine alarms sounded during his clinic work even though a technician was nearby "i didnt have a clue what i was doing but i had the patients life in my hands " mr cleaver recollects after the program mr cleaver accelerated plans to extend the training period for new analysts on the companys computer help desk and lowered his expectations of productivity from such new hires before reality he notes "i never really realized how incompetent entry level people are when they start their jobs "
