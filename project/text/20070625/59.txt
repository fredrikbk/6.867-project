against her house to launch her own business a home care agency with a dozen employees the business took off right away quickly picking up patients six months later ms rumley learned she had breast cancer "i dont have time for this " she protested after her doctor told her she would need surgery followed by eight months of chemotherapy and radiation treatments fighting cancer meant she wouldnt be able to dedicate her usual hours a week to work ms rumley thus found herself in a dual struggle for survival one for her life and one for her business "when you start a business " she says "you really dont think you will die " the fate of a company may seem unimportant compared with battling a serious illness or disability or when a death occurs but when such calamities strike at the owners of a small business the repercussions can threaten the livelihoods of the owners and their families and those of their employees and partners and their families eight years after her diagnosis ms rumleys cancer is in remission and her oldest son just graduated from college her home care agency apex healthcare services inc springfield mass is thriving with about full time employees and revenue that ms rumley expects to reach about &# million this year a look at the experiences of ms rumley and other small business owners whove faced similar situations helps shine a light on what can be a perilous path whats clear is that when a small business is hit by a personal tragedy it could spell the end of that small business but it doesnt have to in particular one theme runs through much of the advice offered by small business experts business owners facing personal crises must be willing to delegate "those business owners who are entirely self sufficient and are not going to yield any amount of control are the most subject to disasters " says bob cockrell a family business adviser in st louis what follows then is help on how small business owners might best handle their businesses and themselves should misfortune arrive having a reliable second in command and a well structured organization is essential for ensuring smooth operations during an owners absence or disability or when a death occurs in the best scenario the person taking charge is someone already working for the company who has had test runs as captain often the responsibility falls to a family member though degrees of preparedness vary olga martinez founder president and chief executive of allright diversified inc a construction company in fresno calif working on government projects had long wanted to involve her family in the business but they werent very interested she says finally she added her younger brother to her business checking account and established him as an officer of her company six months later she suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm during her nearly yearlong illness and recovery ms martinezs brother took over most financial duties of the business "he literally took over my purse " says ms martinez who adds that it was difficult for her to yield that control but she was glad she did in choosing a successor its important for owners to not only groom them for the job but to make their choice widely known julie smolyansky took over as chief executive of lifeway foods inc a dairy company in morton grove ill after her father passed away from a heart attack in although there was no formal succession plan her father had told his business partners and staff that his daughter was next in line she also had been director of sales and marketing which gave opportunities to demonstrate her abilities "my father made it easy for me " ms smolyansky says often there is no family member ready or willing to assume the leadership of a business family connections though are less important than knowing how the company runs for ms rumley and her home care company two staff members a coordinator and a nurse stepped up to take on the temporary leadership it helped that the business was straightforward and that all of her employees knew their jobs well ms rumley says in other cases it can be necessary to hire a turnaround or crisis specialist such experts can be consultants retired or unemployed executives or someone from a turnaround firm these firms generally charge hourly rates of &# and up says mr cockrell the small business adviser the association of certified turnaround professionals a chicago based certification organization has a web site www actp org featuring a database of specialists that is searchable by industry and state retired executives can cost &# to &# a month and more some ask for a salary above that of the absent chief while a small business may consider these tactics to be expensive says mr cockrell they may be cheaper than closing the business outright whoever takes charge can expect a rocky start along with a possibly significant drop in revenue its a good idea for small businesses to have a portion of capital in an emergency reserve fund several forms of insurance and a detailed list of instructions covering key duties in the owners absence many advisers recommend doing annual contingency planning for a key persons absence they say owners should consider establishing an advisory board made up of the companys accountant and attorney family members or friends who would know what to do in case of an emergency alliances can be set up with peers and partners to try to stem losses from disruptions in business ms martinez for example had agreements with other contractors who temporarily took on some of her customers mr cockrell too says that when he had his own accounting firm he and the heads of a few other firms had a mutual support agreement that if one of them should be disabled the others would temporarily help with customer needs and projects in progress philip london senior tax partner with the accounting firm freeman &amp davis llc in new york advises his small business clients to ensure there is a continuation plan in place when two partners run a business its common to set up a buy sell agreement insured by a life insurance or a disability policy mr london says for example each partner holds a life insurance policy on the other the surviving partner then uses the insurance payout to buy the stock of the deceased partner from his or her family that sort of situation is used when the owners dont plan to pass the business to other family members less common is so called key man life insurance in which the business is the beneficiary of the policy only about of businesses with fewer than employees have key man life insurance on their chief executives a study by hay group found other types of insurance however are essential especially good medical and disability insurance disability insurance can cover a businesss overhead expenses or some lost income says paul stawinski managing director at the new york financial advisory firm price raffel &amp browne inc its important to note that disability policies will cover only about of income says mr stawinksi who also recommends making sure that the policy covers partial disability insurance policies should be re evaluated and revised as the business grows he adds some owners trying to cope with tragic circumstances find that staying involved with the business can help when troy dunn discovered that his year old daughter had cancer he handed the day to day operation of his marketing agency dunndeal consultancy llc in fort myers fla to his mother she had already been working at the company but mr dunn told his staff that while his schedule would be inconsistent he wouldnt be invisible and shouldnt be treated like he was although he had to skip conference calls for example he made sure to quickly and effectively make his opinions known after seeing minutes from company meetings mr dunn spent many days incommunicado at his daughters bedside while she was undergoing chemotherapy he would turn his blackberry off during those times afterward he would see messages about matters he once would have considered crises but scrolling down he would often discover that those crises had been resolved by his staff or had disappeared on their own the year that his daughter was ill mr dunn says was actually the most productive so far in his career a time in which he wrote a book and secured a television deal if he hadnt made some commitments like signing the book contract before his daughters diagnosis he says he probably would have put them off but having to focus on them helped during the most difficult times his daughters cancer is in remission now and she has returned to school and playing sports ms rumley for her part says that despite the difficulties it caused her at the time having the business was her saving grace at a particular low point during her chemotherapy she says she sat on the couch in her house and cried to her father that she couldnt manage everything that was going on in her life but the next day she decided she couldnt sit on the couch and cry anymore and would start going back to the office working only half days at first she also hired a woman from her own agency to help her with housework as she was recovering one of the most difficult of the many balancing acts required is deciding where to draw ones line of privacy and what to share with employees and clients mr dunn asked his mother to be the spokesperson for the family and to keep everyone updated he didnt want every phone conversation with employees or clients to start with questions about his daughter he says "we had to keep the sad people at arms length " since soon the crisis wasnt new to him but was new to someone in his extended network every day for months he felt drained talking to people about it every day he says ms rumley called each of her staff individually to break the news of her diagnosis and to assure them that the business would go on telling clients is another matter mr cockrell says the amount of information to be shared should depend on how much clients are affected by an owners absence if a partner at an accounting firm is ill and his colleagues take on the burden and spread the work managing to deliver projects on time then the client doesnt necessarily have to know he says but in many other cases an owners absence may delay deadlines and reduce oversight mr cockrell says in which case its only fair to tell the client at one point ms rumleys father was so concerned for her health and energy that he called the coordinator who was in charge of her business and told her to begin shutting the company down ms rumley reversed her fathers decision after she learned about it and had to talk to her coordinator through tears to assure her that indeed the business would keep running things were bad she says and everyone thought it was all over "but i didnt think so " in the years that followed ms rumley says her father who has since passed away was proud of her keeping the company going and enjoyed hearing stories about her business "he was thrilled " she says "he knew it was a good decision "
