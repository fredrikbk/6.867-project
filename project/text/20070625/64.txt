that pittsburgh attitude is something to enjoy the lack of style in pittsburgh was my second observation upon entering the city the first being the ridiculously affordable cigarettes and beer i complained i judged and i became hopeful when a trader joes found its way here but after reading "cracking the dress code in l a new york" personal journal june and stepping out to lunch i realize that pittsburgh is like the kindergarten teacher you can still remember she loves the child clad in oilily just as much as the route babe in pittsburgh its not about the chanel suit as you walk into a new office for a meeting but what you thought of the steelers game last night how your primanti brothers sandwich was or how your family is doing what i once viewed as a naive and old fashioned attitude i now truly admire i only hope that when i return to the big apple ill be able to bring some of the pittsburgh dogma back with me erin goldberger pittsburgh
