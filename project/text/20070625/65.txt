the afternoon report existential angst online edition grim housing data have become about as routine as the sunrise but the latest disappointing report on existing home sales distinguished itself by also revealing a huge build up in the number of homes lingering on the market the national association of realtors said existing home sales skidded by during may to a million annual pace the lowest level in almost four years given the long downdraft in the housing market gruesome data from the sector have been piling up like sheets of plywood at a construction site and the fall in the headline reading on todays report was generally within expectations and even tame by recent standards but economists said what stood out this time were worrisome readings on prices and supply according to the trade group the national median price for an existing home was &# lower by compared to the same time a year ago given the falloff in demand lower prices should be no surprise but the prices decline has proven long and deep steven wood of consulting service insight economics wrote in a note that may marked the th consecutive month in which median prices declined in annual terms "the longest period since data collection began in " and critically the prolonged descent in prices doesnt yet seem to be wooing bargain hunters prices are poised to come under even greater pressure over the months to come thats because the inventory of homes on the market is continuing to surge in may it advanced to a level that would take nearly nine months to work off at the current pace of sales economists were nearly universal in their assessment that the swollen backlog of homes was a sign of continued danger just a year ago inventories were running at slightly more than a six months supply while two years ago inventories were less than half of current levels joshua shapiro chief u s economist at mfr inc spotted the huge increase in inventories coming he reasoned that homeowners who kept their properties off the market during the winter in hopes of fetching a higher price come the spring selling season put up for sale signs in droves last month he noted that the stockpile of homes for sale had been as lean as months in january inventories could be winnowed down as sellers realize the crush of competition that they are facing in the market and pull their listings back others could slash their asking prices putting further downward pressure on prices overall all that means that the housing market remains some distance from its nadir if buyers pull their existing homes off the market that means they themselves are unlikely to relocate anytime soon drying up one possible fount of demand the tightening of lending standards after the subprime mortgage fiasco also appears likely to restrain demand and thats trouble not just for homeowners seeking to sell but also for builders who could be forced to take even greater steps to rein in still enormous inventories "construction will continue to shrink until much of the inventory overhang is eliminated " mr wood of insight economics said the commerce department will unleash the latest findings on new homes sales tomorrow morning and builders including lennar and kb home are scheduled to report earnings this week observers dont think any of those reports will deliver much cause for optimism "demand is soft prices are weak and the prospects of a turnaround anytime soon are slim " said economist joel l naroff despite housing news stocks climb the big inventory increase in the housing market didnt seem to
