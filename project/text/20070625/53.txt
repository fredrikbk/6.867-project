small business a special report flying solo with a net for those who want the rush of entrepreneurship without all the risks theres a middle ground you dont need your own company to be in business for yourself managers contractors professionals and equity partners all have found a middle ground between independence and becoming part of a corporate machine many run a small business within a larger organization a role that gives them such benefits as a more flexible schedule the autonomy to make important decisions and more pay running a business within a business has its risks you can lose money and be branded a failure as a manager the risks come too without the satisfaction of being able to make important strategic or marketing decisions taking the middle road though can have special appeal for employees who have an entrepreneurial spirit but arent ready to fly solo options range from becoming an equity partner in a law or accounting firm to working for a restaurant chain that gives managers some autonomy and a share of the profits to opening a store thats part of a purchasing cooperative finding the best fit depends on ones motivations and goals someone whos primarily looking for freedom may be happiest as an independent contractor at an established firm while someone whos mostly looking for a boost in income may be happiest as a partner in a big organization at new york based deloitte &amp touche usa llp an accounting consulting and financial advisory firm some equity partners and principals buy units of the organization part of the global group deloitte touche tohmatsu the partners and principals then share a proportional amount of the u s entitys annual profit chief people officer paul parker says partners can be like little kings within an organization theyre responsible for hiring and grooming the people in their unit but also for leadership bringing in new clients and creating new services and theyre spared the grunt work partners arent paying the bills each month or sifting through the companys options for health benefits still an accountant or lawyer can work for years without ever being offered a partnership mr parker says a new college graduate can make partner at deloitte in to years but spaces are limited and much depends on other people seeing their talent and boosting them to the top of the employees at deloitte only about are equity partners some chains allow managers to take a stake in the company by selling them a piece of the restaurant they manage or by giving them ownership units in the parent such options became more visible after some big names such as outback steakhouse a unit of osi restaurant partners in tampa fla and cheesecake factory inc in calabasas hills calif started giving managers a shot at ownership yard house usa which has restaurants in seven states primarily in southern california gives its general managers units in the company which vest over four years the units are valued by outside experts based on the companys overall sales assets and other factors and today they are worth about &# each according to harald herrmann president and chief operating officer they are the managers to keep or sell but yard house based in irvine calif has first refusal rights the general managers have responsibilities like picking vendors setting procedures and deciding staff matters currently there are only general managers one for each existing restaurant of the chain which has hourly workers and even general managers are still essentially employees mr herrmann notes that the general manager is "the single most important person in the restaurant " but not the ultimate arbiter of how the restaurant is run the strictures of working within a larger organization can limit your upside potential says andrew zacharakis an entrepreneurship professor at babson college in babson park mass managers serving a larger entity for instance may not be able to tailor their branches to local tastes even when they know its the right move consequently they can miss out on some profits but zur shapira an entrepreneurship and management professor at new york universitys stern school of business notes that some people are happy to overlook possible limits on success in return for the safety of working for a larger entity "people are more concerned about losses than they are about gains " mr shapira says "if youre an entrepreneur you can lose a lot of money " a step toward independence may be working as a contractor in an established service business consider the real estate world where agents typically have autonomy and where pay is based on performance independent contractors who represent the bulk of the industry may rent their office space and keep a larger portion of their commissions than directly employed salespeople and have more freedom than employees too re max agent cora parker chose this route in july when she became an independent contractor in the re max top achievers office in hainesport n j the office comprises some two dozen contractors who like ms parker work completely on commission while paying rent for their office space ms parker pays about &# a month plus of her commissions for her office for use of re max support staff and for the cachet of the re max name she negotiates her own commissions with clients and markets her services as she pleases right now as an agent who focuses on seniors and families with special needs some hairstylists work this way too as do a number of other professionals although its easiest to get started as an independent contractor at a company that has already embraced this format experts say talented employees especially in tight job markets may be able to negotiate a similar setup with the boss do your homework first the internal revenue service has strict rules about who qualifies as an independent contractor the irs prefers to classify workers as employees rather than independent contractors because employees generate more tax revenue so research federal and state laws and outline a clear plan for staying independent if you declare yourself an independent contractor and the irs or another government agency later classifies you as an employee you could lose out on some deductions and your employer could be on the hook for back taxes and fines when you make your pitch to the boss focus on the benefit to the company as an independent contractor youll be paying for your own supplies training and benefits youll also pay your own taxes so the company wont have to worry about withholdings agreeing to pay rent is a selling point too it creates revenue for the company and saves money other options though they may require more capital are to join a cooperative as an independent retailer or to buy a franchise that gives its operators lots of latitude in purchasing cooperatives companies band together to get bulk rates on raw materials finished goods or services members jointly own the co op so they help set policies and qualify for a yearly earnings distribution or refund art jaeger a spokesman for the national cooperative business association in washington d c estimates there are roughly purchasing co ops in the u s which together represent tens of thousands of member businesses the cooperatives can be nationally branded like ace hardware corp based in oak brook ill or regionally like wakefern food corp and its shoprite grocery stores based in elizabeth n j alternatively a co op can allow members to make their own decisions about branding like yaya bike co op based in chandler ariz yaya bike retailers are independent and name their stores anything they want but the proprietor has the buying power of a national organization and gets marketing and industry information that may be hard to find as an individual a franchise company that gives franchisees lots of latitude may provide similar benefits rick grove owns three little gym franchises in the new york area little gyms part of little gym international inc scottsdale ariz are designed to enhance childrens motor skills mr grove has the advantage of national branding and uses established lesson plans plus he has leeway when making operational decisions hes chosen polo shirts for employees for instance while other colleagues put workers in t shirts and he offers dancing at only two of his locations while some franchisees offer it at every site mr grove says hes happy with his choice partly because he took the time to figure out what he wanted from work and to determine how he would best meet those goals thats what prof shapira recommends too "you want things to come out of what you think and what you want " he says "not be a pawn played by other people " ms badal is a staff
