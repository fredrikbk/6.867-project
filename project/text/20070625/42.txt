politics &amp economics eu may lift trade rank of china for concessions brussels in the struggle to manage its rising tide of chinese imports the european union is considering a subtle but important shift in its approach to beijing the eu strategy which people familiar with the matter say is still under discussion would be to offer china recognition as a "market economy" in the hope of extracting a range of concessions the europeans deem crucial to balancing the trade relationship while the shift would largely be a technical matter it is a priority for chinese trade officials and does offer practical gains beijing would find it easier to defend against persistent european complaints that chinese goods compete unfairly with local manufacturers in trade jargon a country achieves market economy status when it limits state aid bans monopolies and fulfills other criteria only of the world trade organizations members give china full market economy status the u s and the eu by far chinas biggest trade partners are among those that dont the u s isnt planning to change its policy and in fact has recently pursued a more aggressive approach against chinese imports than the eu imposing extra duties and filing two suits at the wto when china joined the wto in it agreed to a year delay before being granted market economy status so no matter what the wtos other members must offer the label by the eus thinking according to people familiar with the matter is to use the designation as a bargaining chip while it still has value to help coax beijing to stem the proliferation of pirated goods and to offer greater market access to european companies especially in the services sector there are also eu officials who believe china has made legitimate progress they add china has been lobbying for market economy status for some time "if out of fortune companies do business in china its because were a market economy " chinese commerce minister bo xilai told reporters in brussels recently countries labeled as having nonmarket economies are generally more vulnerable to punitive import tariffs on their goods that is because the designation forces trade investigators to assume companies in places such as china or cuba receive some level of state support to research complaints therefore investigators use a surrogate "market economy" to determine what costs really should be and calculate whether goods are being unfairly underpriced on world markets a practice known as dumping critics say that method is arbitrary time consuming and wildly imperfect in chinas case for example eu and u s trade officials often use costs in turkey or india as a proxy for those in china though domestic prices in those countries tend to be higher than chinas that makes it easier for u s and european companies to level dumping charges countries with heavy manufacturing sectors such as spain france and italy are eager to preserve this leverage they recently lashed out at a report by the office of eu trade commissioner peter mandelson that said china had made considerable progress toward earning market economy status other countries support mr mandelsons trade agenda arguing the benefits of low cost chinese goods outweigh the damage they do to european manufacturers to be sure the nation eu would retain its ability to impose punitive tariffs on goods that it finds compete unfairly with those of european companies to address the concerns of european manufacturers eu trade officials hope to streamline the way they investigate complaints say eu officials and trade lawyers instead of using complex mathematical formulas to figure out whether chinese goods are being underpriced the eu would address the question of whether a product is made with chinese state subsidies critics say that wont be easy and it raises the question of how one defines a subsidy the eus revised approach could emerge soon in a looming battle over steel chinas construction boom has increased steelmaking across the country but chinas mills recently started pumping out more steel than it can consume pushing producers to look for new customers overseas the international iron and steel institute says chinese steel exports will reach million metric tons this year up from million metric tons in the eu has been the biggest buyer of this excess although mr mandelson has threatened retaliation so far european steelmakers have been sheltered by high prices and export duties beijing imposed in may to reduce exports but if prices fall as they are expected to before the end of the year mr mandelson will face another dilemma over the best way to protect european steelmakers any probe is now more likely to take the market economy approach that is focus on whether china subsidizes its steel sector rather than on whether steel is being sold below its domestic price people familiar with the matter say andrew batson in beijing contributed to this article
