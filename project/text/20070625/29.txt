in a sea of optimism why some forecasters warn of recession talk to just about any economic forecaster on wall street and youll probably get a relatively upbeat assessment of u s economic outlook theyll tell you that business investment and manufacturing output are bouncing back and that housing might be less of a drag on growth trends that suggest the worst of the slowdown is behind us but outside the mainstream and in most cases far away from wall street a small but vocal group of pessimists says the consensus view is wrong and that the economy is getting weaker so weak that it could actually be in a recession right now "were falling off a cliff " said james f smith chief economist at parsec financial advisors in asheville n c mr smith predicts that the u s s inflation adjusted gross domestic product the widest measure of economic activity contracted at an annual rate of in the soon to end second quarter and will shrink in the third quarter before rebounding to nearly growth in the fourth quarter that puts mr smith well below the consensus of economic forecasters for most of the year the consensus is for growth of just more than in the second quarter and between and for the remainder of mr smiths forecasts have thrice ranked him at the top of the wall street journals list of most accurate economic forecasters but other times he has landed near the bottom his success and failure is partly a reflection of his willingness to go out on a limb a position he shares with two other worriers charles dumas an economist at lombard street research in london who believes u s growth is so weak that the federal reserve will probably cut interest rates later this year and tracy herrick chief economist at the private bank of the peninsula in palo alto calif there are some common themes behind these bearish forecasts including the inverted yield curve an unusual occurrence in which short term interest rates are higher than long term rates an inverted yield curve is often considered a harbinger of trouble for the economy although the yield curve between three month treasury bills and year treasury notes returned to a more normal state a few weeks ago after being inverted for nearly a year the pessimists say the inversion is meaningful according to mr smith each of the past times the yield curve was inverted for four months or longer there were subsequent recessions "its a perfect indicator " he said contributing to his view that the u s economy likely slipped into recession "sometime in mid may " mr smith doesnt rely on the yield curve alone he also collects anecdotal evidence from "real people " like business managers analysts and workers at companies all over the u s he said that before he updates his monthly forecasts he speaks with nearly people "the steel experts and the shipping experts and the truck experts and the agricultural experts you name it " he said right now he says the real people are telling him that business is slowing "demand has gone down for railroad trucking and air freight all three all housing companies are down packaging demand is down nobody knows why you cant buy more if youre not selling more boxes " on the other end of the forecasting spectrum youll find morgan stanley economists richard berner and david greenlaw theyre forecasting second quarter gdp growth of mostly a bounce back from unexpectedly slow first quarter growth of just the morgan stanley economists dont believe the economy is booming but they do believe the economy is poised for moderate growth through the end of the year as manufacturing output government spending and business investment pick up lombard street researchs mr dumas whose company closely tracks the u s economy says forecasts such as morgan stanleys are "based on pure fantasies " he doesnt see any evidence that corporate spending is accelerating or that manufacturing at least among smaller companies is revving up his gdp forecast calls for tepid growth between to in each quarter from now through but he also says recession is a possibility mr herrick at the private bank of the peninsula estimates the economy expanded at an annualized rate of just in the second quarter less than in the first quarter while he expects growth to pick up in the third quarter his growth estimate still falls well below the consensus
