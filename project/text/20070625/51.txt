skills deficit so congress doesnt want to make the mistake of passing immigration reform that actually encourages people to enter the country illegally but does that mean we have to live without the engineers scientists and other highly educated and professional workers needed to keep our lead in high technology judging by the debate in the senate the answer is yes thats too bad one reason this country leads the world in technology is that our companies and research organizations are able to bring in foreign workers using h b visas a visa category set aside for professionals or the highly educated engineers for example in silicon valley use these visas to work in this country while they navigate a maze of immigration laws to get a green card a process that can often take years and technology companies need foreign workers because were simply not graduating enough of them to fill all the jobs being created in january dean annalee saxenian of u c berkeleys department of information co authored a study of california start up companies she reported that nationwide were founded by immigrant entrepreneurs she estimates of start ups in california and more than in silicon valley have at least one immigrant cofounder these firms produced sales of &# billion and created jobs in direct employment alone although ms saxenian did not pull out this detail its true that many of these entrepreneurs at some time used an h b visa to legally work in this country and we can be glad they did the impact of start up technology companies is felt throughout the economy in addition to creating products from lifesaving medical devices to entertainment start ups hire real estate agents to lease offices lawyers to write contracts accountants to file tax returns janitors to clean and large numbers of employees employees and contractors in turn buy homes invest in stocks pay college tuition and yes even purchase this newspaper so do the workers employed by the companys vendors and suppliers it would take an economist and a computer running software at least partly developed by an h b visa holder to calculate the full economic benefit until there were no limits on the number of h b visas once as high as congress now allows just annually plus for u s advanced degree graduates college professors and professionals sponsored by universities and certain research institutions are exempt from visa requirements because demand for the visas far exceeds supply the application process has turned into a grab fest in april on the first day to file h b visas for employees to start in october over applications were received the government had to hold a lottery graduate visa numbers were gone in a month steve ballmer microsofts ceo and other technology executives pled with congress for more h b visas mr ballmer told the senate that microsoft alone has unfilled technology jobs instead of more visas sen bernie sanders a vermont socialist convinced his fellow senators to approve new barriers for hiring h b workers his proposal would limit the number of h b visas to the same level that were handed out in when it was already insufficient after one year homeland security would be able to approve more visas but it would be at the discretion of dhs whether to do so the senate also slapped a &# "training and scholarship fee " aka tax on each visa thats on top of other government fees of about &# and for rush orders a &# processing fee other proposed changes would eliminate the ability to combine education and experience to meet h b standards so a ceo like bill gates there are others who did not graduate from college would no longer qualify for an h b visa ridiculous study the history and youll see that back in the ins lost a federal court case on this very issue that was brought by a ceo of a california start up with employees go back a bit further to the nations first technological superhighway the transcontinental railroad and youll see weve cut off necessary workers before the railroads were built to a large extent by chinese laborers after the union pacific and the central pacific railroads connected their tracks in what did we do we passed the first of many chinese exclusion acts today were repeating the same mistake this time with workers essential to maintaining our information superhighway this infrastructure is up and running and what are we talking about doing limiting our access to those who help us grow our technology based economy we need these workers to create new solar technology develop new medicines and otherwise enrich our lives the h b visa has been studied by the immigration service and independent groups and little abuse has been found levying huge taxes to discourage applicants and barring needed workers would turn the clock back to a time when cutting edge technology was the steam engine ms frye is a former president of the american immigration lawyers association mr lawler is author of "professionals a matter of degree" th ed the american immigration lawyers association see related letter "letters to the editor no shortage of engineers despite claims to contrary" wsj july
