changing trajectory french firm vaults ahead in civilian rocket market arianespace cut costs to beat u s rivals trying to sign nasa kourou french guiana using an isolated launch site in this remote french outpost a suburban paris based rocket operator has managed to gain new international clout along with some unlikely u s fans when the company closely held arianespace blasted a pair of commercial satellites into orbit last month the list of dignitaries watching the launch included michael griffin administrator of the u s national aeronautics and space administration mr griffin had good reason to check out the companys massive ariane rocket nasa plans to retire its aging space shuttle fleet in but if the agency stumbles in developing its own replacement it could end up using the european rocket to ferry cargo and perhaps u s crews to the international space station following the ariane s liftoff from this equatorial rain forest creating a bone jarring rumble and massive plume that illuminated treetops like a silver canopy mr griffin declared the launch system "probably the best in the world very smooth and very impressive " the fact that nasa is even mulling a french rocket provider as a possible backup is a telling sign that the balance of power in civilian space has shifted with the new leader no longer an american company arianespace created during the cold war to guarantee independent access to space for european governments and businesses has powered past space kings boeing co and lockheed martin corp to become the dominant commercial force when it comes to placing spacecraft into orbit after decades of struggles arianespace managed to outmaneuver the incumbents with innovative engineering cutthroat pricing and moves that parlayed the financial clout of the european union to beat out u s rivals in launching private satellites the star of its show is the story tall ariane which uses a new "dual launch" technology to simultaneously propel two pickup truck size spacecraft into orbit miles above earth arianespaces u s competitors scoffed at the idea until the company demonstrated its reliable and unique ability to launch various satellites in tandem now commercial satellite operators are rushing to sign up as customers today the company is profitable and has the heftiest order book in the industry with a global mix of blue chip customers it controls well over of the growing &# billion annual world market for launching satellites for communications earth imaging scientific research and other civilian activities thats double its share a few years ago it now has its sights set on a burgeoning new area manned space flight the biggest slice of space pentagon rockets and u s military and intelligence satellites and other hardware is worth an estimated &# billion a year but is out of reach because of arianespaces foreign ownership the companys rise is also notable because it overcame a disastrous launch failure involving the inaugural flight of the current version of the ariane an incident that nearly destroyed the company it was also a catalyst for a strategic shift making arianespace operate more like an airline that outsources many more functions than a traditional rocket manufacturer arianespace is owned by a collection of companies and governmental entities scattered across european countries its rise has been led by jean yves le gall its year old chairman and chief executive reserved and cerebral mr le gall inherited the "super rocket" project when he was recruited from another rocket venture to be arianespaces chief operating officer in the summer of industry critics howled that coordinating delivery of a pair of satellites to kourou not to mention ensuring their readiness for launch at the same instant presented logistical and quality control nightmares promoted to chief executive in august as part of a wider executive suite shakeup mr le gall remained an unabashed champion of the dual launch concept the recent talks between top arianespace and nasa officials were amicable and general with no decisions made about future u s access to the ariane the kremlin has hinted at forging a closer partnership with europe on manned space efforts while suitors from other countries also are flocking to kourou european taxpayers are already footing most of the construction bill for new modular launch pads capable of handling new russian rockets and eventually all types of missions from kourou those range from launching commercial satellites to planetary probes to journeys possibly taking astronauts to the international space station the moon and even beyond "with all the russians french and americans maneuvering for influence its practically a united nations in the jungle " says richard laurie program manager for an intelsat ltd satellite aboard the may launch that was hardly the case during the s when cold war wrangling spilled outside the earths atmosphere and into space prompting european nations to seek their own home grown launch capacity more than four dozen european manufacturers banks and research entities joined forces and by the mid s several early versions of ariane rockets had been declared operational the european space agency europes equivalent of nasa left commercial initiatives to arianespace but it put its french counterpart known as cnes in charge of technical details meanwhile mr le gall was rising through the french government bureaucracy he served as an adviser to the minister in charge of space activities later he was named deputy managing director of cnes which allowed him to begin forging important relationships with russias rocket masters in he was appointed chairman and chief executive of starsem a european russian joint venture to market that countrys soyuz rockets to the west "starsem clearly was the key to obtaining later russian cooperation " says jan marie luton a mentor of mr le gall who preceded him as head of arianespace a shy engineer frustrated by chitchat who is a passionate fan of american rock n roll he is renowned for workaholic habits mr le gall once implored colleagues to make appointments for him in the u s simply to escape the doldrums of august holidays in france in a software fault on the first ariane resulted in extreme maneuvers that tore the rocket apart the company nevertheless persevered and in just a few years the rocket launch business was going strong again on both sides of the atlantic in the u s the pentagon convinced boeing and lockheed to together invest some &# billion of their own funds to develop similar heavy lift rockets but the global launch industry was about to fall off a cliff the internet investor bubble burst tech companies shelved many big satellite projects intended to provide high speed access to the internet for business and individuals launch providers were stranded with sharply reduced manifests lockheed in particular slashed its prices to launch satellites that forced arianespace to try to match or outdo those cuts to retain customers despite access to the u s defense departments huge space budget boeing and lockheed eventually all but dropped out of the commercial launch business they had to write off much of their investments and the boards of both u s aerospace giants ultimately opted to abandon the roller coaster cycles and thin margins of the commercial space segment russian built rockets originally developed by the kremlin and launched from kazakhstan remain arianespaces main competition europeans chose a different path recognizing that defense budgets were bound to remain dwarfed by those in russia or across the atlantic arianespace sought solutions to make its commercial business viable for the long run the primary building block was producing a more powerful model of its basic rocket dubbed the ariane eca with a new engine specifically designed to carry dual payloads totaling nearly tons but ambitious sales projections literally exploded the new rockets main engine malfunctioned less than three minutes into its december inaugural flight destroying the ariane and twin commercial payloads valued at a total of roughly &# million as the company learned all too painfully recovering from a high profile failure can take years of management soul searching and expensive fixes mr le gall personally reassured customers all over the globe and helped them find alternative rides to space either on smaller ariane rockets or those of rivals mr le gall says he recognized the problems went beyond technical matters and that the company with its pan european base would have to struggle to rebuild political support having already invested as much as &# billion in arianespace since the s european politicians and space officials appeared spooked the arianespace chief remembers tense high level meetings attendees wanted to talk about halting operations recalls mr le gall "we wanted to talk about returning to flight " determined to regain the offensive mr le gall turned to air france for some pointers about the airline industry arianespace cut its supplier base by nearly forced those that remained to significantly cut prices and in the process redefined its own role by empowering astrium space transportation an european aeronautic defence &amp space co unit to oversee all manufacturing according to mr le gall "we completely redefined the organization " arianespace came to resemble a typical air carrier providing transportation while outsourcing other parts of the business such as meal preparation and maintenance "we are no longer manufacturing vehicles " he says "we just launch them " yet those writing the checks learned how fickle the rocket business can be in the case of the largest ariane version the companys private and public supporters pumped in a roughly &# million cash infusion part of the investment was to redesign the main engine nozzle today in kourou nearly another &# billion is earmarked to establish the two additional fleets of rockets and carve new pads out of solid granite excavating yards deep at one site to make sure concrete supports will withstand the massive flames and buffeting from the engines on russias midsize soyuz rocket once all the work is finished in proponents envision europes spaceport operating more like an out of the way airport its modern control centers and hulking assembly buildings will conduct a mission every few weeks competitors plan to fly only every few months when the russian rockets are ready arianespace plans to let its managers rather than its customers decide which rocket to use for each payload that is shot into orbit thats considered anathema by many industry veterans accustomed to having the customer decide many of the details involved in launching expensive satellites skyward mr le gall likes to cite the airline analogy "when you buy a ticket on an airline you dont worry about whether a boeing or airbus aircraft will be used " he says in the same spirit he adds the companys latest motto is delivering "any weight to any orbit at any time " kourou will have unmatched flexibility to handle all sizes and types of payloads its location virtually on the equator means it can handle loads up to greater than those of other launch sites thats because the earths faster revolution at that point acts like a slingshot to give more boost the mosquito infested coastline is surrounded by rain forests but on launch day squads of french foreign legion troops in crisp uniforms man antiaircraft guns helicopters swoop around the launch pad and its towering lightning protectors while visitors touring near the site don gas masks to protect them in case of a pre launch accident arianespaces strategy is still fraught with risks commercial satellite operators which often pay &# million or more per launch may balk at the concept of unilaterally being assigned different rockets diplomatic shifts could leave europe and russia at odds just as they have recently cooled europes desires to get together with china on space issues and in the u s some lawmakers are likely to complain about turning to the french for assistance but so far mr le gall says "european governments are very happy with arianespaces success " and the companys management believes "its a really big deal" to be part of the global effort to supply the international space station an ariane booster is slated to propel an unmanned cargo vehicle to the station as early as january if all goes well years later another ariane will propel a large u s research satellite called the james webb space telescope into deep space during the countdown in may dozens of hushed vips sat in an auditorium across from the launch monitoring center called the "fish bowl " the visitors faced floor to ceiling glass partitions dividing them from rows of engineers and controllers all sporting earphones and hunched over computer screens large digital dials ticked off the time remaining surrounded by panels of red and green lights depicting the status of onboard equipment and ground systems out of an abundance of caution the arianespace team postponed blastoff during the initial launch attempt citing dangerous winds the delay made some arianespace officials tense partly because mr griffin furiously messaging on his blackberry throughout much of the countdown appeared eager to jet back to washington the next day things went smoothly as soon as the launch window opened at p m kourou time the final seven second automated sequence proceeded without a hitch the nearly ton behemoth rose straight up for a few seconds as dignitaries scurried to the balcony of the launch center for a peek as the first stage separated and veered off antonio fabrizi director of the european space agencys rocket programs also took a moment to revel listening to the boom squinting at the pyrotechnics and feeling the intense vibration he turned to the nasa administrator and said with a smile "thats heavenly music you never get tired of hearing it "
