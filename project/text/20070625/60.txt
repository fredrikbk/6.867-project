subcontractors who sometimes work in remote locations often exchange sensitive financial information electronically brett martin president of the appraisal company says the students helped him devise a policy for ensuring that such communications were secure they also helped make sure his web site www appraisers in was in compliance with financial privacy laws "im pretty computer savvy but i dont have time to dig into the details " says the year old mr martin "whats hard for a small business guy like me is that it takes so many hours to read what you do for one thing its incredibly hard to keep up with " two students worked with mr martin during the semester they told him that he had an unsecured fax line that could present a liability unless a person in the office was trained to handle nonpublic information they also suggested that files sent electronically be encrypted and helped write a privacy policy for the web site that tells consumers their personal information will not be shared with others "it was a good way to provide a student with a project and offer assistance to the community " says eric n johnson associate professor of accounting at the kelley school of business
