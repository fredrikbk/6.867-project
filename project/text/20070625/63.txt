success in philadelphia among big city public school systems philadelphias record of improvement in recent years has been the most impressive test scores in reading and math have risen substantially even in what had been the lowest performing schools continuing the reforms that facilitated this trend might seem like a no brainer but if district administrators have their way in the current budget negotiations the citys schools stand a good chance of reverting to the bad old days philadelphia historically has been one of the nations worst large school districts as recently as the late s more than half its students were scoring "below basic" on state assessment tests which is to say they were functionally illiterate in republican governor tom ridge initiated a state takeover of the city school district that was completed the next year by his successor republican mark schweiker in short order the local school board long subject to cronyism was disbanded and replaced with a five member school reform commission with three of the members appointed by the governor next paul vallas a superintendent with a record of success in chicago was hired to oversee the districts schools most importantly control of of the lowest performing schools was turned over to outside managers three for profit companies two nonprofits and two universities these private providers agreed to honor collective bargaining agreements but were given some control over staffing and curriculum the idea was to create an entirely new school management model one where competition among private providers and between those providers and the traditional system could produce innovation and new ideas thats exactly what has happened over the past five years among fifth graders proficiency in reading rose to in from in and math proficiency rose to from at the eighth grade level math and reading scores rose by percentage points over the same period just schools met federal standards under no child left behind in today the number is in short philadelphia has become the most improved school system of its size in the u s the outside providers which include private companies like edison schools as well as the university of pennsylvania and temple university are funded by the state to the tune of &# million annually but the district faces a budget crunch this year and there have been calls to scrap or curtail funding for the private providers so the earmarked money can be used for general purposes the loudest critics are district administrators who dont like the competition from outside managers and the mayors office which wants to regain control of the system from the state both are now arguing amazingly that the improvements over the past decade would have happened without the reforms as proof they cite a rand corporation study from earlier this year that found that the gains in schools under private management were on par with other schools in the state but a separate study conducted by harvards paul peterson exposed several methodological flaws in that study and he concluded that "the private providers were especially effective at increasing the percentage of students performing at or above the basic level " in any case the point of the reform was not merely to improve the schools under private management it was to unleash competitive forces within the district that would help lift all boats thats clearly what has happened in philadelphia and its why sending private educators packing would be another blow to the citys poorest children see related letters "letters to the editor are privately run public schools worth the effort and money " wsj july
