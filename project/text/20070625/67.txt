the evening wrap opening the ad gates online edition the nations highest court ruled that an important package of campaign finance measures trampled free speech rights of labor unions and issue advocates in a decision that likely will have ad weary voters hitting the mute button often during the coming presidential campaign the supreme court in a decision loosened restrictions on corporate and union funded political advertisements that run close to election day weakening a key provision of the mccain feingold campaign finance legislation the law had blocked companies unions or other interest groups from running broadcast advertisements that reference a candidate for federal office two months before a general election or a month before a primary the justices upheld a lower court ruling that wisconsin right to life an antiabortion group should have been allowed to broadcast advertisements in the months leading up to the elections the ads asked voters to contact wisconsins two senators democrats russ feingold and herb kohl and urge them not to block president bushs judicial nominees sen feingold as circumstance would have it the co author of the campaign finance law was then up for re election "discussion of issues cannot be suppressed simply because the issues may also be pertinent in an election " wrote chief justice john roberts in the majority opinion "where the first amendment is implicated the tie goes to the speaker not the censor " the court had previously upheld most of mccain feingold from a broad attack brought by sen mitch mcconnell in and while the majority has stopped short of overturning that decision at least three justices who joined the majority justices antonin scalia clarence thomas and anthony kennedy indicated they would have gone that extra step still the ruling would appear to throw open the ad floodgates in time for the race the aclu nra and others that had linked up in an unlikely coalition to get the provision tossed out are almost certain to be blasting at each others preferred candidates as often as their pocketbooks will allow indeed the effect of todays ruling may be seen as soon as december as a number of states have moved primaries forward into january observers said that the ruling will make an indelible mark in the race and beyond "there is no doubt todays decision reflects a constitutional sea change that is likely to have dramatic effects on upcoming elections " said richard h pilbes a professor at new york university school of law on the supreme court blog of law firm akin gump "some will celebrate that change others will bemoan it but that the change is dramatic cannot be doubted " in another speech case before the high court the justices split in upholding the right of an alaskan school principal to confiscate a foot banner reading "bong hits jesus" from a student who unfurled it away from school grounds at an olympic torch relay event in "we hold that schools may take steps to safeguard those entrusted to their care from speech that can reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use " chief justice roberts wrote for the majority joseph fredrick the student who had set up the banner said that the message was meant to be nonsensical and was intended as an illustration of his right to say anything at all also today the high court threw out in a split an atheist groups challenge to president bushs office of faith based initiatives and finally the justices ruled in yet another decision that broke that the endangered species act takes a backseat to the clean water act when it
