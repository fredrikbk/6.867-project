gazprom pipeline plan may fuel worry pact with italys eni might boost influence over eu energy supply rome a joint project by italys eni spa and oao gazprom to build a pipeline into the heart of europe may help slake the continents rising thirst for natural gas but it could also boost the russian gas companys direct control of europes energy supply representatives of the russian and italian governments saturday signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on a kilometer or mile pipeline the pipeline could carry as much as billion cubic meters or trillion cubic feet of gas annually from russia into europe through the black sea construction would begin as early as next year if the project which is to be owned and financed via a joint venture between eni and gazprom overcomes regulatory hurdles the pipeline called south stream is scheduled to be completed three years later saturdays deal has wide ranging implications for europe as well as the companies involved the european union is under pressure to find new sources of natural gas to feed its growing demand just as its internal production is falling by the eu may find itself importing billion cubic meters a year or roughly more gas than it does now finding that gas in an increasingly competitive global market and building the pipelines needed to import it will be a major challenge but just as europe needs new pipelines european politicians are increasingly concerned with the continents dependence on russia for future energy supply russia supplies more than a quarter of the european unions gas a figure slated to rise in the coming years gazprom russias gas monopoly is foremost among eu regulators concerns in the last two years the vast majority of gazproms gas sales to europe were to large energy companies that then resold it to local customers but the russian company has recently been trying to extend its reach by gaining direct access to the lucrative european retail market policy makers are worried that if gazprom controls the supply of gas and the distribution infrastructure it would have excessive control of the market that adds to a concern that russia could one day use its gas supply as a political lever in its relations with europe the eus competition commissioner neelie kroes said earlier this month that gazprom would have to sell its distribution assets in europe as part of a planned deregulation of europes energy industry gazprom winces at that prospect speaking at the signing ceremony on saturday gazprom deputy chief executive alexander medvedev said he felt such a demand "ran counter to the free market " "if principles of communism have come to the eu someone should let us know " he added the italian government has bucked europes concerns about gazprom aggressively endorsing russia as a strategic partner in energy and other areas such as aviation just last week italys foreign minister massimo dalema held court in rome with dimitry medvedev russias first deputy prime minister and also gazproms chairman to discuss cooperation in a range of sectors an italian airline for example recently announced its intention to purchase russian commercial aircraft and an italian defense contractor finmeccanica spa is jointly developing a fighter jet with a russian company italian politicians say forging tighter ties with gazprom is essential for europes energy security "we think of the pipeline as a deal between russia and europe " italys industry minister pierluigi bersani said at the signing eni has launched itself as gazproms top partner in europe a strategy that could eventually give eni an advantage over other major oil companies that are struggling to develop russias vast oil and gas resources bp plc last week sold its stake in a vast siberian gas field to gazprom after coming under regulatory pressure from the russian authorities six months ago royal dutch shell plc sold control of the sakhalin project in far east russia to gazprom after russian regulators threatened to shut down the venture because of alleged violations of environmental norms eni is already gazproms largest customer a ranking that allows the italian company to maintain its position as the largest gas company by sales in the eu with of the total market since eni chief executive paolo scaroni arrived two years ago he has courted russia with intensity seeing it both as a way to secure italys future energy security and to boost enis fortunes those efforts may now be paying off last november he signed a sweeping accord to extend enis massive supply contracts with gazprom to in exchange for granting gazprom a share of the italian retail market the two also pledged to cooperate on future exploration and production projects in russia as well as internationally eni could also now hold on to some assets in russia that it previously thought it would have to cede to gazprom in april eni bought a raft of assets at auction that had once belonged to russian oil company oao yukos the agreement at the time was that gazprom would have the right to buy many of those assets later on on saturday however gazproms mr medvedev indicated that gazprom may decide not to exercise its option to buy one of those assets enis stake in oil producer gazprom neft neither eni nor gazprom would discuss specifics about how much it would cost to build the south stream pipeline although the investment is likely to run into the billions of euros the pipeline would start on russias black sea coast at the same point where another joint eni gazprom pipeline begins the south stream pipeline would cross the black sea to bulgaria from which point it could fork into two routes one heading south toward italy and another toward hungary liam moloney
