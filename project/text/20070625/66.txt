the daily fix columnists remember rod beck a down to earth pitching star online edition rod beck a burly mustachioed reliever for the san francisco giants chicago cubs boston red sox and san diego padres was found dead in his phoenix home saturday mr beck leaves behind a wife and two daughters aged and while the cause of death may not be known for several days police said foul play wasnt suspected mr beck had a history of substance abuse and had done a stint in drug rehab he also was a fan favorite a determinedly blue collar pitcher who could and did befriend most anyone who came his way "beck was a favorite of writers not just because he was a great quote and willing talker but because he treated non players as actual people " writes scott ostler in the san francisco chronicle "he was the writers go to guy the man you could count on to explain even the toughest of losses except for one night when beck blew a huge save and shaken and distraught waved away the writers the next day before the game beck called the writers to his locker and apologized superstar apologizing to writers in baseball this occurs as often as a quadruple play " mr becks death is a sad reason to revisit one of the fixs favorite pieces about mr becks time with the triple a iowa cubs a comeback he spent living in an rv behind the outfield wall entertaining fans and teammates with limitless autographs baseball chat and beers "it isnt uncommon for beck to leave the clubhouse walk home and find strangers hanging out at the rv curious if the rumors that have spread across iowas capitol are true " wayne drehs wrote for espn com "does rod beck really live here does he really sign autographs after games is he really down to earth enough that hell offer a coors light and tell old baseball stories to just about anyone who stops by yes " at the conclusion of that article mr beck told mr drehs "being here has helped me maybe mentally as much as physically it helped me remember why i do this this is not a game or an occupation its a lifestyle i was when i first signed im now thats half my life so if i give this up what the hell else am i going to do " michael jordan ruined things for everybody so says david steele of the baltimore sun in previewing thursdays nba draft looking askance at the huge shadow his airness continues to cast over the league "now the jordan factor is about to stink up the leagues next generation too " he writes "see the draftniks are pondering whether greg oden or kevin durant should be taken first those in durants corner say passing over him would be a huge mistake like the one the portland trail blazers made in when they passed on jordan to take sam bowie never mind how little sense that makes talking about scouts and executives and rosters and draft classes from two decades ago and comparing them with their counterparts in a completely different era thats not even mentioning the insanity of comparing oden to bowie think of how grateful durant must be for this at hes already being set up as the next michael only to be torn down eventually for not being the next michael " mr steele acknowledges that "you cant argue jordans greatness but since his career ended too many people have felt a need to elevate him by stomping on the reputations of everyone and everything that has followed him were you aware that no other nba championship team has been as accomplished gifted popular or charismatic as jordans six time champion bulls from the s of course you knew because every year at this time someone reminds you of it no sport ever dragged itself through this long a period of mourning for a departed star baseball didnt give up and start mocking succeeding players after babe ruth or mickey mantle or willie mays or reggie jackson retired football didnt curse an entire generation of players after johnny unitas or walter payton or joe montana or jerry rice finished playing with the nba though nobody can let go of jordan " in the miami herald israel gutierrez wishes gms drafting thursday would take a cue from steve nash whose ability to make decisions and passes have transformed the phoenix suns "so the player whose passing ability floor vision and decision making are most comparable to nash must be a highly coveted point guard guaranteed to land in the first round " he writes "thats where the logic falls apart jared jordan the marist point guard who led the ncaa in assists for two consecutive seasons for the first time since avery johnson did it for southern in and will be lucky to get drafted most of the nba execs who have watched nash envious of the impact one player can have on an organization arent willing to take a risk theyre still caught up on athleticism and size and speed and all the other attributes that can guarantee nothing but a good looking layup line and cant quite make the leap to drafting a player who forces the game to be played the right way " and the leader in todays columnist receiving molten email standings is phil sheridan of the philadelphia inquirer "there is a common thread running through two of the more unpleasant ongoing stories in american professional sports " mr sheridan writes "while baseball continues to stumble in the darkness unsure of the size or shape of its steroid problem retired football players are becoming ever more vocal about being discarded by the sport they helped build into the new national pastime the common thread unions with all due respect to the fine work done by labor unions everywhere the men who run the major league baseball and nfl players associations are on the wrong side of these difficult and pressing issues the reason is as simple as human nature itself greed both the mlbpa and nflpa are committed to putting as much money as possible into the bank accounts of their current members thats understandable except when they put that last available dollar ahead of the integrity of the sports the long term health of their members and the welfare of the men who played in the past " on june brian esposito caught an inning for the st louis cardinals two days later he was back in triple a memphis for his eighth minor league season that inning in the show grants mr esposito membership in the local chapter of the moonlight graham society writes gerry fraley in the st louis post dispatch "since players have appeared in only one game with the cardinals for of those players who beat the odds just to get the proverbial cup of coffee that lone game comprised their major league career " mr fraley runs down some of those mayfly redbirds tales from the player for a minute who became a manager for decades walter alston to the best player ever to hail from the canary islands al cabrera to the man who will forever be burdened with an infinite era will koenigsmark hmm espn coms bill simmons kept a live diary of the nhl draft did he make fun of gary bettman canadians the nhl do you really need to ask "on the clock at no the hometown blue jackets " mr simmons writes "this might the lowest moment of my life im actually excited to see who they take here as the crowd chants lets go jack ets clap clap clap clap clap their gm tells them in a monotone voice thank you what a fantastic day in columbus it really ranks right up there they take european winger jakub voracek who hopefully wont get corrupted by the columbus nightlife keep your fingers crossed for him " tip of the fix cap to readers don hartline and john herold found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself
