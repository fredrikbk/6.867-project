oil companies hope grease is the word for fuel scientists are turning to fat as renewable energy source tapping pizza taco residue tulsa here in the heart of the oil patch laboratory technician christine king is surrounded these days by containers of what her employer hopes will become the next big thing in energy grease and fat theres used cooking oil in various shades of yellow theres chicken fat a dark brown goo with a scent that evokes dog food "heres one that smells really bad " ms king says reaching for a jar and opening the lid inside taco and pizza grease the small lab is in an industrial building that serves as the headquarters of syntroleum corp for two decades the people behind the tiny company have tried in vain to turn a profit by making liquid transportation fuel out of natural gas last summer frustrated by its lack of progress reinventing fossil fuel syntroleum began shifting to what it saw as a greener pasture making fuel from the renewable resource known as fat today syntroleum and agricultural giant tyson foods inc are set to announce plans to build a &# million plant somewhere in the south central u s that will take fat from tysons processing plants and turn it into liquid fuel to power everything from cars to jets the announcement comes two months after arkansas based tyson announced a similar deal with conocophillips in which the houston based oil company will run slugs of tysons fat through existing conoco refineries and produce what the companies call "renewable diesel" to mix at low concentrations into conocos conventional oil based diesel the amount of fat based fuel to be produced by tyson and its new partners is miniscule in the context of the u s oil market tyson and syntroleum say their plant will crank out million gallons of fat based fuel annually thats less than the size of a typical modern oil refinery theres long been a cottage industry in "biodiesel " the quirky concoction in which garage enthusiasts mix used french fry grease with some rudimentary chemicals to cook up juice for their diesel powered volkswagens and the like and the number of biodiesel plants is soaring the tyson moves and similar deals by oil companies in europe suggest the fossil fuel industry wants to elevate fat based fuel from a microbrew into an industrial scale if still niche product motivating the industry are twin government actions mandates pushing energy companies to produce more alternative fuels and subsidies helping pay for that push tyson and conoco have lobbied hard in washington in recent months to ensure that their renewable diesel will qualify for a &# a gallon federal tax break initially written for traditional biodiesel their capitol hill push has infuriated the midwest based biodiesel lobby which argues that the subsidy never was intended to help big oil now as congress debates a new energy bill the biodiesel boosters are backing amendments that would bar the tyson conoco brew from the tax break the senate voted down such an amendment on wednesday the house still is considering one three weeks ago finnish refiner neste oil christened a renewable diesel plant beside a neste oil refinery in porvoo finland one of two refineries neste owns last tuesday uop a unit of honeywell international inc that develops technology for the refining industry announced that italian oil producer eni spa will use uops technology to make renewable diesel at an eni refinery in livorno italy syntroleum began in as a backyard experiment when kenneth agee then a tulsa pipeline company employee began researching a way to turn natural gas into a liquid fuel he read about a process known as fischer tropsch that had been invented by two german scientists in oil poor germany in the s to turn various materials into "synthetic" liquid transportation fuels mr agees company which sought to improve the process went public in it has hemorrhaged money ever since building a gas to liquids plant costs hundreds of millions of dollars and syntroleum came to realize it was "in a big boys game that we cant play " mr agee says "we had to figure out how do we walk before we run " in as congress was debating an energy bill missouri rep roy blunt authored an amendment on behalf of a plant in his district that was turning turkey parts into fuel using a process called "thermal depolymerization " that process uses heat to change the molecular structure of a substance such as turning animal fat into fuel the amendment expanded a tax break for traditional biodiesel to apply to fuel made through the more complex chemical process the expanded tax break turned heads at conocos headquarters in houston its scientists had begun experimenting with making a renewable form of diesel in conoco refineries using fats instead of crude oil tyson hadnt heard about conocos experiments when in late it approached conoco and proposed that they jointly start a traditional biodiesel business using tysons fat and conocos fuel expertise conoco told tyson it had a better idea than biodiesel renewable diesel the companies began working together syntroleum meanwhile discovered the tax break and recognized thermal depolymerization as essentially the final step in the longer gas to liquids process it had been experimenting with syntroleum and tyson started working together the conoco and syntroleum processes differ conoco can accommodate only fairly clean fat in its refineries it plans initially to add the diesel it makes from those fats to conventional petroleum based diesel in concentrations of no more than but syntroleums process can use the dregs the dirtiest and thus cheapest fats syntroleum unlike conoco plans to make fuel using all fat and no petroleum syntroleum has been testing dozens of fats and oils a particularly inviting variety is a mixture that gary roth syntroleums president refers to as "the road kill blend " sitting at a conference table at syntroleums headquarters he pulls out a vial of the stuff "we tried to find the nastiest product we could " he says renewable diesel proponents say their fuel can be used in any diesel powered car but its still just a test fuel so it hasnt been validated for that use last week syntroleum signed a contract to supply gallons of fat based jet fuel for testing to the air force which already has tested the companys natural gas based fuel syntroleums chief executive met last week with paul bollinger an official in charge of the air forces effort to develop alternatives to oil "youve got to be kidding " mr bollinger says he thought to himself when the syntroleum ceo showed up in his office bearing vials of animal fat and fuel made from it still mr bollinger says its worth a look "lord knows " he says "theres no shortage of chicken or hog fat in this country "
