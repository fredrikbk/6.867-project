diesels good will ambassadors european models preview u s bound technologies online edition after a checkered past and a hit or miss sales record partially hampered by strict tail pipe emission regulations diesel powered vehicles may soon gain popularity in the u s market a raft of diesel passenger cars which often improve fuel economy over similar gas sipping engines by as much as will begin hitting u s showrooms in new emissions reducing technologies are intended to make them eligible for sale in all states including the countrys largest car market california but diesel passenger vehicles are still relatively unfamiliar to american car consumers only mercedes benz is selling diesels in the u s for drivers that recall the last crop of diesels sold in the u s may harbor memories of slow moving smoke belching vehicles in an effort to herald the coming wide release of new diesel cars in the u s bosch a supplier of clean diesel technology provided the wall street journal onlines david patton and matt vella with two imports not available on american shores a bmw d and chrysler c crd a discussion of diesel fuel and the two vehicles general pros and cons follows matt vella lets start with the bmw so what did you think performance diesel oxymoron or next big thing david patton this is an oxymoronic vehicle i understand the idea behind it but if im looking for a performance car i dont necessarily care about the fuel efficiency a diesel brings with it mr vella i agree that if youre going to spend roughly &# on a sports sedan you might not be concerned about the high cost of gas still i think a performance diesel only seems oxymoronic because of the troubled past diesels have had in the u s but european consumers and race fans particularly with the recent run at le mans certainly know that diesel fuel can serve as a platform for pretty impressive results mr patton le mans is a good example since it was going on at the exact same time that we were driving these cars still i was disappointed in the bmw it was quick off the line but power rapidly tapered out as revs rose i also didnt feel that the transmission was well matched to the engine i understand bmw couldnt put a manual in this car because the immense torque was too much for its current transmissions according to this article but even the lack of manumatic shifting paddles on the wheel detracts from the sporting intentions of this vehicle it just didnt feel sporty to me mr vella well i think any engine is going to pale next to the five liter v in the m but even if its not exactly worthy of bmws coveted "m" badge i think the performance was pretty impressive the pound feet of torque is amazing from an inline thats lb ft more than the u s spec m and as for gas mileage the gulf between miles per gallon an m would likely return in the real world and the miles per gallon we observed in our diesel testing is vast in any case the diesel proposition was certainly accented different in the other model we tested a european only chrysler c crd mr patton i was more impressed with the chrysler which i think is more suited to american driving tastes and was overall a better pairing of engine and transmission the didnt have any sporting pretensions so it was easy to accept the laid back feel of the engine which still provided good acceleration and was very quiet on the highway this new generation of diesels is so far beyond what was sold even a few years ago frankly this is a car i could see myself buying though maybe not for &# which is roughly what it sells for in europe mr vella yes i think both these vehicles their differences in driving style aside could easily be poster children for a diesel renaissance in the u s weve mentioned pricing which i think could potentially be an achilles heel some of the new systems are so sophisticated i e technologically complex and expensive that they will carry premiums close to or even higher than some hybrids i guess the question is how much are consumers going to be willing for the increase in mileage even with the performance mr patton i think the premium will be easier to stomach not only because of the improved mileage but because theyll also likely pay less at the pump right now diesel is about cents per gallon cheaper than regular gasoline and a whopping cents per gallon cheaper than premium and prices have been stable for months in any case hondas recent announcement that it will replace the accord hybrid with a diesel is really going to lead to a rush of interest in diesels mr vella you bring up an interesting point about the ideal implementation for a diesel engine is it in the large tourer is it the thrifty mainstream sedans or is it in a sporty roadster coupe or other performance type vehicle i dont think diesels will really displace gas for high performance production vehicles an american consumer who wants horses is going to get them but i think diesel has a good shot of capturing a significant chunk of market segments where fuel economy is a big part of consumers buying decision hence the importance of the accord announcement mr patton these two models are top of the line obviously showcases for the technology which is why we drove them as is the diesel mercedes ml cdi i reviewed but the introduction of less expensive diesels like the accord and the vw jetta coming in will be a truer test of whether these engines can catch on to the mainstream mr vella i agree the trick for consumers i think is to take the coming crop of diesels on their own not necessarily comparing them line for line with gas vehicles and certainly leaving behind the bad impressions from the diesels dark past write to david patton at david patton wsj com and matt vella at
