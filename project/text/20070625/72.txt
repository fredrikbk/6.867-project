third times no charm for summer blockbusters as a hollywood sequel the new universal pictures film "evan almighty" could not be more unlike its predecessor s "bruce almighty " the originals star jim carrey has been replaced with comic actor steve carell and while "bruce almighty" was a ribald pg comedy "evan" is a tamer pg family film that earnestly updates the biblical story of noahs ark now the two films may have something else that distinguishes them from each other their financial performance "bruce almighty " which cost about &# million to produce was a giant box office hit taking in &# million in its debut weekend and &# million by the end of its domestic box office run but "evan " which cost at least &# million to make took in just &# million over the weekend in its debut putting it on track to far underperform the original and at risk of being caught in a flood of red ink "evans" almighty stumble is the first major pothole in hollywoods sequel filled summer universal still hopes the film can gain momentum "we were hoping to get off to a faster start " says marc shmuger co chairman of universal pictures "i think there are some movies that dont necessarily get off to the biggest start but word of mouth is so strong that the appeal spreads and grows the longer its in the marketplace " universal executives were trying this weekend to compare the launch of "evan" with last years hit fox movie "night at the museum " starring ben stiller and robin williams that movie opened on dec with &# million and went on to gross more than &# million at the box office but even before this weekend hollywoods reliance on third fourth and fifth installments of their biggest franchises was showing signs of strain mays big blockbuster "threequels" "spider man " "shrek the third" and "pirates of the caribbean at worlds end" are all expected to fall short of the last installments in those series at the domestic box office some of that drop is being supplemented by healthy international receipts and the films are all expected to be strongly profitable the domestic performance of the films may be a sign that audiences are growing fatigued with overly familiar offerings one big problem is that the sheer volume of may sequels caused gridlock at the theaters by opening too close to each other indeed sony pictures"spider man " fared best by opening first and smashing all opening weekend box office records taking in &# million domestically but the arrival of "shrek" followed by "pirates" just a week later quickly siphoned the audiences from one film to another "spider man s" second weekends gross was lower than its opening compared to a drop for "spider man " in as for the "shrek" franchise "shrek the third" didnt do as well as "shrek " domestically but is on track to outperform its predecessor internationally "we did better than we expected but theres no question "pirates" took a piece out of our back end staying power " said dreamworks animation chief executive jeffrey katzenberg he added "irrespective of how "pirates" did they cannibalized us " "evan almighty" should have had it easier it was given plenty of distance from mays big three and some breathing room before pixars animated "ratatouille" and next months "transformers " "the simpsons movie " and the fifth "harry potter" film but the film which has been hung with the unfortunate label of being the most expensive comedy ever made will likely wind up a cautionary tale that shows how perilous it can be for studios to pursue sequels at all costs computer effects required to render the hundreds of pairs of animals added to the price tag because the new film is so different than the original universal was put in the uncomfortable position of having to sell the sequel to an almost entirely different audience than the one that made the first a hit the first film drew more of a general audience including people who were comfortable with mr carreys sometimes off color humor adam fogelson universals marketing president said in an interview last week that the film tested equally well with the audience that loved "bruce almighty" and a previously untapped audience that included families as well as christian groups targeted by the studio but mr carells fan base from his star turn in the sex themed comedy "the year old virgin" and the irreverent television show "the office " are a different demographic universal executives said interest was high among churches with more than signing up on an "evan" related community outreach web site the sequel situation has largely sent audiences in search of more original fare on the flip side for universal it has scored big with the pregnancy comedy "knocked up" that cost less than &# million to make which already hit the &# million mark domestically since it opened four weeks ago hopes are high for the coming sony release "superbad " and paramounts "hot rod " both low cost comedies that could perform well relative to their production costs and hollywood still has a probable smash and perhaps even a new franchise with "transformers " there remain a few more sequels yet to test the water warner bros "harry potter and the order of the phoenix " the fifth film in the franchise carries the momentum of the release of the series seventh and final book around the time of its opening on july the third installment of universals "bourne" spy thriller franchise staring matt damon is also expected to do well while industry officials and observers have downgraded earlier estimates of a record breaking &# billion summer they arent yawning at the money being brought in "the films that front loaded the summer were the films that open big and drop off but still make a heck of a lot of money " says paul dergarabedian president of media by numbers llc a encino calif box office tracking firm he notes that year to date revenues are up about but theater attendance is flat compared with last year that is far from what was expected during a summer in which the studios unfurled many of their biggest brands in an effort to drive people into theaters the lower summer domestic box office receipts are also affecting exhibitors on friday bank of america analyst michael savner downgraded the theater sector from a "buy" to a "neutral" based largely on weaker than expected box office performance merissa
