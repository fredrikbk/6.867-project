kpmg injustice the justice departments case against former kpmg partners for tax evasion continues to unravel with prosecutors themselves conceding late last week that federal judge lewis kaplan has little choice but to dismiss the charges against most of the defendants judge kaplan ruled last year that justice had violated the defendants constitutional rights by pressuring kpmg not to pay their legal fees he is now considering a defense motion to dismiss prosecutors continue to protest the judges ruling but on friday they admitted in a court filing that dismissal is the only remedy for the rights violations the more honorable route would have been for prosecutors to acknowledge their mistakes and dismiss the charges themselves the truth is that this tax shelter case should never have been brought both kpmg and its partners believed the shelters they marketed were legal and no tax court had ruled against the shelters before justice brought its criminal charges then prosecutors used the threat of criminal indictment against all of kpmg to extort an admission of guilt from the firm and force it to stop paying the legal bills of individual partners the point was to use the threat of bankruptcy to coerce plea bargains and score another white collar crime "victory" that would play well in the press most defendants have refused to cop a plea despite this prosecutorial abuse no doubt because they believe they are innocent we hope judge kaplan puts an end to this unjust and embarrassing prosecution
