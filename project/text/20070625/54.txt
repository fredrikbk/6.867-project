small business a special report look whos talking its tempting to dismiss online reviews of your business tempting but not smart after looking up her spa for the first time on yelp inc a popular web site where urbanites rate local businesses peggy wynne borgman nearly headed for a steambath herself four out of five reviews of her business were chilly or lukewarm ms borgman the owner of preston wynne spas in saratoga calif decided to try to do something about her "miserable" star rating using yelps email system she typed out messages to each downbeat reviewer to find out more about what went wrong and to try to make it right and she sent a thank you to the happy customer then she added to her email newsletter a note encouraging regular clients to get online and share their good experiences several stressful months later the spas rating had climbed to an acceptable four stars "its personal and its painful a public flogging like that " ms borgman says but today yelp is an important source of new visitors for her two california spas she says "which is funny considering i originally thought it was the tool of the devil " proprietors of service businesses like ms borgman are facing a new challenge from the increasing popularity of web sites that feature consumer reviews of local establishments though good customer service and reputations have always been keys to success for smaller players never before has news good or bad traveled so far so fast or been so long lived and accessible experts suggest that businesses regularly track what is being said about them on the web and address any negative reviews head on they recommend contacting critics to find out more about what went wrong and how to remedy it and ideally in the process inspire naysayers to amend their reviews another approach is to encourage fans to write reviews that can counterbalance critiques the rise of consumer reviews online has created a new puzzle for small companies "how do you protect and advance your reputation " says greg sterling founding principal of sterling market intelligence a consulting and research firm in oakland calif and a specialist on local businesses on the internet "there is an opportunity here for the smart businesses to embrace this phenomenon " it can be challenging for owners to keep abreast of what customers are saying about their businesses online especially as more people increasingly write reviews on sites like yelp iac interactivecorps citysearch and insiderpages yahoo local and expedia inc s tripadvisor but some sites are making it easier to track reviews for instance on tripadvisor hoteliers and restaurateurs can subscribe to rss feeds software tools that allow users to track specific web content so that they are aware of any new reviews that come up businesses also can use the feeds to post tripadvisor reviews on their own web sites businesses that sign up for free business listings on yahoo local can also subscribe to a service that emails them any new reviews that appear on the site mr sterling also recommends that businesses do a web search of their companys name town and state the first sites you see on a search results page are the ones to worry about he says because theyre also the first sites potential customers will see a search "alerts businesses to issues and problems that they can address " says mr sterling running such searches in google can be particularly useful because the search engines maps service which is automatically triggered when a location is included in a query collates reviews from sites across the web for ms borgmans spa for instance google currently assigns an aggregate star rating based on reviews culled from yelp insiderpages and citysearch google maps also often provides links to blogs and other web pages where the business has been mentioned so what does a business do if the reviews it finds arent all positive dont panic say experts and executives from review sites consumers tend to weigh the sum of all reviews and a vitriolic one very often elicits sympathy for the business not the angry customer people also tend to give more weight to recent reviews and since there will always be more reviews there will always be opportunities to turn things around still businesses should consider contacting the authors of bad reviews as ms borgman did if possible yelp for instance has a private messaging system for members who can register free of charge citysearch and tripadvisor dont have private messaging but they give businesses the opportunity to post public responses on their sites before contacting a critic take time to cool off a harsh response or rant could do more damage than the poor review an owner is better off crafting a professional positive response and trying to win over the critic "making amends and taking responsibility as in life goes a long way in building trust and loyalty " says scott morrow executive vice president of product marketing at citysearch in fact it can win a business praise on the review sites a woman who had written a negative review on yelp after an "awful" massage at ms borgmans spa was invited back for a free "do over " she later amended her rating on yelp to four stars "i appreciate when folks care about their customers and want to do right by them " the woman wrote "good customer service is so rare these days that i think its a good sign when businesses monitor review boards and take action on them " ms borgman says she has never asked any unhappy customers to amend their reviews if a review is truly abusive a business may be able to get it removed but before complaining to a site check its rules or terms of use to see what it deems impermissible behavior since none will take down a bad review thats legitimate "we dont allow you to escape your business reputation " says jeremy stoppelman co founder and chief executive of yelp "were out here to map people to great local businesses " the most constructive thing a business owner can do is to consider whether customers online complaints point to real problems in the business and if so to take action "if anyones really in the customer service business they want to know what happened and make sure it never happens again " says tripadvisor spokesman brian payea people will often write things in online reviews that they didnt feel comfortable saying in person their words may sting or frustrate says mr morrow of citysearch but businesses ignore them at their peril "sometimes local businesses have a hard time hearing it " he says "the reality is if they continue to hear it the problem is there and unlike the spoken word an online review impacts a hundred more people " ms borgman says she learned from poor reviews that her employees needed to be more careful pitching skin products to clients to take home especially to younger women who seemed less comfortable saying no so she did some remedial sales training several reviewers on yelp now praise preston wynne employees for their soft touch with product pitches one reviewer originally gave the spa a poor review but after returning for another facial she posted an update reading "there was zero promotional push at the end which was a complete contrast from my last experience " ms borgman says complaints "can absolutely be leveraged for the benefit of the business " ms richmond is a reporter for dow jones newswires in jersey city n j she can be reached at riva richmond dowjones com
