small business a special report show me the money maybe venture capital is easier to get these days but that doesnt mean it makes sense for small companies its the best time in years to go looking for venture capital venture investments topped &# billion in up from less than &# billion in according to thomson financial and the national venture capital association in the first quarter of this year funds totaling nearly &# billion were established but easy money doesnt necessarily mean smart money its tempting to grab a big deal while the going is good but if the money comes from the wrong investor it could be a disaster a bad partner can wreak havoc with a start up such as demanding unrealistic performance targets and meddling with the day to day operations the answer experts and entrepreneurs say is to carefully research potential investors "its never been more important to pay attention to the concept of smart money " says clare fairfield a venture capitalist and chairman of the education committee for the venture capital institute "what are these people really like who are giving me the money " for an idea of how risky things can be consider what happened to brian carlton byrd mr byrd set out to find funding for his technology start up at an inopportune time in shortly after the dot com bubble burst yet his fledgling mobile phone services business needed cash so he took the terms laid out by an independent investor from ohio mr byrd a graduate of harvard business school says the deal called for him to receive &# payable in two installments in exchange for of the company there were problems from the beginning as the investor made clear his growth expectations for the company when mr byrd failed to meet one of the benchmarks about a year into the deal the investor refused to pay the second lump sum suddenly mr byrd found himself in a tight position financially and personally "i had strained just about all my relationships because i didnt have any money " says mr byrd "that investor didnt really understand how technology businesses grow " mr byrd eventually recovered his company new york based ceig inc met the benchmarks and received the remaining &# but the experience prompted mr byrd to revise his fund seeking strategy mr byrd took small sums of money what he calls "survival amounts" to keep his business afloat without having to deal with demands from big investors it allowed him to continue operating while buying him time to research large investors and find the right match mr byrd has done extensive research on all of his recent financial backers including several face to face meetings with major investors he made sure that the investors he chose are on his wavelength about deadlines and goals he now has investors he has raised a total of &# million and retains control of of the company mr byrd says in the next round of financing he wants to offer up only to more of the company which develops content and applications for mobile phones under the brand name new breed wireless equity investment experts agree with mr byrds research strategy "make sure that you do your homework " says daniel oconnell director of the golder center for private equity and entrepreneurial finance at the university of illinois urbana champaign business owners he says should request references on an investor and meet with chief executives theyve backed owners should then grill those ceos about the investors personality such as how involved he or she tries to get in management questions such as "are they hard workers " or "do they come to meetings prepared " will help determine their investing personality says mr oconnell "ask all the questions you hope your ceo would ask " he says one good strategy experts say is to find equity investors with background in the companys field for instance about a third of the plus investors in biotech start up genesystems inc of rockville md are doctors company founder jonathan cohen says that the doctors experience in the field makes them go beyond the traditional investor role to help the company for instance some of the doctors have helped the company find sources of tissue and blood for samples "they have opened doors " says mr cohen adding "they are certainly interested in the return on investment but they also want to advance a disease cure " other entrepreneurs protect their companies by having independent sources of funding cleveland based entrepreneur robert schmidt saw too many friends lose their money and businesses in bad equity deals so mr schmidt who has an m b a and a law degree built two umbrella companies cleveland medical devices inc a medical devices company and orbital research inc an aerospace and micro electro mechanical systems company these operations which mr schmidt founded each serve as a "mother ship " he says heres how it works the companies do work for outside clients the revenue that work generates is then used to initially finance start up companies that mr schmidt creates usually the ideas for these start ups grow out of research done at the "mother ship" companies later when mr schmidt is ready to spin off those start ups he turns to venture investors for more capital but because the "mother ship" companies have been funding the start ups all along mr schmidt can ask the investors for less money and thus keep a bigger chunk of the companies "the closer you are to market the higher percentage of equity youre able to maintain " he says for instance mr schmidts comsense technology inc grew out of orbital research which funded comsense as it developed a pressure sensor for diesel engines that helps save fuel and reduce emissions once the product was ready for a wider audience mr schmidt relinquished a fraction of control raising a first round of financing his model helps him build his companies until hes happy with them and ready to let them go "the key is to not need the money " says mr schmidt "when youre desperate and youve got a large staff to feed and your checkbook is nearing zero your negotiating position becomes extremely weak " ms holmes is a staff reporter in
