small business a special report why running a franchise is getting easier you dont have to quit your day job you can even work from home or the beach but dont be fooled making money is just as hard bob mcquillan runs a tight ship at his hollywood tans franchise in arlington va he knows precisely when workers clock in and out who each of his daily customers are and which employees are selling what products at regular price or discount but theres a twist hes doing all this micromanaging from home miles away in mullica hill n j "we monitor the business remotely via the internet " says mr mcquillan who co owns the store with his wife and another business partner while a manager handles the tanning salons day to day affairs he pulls up data from afar by computer a fingerprint scanner monitors workers arrivals and departures while intricate software tallies sales data and pricing almost in real time "im down there once every three months " he says the franchising world is letting loose gone are the days of one owner being chained behind the counter of a single store day in day out today there are absentee owners who oversee their operations from laptops and treos and owners who maintain dual careers or run multiple franchises at hollywood tanning systems inc more than half of the franchise owners have another job the chief executive of sport clips inc hair salons estimates that hours a week is a "generous allowance" for owners to physically be in stores and franchisees for the decor&amp you inc interior design business can receive decorating and product training at home whenever they like via online video seminars even costs are more flexible with investments ranging from as low as &# to more than &# million according to the international franchise association that frees up owners to spread their talents around by opening multiple franchises either of the same brand or even in different industries a departure from the days when the rule of thumb for franchising was "one person one store " says ann dugan author of "franchising " and assistant dean at the university of pittsburgh business school in large part technology has helped fuel the shift making it easier for franchisers to replicate and spread their systems as well as for franchise owners to keep track of their businesses wherever they are an unstable economy has also made the franchise model look more appealing with its entrenched systems and sales history between and about new franchising concepts were launched in such diverse fields as real estate art education construction and health care today there are an estimated u s franchised establishments generating more than &# trillion in economic activity and producing one out of every seven jobs according to the franchise association the result is that franchises must now compete more rigorously with one another for the best owners in part by offering more flexible business models "the concept now is to be in the business but not in the store all the time " says steve greenbaum incoming chairman of the franchise association and ceo of postnet international franchise corp based in denver this new breed of franchise can be seen at the mens hair cutting franchise sport clips where guys watch sporting events while women trim their locks technological advances have translated into a more streamlined inventory system where computer systems self generate orders for products such as shampoo and conditioner when inventory runs low and the ability of franchise owners to track sales over the internet has allowed them to run their stores while working another job "the vast majority of our owners are successful businesspeople who are looking for additional sources of income " says gordon logan founder and chief executive of sport clips based in georgetown texas today there are about sport clips franchises across the country and mr logan estimates that as many as three quarters of the owners have other jobs "we dont want people in the stores hours a week " he says "thats not the type of business we are " likewise mark tucci leads by example for his newly franchised company custom blends franchise services a seller of roll your own tobacco supplies based in york pa mr tucci lives in hilton head s c where he keeps track of sales at his own store in york often via his treo w smartphone and allows his two franchisees to also oversee their businesses from home he says franchisers that require owners to be physically present in their stores "dont put enough faith" in their owners abilities "it assumes the franchisee doesnt know how to remotely manage or hire effective managers who can manage in their place " mr tucci says in part the attitude shift is born out of necessity as franchisers look to attract the best business talent in a digital age where working remotely is an accepted job perk both among baby boomers who may be looking to slow down and among younger workers who demand more work life flexibility "franchising follows demographic and cultural and geographic changes " says ms dugan of the university of pittsburgh "its a trend based model " for instance year old christina clark owns three snap fitness hour gym centers in the minneapolis area with her husband jason she also works full time for jc fitness inc a fitness center flooring company her husband owns the couple say they keep a hands off approach to their franchises by hiring strong operations managers in the facilities they own dropping in only once or twice a month "as far as being an owner goes you can be as absentee as you want " says ms clark who has two sons ages and "if i had to go to the club to pull up all my reports it would be frustrating for me " instead the clarks keep tabs on business through daily emails and can see whats happening in their facilities via cameras they monitor online from home about of some snap fitness franchisees have another job or are semi retirees or stay at home parents says peter taunton founder and ceo of snap fitness inc in chanhassen minn "it allows you to get into a new business without quitting your day job " owning multiple franchises as the clarks do is another element of the new franchise paradigm this approach began gathering steam in the mid to late s among franchisers who wanted to retain talented franchise owners chafing to grow beyond a single unit "historically franchisers did not encourage multiunit operators " says darrell johnson president of frandata an arlington va franchise research firm today mr johnson says about half of all franchise units are controlled by multiunit operators and in a growing number of cases franchise owners are diversifying into multiple franchise brands allowing them to squeeze new revenue streams out of the same territory and occasionally the same customers among franchisees who control more than one unit nearly now own units in different franchise systems according to frandata "a franchisee as they continue to expand their brand theyre working with in a local community at some point they reach a saturation level within that community " mr johnson says "then theyre faced with a decision either to learn about another community or look at other brand opportunities to introduce in a community that they know well thats how you see the multibrand operators growing " a case in point in their recent merger ice cream maker cold stone creamery and fast food purveyor kahala corp formed a new company with some brands and more than franchisees who may own a variety of brands in multiple locations or a single spot such as a food court airport or college campus franchisees are "eager to explore the numerous opportunities for multibranding within our diverse portfolio " says doug ducey ceo of the new kahala cold stone company certainly such diversification and absenteeism has drawbacks "the further away you are from being physically present in a retail situation in particular the more things can happen that are not good " mr johnson says he offers a small but telling example sun reflecting off a misplaced display board may seem a tiny matter but would be of importance to a hands on owner those tiny matters can add up says ms dugan at the university of pittsburgh "any business whether its a franchise or not takes a lot of work " she cautions that without careful management working part time "wont provide the return youre looking for " and the movement carries some risks for franchisers themselves experts caution that all the technological advances might paint a false sense of security about the potential for quick expansion through franchising "if you look at the start up costs of todays franchisers youd find that with legal and development costs its not an easier way to expand " says mr greenbaum the incoming chairman of franchise association people who believe its a quick way to riches "dont understand the commitment it takes " but among those taking the plunge the urge to create more flexible models doesnt show signs of slowing anytime soon even when it comes to once rigid provisions such as pricing it costs about &# to open a bricks and mortar franchise with business partner franchise corp an irwin pa purveyor of promotional gifts signs and embroidered clothing recently however the company added a home based model which goes for &# or about the same price as a new nissan altima today new owners are choosing the home based model to over a retail store says bruce violette chief executive of the company which has locations "people like the flexibility were finding out " mr violette says meantime decor&amp you an interior decorating franchiser based in southbury conn has invested tens of thousands of dollars to build a computer system that includes a virtual classroom for its franchise owners most of whom work from home spread across states the franchisees are in constant need of new data about vendor offerings and education on everything from quickbooks accounting software to sofa construction and the latest window fashions now instead of trying to gather owners in centralized locations for expensive in person instruction much of the information is communicated online via hundreds of classes as well as operations manuals which owners can access at their leisure based on the efficiency of the online learning the company plans to invest in a new generation of software that adds live video capability "im a night owl so i can be on the computer doing stuff from p m to a m " says year old kristina wirick who opened her new port richey fla decor&amp you franchise in she runs it from her parents home across the street from where she lives "if i didnt have any of the technology in place id have no clue how to start a business like this especially at such a young age " ms bounds the wall street journals small business news editor in new york served as contributing editor of this
