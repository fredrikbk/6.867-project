small business a special report stock answers are you ready for a public offering heres how to know an initial public offering of stock it sounds great a company gets an influx of capital and attention but far from being a sure thing an ipo in reality is a long expensive process with the potential to backfire "absolutely there are companies that regret doing the filing " particularly those that suffer stock drops afterward says scott sweet managing partner at tampa fla research firm ipoboutique com whether and when a business is ready for an initial sale of shares depends on several things including its revenue stream growth potential leadership and ability to withstand scrutiny then there is the cost frederick lipman a partner at law firm blank rome llp in philadelphia and author of a book on how to plan for ipos estimates the background work for a traditional filing can cost &# to &# million "the most common mistake is the failure to understand the amount of time and effort that is required and the amount of distraction from the primary business " mr lipman says how might a small company know if it is a candidate for going public a review of the following issues may provide some clues revenue investors want to know that a company is capable of growing and making money so its products or services should have proven appeal biotech and health care companies are the exception sometimes they can go public with very little in the way of sales because the products they are developing havent yet been approved but a small business selling software or networking products and showing zero revenue probably isnt going to fly says mr sweet "in todays market you really need a strong upward revenue stream on an ipo with the only exception being biotechs because of the nature of their business " he says predictability over the next few quarters also is essential says chad abraham head of equity capital markets at piper jaffray &amp co in minneapolis that way when the company is doing its road show a tour in which managers give presentations to prospective investors it can provide some guidance on expectations for financial performance and share price mr abraham says size experts recommend that a business not proceed with a traditional ipo unless its post offering valuation is going to be about &# million or more at that size a company has enough bulk to weather various storms and comply with the stricter disclosure and auditing rules required of public companies a look at the competitive environment in which a company operates may provide clues about ipo readiness experts say a company that is dominant or one of the few dominant firms in a certain business or sector would be more desirable to underwriters and investors than one that is still working to gain a foothold for example people a company can help itself by having people on board who know how to make an ipo happen legal counsel and directors with expertise in the public markets are essential says piper jaffrays mr abraham outside investors such as venture capitalists private equity firms and angel investors with substantial experience taking companies public also can be useful "in many cases theyve got a lot of the relationships needed to get the process rolling " in terms of dealing with underwriters and other people who make the ipo happen says mr abraham he recommends trying to find "one or two key advisers who can really walk you through the process " bigband networks inc a nasdaq listed company that went public march hired chief financial officer fred ball in august because the companys founders were evaluating a share sale and mr ball had been finance chief at a public company mr ball says to of the staff at bigband a redwood city calif provider of technology that enables cable and telephone companies to sell video voice and data services across networks have worked at public companies and that helped smooth the businesss transition to a public entity top executives meanwhile need to be articulate underwriters look for well spoken chief executive officers and chief financial officers mainly because the executives have to explain to potential investors why the business is viable and the stock attractive the business also must be able to withstand the loss of those top executives attention because the ipo process can take up much of their time mr abraham says if it cant the company could take a step backward scrutiny a public company receives more scrutiny than a private one so any firm preparing an ipo should brace itself for intense inspection "the public market is less forgiving on missteps and execution " says mark hantho head of equity capital markets at deutsche bank americas going public means divulging a substantial amount of information about operations and the companys financial condition and complying with laws and regulations that lay out required financial and accounting disclosures anything unusual or unorthodox the companys payment of its ceos country club dues for example likely would draw attention other options with good preparation including an attractive road show predictable returns and reasonable expectations about the ipo process a company can raise its odds of having a successful ipo and reduce its vulnerability to market moodiness which can affect a stocks performance out of the gate but for firms that ultimately decide they want less risk or expense possible options include a sale of the business or merger with a special purpose acquisition company it often is a "dual path process" in which a company files to go public and may end up selling itself instead says mr hantho an acquisition can mean a big payout for the people in charge as well as the creation of a larger stronger organization with a better chance of flourishing especially in sectors where size offers a big advantage a sale to a special purpose acquisition company or spac might work better for a smaller firm because it doesnt cost as much as an ipo to prepare says blank romes mr lipman spacs known as "blank check" companies essentially are empty shells that sell stock to the public to raise money the structure typically dictates a time limit of to months within which the company must find an operating business to purchase whatever path a company chooses it should remember that going public isnt the end but rather the beginning of a new phase says bigbands mr ball "the offering process is short " he says "dont think of it as an end all going public is about establishing those mechanisms and thought processes to be and act like a public company " ms ossinger is a staff reporter for the wall street journal online in new york she can be reached at joanna ossinger wsj com
