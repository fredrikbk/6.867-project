with friends like these how do you fight terror your june editorial "hot topic arafats children" emphasizes the one sided treatment by even our allies of the israeli palestinian conflict our so called friends have done everything possible to not only acquiesce and encourage but even fuel terror by the two main palestinian organizations fatah and hamas perhaps this is a remnant of anti semitism in europe or an attempt by several of these countries to absolve their people of guilt in either conducting or abetting the holocaust however your editorial made one prediction that has already been fulfilled namely that many in the media as well as individual letter writers have already placed the blame for the internecine fighting between hamas and fatah on israel and the bush administration israel is faulted for attempting to protect its citizens from being murdered and not being sufficiently amenable to surrendering its entire territory to the palestinian arabs the bush administration is castigated for not playing a sufficiently active role in settling the israeli palestinian arab conflict the code terminology for not applying pressure to israel while obviously having no influence on the palestinians the media have it wrong the only mistake that was made by israel after arafat refused generous terms for a final peace at camp david and then taba was to surrender further areas in the west bank and then gaza the u s after the failed diplomacy because of the intransigence of yasser arafat did exactly what it should disengage from a fruitless search for peace between the palestinians and israel nelson marans silver spring md
