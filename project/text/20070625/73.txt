though now routine bosses still stumble during layoff process as a new reporter at this papers pittsburgh bureau in the early s i had a front row seat when steel companies battered by lower cost japanese rivals closed plants and laid off thousands of workers and managers there was shock anger and the mistaken belief among many workers that theyd get their jobs back when the economy improved it was the onset of corporate restructuring and the beginning of the end of the era when employees could expect to spend a lifetime at one company today layoffs are a widely accepted way to cut costs at companies big and small in every industry theyre also a common aftermath of mergers and of decisions to outsource jobs exit a business or change the mix of talent in the ranks yet despite the fact that layoffs are commonplace "theres an enormous gap between what managers know they should do and how they act on that knowledge " says robert sutton professor of management science and engineering stanford university most managers hate giving the bad news of course they know what losing a job means to an employee and his or her family but layoffs are a quick way to shore up the bottom line and that becomes a priority because the task is an unpleasant one the biggest mistake managers make is waiting until the last possible moment to inform those being cut then once in the middle of the process they become tongue tied and fail to express any empathy or articulate what the company will provide in the way of severance and other benefits many also dont take the high road they let themselves off the hook by telling themselves and others that those being laid off werent good at their jobs the corporate version of blaming the victim timing and straightforward communication are critical not only for those losing their jobs but for those employees who survive layoffs when managers dont treat terminated employees decently those left behind conclude they arent valued either making them fearful and sometimes pushing them out the door too "the key to driving out fear during difficult times is to give people as much prediction understanding control and compassion as possible " says mr sutton when ron thomas vice president of organizational development at martha stewart living omnimedia coached managers during two rounds of layoffs he advised them on what to expect from themselves and from those getting the bad news the company cut a total of about employees when it closed the catalogue business in and then eliminated its television show in on both occasions "i told managers they werent going to sleep the night before" they had to announce layoffs he says he urged them to "try to envision that one day you may be on the other side of the table so you should treat people the way youd like to be treated in this situation " he adds mr thomas advised managers not to "sugar coat" the news he told them to say "were closing something down and restructuring and unfortunately your job is being eliminated " they should then move quickly to discussing how the company plans to help with severance and other benefits he says he also has arranged outsourcing help for the terminated employees "we make sure people who are losing a job know someone will call them to start helping them within a day " he says he will often use his own network of contacts to help them land new jobs when the catalogue business was closed he called every catalogue company he could think of to inquire about job openings these efforts fostered loyalty among current and former employees and helped the company recruit new talent when martha stewart living launched a new television show it hired back some employees who had been laid off in "if you handle a restructuring well the word gets out that youre a good place to work if we post a job opening today well get resumes tomorrow " says mr thomas an equally big challenge for managers at companies contemplating layoffs is figuring out the actual benefits numerous studies by business professors and management consultants conclude that layoffs while perhaps boosting the bottom line momentarily rarely yield companies sustainable long term savings staff reductions cost companies valuable talent that frequently must be replaced at an even higher cost at a later date they also hurt morale and productivity among survivors this is the case even at some of the most employee friendly companies a study of canadian workplaces between and that offered employees "high involvement work practices " such as training information motivation and latitude suffered productivity losses after layoffs according to christopher zatzick and roderick iverson of simon fraser university who conducted the study survivors at these companies felt their "psychological contract" with bosses had been violated the companies that continued people friendly practices after layoffs however eventually recouped
