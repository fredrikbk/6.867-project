the lefts double standards i read the commentary by mia farrow "no hopes for us " july with interest ms farrow calls for an "international force with the resources and mandate necessary to protect defenseless civilians and the aid workers who are struggling to sustain them" to go to darfur and eastern chad if an "international force" is sent it will surely be led by the united states no one else in the u n will do it and most of the forces in harms way will be our soldiers other countries would send only a token number of troops and require that they be deployed outside of the danger zone thus most lives lost in the "international forces" will be the lives of u s soldiers it must be asked of ms farrow and others who are suggesting this "when u s soldiers start getting killed will they suddenly change their minds start protesting the war and demand that our soldiers be returned home immediately " when we make a commitment like this or like the current one in iraq we must stay until the mission is accomplished or our enemies will think we are weak and attack us in other areas donald c williams lake city mich
