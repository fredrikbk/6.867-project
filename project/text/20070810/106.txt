weekend journal review theater james whitmore comes to dinner the man who came to dinner peterborough players hadley rd peterborough n h &# &# closes aug damn yankees seacoast repertory theatre bow st portsmouth n h &# &# closes aug peterborough n h sixty years ago a year old ex marine named james whitmore made his acting debut at a summer theater in new hampshire from there he went straight to broadway won a tony got snapped up by hollywood and became a familiar face appearing in "the asphalt jungle " "planet of the apes " "the shawshank redemption" and countless other films and tv shows but mr whitmore never forgot where he came from and in recent years hes been performing once again with the peterborough players the much admired troupe that gave him his start this month at an age when most actors would be content to sit back and let the kids strut their stuff hes playing sheridan whiteside in "the man who came to dinner " its a long tough part and i wondered as i drove up to new england whether an year old actor however talented could possibly summon up sufficient energy to make it work i didnt need to worry mr whitmore sailed through it like a youthful trouper gleefully nailing each and every punch line to the back wall of the converted th century barn in which the players have been performing since most of the plays of george s kaufman and moss hart are now gathering dust but "the man who came to dinner " in which they send up alexander woollcott their erstwhile companion of the algonquin round table still holds the stage seven decades after its broadway premiere and long after woollcott himself has ceased to be a household name why does this piece of period spoofery continue to amuse because kaufman and hart were shrewd enough to build an exceedingly well made play around their old friends flamboyantly nasty personality even if you dont have the faintest idea who woollcott was youll get the comic point of a play in it a world famous writer comes to a small ohio town to give a lecture slips on a patch of ice and fractures his hip and spends the next few weeks convalescing in the home of a local family whose members are ill equipped to deal with the unwanted presence of an adder tongued monster of self indulgence gus kaikkonen whose off broadway work with new yorks mint theater company and phoenix theatre ensemble has been highly impressive is in charge of the peterborough players and he has done his very best by "the man who came to dinner " every part of this production from the sturdy set of charles morgan to the down the center performances of the large uniformly excellent cast has the satisfying solidity of an old fashioned broadway show i wouldnt be surprised if the plays original production looked and sounded a lot like this which would explain why it ran for performances the biggest difference between then and now is probably mr whitmore hes a good deal smaller than monty woolley who created the role of sheridan whiteside on broadway and also played it in the film version of "the man who came to dinner " that would have mattered in since woollcott was famously fat harpo marx who also figures prominently in the play once described him as looking like something that had gotten loose from the macys thanksgiving day parade now that the real life whiteside is no longer a living memory though the only thing that matters is whether the actor who plays him has a personality big enough to propel his alter egos sulfurous wisecracks mr whitmore may be on the small side but his rich gravelly voice and abundant gusto leave nothing to be desired it isnt always enjoyable to watch an actor enjoying himself on stage so im pleased to report that the disciplined fun mr whitmore and his colleagues are having is devoid of self indulgence you can tell that they know how good this show is and their delight is impossible to resist you can also tell how happy everybody is to be sharing the stage with an old pro at the end of last thursdays performance they went so far as to serenade their beaming star with a curtain call chorus of cole porters "youre the top " im with them portsmouth n h ninety miles east of peterborough the seacoast repertory theatre whose home is a charming harbor town just across the piscataqua river from maine presents a year round schedule of familiar musicals and straight plays resort town theater can be a dreary affair but the reps bare bones revivals are unpretentiously engaging in part because of the seat basement auditorium in which theyre performed the amphitheater style seating is unusually intimate and john mccluggage the companys new artistic director makes the most of it the young actors in his production of "damn yankees " which is currently playing in repertory with "west side story" more about that musical next week do without microphones scaling their singing to suit the size of the house you wouldnt think that a big brash s musical about a baseball team would work in such close quarters but it comes off quite neatly im not over fond of "damn yankees " the story of a paunchy middle aged baseball fan robert vernon who sells his soul to the devil ed batchelder to become a year old hotshot shortstop michael stoddard mainly because the richard adler jerry ross songs "heart" and "whatever lola wants" excepted are unmemorable still its amusing when done well and mr mccluggages nicely detailed direction and kevin hauges lively choreography are more than sufficiently effective jessica moryl is wickedly cute as lola the temptress who almost always gets what she wants the rest of the cast is vocally uneven but otherwise likable if youre vacationing in or near portsmouth you wont be sorry to spend an evening
