et tu paribas the dead bodies keep floating to the surface in the subprime credit market contagion yesterday hitting frances largest bank bnp paribas and sending global equities into a swoon the question going forward is whether the worlds regulators and central bankers know how to contain this incipient financial panic the european central bank took a sensible step yesterday pumping billion euros of short term liquidity into the system this lender of last resort role is appropriate for a central bank when credit markets seize up as they did yesterday after bnp paribas froze three of its asset backed securities funds several other european banks have also reported losses from the subprime debt market and amid so much uncertainty a surprise like the one at paribas can all too easily trigger a full fledged global run mr trichets job is to restore trust and confidence which he did well yesterday whats becoming clearer by the day is that were watching the unraveling of a global real estate financing bubble the u s subprime market is the heart of the problem but financial innovation has spread the risk around the world in a way that wasnt possible a generation ago long term assets real estate have been financed by hedge funds with short term debt instruments and the amount of the debt now exceeds the value of the collateral in these subprime investments somebody is going to have to swallow the difference and the challenge for regulators in both the u s and europe is to assist this debt workout while protecting an otherwise healthy global economy part of that regulatory challenge is understanding where the biggest problems still are and cauterizing the wounds that shouldnt be construed as an invitation to bailouts quite the opposite amid the asset boom many even conservative institutions began to take surprising risks everyone wanted to be a hedge fund manager and play in such instruments as high risk asset backed securities in announcing the launch of two of the now frozen funds back in bnp paribas asset management said in a press release that asset backed securities "have lost their exotic status and entered the mainstream of fixed income investing " theyve also now entered the history books as non exotic losses one question is who is going to suffer the consequences in suspending even if "temporarily " redemptions from funds that bear its prestigious name bnp paribas was saying it doesnt want to subsidize the losses in its subprime funds from elsewhere in the bank but imagine the outcry if paribas had prevented its retail customers from withdrawing their savings paribas shares did sink after its announcement yesterday while dragging most of the european banking sector down with it that kind of decision only promotes financial contagion by encouraging a run on other hedge funds before they close their redemption windows the market already suspected europe was more vulnerable to the subprime shakeout than was visible to the naked eye perhaps the french regulator and banque de france chief christian noyer might quiz bnp ceo baudouin prot about the banks policy of keeping its promises only last week when presenting second quarter results mr prot claimed that bnp had little exposure to the subprime mortgage market "it was a deliberate choice" to stay clear mr prot said "for many years we didnt get the revenue now we dont get the problems " well now hes found a way of spreading the problems around at least bear stearns parted with its co president warren spector on the weekend after two of its mortgage funds collapsed the larger point here is that the losses should be absorbed by the hedge fund promoters as well as by the investors that means by the equity holders in paribas bear stearns or any of the other big and supposedly safe financial institutions that decided to play in the subprime casino as mr odriscoll notes one of the root causes of the current mess is that bankers concluded they would always be rescued by the federal reserve on that score germanys bundesbank sent the wrong message yesterday by hosting a meeting with the countrys finance minister private banks and state bank kfw to stitch together a billion euros rescue package for ikb deutsche industriebank that small company lender said last week it had run up huge losses in the u s subprime market the subprime mess neednt derail the global economy and it is less likely to do so if paribas and the other hedge fund operators meet their obligations having some of these financial firms swallow the losses for running lousy funds may teach everyone a few salutary lessons about risk
