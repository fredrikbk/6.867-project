democratic dustup theyll find their way back to the middle and if they dont they wont win " so says a blunt harold ford jr chairman of the democratic leadership council of his partys current crop of presidential candidates the question is just how many would be democratic presidents recognize the wisdom of his words mr ford is in a feisty mood throughout our chat as well he might be given the shelling his group has recently endured at the keyboards of the far left skip back years and the dlc stood as the proud architect of bill clintons "new democrat" campaign victory liberals derided the outfits goals of nosing the party back toward the political center but mr clinton understood the perils of running as jimmy carter he took the dlcs advice talked up "opportunity responsibility community" and won today the dlc is again battling for the souls of those democrats who would occupy the white house urging them toward a centrist agenda that will seek to convince the broad middle that democrats can be trusted on national security values and fiscal responsibility mr fords colleague dlc founder al from thinks the stakes are giant and that the publics unease over the war health care and the economy has created the "first time in modern political history" that his party has the opportunity to "build an enduring majority in the progressive center " that is if his party doesnt blow it and mr froms problem is that a whole lot of folks still think him a heretic and this time theyre louder ruder and more coordinated the far left has found something to unify it hatred of george w bush technology has given it the means to organize what the right found in talk radio liberals have found in the "netroots" internet from moveon org to daily kos its activism has of late overshadowed groups like the dlc which still believe in such creaky notions as ideas even mr ford who took over the dlc chairmanship in january is willing to admit his outfit has been eclipsed "the dlc and other moderate groups have struggled a bit to find not only our voice but a way to be heard " making it harder is that this newly energized left is directing inordinate firepower on the dlc itself in a crazed purist drive to purge any group that would exert a moderating influence on the democratic party new republic scribe noam scheiber let loose a few weeks back in a new york times hit piece calling the dlc "radioactive" and "quaint " gloating that its "fading influence was good news for the entire party " and arguing that it should just get lost markos moulitsas chief flogger blogger on the daily kos this week slammed the dlc as a group that wants to "blur distinctions with the gop " and reveling that democrats had won in because liberals like himself had "forced" americans to pick sides the real target audience for these pronouncements is the democratic presidential field and the threat is clear touch the dlc and you will be to use a favorite medieval kos word "punished " at least a few activists danced a victory lap too a few weeks back when every last democratic candidate spurned the dlcs annual convention in nashville instead turning up at mr moulitsass yearlykos event in chicago messrs ford and from in their usual optimistic way insist that backslapping is premature its primary season they note and that means the candidates are catering to the left none of the front runners bothered to show up to the dlc event in either though nominee john kerry was pitching to the group come the summer of "in the primaries you play on one end of the field but you have to play on the whole field in the general " says mr from yes though whats also clear is that so far it has been the netroots calling out the plays from the sidelines congress alone should be cause for the dlcs concern nancy pelosi shrewdly presented her party as more centrist in last years election yet upon winning tossed the gavel to her liberal wing egged on by activists congressional democrats have spent eight months fighting for surrender in iraq tanking trade pacts with latin america and south korea and maneuvering to institute backdoor socialized health care this undoubtedly has something to do with congresss approval rating which now stands below that of even president bush and the presidential candidates mr from says hes happy that none of the front runners have so far "gone off the deep end " but this might be considered faint praise the one grown up on national security has been sen joe biden who barely registers in democratic polls hillary clinton has come out against even a south korean trade deal this from the wife of the dlcer whose own free trade impulses at least his first term delivered nafta and gatt barack obama produced a little shiver among his partys fiscal disciplinarians when he recently blurted out at the kos event in case you were wondering that hed be happy to run up deficits in the name of greater domestic spending no doubt the ultimate nominee will backpedal and finesse these points for the broader national audience just how much finessing goes on just how far the candidates come back to mr fords "middle" will be the ultimate test of whether groups like the dlc have a role in the future of the democratic party mr ford for his part has dark warnings for those activists selling the line that last years election is proof that their liberal ideas are now "mainstream " or that democrats reputation on national security and the economy is so secure that the candidates run no risk going left "thats called short term memory " he says with a few references to carter mondale and other ghosts of failed democrats past as he does his convincing mr ford is going to be holding up a few key facts ones that no belligerent blogger has yet been able to refute the partys most impressive gains last year all came from politicians straight out of the dlc cast four governors spoke at the dlc convention this year all four had beat republicans the vast majority of the pick ups in the house came from dlcers in red states in the south and midwest the senate wouldnt be in democratic hands were it not for montanas jon tester "the reality is without the dlc and without candidates who subscribe to our platform democrats wouldnt be in the majority today if we abandon that group we will lose the majority and we will lose the white house " says mr ford write to kim wsj com
