bumper crops of corn problems by the bushel silo scarcity has farmers hunting for storage space specter of moldy spoilage nevada iowa farmers are up to their ears in corn and scrambling for places to store it with demand for ethanol soaring farmers around the country have planted more acres of corn this year than at any time since world war ii the u s department of agriculture predicts the fall harvest will yield to billion bushels of the grain enough to fill olympic sized swimming pools a far greater quantity than currently available storage capacity its a worrisome situation for farmers who typically choose among selling their grain right away paying elevators to store it or storing it in silos on their farms stashing it gives farmers more flexibility to play the market to their advantage last year some farmers who sold their grain early came to regret it as rising demand for ethanol pushed the price of corn from &# or so a bushel to well past &# but the cloud over the farmers has a silver lining for those in the storage business storage facilities have more business than they can handle and manufacturers of silos and storage equipment are stepping up production silos are more than just cylindrical towers that hold grain walk in doors zinc coated walls and axial fans and heaters are just some possible add on features in recent years silos have increased up to seven times in size from the old standard of the bushel bin to silos that can hold bushels of grain to keep up with the pace of growers silos now require stirring machines to speed dry the grain or sweep away systems to quickly empty the bins silos can cost as much as &# a bushel of capacity with an expected year life span since the u s department of agriculture has awarded farmers across the country &# million in loans to build on farm storage but roger fray executive vice president of the west central cooperative in ralston iowa says storage remains a problem "there has been an industrywide need for storage since the crop and we are trying to catch up " he says a recent visit to the heart of iowa cooperative here in nevada the town pronounces it nah vay dah showed the catch up in action nestled in the heart of corn country where eight foot tall corn stalks stretch along highways the co op began last month to unload five shiny semitrucks full of steel bin roof and leg parts to build additional bushels of much needed storage space the seven location million bushel operation serves farmers and supplies of the grain needed to fuel lincolnway energy the neighboring ethanol plant "with prices for concrete and steel rising we are doing what we can afford right now but we have plans of doubling the entire size of the cooperative " says scott stabbe heart of iowa grain division manager while checking his computer every few minutes for flashing corn prices displayed by the chicago board of trade story county where nevada is located alone looks to produce million bushels of corn and farmers predict a five million bushel shortage in storage capacity at scafco corp a silo maker in spokane wash sales manager dennis queen says sales are up in the past year brock grain systems in milford ind a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway co has added extra weekly shifts and is now running hours a day says district manager john tuttle demand for silos is so high that months long backlogs have developed farmer sam spellman of woodward iowa just witnessed the completion of a silo he ordered last december his supplier menz construction co in perry iowa doubled its production last year but stopped taking orders in december john copple district sales manager for the agriculture industrial division of chief industries in grand isle neb tripled his work crews this year "this business is either feast or famine " he says "in the past we could hardly give a grain bin away and now we have a million bushel backlog " howard shepard program coordinator at the iowa grain quality initiative says bin manufacturers as a whole are running about three years behind the demand the companies that erect the silos are also in huge demand and there arent enough workers to provide the labor needed farmers within miles of ethanol facilities are particularly concerned thats because many ethanol plants want to buy corn directly from nearby farmers to guarantee necessary speed and quality "ethanol factories only hold about days worth of corn but need enough corn to run hours a day every day " says david zimmerman commodities manager at lincolnway energy about miles away from lincolnway energy dewayne berg eagerly anticipates the completion of his new silo monitoring the progress of his bin builders he wipes away "bees knees" what farmers call corn residue that falls from the tall bins like snow from his face "we realized it was a whole new ball game out there and we needed to keep up and add more storage its a bit scary " he says the bushel bin will cost mr berg &# to construct but he predicts that even if a summer drought occurs hell pay off the cost of the bin within two years david menz who also owns a farm says he doubled the amount of his storage space "in the past we could gain to cents a bushel by holding on to our grain but now we can sometimes get a dollar " he says "with four ethanol plants within miles of our farm this is a hot market " farmers and grain elevators without enough storage capacity will place their grain in piles on the ground covering them with tarps for added protection in other years farmers have stored their grain in old schoolhouses airport hangars or caves farmer doug adams from humboldt iowa says "there are two ethanol plants within miles of my farm and i would benefit from adding storage but its just too expensive right now " quality control is no easy task mr berg checks his grain bins every two weeks "we have way too much of an investment inside these bins not to pay close attention " he says otherwise the corn will spoil crack or shrink ethanol plants will reject or severely discount spoiled wet or moldy grain because its hard to ferment and without enough quality corn mr zimmerman says lincolnway energy could run into big problems temporary placement can lead to even more serious damage from heat wind and humidity "placing grain outside is like keeping food outside a refrigerator " says mr tuttle
