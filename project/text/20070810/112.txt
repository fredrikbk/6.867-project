weekend journal the drivers seat five days miles racing through the west in the mph audi r hydroplaning amid frogs like all great road trips this one was spontaneously planned on the same day i was trying to book a flight from detroit to western montana audi called to offer a week in a preproduction version of the r its first ever supercar even for someone who drives cars for a living opportunities for cross country trips in vehicles of this caliber dont come along often companies at the very top of the automotive pecking order aston martin ferrari and lamborghini primarily dont routinely make cars available for review these are exclusive brands that sell limited numbers of high performance vehicles at prices starting in the low six figures and soaring into if you have to ask territory presumably theyre going to sell just as many only several thousand a year regardless of media attention but volkswagen ags audi isnt a high end car company its a mass market luxury brand thats attempting a true limited production exotic car at audi headquarters in germany theyre hoping the miles per hour horsepower r will be mentioned in the same breath as the aston martin v vantage the ferrari f and the lamborghini gallardo theyll even be happy if instead the &# plus a &# gas guzzler tax two seater is favorably compared to the relatively common porsche turbo which is why when i asked if there was any mileage restriction to my test of the r a common limit with exotic cars the answer was "no " i did some quick math and including connections it would take about hours to fly i might spend more than twice the time driving not including stops but this trip could be infinitely more satisfying provided i avoided the dreaded freeway a peek at a pre mapquest era road atlas showed that u s a lightly traveled mostly two lane highway runs from st ignace mich all the way to my destination at glacier national park id be lying if i said i also noticed williston n d population along the route but thats where i found myself about hours after leaving my home in ann arbor mich i had stopped for ice cream and soon enough the car was surrounded by kids they didnt care how much the car cost and didnt ask whether two golf bags fit behind the seats audis specious answer is "yes " there was only one thing that their gasoline and testosterone addled brains wanted to know and they waited for my answer as if i was about to reveal the secret of the universe "yeah " i said "its really fast " i wasnt about to give anyone a ride as proof and i didnt have to confess to doubling the speed limit a few hours earlier the sci fi look of the r with its airfoil side vents and led running lights vouched for me i encouraged the juvie gang in the parking lot to step closer unlike a lot of other very nice very expensive cars the r seems to have a force field that holds gawkers at bay i popped open the glass hatchback that covers the engine compartment and out came a blast of heat that was noticeable even in the abnormally warm summer air we all stared at the sculpture that is the rs mid mounted liter direct injection v i asked one of the kids how old he was he told me he was then he showed me his drivers license and pointed across the lot to a dodge pickup named for this farm state "thats my truck " he said of the dakota he had braces and acne and i wondered how much trouble he had reaching the pedals but that permit made him the leader of the pack of pubescent kids the r had thoroughly dumbfounded the lot of them the kid smiled at me and approvingly at the r and said "thats the most amazing car thats ever come through this place " who was i to argue we were closer to the canadian border than to an interstate highway and on my own list of amazing cars driven over nearly a decade as an automotive journalist i figured the r stood fairly near the top after a few more minutes of loitering i slid back down into the cockpit revved the engine to its rpm redline and the pound aluminum rocket shot me out of town with all the quickness of its advertised second zero to mph time when i arrived home a few days later the final tally showed miles traveled over five days and five nights with a friends wedding sandwiched in the middle the audi drank just more than &# of premium gas with an overall fuel economy of miles per gallon despite several long stretches averaging superlegal speeds the r managed this without complaint save for a few hours of biblical rainfall in minnesota that not only caused its wide inch tires to hydroplane but also coated i with dead frogs providing a most bizarre test of the cars excellent all wheel drive system about miles from home the onboard computer did issue a warning that the oil level was low still it was a good showing audi would have us believe that the almost trouble free trip i enjoyed had something to do with its recent success at the hours of le mans what with the r street car bearing the same name as audis dominant endurance racing car i wont dispute the assertion but neither will i suggest that the r i drove is anything like a real race car its much more like audis &# tt coupe and not just because the cars share a steering wheel and similar interior putting in over miles a day was actually a comfortable enjoyable experience as the r was docile quiet and virtually effortless to drive but you dont buy a six figure supercar for its repose or do you i had a lot of time during my trip to ponder this question and its corollary which is that a real exotic sports car is loud harsh cramped unforgiving and difficult to drive yet the r is none of these things and all the better for it to start with id guess we wont see too many rs on www wreckedexotics com the car is so well balanced and has such extreme levels of grip that you can basically point it where you want to go and get on the throttle with impunity its suspension is stiff when it needs to be yet comfortable enough to manage thoroughly awful pavement at a brisk pace indeed logging a few miles around some lakes and up and down mountain passes proved that the rs performance is as over the top as any sports car on the road and will suffice for all but the sorts of geeks who like to throw around road &amp track test numbers at cocktail parties if the r is lacking anything it would be cargo capacity complaining about this however is like sending your gazpacho back to the kitchen because its too cold between the small front trunk and the shelf behind the seats theres room for enough soft sided luggage to get you anywhere you need to go presumably if you have the means to own an r youll be staying somewhere with a laundry regardless owners should drive their r rather than park it in the garage waiting for it to appreciate in value exotics too often fall prey to this sort of speculation or wind up in the hands of owners loathe to get them out on the road and splat a few bugs on the windshield it is for the obvious good of man that i wish the few hundred rs that audi plans to sell in the u s each year meet a better fate after all there are kids out there who dream about these kinds of cars and after my road trip in the r im happy to say that im still one of them contact me at jeff sabatini wsj com
