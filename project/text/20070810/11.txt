thought of writing a book until she had a dream about a teenage girl and a handsome vampire "it sounds so cheesy but that dream is chapter in my first novel " says ms meyer "i saw two characters talking about the fact that they were in love he was telling her that his problem was that he wanted to kill her because she smelled so tasty " the next day ms meyer began to write at the time her three sons were and she didnt have an outline she didnt have a plot and she didnt have an agent nor did she tell her husband but after her sister called to complain that she hadnt heard from ms meyer in weeks she confessed "i was ashamed to tell her because it was a vampire story " she says later after she finished her sister urged her to try to sell it ms meyer did what anybody might do in her situation she looked online for advice she then sent off a one page literary query to various literary agencies to her surprise writers house in new york wrote back and asked her for the first three chapters "they sounded excited so i was excited " she says jodi reamer who now represents ms meyer said her assistant recommended she read the manuscript originally titled "forks " ms reamer suggested they come up with a new title and eventually they agreed on "twilight " ms reamer then submitted the manuscript to nine editors ms tingley was the first to reply "i know im on to something big when i respond to something that is outside my favorite genres " says ms tingley "im not a vampire fan and im not a romance fan either but this book has vampires romance and suspense also the heroine is

printing of one million copies of "eclipse " is going back to press for more she noted that the books dont include sexually provocative material or graphic language which makes it an easier sell for parents "there is a lot of young adult fiction that is pretty racy but parents know these books are romantic not sexual " she says ms meyer says that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she has read only one vampire tale a novel by anne rice "im not a vampire fan " she says "i havent read dracula and i dont watch scary movies " the author a mormon adds that her faith has influenced her work in particular she says her characters tend to think more about where they came from and where they are going than might be typical "is there nothing if it all stops " she says "they worry " and while some young adult novels tackle edgier subjects ms meyer has steered her work away from them "i dont think teens need to read about gratuitous sex " she says she does however
