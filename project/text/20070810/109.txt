weekend journal taste de gustibus ruslan on ice a druze boys olympic dreams toronto ruslan mahmud is a fairly typical year old his favorite band is metallica the best movie hes seen this summer is "saw iii " he already wears an earring never mind that hes barely feet tall asked about his favorite subject in school he sagaciously answers "nothing " so what am i doing at a fancy french restaurant along with an olympic medalist and a nuclear energy executive earnestly interviewing this child at dow joness expense the short answer is that he is a hugely promising figure skater who trains with some of the worlds best at the elite toronto cricket skating and curling club the longer answer is that he is one very improbable boy to get a better sense of ruslan check out a film called "the syrian bride" the film tells the mostly true story of a day in the life of a druze family from the barren hillside town of majdal shams on the golan heights a daughter is betrothed to a man she has never met the fiance is a damascene druze meaning that she will have to cross the heavily guarded border from israel to syria to consummate the marriage leaving her family and hometown behind forever a family cum political drama ensues involving among other subplots a sister who wants to get an advanced degree at an israeli university over the objections of her traditionally minded husband a paterfamilias with strong pro syrian political views who will stop at nothing to see his daughter off at the border over the objections of an israeli police chief a brother who wants to bed a lithesome french u n staff officer over her objections a second brother who has married a catholic woman from russia over the objections of the highly endogamous druze community that second brother hasan hatem in the movie is ruslans father his wife victoria evelyna is ruslans mother with their three children they live in the picturesque israeli town of metulla hard on the border with lebanon hasan is a lawyer victoria is a pharmaceutical researcher and ruslans older brother nazar is a soldier in the israeli army all in all they are a perfectly ordinary hebrew speaking family with one small difference not a drop of jewish blood runs in their veins nonetheless when i ask ruslan how he feels about israel he answers without hesitation "i love it " when ruslan was he began skating at the metulla ice rink the only one in all of israel "it started like a hobby " he says by age he was the israeli champion in his age group a title he has held ever since at age he managed a double axel in he placed second at a european novices competition in zagreb croatia losing out to a hungarian though he failed to qualify for the same tournament the next year he did have a decent excuse at the time he was living as a refugee in majdal shams while metulla was under intense and close range fire from hezbollah mortars and katyusha rockets the war came and went and the skating resumed though the notion of israeli figure skating invariably inspires comparisons to jamaican bobsledding the sport has gotten a boost in the country thanks to some talented russian and american arrivals sergei sakhnovski and his partner galit chait took eighth place at the winter olympics but there are limitations metullas pro size rink closes down in the summer and the best israeli skaters must go abroad to find better facilities and professional trainers for ruslan to have a chance to skate at a higher level he had to do the same as it turns out a friend of the mahmud family is an israelophilic frenchman named armand laferrere a former aide to nicolas sarkozy who now runs the canadian operations of the french nuclear energy consortium areva mr laferrere promised to shop a tape of ruslans performance in zagreb to trainers in canada he found one in brian orser who took silver at the sarajevo and calgary olympics and is the father of the triple axel now de rigueur among top ranked male skaters mr orser watched the tape declared "this kid can go very far " and accepted him into his clinic ruslan was on his way which brings me here now earlier in the day i watched ruslan go through his routine of double axels triple toes sit spins and camels from the sidelines of the cricket clubs rink ordinarily i hate figure skating competitions i keep expecting the skaters to fall but to watch them at practice is a pleasure it helps that on the ice are recognized stars like year old yuna kim of south korea considered a favorite for the vancouver olympics ruslan is not yet in yunas class but he is a disciplined athlete with his eye fixed on the sochi olympics in "the olympics isnt something you just dream about " he says "you have to do it " this kind of drive is rare among kids his age though its both a norm and a necessity among athletes with his aspirations will he make it that depends partly on him partly on people such as mr laferrere who is trying to arrange a visa funding and a foster family for ruslan to enable him to return to canada next year and partly on the vagaries of fate maybe war will break out again on the edges of his town maybe hell break a leg what is improbable however if not actually miraculous is that this israeli grandson of a syrian army officer should through strange combinations of circumstance and talent now find himself where he is ruslan mahmud whose very name nearly says it all is beyond identity any objections mr stephens writes "global view " the wall street journals foreign affairs column
