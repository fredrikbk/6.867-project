the daily fix caffeine cigarettes and gambling lift john daly to strong pga start online edition john daly the no ranked golfer in the world but perhaps the no most quotable duffer on tour walked into the clubhouse thursday at the pga championship three strokes under par and ahead of all but one competitor "all the fitness freaks and bottled water junkies the keeners here at a m sports psychologists in tow to practise when the heat is tolerable all of them are looking up at daly and one graeme storm an obscure english pro who shot " dave perkins writes in the toronto star "daly didnt play a single practice round here too hot he said and didnt drink any water during his round deferring as usual to diet pop when he felt the heat and humidity close in he sought old fashioned remedies light up a cigarette and drink some caffeine it actually works daly said and for one day and probably only one yes it did because everything did he bombed drives escaped the rough sufficiently and putted beautifully hes usually good on greens at least when hes trying and avoided the train wrecks that are as famous a calling card as his lifestyle " mr perkins has pulled just a few highlights from mr dalys entertaining press conference the full transcript is here washington post columnist sally jenkins captures the joy that mr daly can bring to a major when hes in the running "people hollered at him and he waved back and obliged them with gargantuan swings at the ball epic thrashings and titanic mistakes he chain smoked and pulled from a bottle of diet pepsi he kept stuck in his bag all in all it was as much fun as anyones had at a major championship since well daly last contended and it was a reminder of how badly the game of golf needs daly in the field needs his humor his havoc his vivid combination of massive physical strength and shuddering human weakness " if mr dalys weaknesses keep him from contention on sunday as many golf writers seem to expect then who will win at mission hills fix golf guru tim carroll thinks he knows and his pick is in contention heading into fridays second round the worlds most popular soccer league returns saturday with the start of the english premierships season toronto star columnist cathal kelly expects more of the usual domination by the quartet of manchester united chelsea liverpool and arsenal "barring calamity the half dozen penthouse dwellers will hang on to their spots after another four months of lavish outlays on the worlds best players " mr kelly writes "then there are the majority the middle classes who try desperately to prevent their betters from stealing their emerging stars while also picking out a few diamonds in the rough for themselves " manchester city now owned by ousted thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra and coached by ousted england manager sven goran eriksson also may contend "eriksson has clearly been a closet alchemist forming his new squad in his mind while he waited for the right opportunity to present itself " rob hughes writes in the international herald tribune "he must have spent those unemployed days and nights nurturing his contacts with player agents casting covetous eyes on the international player pool especially in portugal and italy where he coached before arriving in england " david beckham former captain of manchester citys intracity rival man u made his official major league soccer debut yesterday playing in the last minutes of the los angeles galaxys loss to d c united washington post columnist michael wilbon reminds readers beckham is hardly the equal of dutch midfielder johan cruyff who played for the washington diplomats of the north american soccer league more than a quarter century ago "beckham in his wildest fantasies isnt and hasnt ever been the player cruyff was " mr wilbon writes "cruyff was steve nash he was on the ball he owned the ball you never wanted to take your eyes of cruyff even when he was past his prime which is to say when his days of world cup heroics were over and he came to the u s to help lift soccer in america to new heights " speaking of mr nash the phoenix suns point guard is training for his future career in the mls or premiership he was spotted tuesday in new yorks central park by nathaniel vinton of the new york times playing for his rec league team in what was supposed to be a match against members of the mlss local team a year before the start of beijings summer olympic games espn coms wright thompson travels chinas highway to see how the games are received outside the capital "in the next week we will see exactly one sign for the games that is not in a city " mr thompson writes "but the cities they are full of signs thousands of them each one connected to an advertisement the olympics it seems are mostly about selling things about a consumer revolution the peasants dont have the money to buy these trappings of modern life " the detroit lions and dallas cowboys began their nfl preseasons with wins over the cincinnati bengals and indianapolis colts the games dont count the scores are irrelevant but columnists in the victorious cities nonetheless hunted for some meaning dallas morning news columnist jean jacques taylor was glad to see the cowboys quarterback and wide receiver getting along "tony romos work was done early in the second quarter when television cameras showed him chatting amiably with terrell owens on the sideline " mr taylor writes "as the first half of the cowboys preseason opener against indianapolis ended those same cameras captured romo and t o laughing and conversing as they headed toward the locker room then the duo did their postgame news conference side by side in the middle of the cowboys locker room with each player heaping mounds of praise upon the other " the lions offense will have to click as well for the team to contend "the lions best hope their only hope really is that they will outgun their opponents " michael rosenberg writes in the detroit free press "because rest assured teams will pass like crazy against the lions opposing quarterbacks are going to bring popcorn to their film sessions " meanwhile before the season even begins tampa bay fullback mike alstott is pondering retirement "this time next year he will be with two major neck injuries behind him " gary shelton writes in the st petersburg times "as much as tampa bay has enjoyed watching him run it should now encourage him to walk away its a strange thing the way love works there have been better athletes than alstott faster ones stronger ones but there was a passion that bubbled out of alstott and poured into the stands with every tackle he would break tampa bay liked the guy a little more this was an affair that went beyond statistics beyond stardom " you want civic love for a player try the dramatic return rick ankiel made to the st louis cardinals last night the one time pitcher who reinvented

stunned the delirious fans the ecstatic cardinals the padres " bernie miklasz writes in the st louis post dispatch "and after ankiel sent that incredible flare that officially signaled his reentry did you see the look on the face of cardinals manager tony la russa in the dugout its been a tough season in americas baseball center for la russa he had not smiled like this or applauded with such vigor all season but what ankiel did prompted la russa to let loose hes such a special young man la russa said short of winning the world series thats the happiest ive seen our club and other than winning that world series thats as happy as ive ever been in this uniform " tip of the fix cap to readers michelle alessandri john falck don hartline and karen okupniak found a good column from the world of
