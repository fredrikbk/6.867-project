traditional of our picks the quart electric white mountain ice cream freezer &# from amazon com proved a bit too complicated it required loading up the machines wooden bucket with plenty of ice and rock salt then placing that bucket in another container in case anything spilled or leaked the machine was also the noisiest of our tested models but the white mountain did produce an especially well blended ice cream the company now owned by appliance giant rival has history on its side it introduced its first ice cream maker a hand crank model in less than three decades after this then revolutionary style of machine was said to have been invented by a new jersey woman white mountain still makes old fashioned hand crank models but the electric ones will spare you some effort another
