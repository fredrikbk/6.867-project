weekend journal the wealth report cutting edge executives top managers find inner peace in carpentry a &# sander that eats its own dust his peers buy yachts vintage wine and high end golf gear for fun but for software executive jon ramsey theres nothing like the deep rumble of a &# powermatic table saw "it sounds like a jet airplane taking off " he says the powermatic is the centerpiece of mr ramseys basement workshop where he turns raw lumber into finely crafted tables and dressers for his home its noisy sweaty work and thats just fine for him and many other senior executives like him old fashioned woodworking is the perfect antidote to the endless blizzards of memos meetings and strategy shifts that define life at the top affluent amateur carpenters have been around for decades but the current boom is being fueled by a belief that escaping to the world of chisels saws and glue can whisk away the stresses of modern corporate life traffic is growing at web sites that cater to

products were curiosities now customers flock to them the biggest challenge is "keeping our waiting list orderly " says lawanna bales highlands chief executive officer handmade tool makers are also gaining cult status particularly among fussy customers with unlimited budgets when phillip rademacher a lawrence kan money manager decided this summer to build a foot high gazebo in his spare time he ordered four hand forged chisels from barr tools of mccall idaho they cost as much as &# each vastly more than what big hardware chains charge for machine made alternatives but mr rademacher says he never hesitated "with barr chisels you can peel off a paper thin piece of wood without any trouble " he says barr quarton the blacksmith who makes barr chisels started out selling primarily to

coffee table a cherry mirror and a walk in wooden rocket ship that he built for his children creating all these projects "helps me relax " mr bass says "it helps me be calmer about dealing with wall street and it gives me a deeper understanding of design thats important because we sell our software to designers who make movies cars and the like " for george cigale the ceo of tutor com inc building cabinets at home provides a vital chance to clear his head of workday clutter cellphones dont ring staff meetings arent packed back to back well meaning subordinates dont write down every word he says instead he says he can let his mind wander "ill play through difficult conversations of the past week " he says his new york based company provides online tutoring for grade school and high school students its customer base is changing and mr cigale is trying to get the balance right between his traditional library based sales channel and new chances to connect directly with families "the best strategic thinking for me happens when im not fully engaged " he says for bob thornborough of calgary alberta woodworking is a chance to escape the sour moments of a long career he spent much of the past decade as president of learning management corp an educational software company and had a big say in matters like pricing and customer acquisition he didnt call all the shots however after the company was sold he parted ways with the new owners now he has become an avid builder of wooden clocks to produce perfect clock gears some have as many as teeth he bought a computerized routing machine on the internet for about &# he experiments with a vast range of woods including baltic birch and black walnut "for the first time in my life i can do exactly what i want " mr thornborough says his wooden clocks dont keep perfect time but they look beautiful he says mr ramsey who is chief technology officer at atlanta based secureworks inc has a host of other top tier

however hedonism takes over when mr turner smoothes wood its with a &# festool hand sander that has a tiny built in vacuum that sucks up the sawdust "no cleanup " he says some of mr turners favorite
