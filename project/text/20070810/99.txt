tv channels move to web think outside the cable box when the black family channel launched on cable television in its executives and celebrity investors including boxer evander holyfield and the jackson fives marlon jackson had big plans to bring socially responsible tv shows to african americans but in may the black family channel said it was abandoning tv and instead would become an online only channel despite some inroads it eventually reached million homes the atlanta based company had struggled to get cable providers to offer the channel in enough homes to attract advertisers the internet which offers tools like social networking and blogs provided a fresh opportunity "today if you want to start a cable network it might be easier to schedule a ride to the moon " says rick newberger chief executive of the black family channel "but in the world of broadband you can do so much more than just run programming " across the cable tv industry other independent channels are also turning away from tv to the internet the lime channel which focuses on healthy living pulled out of cable last year and now offers its programming online and as video on demand the employment and career channel which began streaming online in has junked its attempts to be a cable tv channel to be an online only outlet others like the horror channel and horsetv which revolves around equestrian events have also opted to go online the shift illustrates how the internet is offering a second chance to certain segments of old media web based tv is now becoming a more viable business route and internet video is exploding running an online only video channel which doesnt require expensive cameras and broadcasting gear is cheaper than operating a cable tv channel while starting a new cable channel today takes an initial investment of &# million to &# million a broadband channel needs just &# million to &# million to get going says boston based research firm broadband directions the internet is offering a new outlet for voices including those of ethnic minorities that werent heard from as much under old media the black family channel was repeatedly denied carriage by cable and satellite operators who cited a lack of community interest in its programming on the web mr newberger says he expects to more easily tap into the african american community all of this could turn web based tv into a more competitive medium overall the worldwide market for online content is expected to grow to more than million households by from about million households last year according to research firm in stat but the cable channels move to the internet is a gamble transforming into an online channel often requires a wholesale change including hiring new employees with web and software expertise finding an audience online is also daunting and the business model for online video remains unclear the horror channel initially planned to rely on internet advertising as a source of revenue but the site didnt generate enough traffic to attract enough advertisers tom adams president of adams media research a carmel calif based media and entertainment research consulting firm says the black family channel is facing a major challenge by moving to the web and will have to create eye catching content to attract viewers "without a big brand behind you you have to do a lot to make it work " he said indeed the track record of many online only channels is mixed many of the web sites dont get enough visitor traffic to make the radar screens of web trackers the employment and career channel says it hasnt turned a profit since going online in the lime channel registered nearly visitors to its web site in june up from in january but still down from the eight million households it reached while on cable tv "were making things up as we go along " says nick psaltos founder of the online only horror channel guttenberg n j "the opportunity is there but without the right execution we wont be able to seize it " the idea behind the black family channel was to build an alternative to viacom inc s black entertainment television inc which reaches million homes bet has been criticized for carrying sexually charged music videos and controversial programs like "hot ghetto mess " later retitled "we got to do better " the black family channel created programs aimed at parents and kids including a spelling game show for fourth and fifth graders and a baby boomer talk show from its launch however the black family channel was a struggle to operate say former employees many cable and satellite operators believed viewers had enough african american programming from channels like bet and another african american channel called tv one in black family channel managers launched a campaign to convince satellite operators to carry their channel in one instance a manager presented a leather bound book with signatures from interested viewers to an operator but the operator didnt budge "everyone hoped we could find our way " says samara cummins the channels former vice president of affiliate sales who left last year "unfortunately the financial burden took a toll " she says that while cable channels need at least &# in monthly revenue to survive the black family channel took in less than &# in monthly revenue primarily from financial services and consumer products advertisers such as verizon communications inc and auto insurer geico corp a unit of berkshire hathaway inc the black family channel is now revamping its old web site into a new online destination that will combine video social networking user generated content and ecommerce says mr newberger the site is set to launch in november mr newberger a year cable veteran who previously headed vanguard media corp says the new web site will make money through advertising subscription fees for some services and merchandise sales of things like t shirts he says he plans to contact prominent deejays bloggers and community advocates in the african american community to get the word out about the site the goal is for the channel to break even after a year he adds to prepare for the jump to the net the channel in may laid off most of its nearly employees many of whom specialized in tv production and advertising mr newberger has since begun contracting with an online agency to build the new site he declines to name the agency the channel is also about to embark on a hiring binge with plans to initially recruit new staffers including recent college grads and media professionals with experience in social networking and web video overall the black family channel is putting in &# million to &# million to switch to the web kenneth reaves an atlanta based financial adviser says he often allowed his three children to watch the black family channel unsupervised which he rarely permitted for other channels so he was disappointed when the channel left the air now he says he looks forward to the black family channel re emerging online since he anticipates that the web site will combine educational video programming with other web resources "if they play it right the channel will be able to take advantage of all sorts of opportunities " mr reaves says
