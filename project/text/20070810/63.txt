our subprime fed in recent years monetary policy has created an expectation that the federal reserve will bail out investors when asset bubbles deflate the recent crisis in the subprime mortgage market is at least partly the outcome of this new approach to monetary policy that crisis has already had widespread ramifications for homeowners and investors in february the popular press discovered subprime mortgage loans when two major originators of such loans hsbc holdings plc and new century financial disclosed increased loan loss provisions hsbc is a globally diversified financial company while it was a large lender in the market the aggregate amount of its subprime loans was not a significant portion of its total portfolio new century financial fared much less well because of the concentration of its lending in this risky category its stock price collapsed after problems surfaced on feb and the company eventually declared bankruptcy other lenders in the subprime market experienced difficulties fears of a housing collapse and even an economic recession grew as investors gauged the size and extent of the problem in the mortgage market the crisis was foreseen for more than a year before the bust bankers analysts and even regulators knew they had a mess in the making and once the mess became clear it wasnt hard to see what was wrong lending practices in the subprime market were "shoddy and absurd " said john makin of the american enterprise institute in march of this year lewis ranieri former chairman of salomon brothers echoed those comments in this newspaper when he observed "were not really sure what the guys income is and were not sure what the house is worth so you can understand why some of us become a little nervous " mr ranieri helped pioneer the bundling of mortgages into marketable securities "securitization" so he should know the collapse of the subprime mortgage market is the latest in a series of financial bubbles whose existence reflects at least in part moral hazard in financial markets at one time deposit insurance was a major culprit for example in an october speech to economists in new york then fed governor ben bernanke described the savings and loans crisis of the s as "a situation in which institutions can directly or indirectly take speculative positions using funds protected by the deposit insurance safety net the classic heads i win tails you lose situation " after an intellectual and political battle of more than a decade the deposit insurance loophole was sealed today monetary policy is fostering moral hazard monetary policy can generate moral hazard if it is conducted so as to bail investors out of risky and otherwise ill advised financial commitments if investors come to expect that the policy will persist then they will deliberately take on additional risk without demanding commensurately higher returns in effect they will lend at the risk free interest rate on risky projects or at least at a lower rate than would otherwise be the case too much risky lending and investment will take place and capital will be misallocated the new moral hazard in financial markets has its source in what can be best described as the greenspan doctrine the doctrine was clearly enunciated by alan greenspan in his december speech mr greenspan argued that asset bubbles cannot be detected and monetary policy ought not to in any case be used to offset them the collapse of bubbles can be detected however and monetary policy ought to be used to offset the fallout two months earlier mr bernanke endorsed the greenspan doctrine arguing against the use of monetary policy to prevent asset bubbles "first the fed cannot reliably identify bubbles in asset prices second even if it could identify bubbles monetary policy is far too blunt a tool for effective use against them " since mr bernanke is now fed chairman it is reasonable for market participants to assume that the greenspan doctrine still governs current fed policy the two men were surely asking and answering the wrong question they were implicitly treating bubbles as solely the consequences of real shocks or disturbances an example of a real shock is a technological innovation leading to productivity gains and higher future expected profits in a sector they asked whether monetary policy should be used to offset the effects of real shocks and concluded that it should not the latter is the correct answer to the question they each posed a different question would be to ask whether monetary policy should be conducted so as to create or exacerbate asset bubbles the answer to that question is surely "no " consider mr bernankes apt characterization of moral hazard in the context of the deposit insurance crisis "when this moral hazard is present credit flows rapidly into inelastically supplied assets such as real estate rapid appreciation is the result until the inevitable albeit belated regulatory crackdown stops the flow of credit and leads to an asset price crash " he could have been talking about the subprime mortgage market the fed pre announced that it will take no action against bubbles but will act aggressively to offset the consequences of their collapse in effect the central bank is promising at least a partial bailout of bad investments the logic of the old deposit insurance system is at work policymakers should protect investors against losses no matter their folly or in mr greenspans own words monetary policy should "mitigate the fallout of an asset bubble when it occurs and hopefully ease the transition to the next expansion " in the present context the "next expansion" could also be rendered as "the next asset bubble " if the fed promises to "mitigate the fallout" from "irrational exuberance " then it is rational for investors to be exuberant investors may be at risk for some loss as with a deductible on a conventional insurance policy but losses are still being mitigated the bernanke fed has confused matters for investors by not yet cutting interest rates in the face of the recent crisis there are two possible not mutually exclusive reasons for its not doing so first it may not view the current crisis as serious enough second current price inflation is above its comfort zone and the fed may feel it has no room to maneuver time will only tell which is at work the fed cut the fed funds rate sharply after the bursting of the stock market bubble in march in the eyes of many the fed cut rates too far and held them down too long fueling not only a vigorous economic expansion but also the housing bubble in his december speech mr greenspan was at pains to deflect any argument that the fed was inflating a housing bubble "to be sure " he acknowledged mortgage debt was high relative to household income remember the date by historical norms but "low interest rates" were keeping the servicing requirements of the mortgage debt manageable emphasis added "moreover owing to continued large gains in residential real estate values equity in homes has continued to rise despite very large debt financed extractions " how wrong the fed chairman was if mr greenspan was not worried about interest rates resetting however why should mortgage bankers and homeowners worry it would have been reasonable to read into the chairmans musings an implicit guarantee of continued low rates a homeowner is certainly entitled to bet his home on the come if he wants should the central bank encourage such behavior however a monetary policy of substantial stimulus will have a number of real consequences including asset bubbles these asset bubbles have real costs and involve misallocations of capital for example by the peak of the tech and telecom boom in march too much capital had been invested in high tech companies and too little in "old economy firms " too much fiber optic cable was laid and too few miles of railroad track were laid by worried about the possibility of price deflation the fed introduced a strong anti deflationary bias a tilt to stimulus was understandable at the time a continued bias against deflation at any cost however will produce a continued bias upward in price inflation with the bursting of each asset bubble and the fear of deflationary pressure fed policy must ease the greenspan doctrine prescribes a stimulative overkill that begins the cycle anew the greenspan era gains against inflation will then prove to be only temporary his doctrine will be the death of his legacy a legacy that already includes a housing bubble and its aftermath mr odriscoll a former vice president with the dallas fed and a former director of policy analysis at citigroup is a senior fellow at the cato institute
