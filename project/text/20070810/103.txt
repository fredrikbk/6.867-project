especially imaginary ones second life and other multiplayer games are moving into the mainstream with some million people now involved world wide there is mounting concern that some are squandering even damaging their real lives by obsessing over their "second" ones thats always been a concern with videogames but a field of study suggests that the boundary between virtual worlds and reality may be more porous than experts previously imagined nearly of men and of women who play online games said their virtual friends were equal to or better than their real life friends according to a survey of gamers conducted by nick yee a recent ph d graduate from stanford university more than a quarter of gamers said the emotional highlight of the past week occurred in a computer world according to the survey which was published in by massachusetts institute of technology presss journal presence "theres a fuzziness thats emerging between the virtual world and the real world " says edward

to according to linden labs most recent data a typical "gamer" spends to hours a week in a virtual world academics have only recently begun to intensively study the social dynamics of virtual worlds but some say they are astonished by how closely virtual relationships mirror real life "people respond to interactive technology on social and emotional levels much more than we ever thought " says byron reeves a professor of communication at stanford university "people feel bad when something bad happens to their avatar and they feel quite good when something good happens " on a neurological level players may not distinguish between virtual and real life relationships recent studies suggest in an experiment conducted at the university of washingtons institute for learning and brain sciences test subjects were hooked up to neuroimaging machines while they played a simple computer game in which they moved colored discs to form a pattern when told that they were playing with a person rather than a computer participants showed increased activity in areas of the brain that govern social interaction other experiments show that people socializing in virtual worlds remain sensitive to subtle cues like eye contact in one study participants moved their avatars back if another character stood too close even though the space violation was merely virtual says jeremy bailenson director of stanfords virtual human interaction lab which was created five years ago to study social behavior in virtual worlds "our brains are not specialized for st century media " says prof reeves "theres no switch that says process this differently because its on a screen " on a saturday afternoon in july mr hoogestraat decides to go to the beach he lights a cigarette and enters

hoogestraats real life wife is losing patience with her husbands second life "its sad its a waste of human life " says mrs hoogestraat who is dark haired and heavy set with smooth pale skin "everybody has their hobbies but when its from six in the morning until two in the morning thats not a hobby thats your life " the real mrs hoogestraat is no stranger to online communities she met her husband in a computer chat room three years ago both were divorced and had adult children from previous marriages and mrs hoogestraat says she was relieved to find someone educated and adventurous after years of failed relationships now as she pays household bills cooks does laundry takes care of their three dogs and empties ashtrays around the house while her husband spends hours designing outfits for virtual strippers and creating labels for virtual coffee cups she wonders what happened to the person she married one saturday night in early june she discovered his cyber wife he called her over to

tried to get her involved so we could play together but she wasnt interested " family law experts and marital counselors say theyre seeing a growing number of marriages dissolve over virtual infidelity cyber affairs dont legally count as adultery unless they cross over into the real world but they may be cited as grounds for divorce and could be a factor in determining alimony and child custody in some states according to several legal experts including jeff atkinson professor at the depaul university college of law and author of the american bar associations "guide to marriage divorce and families " this past june the american medical association called for more psychiatric research on excessive gaming but backed away from classifying videogame addiction as a formal disorder some gamers say the addictive dangers have been overstated citing surveys that show most players spend fewer hours online than the average american spends watching television and unlike television online games are social in june when mr hoogestraat first logged on to second life after he had his gall bladder removed he was greeted with messages from virtual friends asking him how the surgery went still some antigaming organizations and psychiatrists say the social aspects of such games may be driving up pressure to play for longer stretches kimberly young a clinical psychologist and founder of the center for internet addiction recovery said the majority of the cases a year she sees for counseling involve interactive fantasy role playing games "they start forming attachments to other players " she says "they start shutting out their primary relationships " back in the world of second life mr hoogestraats avatar and tenaj have gotten bored at the beach so they teleport to his office a second floor room with a large tinted window overlooking the stage of the strip club he owns tenaj plays with her pug jolly roger commanding the dog to sit and fetch its toy dutch drinks

is shirtless in cut off denim shorts and flip flops and renovating the lower level of his mall "sunday is my heavy duty work day " mr hoogestraat explains earlier that morning he evicted shop owners who hadnt paid rent and signed up four new vendors including an avatar named arianna who sells virtual necklaces and womens shoes from the kitchen mrs hoogestraat asks if he wants breakfast he doesnt

chaps and motorcycle gloves and teleports to a place with a curvy mountain road its one of his favorite places for riding his harley look alike the road is empty he weaves his motorcycle across the lanes sunlight glints off the ocean in the distance mrs hoogestraat pauses on her way to the kitchen and glances at the screen "you didnt eat your breakfast " she says "im sorry i didnt see it there " he responds "they probably wont taste any good now " she says taking the plate over the next five hours mr hoogestraat stares at the computer screen barely aware of his physical surroundings he adds a

more rewarding " he says sitting alone in the living room in front of the television mrs hoogestraat says she worries it will be years before her husband realizes that hes traded his real life for a pixilated fantasy existence one that doesnt include her "basically the other person is widowed " she says "this other life is so wonderful its better than real life nobody gets fat nobody gets gray the person thats left cant compete with that "
