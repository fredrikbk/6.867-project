weekend journal review books the past another country the song before it is sung by justin cartwright bloomsbury pages &# in an age when it is fashionable inside and outside the academy to deny the very existence of truth it is refreshing to encounter a novelist intent on using fiction to reach historical reality justin cartwrights "the song before it is sung" takes us from contemporary london and germany back to the cloistered world of oxford university in the s and to the blood soaked horrors of nazism in the novel the bequeathed papers of an oxford scholar elya mendel prompt one of his former students a man named conrad senior to begin an enigmatic quest conrad finds himself gathering letters and collecting testimony to sort out mendels long ambivalent friendship with axel von gottberg a german aristocrat tortured and hideously executed following the unsuccessful plot to assassinate hitler when we meet him conrad is barely managing a parlous existence as a journalist and would be author he is not himself a compelling figure and the scenes from his wobbly life are themselves rather weak but they dont really matter for conrads investigations into mendels papers and life are the heart of the story they reveal a great deal about mendel himself and raise disturbing questions about mendels german friend in short conrad serves as a useful lens for readers as they try to understand the novels two main characters both of whom mr cartwright writes in an afterword are based on real people who exactly elya mendel we are told is a fictional version of the oxford philosopher isaiah berlin and axel von gottberg is a version of the german aristocrat adam von trott who studied at oxford in the early s and who did indeed participate in the plot to assassinate hitler to feel the historical reverberations of mr cartwrights fascinating novel it helps to know a bit more about the real life figures he has put into play a russian jewish immigrant isaiah berlin came to england as a child and in the s was elected to that most prestigious of oxford academic honors a fellowship at all souls college he was the first jew to achieve that position in addition to being intellectually formidable berlin was famously indiscreet and garrulous on first meeting him justice oliver wendell holmes averred that he had understood only a fraction of the torrent of ideas that had poured forth in berlins heavily accented english berlin was close in age if not in background to von trott the suave but elusive descendant of junker warriors at oxford a friendship sprang up between them hitler came to power during von trotts time at oxford but he returned to germany anyway thus began a difficult period for von trotts english friends including isaiah berlin von trott was no fan of hitler he resisted joining the nazi party for many years only doing so he said when it became absolutely necessary to the continuation of his legal career but he shared the fuhrers view of the treaty of versailles regarding it as a monstrous injustice at oxford von trott had come to know prominent figures in the british political establishment and after moving back to germany visited britain frequently as the events of the s unfolded it was hard to figure out quite where von trott stood sometimes he took the line that appeasement would only strengthen hitler and that if britain properly stood up to him the german army would overthrow him at other times von trott would say that if hitlers demands were met such as the return of former german colonies in africa then the german people would be satisfied and wouldnt need hitler von trott eventually took a position in nazi germanys foreign office and continued to make trips abroad was he then an apologist for the nazis or a german patriot who wanted to rid his country of its incubus for isaiah berlin the parting of ways came with the publication of a letter by von trott in the manchester guardian a letter saying incredibly that in the court in germany where von trott practiced law there was no discrimination against jews later berlin would come to accept von trotts explanation that he had written the letter to establish his cover with the nazis but at the time berlin found such public temporizing hard to stomach a staunch foe of totalitarianism berlin saw the nazis in stark terms they needed to be resisted and if necessary crushed by force unlike other friends of von trotts such as london observer editor david astor and new york herald tribune journalist dorothy thompson isaiah berlin never put much faith in the efficacy of domestic german resistance to hitler it turned out that at least by von trott was indeed a foe of hitler participating in the stauffenberg plot to blow up the fuhrer and paying for it by being tortured and hanged with piano wire we know from various sources that von trotts actions and gruesome fate occasioned in isaiah berlin a certain amount of guilty revisionist thinking he worried that his doubts about von trott voiced to powerful friends caused the allies to resist giving their full help to the assassination plotters he worried that he wrongly thought von trott to be merely self aggrandizing or half in sympathy with the leader he later sought to kill thus in "the song before it is sung " elya mendel is full of intelligent ambivalence he writes in a letter "the truth is axel von gottberg was a man of courage and action while i was a man who loved libraries and enjoyed gossip " and yet mendel is elsewhere shown to believe not without reason that his german friend is deeply confused seeing hitler "in hegelian fashion" as the "agent" of "inevitable change " at times mendel even views von gottberg as a "dangerous fantasist who sees himself as a man with a destiny " mendel finds such man of destiny notions "repugnant " for they lie "at the heart of fascism and all other forms of totalitarianism " the portrait may be fiction but it has the ring of truth in "the song before it is sung " mr cartwright allows us to observe up close a great man with a philosophical temperament brooding over his martyred friend he suffers from conflicting emotions admiration for his friends bravery uncertainty about his true convictions and distaste for his megalomaniac tendencies and yet he also feels guilt over his own doubts and actions the reader is left to wonder rightly which of these two men the one in the ivory tower and the other at least at the end on his white horse got the crucial questions of his time right mr cartwrights impressive achievement lies in his ability to penetrate beyond easy moral certitudes to evoke the recent past and not least to make the reader understand just how much was at stake back then mr rubin is a writer
