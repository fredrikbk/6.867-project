weekend journal taste writers little helper associated press barry bonds hit career home run no on tuesday night breaking hank aarons storied record held since steroid allegations have plagued the san francisco giants slugger aug good morning distinguished members of the subcommittee im pleased to be here before the congress today so we can at last begin to restore the publics faith in literature i know that theres been a lot of speculation about what im going to say in my sworn testimony some of it quite lurid but unfortunately the reality is far worse than the imaginings of all the commentators and the reading public and i am grateful to all of you for the grant of immunity that makes it so much easier for me to uphold my duty here let me first make it clear that i intend to name names which is why im testifying from beneath this hood with the aid of a voice distorting microphone the literary game is vicious ladies and gentlemen a lot of money is at stake and the words i speak could be worth my life but those ive assisted in the past and im not proud of this joined me in corrupting a business ive learned to love together we set a terrible example for youthful writers coming up through the mfa programs theres no excuse for what i did but theres no excuse for what my clients did either so yes i am the person responsible for feats of writing productivity that under normal circumstances are simply beyond the power of mere mortals with fingers and a literary imagination i am the one who has made it possible thanks to the "performance enhancers" i sold and distributed so aggressively for americas top writers to push their page output to record levels astonishing critics and book publishers and making it impossible for even avid fans to keep up with the deluge of print is all this really such a surprise havent you ever wondered how someone like joyce carol oates churned out all those novels stories poems plays even boxing essays its unnatural and i should know i watched as my "writers little helpers" transformed a modestly productive academic into a terrifyingly prolific human writing machine thats how i met joyce at the boxing ring where for reasons i wont go into here i was well known in pugilistic circles joyce was so thankful the second time she was a pulitzer prize finalist that she introduced me to anne rice barbara cartland stephen king tom clancy danielle steel and eventually j k rowling pause while chairman gavels down crowd noise youre shocked ladies and gentlemen lets all grow up wasnt anybody just a little bit taken aback that this obscure english writer suddenly out of the blue hits it out of the park on every single pitch not just seven straight best sellers but seven straight averaging pages you should also know that the fantasies contained in those harry potter books are consistent with the kinds of hallucinations common to heavy users of the substances i peddle through steve king i met his fellow new englander john updike johnny was always a gentleman he even made a little pencil drawing of me that i keep framed right over my desk not only did i help johnny jack up his literary output hes got a book of essays and reviews coming out thats words if its a paragraph but i also took half a dozen strokes off his golf game as you can see writers often turned me on to one another im especially popular with biographers which is why chronicles of peoples lives these days are as thick and heavy as cinder blocks but just as often writers didnt want to share me and my magic with their peers fortunately for my business i met writers on my own as well i encountered philip roth through some pals in newark whose names i am not at liberty to disclose i dont know if you have time to read much fiction madame chairman but scouts will tell you that most writers have done their best work by the time they turn phil was in a rut he was getting old i drove up to vermont with my little black bag and provided a pick me up in no time he was doing some of the best work of his life think of it a man in his s he was so grateful at one point forgive me may i have just a moment this is very emotional for me at one point phil had just finished "the plot against america" and wanted to dedicate it to me "ill just use your initials " he said "nobody will ever know " i couldnt let him of course but i was touched the tragedy is that the publishing industry the guild the new york review of books all of them have turned a blind eye to the evidence right under their noses the result is that young writers who would once have shattered their health the old fashioned way with drink now risk it with performance enhancers our nations literary output meanwhile is completely out of control with new titles pouring out of the nations presses faster than anyone can read them awards like the pulitzer prizes lose their value when we know the winner cant produce a clean blood test ladies and gentlemen the answer here is simple a zero tolerance policy based on rigorous random testing theres no other way imagine if the guild could demand blood tests from any member at any time imagine if you couldnt get near breadloaf or the university of iowa without a complete lab work up only then could we get on top of this tragic problem and know for sure that writers whose books win prizes earned them with a pen rather than a hypodermic needle thank you very much for your time mr akst writes from new yorks hudson valley
