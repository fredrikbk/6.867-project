weekend journal review film stardust gives a cult fairy tale global appeal pfeiffer plays a witch austen bio becoming jane sells heroine short hell hath almost no fury like devotees of a cult author artist or performer whose idol is suddenly discovered by the hoi polloi now just simmer down and give it up all you proprietary fans of graphic novelist neil gaiman and surrender to cruel reality with the release of "the princess bride" flavored "stardust " the immensely winning and visually arresting adaptation of gaimans fantasy the word is going to be out tristan charlie cox is a sweet diffident young man who as an infant was delivered to his father in a basket the lads true identity will come as a surprise only to those unfamiliar with the works of the brothers grimm hans christian andersen or walt disney desperately in love with the indifferent victoria sienna miller the prettiest and perhaps shallowest girl in their serene victorian english village tristan strikes a bargain if as a birthday gift he brings her the star that has just fallen victoria will be his bride to seal the deal tristan must venture into stormhold the enchanted kingdom just beyond the stone wall bordering his village the bright particular fallen star hes after turns out to be embodied by a beautiful if rather petulant young woman who answers to yvaine claire danes channeling gwyneth paltrow but this is a fallen star sought by many the list includes dim witted power crazed princes of the realm and witches chief among them lamia michelle pfeiffer here as in "hairspray " wonderfully full of rage about her lost youth one way or another the whole motley lot of them wants yvaines heart those who like their fairy tales served up subversive or at the very least hip and self referential like "shrek" would do well to look elsewhere the most "stardust" supplies in this department is a hilarious greek chorus made up of fallen heirs to the stormhold throne and robert de niro as the fierce captain of a flying pirate ship whos leading a double life with that armoire full of frocks and furbelows hes as much swish buckling as swashbuckling the considerable spell the movie casts is weakened by its length and sometimes scattershot approach there are just a few too many incantations and transformations and the climactic scene is just this side of tedious but these are quibbles at its best "stardust" shines bright rush hour jackie chan and chris tucker have been through a lot together to be exact "rush hour" "rush hour " and now "rush hour " are they tired perhaps not but their antics and action sequences certainly are like most other cop buddy movies the formulaic "rush hour" is built on the belief that opposites attract specifically that opposites attract audiences mr chan as inspector lee is the certified introvert the unflappable analytical half of the duo who lets his dazzling martial arts work do the talking meanwhile mr tuckers officer james carter is loud lewd bold and bumptious in his approach to the ladies and almost as bumbling as his fellow guardian of the law inspector clouseau in "rush hour " as in "rush hour " lee and carter are up against triad the pre eminent crime syndicate in china one of whose members is lees close childhood friend hiroyuki sanada to put a lid on murder and mayhem the two guardians of law and order must locate a mysterious list containing the names of the groups top thugs the search involves a trip to paris with stops at such tourist attractions as the eiffel tower the sewers a casino house of ill repute and a cabaret styled on the folies bergere where amusingly messrs tucker and chan cross cadenzas on the roberta flack donny hathaway classic "the closer i get to you " or perhaps it only seems amusing in comparison to a stop at a martial arts school where the men offer up an offensive take on abbot and costellos classic "whos on first" routine max von sydow is on hand to play an eminence gris the sort of role reflexively handed over to christopher plummer perhaps hell turn up in "rush hour " becoming jane there is what amounts to a cottage industry of novelists who update or refashion the works of jane austen "the jane austen book club " "jane austen in scarsdale " "jane austen in boca " "confessions of a jane austen addict" and "lost in austen create your own jane austen adventure" are but a few such titles reimagining the life of austen herself was perhaps the next logical step thus the heavy handed fatuous "becoming jane" with the lovely anne hathaway doing the best she can in the title role a letter from austen to her sister mentions "a gentlemanlike good looking pleasant young man " one tom lefroy james mcavoy according to austen biographers he and jane danced together at several balls flirted discussed the racy novel "tom jones" and perhaps even did a bit of canoodling but jane the daughter of an impecunious country rector had no dowry lefroy a prospective lawyer was expected to contribute to the support of his many siblings marriage then was an impossibility despite pangs the two parted jane never married end of story with plenty of masterpiece theatre filigree the wall to wall chamber music the bosky scenery the images of characters reflected in pretty ponds "becoming jane" takes that small undeniably tender interlude injects it with steroids actually creates an elaborate fiction and posits it as the defining event of the great novelists all too brief life it surely could not have been the intention of the filmmakers to trivialize austens art but with myriad allusions to the novels the haughty neighborhood dowager maggie smith looking like an aging madam who recalls "pride and prejudice"s lady catherine with one unsuitable suitor intoning "its a truth universally acknowledged " thats exactly what happens austen comes off here more as stenographer than writer worse the movie has tom lefroy as her condescending guide if she wants to be a novelist she must learn about passion he says pointing her in the direction of "tom jones " thank you kind sir dvd tip two sisters of vastly different temperaments kate winslet and emma thompson navigate the rough road to love and marriage in ang lees fetching take on jane austens "sense and sensibility" with ms thompson pulling double duty as star and screenwriter joe morgenstern is on vacation
