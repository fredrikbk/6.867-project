internet hunting has got to stop if it ever starts even the nra agrees this is one humane issue everyone can get behind the humane society of the united states last year mailed more than people an urgent message underlined and in bold type "such horrific cruelty must stop and stop now " the cruelty in question was internet hunting which the animal rights group described as the "sick and depraved" sport of shooting live game with a gun controlled remotely over the web responding to the humane societys call states have outlawed internet hunting since and a bill to ban it nationally has been introduced in congress but nobody actually hunts animals over the internet although the concept first broached publicly by a texas entrepreneur in is technically feasible it hasnt caught on how so many states have nonetheless come to ban the practice is a testament to public alarm over internet threats and the gilded life of legislation that nobody opposes with no internet hunters to defend the sport the humane societys lobbying campaign has been hugely successful a welcome change for an organization that has struggled to curtail actual boots on the ground hunting michael markarian who has led the groups effort calls it "one of the fastest paces of reform for any animal issue that we can remember seeing " vicki l walker a state senator in oregon says she wasnt aware of internet hunting until a representative from the society told her about it and asked her to sponsor a ban "it offended my sensibilities " she says the bill passed unanimously this year melanie george marshall a delaware state representative who sponsored an internet hunting ban that passed in june considers her legislation a matter of homeland security "i dont want to give ideas to people " she says "but these kinds of operations would have the potential to make terrorism easier " even the national rifle association endorses the ban "its pretty easy to outlaw something that doesnt exist " says rod harder a lobbyist for the nra in oregon who supported an internet hunting ban that took effect in june "we were happy to do it " john c astle a maryland state senator angered animal rights groups in when he successfully pushed to allow hunting black bears in the state safari club international a hunting group named him the nations state legislator of the year in but last year working with the humane society he sponsored an internet hunting ban that sailed through the legislature "if youre a dedicated hunter you believe in the concept of fair chase " says mr astle who once shot a foot crocodile in africas zambezi river internet hunting he says "flies in the face of fair chase " still mr astle worried that the bills wording "might extend the ban to legitimate types of hunting as im sure those animal huggers would like to do " internet hunting was first put forth as an idea in november when john lockwood an insurance estimator for an auto body shop in san antonio launched live shot com for &# an hour and a monthly fee users could peer through the lens of a webcam and aim a caliber rifle at animals on a hunting farm in central texas mr lockwood said he wanted to help the disabled experience the thrill of hunting pulling the trigger was a matter of clicking the mouse rather it would have been had a public outcry and concern from state regulators not forced mr lockwood to abandon his plans at the time just one person a friend of mr lockwoods had tested the service he killed a wild hog "i thought that would be the end of it " recalls mr lockwood whose site now features ads for hunting gear cars and life insurance hardly the humane society calling internet hunting a "sickening reality " urged state legislatures to outlaw the practice virginia became the first to do so in and others followed in quick succession california also banned internet fishing nobody is doing that either an illinois bill outlawing internet hunting is awaiting the governors signature that will bring the total to states in three of them regulators imposed the bans ms marshall the delaware state representative realizes that nobody is actually killing animals on the internet but thinks now is the time to act "what if someone started one of these sites in the six months that were not in session " says ms marshall "we were able to proactively legislate for society " that sentiment bothers a fellow representative gerald w hocker of state legislators nationwide who have voted on internet hunting bans mr hocker is one of only to oppose them he co sponsored an earlier version of rep marshalls bill in but took his name off it after doing some research "internet hunting would be wrong " he says "but theres a lot that would be wrong if it were happening " nevertheless the humane society depicts internet hunting as an imminent threat "sick ideas have a habit of spreading " the group told members last year in a letter requesting donations "to fight this madness " mr markarian president of the humane societys lobbying arm concedes that internet hunting is "certainly not the biggest problem currently facing animals " but he adds "it wouldnt take much for someone to start an internet hunting site offshore or in one of the states that hasnt banned it " mr markarian also argues that the societys focus on a potential threat has drawn attention to a current one canned hunting in which quarries are confined to a piece of land and are an easy kill in alabama last year legislators shot two birds with one stone banning internet hunting and many types of canned hunting in the same bill mr lockwood meanwhile says hes incredulous that his abortive scheme an idea that came to him one afternoon while surfing the web has spawned such a legislative backlash "they didnt have to make a federal case out of it " he says internet hunting is now in fact a federal matter on june two congressmen introduced h r the computer assisted remote hunting act although it had no apparent opposition a similar bill died in committee last year and its not clear whether this one has a better chance at passage republican rep tom davis of virginia one sponsor says he first heard of internet hunting from the humane society which asked him to introduce a ban "you just wonder " he says "who would do something like this "
