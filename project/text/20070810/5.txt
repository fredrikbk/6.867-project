barney franks muse barney frank is a busy guy so we suppose its no great surprise that he used a ghost writer for his recent supreme court amicus brief in a big securities tort case imagine our surprise however to learn that the ghost is none other than tort kingpin bill lerachs favorite lobbying outfit mr frank and house judiciary chairman john conyers filed their brief last week in the stoneridge case which concerns "secondary liability " this is the question of whether plaintiffs attorneys can sue not just a company that engages in wrongdoing but any company that has done business with the wrongdoer its a favorite cause of the plaintiffs bar and mr frank has manfully assisted their cause with hearings at his financial services committee his amicus brief argues further that as the head of a powerful congressional committee he has an "interest" in making it easier for trial lawyers to sue corporations yet according to a footnote the frank conyers brief was written by lawyers from cuneo gilbert &amp laduca and according to disclosure records that firms lawyers have since been lobbyists for the national association of securities and commercial law attorneys an outfit set up by mr lerach the tort baron has also served as co counsel with two cuneo partners who helped write the stoneridge brief jonathan cuneo and michael lenett meanwhile mr cuneo and a third lawyer who also assisted on the brief are registered as lobbyists for the american association for justice the new euphemistic name for what was formerly known as the association of trial lawyers of america we trust the supreme court justices who are due to hear stoneridge arguments as early as october will notice the provenance of mr franks legal wisdom
