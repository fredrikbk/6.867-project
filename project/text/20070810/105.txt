weekend journal review television jaded lothario seeks theres nothing misleading about the title of showtimes new series "californication" et monday david duchovny playing a middle aged new york writer unhappily transplanted to l a does bounce around in bed with one bimbo after another yet its far from a pretty sight as the shows title should also suggest to all but soft porn addicts the coupling here is soulless stuff more depressing than titillating to some extent its meant to be series star and producer mr duchovny plays hank moody whos going through a classic crisis for men of a certain age and disposition hes come all the way out to l a only to see his meaningful novel turned into a mindless movie that even more insulting to hank is a huge hit worse hes separated from his family a precocious year old daughter becca madeleine martin and a lovely girlfriend of some years standing karen natascha mcelhone whom he never quite got around to marrying now hes adrift and full of self loathing in sunny california drowning his sorrows on a conveyor belt of surgically enhanced strangers its not clear why the haggard hank instantly and easily lures into bed practically every stray woman he meets however it is abundantly clear why karen wont take him back and is in fact preparing to marry a new boyfriend hank is an immature jerk to some extent hes meant to be if the show has a theme its that too often in life we dont appreciate what we have until we mess up and lose it the question for viewers will be whether hank and his dilemma are interesting enough to make us root for him in his journey of discovery and shall we say because this is set in l a healing hmmm despite his nearly affectless face and inflectionless voice mr duchovny does fill the screen as hank forcing us to take his side whether we like it or not the same man boy persona that made him sympathetic as fox mulder in the "x files" helps him along here when hank smashes the cellphone of a guy whos using it in a movie theater we like the fictional theater audience let out a little cheer despite their personal problems hank and karen are determined to "be there" for their daughter after hank is summoned to a wild party where becca is mixing with dangerous boys and drugs he barges into the crowd heaves her over one shoulder and triumphantly carries his child out of harms way on the other hand while he makes becca pay him a fine every time she swears he uses filthy language in front of her himself the vulgarity of his speech is harder to take than some of the explicit sex scenes poor ms mcelhone actually seems uncomfortable uttering some of her more explicit lines hank is cruel too in one case verbally eviscerating a blind date whos guilty of nothing more than not being a free spirited sex object after a while hanks whiny angst may get to be like a mosquito at a picnic that you long to smack oh and he accidentally sleeps with a year old vixen she comes back to taunt and menace him so there is some justice in the world and by the second episode hank is beginning to show signs of weariness with the chase and the plasticene sameness of l a women so perhaps there is hope for him after all although personally i doubt it "science of dogs" p m wednesday national geographic channel is about another reason for coupling specifically it examines the way humans have engineered a species with more variety of shapes sizes and behavior than any other animal on earth think about it as the program notes cows may be bred to produce more milk or grow larger but they still look like cows dogs however have been stretched shrunken and otherwise manipulated into about distinct breeds we know that they are almost identical genetically to their lupine ancestors and that the first ancestor of the canus familiarus probably appeared on the plains of north africa about years ago looking like a modern saluki even so of the dog breeds we recognize today did not exist as recently as years ago most are the product of the industrial revolution that gave europeans enough leisure time to begin tinkering with the world around them and seeking perfection in everything from their gardens to their pets even today new breeds are still being designed for specific purposes we meet the dogo argentino only a few decades old which has been created and deployed to hunt crop destroying wild boars ferociously but to frolic gently with children when its off duty a scientist in russia has fabricated a new animal using jackals and many types of domestic dogs that yearns only to sniff for explosives it turns out that all this fine tuning over just a few generations warp speed in evolutionary terms is possible because of unique characteristics of dog dna thats all explained here along with experiments showing what may be the most pronounced difference between wolves and dogs which is the latters instinctive view of humans as partners its awful to be reminded that dog eugenics has produced some terrible disorders yet even then it seems these faithful companions go on rewarding us because the science being applied to cures for their genetic diseases may turn out to be useful for treating human ones too speaking of hound dogs this month marks the th anniversary on aug of the death of elvis presley like virtually all american tv treatments of his life "myths and legends elvis" tv land channel thursday p m draws a cloak of hagiography around its subject that is to say it reveals nothing that would disappoint rabid fans of the king although it does regretfully conclude that despite some tantalizing evidence to the contrary elvis is almost certainly dead for the juicy stuff youll have to go on youtube and look for the clip of a late era substance addled elvis singing "are you lonesome tonight" in "a bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh" gibberish that ends with the enigmatic words "plus tax "
