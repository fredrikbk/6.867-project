weekend journal food &amp wine cleaning out the cellar high end wine lovers whittle collections a story for each bottle for many people wrinkles arthritis and memory loss are the most painful reminders that theyre growing old for thomas o ryder it was the realization that he would never be able to drink all the wine in his cellar "the idea of mortality was gradually growing on me " says mr ryder founder of aspens year old food &amp wine classic who decided shortly after retiring as chairman of the readers digest association in march to auction off nearly half of his collection in september for an estimated &# million "my cellar kept getting bigger and i kept getting older " says the year old mr ryders will mark sothebys th single owner wine sale since the auction house started selling wine in and two more are lined up for later this year christies which has also seen a proliferation of single owner collections on the market of late has two scheduled for october richard brierley christies director of north american wine sales says the hot wine market is driving this but the growth in these sales is also a function of the number of baby boomers who started collecting in the s and s and are just now starting to move to warmer climates and scale down their homes because wine only improves with age for so long before beginning to deteriorate many boomers feel an urgency to clean out their cellars "its best to let someone else enjoy them rather than letting them get over the hill " says jamie ritchie senior vice president of wine sales at sothebys the spike in single owner sales is welcome news to some young oenophiles since the individuals who are now selling their collections bought most of their wine directly from vintners as it was released and have generally been fastidious about storage its easier to trust the provenance and condition the personality of the owner and stories behind the bottles can also boost their auction prices mr ryders collection may be interesting to foodies during his seven years as president and publisher of american express publishing corp he bought food &amp wine magazine founded departures and in turned a small colorado wine festival into the food &amp wine classic in aspen which has become an important international event for many chefs and sommeliers and has helped foster a growth in culinary festivals across the country while sothebys expects the sale to generate between &# million and &# million it represents less than half of mr ryders cellar there are some bottles with which he cannot bear to part among those hes keeping for himself are bottles of a spanish cabernet that critic robert parker pronounced to be better than bottles of bordeaux he tried during a tasting in aspen years ago mr ryder who hired mr parker to be food &amp wines staff wine columnist had thrown in the torres gran coronas black label from spains penedes region as a ringer in the bordeaux tasting mr ryder is also saving his brunellos his wifes favorites his burgundies which he says he has yet to master and some bottles from and the vintages when his four children were born "i like to save those for their birthdays " says mr ryder some of mr ryders favorite wines and the ones he will have the harderst time selling are the california labels he accrued shortly after moving to the state in to start a small publishing company in palo alto he recalls tasting heitz cellars "marthas vineyard" cabernet sauvignon several times with the late winemaker joe heitz before it hit the market in and became nearly impossible to find luckily mr ryder says he spotted six magnum bottles in a wine store during a trip to new york bought them for &# each and carried them back on the plane in his lap he drank two bottles but four of them are on auction this fall for &# each before the state of new york legalized the reselling of wine in auction buyers were mostly merchants or wine professionals now more wealthy amateurs from across the world are bidding up the value of wine and attracting investors most buyers now range in age from to down from about a decade ago last year u s wine auction sales totaled about &# million with new york raking in more than any other city in the world as these auctions grow houses have started trying to draw larger crowds by offering gourmet buffets and by swapping the classroom like configuration of most art auctions for restaurant style seating zachys began holding its wine auctions at daniel restaurant in new york five years ago while last year christies introduced evening wine auctions with champagne and hors doeuvres on the menu for mr ryders coming sale at sothebys coffee rubbed beef sirloin back in april when mr ryder says he decided to clean out his cellar he invited several new york auction houses to bid on his collection sothebys made him the highest offer although he believes the house undervalued some of his off year bordeauxs and california wines from the s and s "people do not know those wines well enough so theres not enough snob appeal " he says after inspecting the collection this july the sothebys staff hauled the wine from mr ryders home in new canaan conn to a temperature and humidity controlled warehouse in new york mr ryder says his cellar which can hold bottles is now a "lonely place " and hes already back in the game on tuesday he says he came home with four cases of german riesling from a local wine store mr ryder wont be present at the sept auction he says he accidentally scheduled the sale for the night before his daughters wedding and that hell be expected at the rehearsal dinner just as well he says it would have been excruciating to watch people taking home some of his most beloved wines at prices he says will likely be "ridiculous" bargains "its a bit like selling my children " he says
