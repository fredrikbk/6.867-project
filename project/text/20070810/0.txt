convenient ideas to nurse u s medical care back to health in his aug opinion piece "health care when you want it " web golinkin identifies many problems endemic to the service rendered by physicians limited patient convenience long wait times and expensive routine exams and tests as a medical doctor in private practice i admit that the level of service offered by many of my colleagues is often abysmal an entrepreneur attempting to differentiate his offerings on the basis of convenience will find the bar set very low however convenience must never be conflated with clinical excellence touting evidence based guidelines and the electronic health record mr golinkin fails to show how patients who fall "outside of convenient care clinics limited scope of practice" are consistently and expeditiously identified by an enterprise that offers no continuity of care what was the personal and economic fallout for the nearly patients seen at minuteclinics whose diagnoses and treatments of sore throat did not conform to evidence based guidelines would this number be significantly higher if the presenting symptoms were more complex i am no luddite mr golinkins efforts may yet inspire physicians to offer more convenient hours and locations courteous and friendly service delivery price transparency and enhanced access to health information technology but in terms of our nations "inefficient two trillion dollar health care system " patient convenience and governmental determination of scope of practice will not solve the socioeconomic problems posited by irresponsible personal behavior chronic illness and the care required by the oldest of the old none of these issues are addressed by positioning a nurse practitioner in a wal mart j c noreika m d m b a medina ohio mr golinkin has his finger on the pulse of the people by recognizing the need for high quality routine health care at hours not available in private doctors offices and with prices for care posted and visible as a family nurse practitioner for many years at a large womens health non profit organization our clinic had women with access to private physician care coming in for urinary tract infections at p m because they could not miss work to see their doctor between regular work hours we were begged to treat ear infections and sinus infections too but that was outside our mission the agency took cash as well as some insurance plans but its hours seemed to be the big draw we also handled patient calls after hours and a frequent request was the question of where to go for care when one had no insurance these patients did not want to go to the emergency department which seemed their only option mr golinkin also is ahead of the curve in recognizing the pool of providers with education and training perfect for this setting nurse practitioners until recently reimbursement and billing practices that credit their services to physicians have kept measurement of their cost effectiveness and quality in the background many studies validate that their care is comparable to that of physicians in primary care settings these retail clinics associated with a pharmacy will put good quality basic health care within easy access for all consumers and provide options that are needed for care after hours in all communities it is a component that has been missing for many years sandra glantz r n pittsford n y retail based "convenience care" clinics are not a long term solution to improving access their real value is in alerting medical educators of the acute need to turn out competent primary care doctors quicker than they have in the past it currently takes four years of college four years of medical school and three years of residency to train a general internist or a family physician the two groups that are commonly referred to as primary care physicians two years could probably be eliminated from college and two from medical school to shorten the total time by four years and still produce competent primary care doctors the present model of the primary care doctor as someone who could do it all has been failing for several years yet medical educators have not taken the changes seriously ironically being taught and expected to be all things to all people has made primary care doctors ineffective much of what they are currently doing should be handled by specialists hopefully the convenience clinics will accelerate change in the way and length of time that primary care doctors are trained edward j volpintesta m d bethel conn
