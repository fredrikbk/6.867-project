cap gains logic heres some advice to the democrats on how to raise the revenues theyll need to pay for all the spending they have in mind dont hike the capital gains tax rate dont lower it either eliminate the capital gains tax entirely how can tax revenues be increased by eliminating a tax its simple when the tax in question is on capital gains capital itself exerts a multiplier effect that benefits the entire economy investment in new plant equipment business processes and whole companies creates new and higher paying jobs and higher levels of economic activity all of which generate additional tax revenues far in excess of what government would lose by foregoing cap gains taxes this idea has broad theoretical support former clinton treasury secretary lawrence h summers has written "the elimination of capital income taxation would have very substantial economic effects" which "might raise steady state output by as much as " economist jack l treynor has shown that "the level of taxation on capital that is fairest i e most beneficial to labor is zero " and nobel prize winning economist robert e lucas jr has concluded "neither capital gains nor any of the income from capital should be taxed at all " these economists think in terms of very complex models but the real world intuition here is quite straightforward the cap gains tax is a barrier to the investment of capital without it capital will flow to investments that otherwise wouldnt have been made the cost of eliminating the barrier is foregone revenues from that particular tax but those revenues are small usually deferred and non recurring in their place government receives large and recurring revenues from corporate taxes sales taxes wage taxes and dividend taxes all generated by new economic activity the cap gains tax is a poor revenue raiser because any given capital gain is a one time event that can only be taxed once and in many cases ends up not being taxed at all consider microsoft since the company went public years ago its market value has increased by about &# billion a generous estimate of the cap gains tax revenues we could expect from this increase is about &# billion actual collections will surely be less many shares will never be sold held by founders who wish to retain control or by people who wish to avoid paying taxes many shares will be gifted to charitable foundations as bill gates has done for the bill and melinda gates foundation out of the tax collectors reach even for those shares that will eventually be sold from todays perspective the resulting tax revenues have to be discounted as they wont be collected for years at the same time microsoft has been a fountain of other tax revenues since the company went public i estimate that in cumulative present value terms corporate taxes already paid total roughly &# billion sales taxes paid by microsofts customers total roughly &# billion income taxes paid by microsofts employees total roughly &# billion and dividend taxes paid by microsofts shareholders total about &# billion these four sources of tax revenues over the last years total &# billion more than twice our generous estimate of the notional cap gains tax revenues &# billion for the same period moreover unless microsofts stock price increases which its had a hard time doing the last couple years the estimated &# billion in cap gains tax revenues will never grow to a larger number but corporate taxes sales taxes income taxes and dividend taxes will continue to be generated year after year even if assuming microsofts business stops growing it has been reliably growing at better than per year the present value of the tax revenues from these other sources is roughly &# billion added to the revenues already collected the total is &# billion there is also all the new taxable economic activity enabled by microsofts products its impossible to estimate a dollar value for it but we can be sure it is a multiple of the value created within microsoft in this context there is nothing unique about microsoft anytime capital is invested the small deferred and non recurring revenues that can be expected from the cap gains tax are a tiny fraction of the perpetual revenues from other economic activities generated directly and indirectly while eliminating the cap gains tax may well induce companies like microsoft to generate additional taxable activity theres a more important opportunity here eliminating the cap gains tax will cause the economy to generate more innovators like microsoft for each new microsoft the cost to government would mean &# billion in foregone revenues but for those new microsofts that wouldnt have existed otherwise the payoff would mean raking in &# billion thats a smart trade off if the democrats were really interested in raising revenues and not just making life harder for a handful of wealthy private equity players its a trade off they should eagerly make mr luskin is chief
