companies decided it wanted to broaden its business an affiliate of the bank started buying complex bonds invented in the u s the strategy brought a sharply higher industry profile for ikb deutsche industriebank ag moodys investors service endorsed its move crediting the bank last year with "successfully diversifying " today ikb is on the receiving end of a bailout organized over a weekend of emergency meetings by germanys financial regulator with contributions from major german banks to rally the banks the lead regulator warned that they needed to head off the risk of what could become the countrys worst financial crisis since the s the safety net for ikb consists of about billion euros or &# billion available now to cover possible losses plus a further financial backstop of billion euros to keep afloat ikb and the affiliate that invested in fixed income securities the case shows how quickly global investors abrupt new appreciation of credit risk can ricochet around the world as some strapped homeowners in the u s fail to make their monthly mortgage payments among those touched by their defaults are institutions in europe that borrowed to buy bonds backed by the mortgages their troubles in turn affected others in the market and injected worry into markets for even some safe securities ikb is housed in a seven story stone clad building a short distance from the rhine since its founding years ago its main business has been to provide long term financing to the smaller german companies called the mittelstand companies like trumpf group a maker of machine tools the affiliate ikb set up for bond investing five years ago is rhineland funding capital corp the purchases included bonds backed by subprime mortgages those issued to home buyers with weak credit it was a global circuit rhineland partly funded its bond purchases through short term debt issued to u s investors such as a suburban minneapolis school district and the city of oakland calif but rhinelands short term borrowings had to be renewed frequently and when investors realized that their collateral for the borrowings included u s subprime mortgages they shut off the spigot suddenly rhineland couldnt repay other debt that was coming due if other german banks hadnt agreed to bail it out a week and a half ago fitch ratings believes ikb "would have defaulted " says a fitch credit analyst in frankfurt sabine bauer ikb is using bailout funds to repay the short term borrowings which are known as commercial paper this wasnt the only u s related credit problem to surface in europe yesterday the big french bank bnp paribas sa suspended withdrawals from three investment funds citing volatility in the u s asset backed securities market that led to a scramble for cash short term money market interest rates spiked above their target levels in both europe and the u s in response the european central bank in an extraordinary step injected billion euros in short term funds into the system to get rates back down the u s federal reserve injected &# billion through its open market operations the crisis at ikb unfolded quickly as recently as july the german bank told investors it was fine but days later it began having trouble selling commercial paper that instrument is a staple of money market funds and other risk averse investors regarded as one of the safest investments apart from u s treasurys its often issued by big companies that use the proceeds for day to day expenses but even the haven of commercial paper has been rattled in recent weeks as investors began to worry about securities that might be tied in some way to subprime mortgages rhinelands difficulty in issuing new commercial paper didnt go unnoticed by deutsche bank ag one of several banks that helped rhineland sell the paper deutsche bank tipped off germanys financial watchdog called bafin within hours the banks and regulators had structured a bailout package three of ikbs top executives including chief executive stefan ortseifen departed the bank formed a task force to sort out its problems its stock is down since the crisis began to develop about two weeks ago mr ortseifen declined to comment ikb dreamed up rhineland in as a way to move beyond its german client base of smaller companies ikb set up rhineland in delaware and jersey a tiny tax haven in the english channel so it could borrow from investors in the u s and europe rhineland poured the proceeds into a highly rated portfolio of bonds seeking high yields it often invested in bonds or bundles of bonds backed by other securities including subprime mortgages according to people familiar with ikb it was courted by banks such as lehman brothers holdings inc j p morgan chase &amp co and deutsche bank ag which sought to sell it securities including collateralized debt obligations known as cdos these are pools of debt broken into tranches or slices that offer investors various levels of yield and risk ikb was such a good customer that banks would adjust which assets they bundled together in cdos on ikbs wishes for example ikbs risk team didnt like airplane loans so banks would often remove them the banks declined to comment rhinelands profit was the difference between what it had to pay for its commercial paper borrowings and the return on the bonds it bought with the proceeds on its commercial paper rhineland had to pay approximately the london interbank offered rate or libor a common benchmark the bonds it bought returned about a full percentage point above libor ikb is just one of many banks that set up companies to use this strategy theyre usually off balance sheet so that banks dont have to set aside capital to cover the liabilities to sell its paper rhineland often looked to u s investors robbinsdale area schools district in a northwestern suburb of minneapolis bought some last year thus lending money to rhineland it did so on the advice of a citigroup inc broker in st paul says gary hauan director of finance citigroup declined to comment oakland calif also bought some of the paper figuring that the collateral backed debt was safe "we dont take risks " says katano kasaine the citys treasury manager also buying rhineland commercial paper was the montana board of investments which manages a &# billion fund all three say they wont be buying any more of this issuers commercial paper they shouldnt have to worry about what they did buy despite ikbs troubles because its affiliate can repay the paper with proceeds of the ikb bailout the montana board however is looking through the rest of its commercial paper holdings to see if any others are tied to cdos says its executive director carroll south ikb started in helped germany rebound from the decimation of world war ii by lending to companies rebuilding but in when german bank profits were hurt by an economic slowdown ratings agencies pressured the countrys banks to diversify away from lending to companies a trio of ikb officials came up with the idea for rhineland led by a banker and lawyer named dirk roethig he joined ikb in bringing with him experience working with bonds in europe for the u s bank state street corp alongside him was a longtime ikb official winfried reinke the venture was a success ikbs fledgling asset management arm earned fees for selecting rhinelands investments ikb bought similar bonds for rhineland and its own portfolios according to ikbs annual report in the fiscal year ended march ikb earned just under million euros with million euros of that coming from fees and commissions rhineland paid roughly half of the commissions according to ikbs annual report the bank and other banks established a line of credit to be tapped only in the most drastic of situations promising to cover liabilities if rhineland couldnt pay off the commercial paper rhineland grew quickly in september it held billion euros of debt by january it had billion euros its commercial paper program led by deutsche bank won an award in from banker magazine in mr roethig told industry publication risk magazine "this adventurous portfolio building was the outcome of a carefully planned strategy we wanted to diversify in asset classes as well as geographically because we were pretty much dependent on the german economy " the next year at an investment conference in barcelona spain mr roethig sat alongside executives from banking heavyweights frances societe generale sa and dresdner bank ag on a panel on how to pick investments in u s asset backed and mortgage backed securities but executives at rhineland disagreed about how fast to expand in january mr roethig left after others overruled his objection to growing so quickly he said "i made several proposals for a more sophisticated portfolio management to address expected negative market developments " which werent accepted by ikb he said in a statement ibk declined to comment growth accelerated after he left between then and this july rhineland boosted its assets that is the bonds and other debt it had purchased to billion euros from billion euros that was a large investment in view of ikbs stock market value which was just a bit over billion euros at the end of this march a december report by moodys credited ikb for its success and noted "ikb has over the last few years been successfully diversifying its business activities by expanding outside germany " earlier this year ikb founded another rhineland type vehicle called rhinebridge to invest in bonds backed by u s home equity loans by february though u s subprime mortgages written in and were showing increasing delinquencies as home prices weakened and some borrowers mortgage rates adjusted higher as defaults rose the value of securities backed by those mortgages began to tumble in a financial update july ikb said it wasnt incurring problems it acknowledged that both moodys and standard &amp poors had downgraded some debt securities but said "it is worth noticing that the bulk of our investments are in portfolios of corporate loans " but rhinelands commercial paper investors were getting jittery as they saw erosion in the value of the bonds backing their investments even if the company wanted to sell bonds to pay off creditors it would have a tough time finding buyers some worried about a week after ikbs financial report the bank started having difficulty finding buyers for additional commercial paper at sei investments co in oaks pa sean simko head of fixed income asset management says his firm stopped buying rhineland paper last month because of growing volatility by friday july ikb was in trouble some of the commercial paper was maturing and investors needed to be repaid but buyers for new commercial paper had vanished it couldnt sell cdo assets to raise funds because the market for cdos had dried up rhineland was going to turn to ikb deutsche bank ag and others that had promised a credit line to pay its bills in an emergency that strategy had its own pitfalls if they provided rhineland with the money rhinelands bills would move to ikbs modest balance sheet a scenario that could topple the bank even worse the banks including deutsche bank that had standing agreements to lend ikb money backed out deutsche bank declined to comment instead deutsche bank germanys biggest bank phoned bafin the german financial supervisory agency to tell it there was a problem with ikb people familiar with the matter say that same day according to a person familiar with the matter ikbs management board reported the problems to the banks biggest shareholder kfw group which is state owned bafin called for a special probe of ikbs books over the last weekend in july it convened a crisis meeting at ikbs dusseldorf
