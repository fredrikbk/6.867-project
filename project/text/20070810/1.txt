a new world disorder for debt traders system of risk dispersal proves to be a bit erratic welcome to the new world of finance as tremors from the u s subprime mortgage meltdown shake markets around the globe investors are getting a lesson in how unexpected stresses could emerge in a global financial system that has changed significantly in the past few years markets have taken on an increasingly important role since the financial crises of the s and s when banks make loans they are now often bundled into securities that are sold in pieces to investors around the world changing hands many times it spreads risk which policy makers believe keeps the overall financial system sound and stable but the downsides to this system could be serious a financial architecture that dispersed risk also helped to create it and when troubles emerge as they have in the u s housing market they can show up just about any place in the world and in ways nobody predicted those troubles continued yesterday as rattled investors shied away from u s corporate debt with some traders saying they had difficulty finding buyers both investment grade and so called junk bonds suffered the spread between the returns on both types of bonds and that of u s treasurys widened in the past few weeks shaky mortgage loans to americans have emerged in the portfolios of hedge funds banks and investment vehicles in australia germany france singapore korea china and elsewhere investors are also discovering that subprime loans were used as collateral for some short term commercial loans that are part of a &# trillion market that banks and investors turn to regularly for quick doses of cash when they need it the european central bank and federal reserve pumped liquidity into the system yesterday to hold down their target short term interest rates which had been disrupted by turmoil in the commercial paper market until a few weeks ago many central bankers expressed confidence that subprime problems were contained "the downside of spreading the risk is that when the problems get big enough it affects all markets regardless of the fundamentals " says christopher mayer a real estate expert and professor at columbia university back in the s and s when financial stress turned up in places like mexico thailand or the u s the problems often resided close to home in banks now banks often sell their loans after making them they end up in investments such as collateralized debt obligations or residential mortgage backed securities and sold to investors around the world in the process it might have made investors and lenders complacent about monitoring borrowers to make sure they could pay off their loans or were using borrowed money wisely "weve created these new instruments and people with a wink and a nod claimed that these were just as safe as traditional safe assets " says christian stracke a bond analyst at research firm creditsights mr stracke points to the commercial paper issued by ikb deutsche industriebank ag which german bank officials had to bail out after its investment arms holdings went bad commercial paper is normally considered a very safe investment but in this case the bank used the paper to buy a host of credit instruments including some backed by dicey subprime mortgages another problem the same framework that disperses risk to different corners of the globe can also spread fear in times of uncertainty "credit went belly up so people got nervous " says tim krochuk managing director of grt capital partners a boston investment manager as a result investors began looking to pull money out of hedge funds with exposure to the sector they pulled their money out of other places too "because some of the exotic securities arent really tradable now people are getting liquidity by going to other markets" to sell assets and raise cash he says one casualty is u s stocks his firms research shows that companies with deteriorating financial fundamentals have done significantly better than those with improving fundamentals during the past three weeks because hedge funds are unwinding their best bets "why would you buy a crummy stock and sell a good stock " he asks "because you have to " the value of debt derivatives and credit default swaps world wide is approaching &# trillion or seven times global gross domestic product according to andy xie a private consultant and the former morgan stanley chief economist in hong kong these instruments can be used to hedge against other risky investments mr xie says in a recent report it might also have encouraged some traders to take even bigger risks in japan last month nomura holdings inc came under pressure for subprime holdings it announced it had reduced its positions in u s subprime loans during the previous quarter to &# million from &# billion taiwan life insurance co said it booked a loss of million new taiwan dollars us&# million in the first half related to its investment in a bear stearns cos hedge fund meanwhile banks in singapore including oversea chinese banking corp and united overseas bank ltd have reported losses on collateralized debt obligations other investors say the notion of diffusing risk will ultimately make the global economy stronger but financial markets will experience severe growing pains one of the biggest problems suggests mohamed el erian head of harvard management co which invests the universitys &# billion endowment is that wall street is cranking out new products faster than analysts or investors can understand or value them "in the short term " he says "the systems werent ready for these changes " credit rating services have been struggling to determine the risk level of these new securities often they have erred by understating the risk and assigning what now looks like ratings that were too generous banks have also confessed to failure at properly assessing the value of some of these new instruments frances bnp paribas sa became the latest victim when it said that the lack of liquidity in the asset back security market "made it impossible to value certain assets fairly regardless of their quality or credit rating " in cases like this when banks are unable to value their holdings investors can temporarily lose access to their capital jon e hilsenrath contributed to this article treasurys post
