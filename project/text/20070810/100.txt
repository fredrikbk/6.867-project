were pro immigration but enforce the laws george melloan made some sound arguments in his july op ed "immigration paralysis " but there were also some serious oversights mr melloan seems to believe that the current immigration laws are unenforceable this is simply not the case the federal government has the ability but not the will he also characterizes our immigration laws as "draconian " they can hardly be too harsh if they are not enforced and hence meaningless mr melloan writes "republicans are frozen in the headlights of the anti immigrant campaigns being conducted by nativists and vigilantes in their home states hate and emotion do not produce good laws " the latter part of that statement may be true but the former is insulting to the legitimate concerns of the american people congresss "grand bargain" on immigration did not sufficiently address these concerns either which is why it collapsed under scrutiny the vast majority of the public favors immigration but recognizes that there is a difference between "immigrants" and "illegal immigrants " they have no faith in the governments willingness to enforce immigration laws to preserve the distinction quite frankly i think we should allow as many immigrants into the country as want to come in legally meaning of course that such immigration should be governed by reasonable laws and limits we should require background checks to weed out those with criminal records when in our country immigrants should pay taxes they should not receive government benefits and services until they become citizens in order to become citizens among other things they should have to pass a somewhat rigorous test to be administered in english these are but some of the common sense principles that most americans can support we want more immigration we only ask that those wishing to migrate to our country do so by our terms and abide by our laws shawn mcgrath atlanta
