weaker rivals rattled by a constant stream of bad news investors in recent days have been shunning nearly all mortgages except for those that can be sold to fannie mae and freddie mac the government sponsored investors that guarantee payments on loans that "conform" to their standards that has prompted lenders to boost rates on prime "jumbo" loans those totaling &# or more too big to be guaranteed by fannie or freddie to as much as or usually such loans cost only about a quarter percentage point more than "conforming" mortgages but the gap has ballooned to as much as point during the past week in financial markets several entities thought to be insulated from the subprime meltdown now turn out to be affected leading investors to wonder who might be next for instance bnp just last week had said the three funds were conducting business as usual but europes sixth largest bank by stock market value said yesterday that it had been forced to suspend the funds on tuesday because of a sudden and unexpected dearth of buyers and sellers "the market for the assets has just disappeared " said alain papiasse head of bnp paribass asset management services division "since the start of

those that focus on "market neutral" strategies or strategies that seek to do as well in both falling and rising markets the strategy has been embraced by some of the biggest names in hedge funds in part because its popular with institutional investors who hunger for gains in any kind of market many market neutral funds have been wagering on high quality stocks or stocks that trade at low valuations based on various metrics and betting against stocks that look expensive because this stance is seen as relatively conservative the funds felt comfortable borrowing money to boost returns but as banks began getting worried about their hedge fund clients in recent weeks some hedge funds were asked to put up more collateral to back the loans or anticipated these requests the funds sold some of their holdings of high quality stocks to raise the cash and closed out "short" trades or bets against companies by buying back shares of companies seen as expensive others sold positions simply to become more conservative in a rocky market since market neutral funds often are guided by similar computer models and share similar holdings the actions magnified moves in asset prices the last week has been the worst on record for many large hedge funds focusing on this strategy worrying traders across wall street many of whom look to these firms for signs of stability in difficult markets aqr capital management llc a &# billion fund based in greenwich conn has seen losses in recent days in investments employing market neutral strategies although the firms other strategies which
