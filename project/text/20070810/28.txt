credit turmoil tests central banks as market losses spread policy makers grapple with hard line stance the worlds central bankers say investors should bear the pain of their past excesses but turmoil in credit markets is testing that hard line yesterday a french banks surprise announcement of subprime related losses reignited investor worries and sent short term interest rates sharply higher in response the european central bank took unusually aggressive steps injecting cash into money markets to bring rates back down by days end a few hours later the federal reserve did the same in the u s to a lesser degree while japans central bank injected trillion yen &# billion into money markets amid a stock market plunge in friday morning trading there following a sharp decline on wall street overnight skittish investors sent the dow jones industrial average down points or to yesterday stocks outside the u s also sold off what began with rising delinquencies on u s home mortgages to risky borrowers months ago has evolved into a world wide flight from risk by investors the ripple effects have sunk two hedge funds run by bear stearns cos knocked dozens of lenders out of business battered an already weak housing market and fueled weeks of stock market turmoil despite yesterdays central bank reaction to signs of market distress there are few suggestions that global central banks are prepared to cut interest rates indeed south koreas central bank raised rates yesterday citing the inflationary risk of excess liquidity australias did so on wednesday citing surging consumer demand and an increased inflation risk the bank of japan is expected to raise rates later this month or next central bankers have generally felt lenders had become complacent about risk and a return to more normal standards would be healthy yesterdays developments however underscore the risk that markets may rapidly go from being excessively lax with lending to excessively tight until yesterday lenders were primarily avoiding borrowers whose ability to repay was clearly questionable such as subprime borrowers said lou crandall chief economist at wrightson associates "that would be manageable " he said the new development consists of signs that market participants may be hesitating to lend to each other "because they dont know where the losses are going to be " mr crandall adds "thats where you get a multiplier effect " if hedge funds were unable to get the short term cash they use to fund their trades for example they might have to sell their holdings thus compounding the turmoil in washington president bush meeting the press for the second day in a row emphasized the u s economys fundamental strength and expressed confidence that markets could handle the strains without any major government intervention "is there enough liquidity to enable markets to be able to correct " mr bush said in response to a question "i am told there is enough liquidity in the system to enable markets to correct " the presidents working group on financial markets representatives of the treasury fed and securities and exchange commission has been conducting daily telephone calls as they often do at times of market volatility the fed earlier this week left its interest rate target unchanged and reiterated its focus on inflation while acknowledging risks to economic growth had increased economic fundamentals remain sound the pullback in lending is limited primarily to the riskiest borrowers the ones who are offered subprime mortgages no dangerous credit crunch has yet developed and a rate cut now could aggravate inflation pressures said peter hooper chief economist at deutsche bank securities "life has become more difficult for the fed " futures traders are now putting at the odds of a rate cut in the u s at officials scheduled sept meeting and a small possibility of a cut before then mr hooper says either of two developments could prompt the fed to cut rates "one is some severe market dislocations like in and the other is developments that suddenly shift the prospective path of the economy i see risk on both of those fronts having increased of late " until yesterdays ecb and fed moves there had been few signs of concern among central bankers major central banks have been generally raising interest rates or keeping them flat and emphasizing concerns about inflation many had fretted that investors had become too cavalier about taking risks and suggested recent developments in markets were welcome rather than reason to rush to cut rates ecb president jean claude trichet on aug described market gyrations as a "normalization of the assessment and pricing of risks " and bank of england gov mervyn king this week said "interest rates arent a policy instrument to protect unwise lenders from the consequences of their unwise decisions " indeed some critics say it was the low rates central banks maintained earlier this decade that propelled the surge in risky lending and ultimately the current turmoil trouble emerged yesterday when bnp paribas frances biggest bank stopping withdrawals from three investment funds citing volatility in the u s asset backed securities market that rattled investors because just last week the bank had said it was "not directly impacted" by the strains in u s markets while the problems didnt affect the bank itself they nonetheless reignited concerns about credit market troubles at the same time some analysts said some issuers of asset backed commercial paper a short term iou have had trouble reissuing paper as it comes due and have turned to backup credit lines at european banks the developments increased demand for short term funds and drove the overnight lending rate among countries that use the euro to far above the ecbs target both the ecb and the fed manage economic growth and prices by setting a target for the rate on overnight loans between big banks then use open market operations to increase or decrease the supply of funds to keep the market rate near the target it is typically a routine operation and the actual and target rates seldom diverge much yesterday was an exception the ecb issued a statement noting "tensions in the euro money market notwithstanding the normal supply of aggregate euro liquidity " then injected billion euros &# billion into the euro zone money market through the banking system it was the largest injection since a billion euro move the day after the sept terrorist attacks and the first time since the attacks aftermath that the bank offered funds at a fixed rate yesterdays move succeeded in bringing the rate back to in late london trading "what you saw today was something quite exceptional " says james nixon euro zone economist with french bank societe generale sa in london and a former ecb staffer "to date youve seen the ecb sending a rather measured response to the widening of credit spreads but injecting this much money is a major attempt to bolster confidence in the current policy stance " there is now increasing debate about whether the ecb will as it had signaled raise rates another quarter percentage point in september pressures in europe spilled over to the u s the federal funds rates at which banks lend to each other overnight and the feds benchmark climbed to well above the feds target the fed injected &# billion into the u s money market which mr crandall of wrightson associates estimates was &# billion more than the fed probably would have added under normal circumstances analysts said the feds response was more aggressive than usual but not abnormally so it was a far smaller move than the fed made after sept when it poured so much money into the system that the federal funds rate plunged well below target and stayed there for days the feds limited response reflects in part the fact that yesterdays scarcity of funds was largely confined to european banks as evidence mr crandall noted that the london interbank offered rate or libor the rate charged on overnight u s dollar loans among primarily european banks jumped as high as libor normally tracks the fed funds rate economists generally say that has benefits the allocation of credit is more efficient and economic growth is stronger but it also makes central bank money market operations less influential than they once were and makes investor confidence which can wax and wane without warning even more important to credit markets in recent months confidence has ebbed in one market after another first subprime mortgages then leveraged buyout loans and more recently asset backed commercial paper evan ramstad and deborah solomon contributed to this article
