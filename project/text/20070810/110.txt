weekend journal taste houses of worship preaching to the choir tomorrow as republicans from around the hawkeye state gather to vote in the iowa straw poll one group will undoubtedly exercise an outsize influence on the polls outcome evangelical protestants motivated in large part by their concern with the state of american families evangelicals have played an important role in republican presidential politics in iowa since when they helped pat robertson win the poll in an upset in an unprecedented of evangelicals voted for president george w bush the close relationship between mr bush and evangelicals has fueled an intense backlash in books like kevin phillipss "american theocracy" and james rudins "the baptizing of america " moderate republicans and liberal democrats have charged that the president and the republican party are now in the thrall of religious radicals intent on imposing their conservative social values on the rest of the nation but does their "pro family" agenda really stem from evangelicals desire to change the behavior of others there are at least three reasons that evangelicals are concerned about issues like abortion sexual promiscuity and marriage first most obviously evangelicals subscribe to a traditional form of the christian faith that views the bible as a literal and authoritative guide to family life second in the past years evangelicals have come to see their pro family worldview as a countercultural badge of honor it signals both to themselves and to the broader society that they have not conformed to the ways of the world thus paradoxically attacks by the likes of howard dean frank rich and bill maher on "intolerant" and "bigoted" evangelicals only deepen their commitment albert mohler president of the southern baptist seminary put it this way in an op ed in the new york times "to the cultured critics of religion we are the cantankerous holdouts against the inevitable but so far as the southern baptist convention is concerned the future is in gods hands if faithfulness requires the slings and arrows of outraged opponents so be it " third and perhaps most surprisingly evangelicals are concerned about the state of the family in their own homes neighborhoods and communities and for good reason studies indicate for instance that teen sex and divorce are as common among evangelicals as they are among other americans indeed divorce is especially high in bible belt states such as kentucky mississippi and arkansas thus evangelical efforts to advance a pro family agenda in the public square must be understood at least in part as a defensive effort to get their own house in order so what gives are evangelicals hypocrites intent on imposing biblical values on others that they themselves cannot live up to media reports to the contrary and despite the bad example of the occasional evangelical leader e g ted haggard churchgoing evangelicals actually do better than most americans in living up to their distinctive worldview my recent research for the russell sage foundation indicates that evangelicals who attend religious services weekly when compared with average americans are less likely to cohabit as young adults vs of other young adults to bear a child outside of wedlock vs of other moms and to divorce vs of other married adults divorced from to so churchgoing evangelicals who are also the ones most likely to be involved in political and pastoral efforts to strengthen the family are actually achieving some success in their efforts to focus on the family but their nominal brethren that is evangelicals who attend church rarely or never are a different story according to my research nominal evangelicals have sex before other teens cohabit and have children outside of wedlock at rates that are no different than the population at large and are much more likely to divorce than average americans one reason that nominal evangelicals have been particularly vulnerable to the family revolution of the past years is that they are much more likely to be poor and uneducated than other americans but even after controlling for class i find that nominal evangelicals do worse than other americans why i suspect that many nominal evangelicals are products of a scotch irish "redneck" culture still found in parts of appalachia and the south that thomas sowell and the late southern historian grady mcwhiney argue has historically been marked by higher levels of promiscuity violence and impulsive behavior this cultural inheritance and not their protestantism probably helps to account for the poor family performance of nominal evangelicals so the next time one hears about evangelicals trying to impose their family values on the rest of us remember that they are probably more concerned about the families of their nominally protestant brothers cousins neighbors and friends in the bible belt than they are about folks in massachusetts mr wilcox is assistant
