politics &amp economics democrats move to force tax debate after election washington senate democrats are proposing a five year fiscal plan that seeks to match president bushs pledge to balance the budget by but also force a major debate on tax overhaul after the elections budget committee chairman kent conrad in a budget resolution he is drafting projects that the governments annual deficit will narrow from about &# billion in to just &# billion in after which there will be a &# billion surplus in revenue numbers are crucial to these calculations by the north dakota democrat who will outline his plan in greater detail when it comes before his committee today his revenues are about or more than &# billion higher than mr bushs five year budget as scored by the congressional budget office but when compared with the more optimistic projections of mr bushs budget the difference is less or about mr conrad said within these totals the chairman isnt prejudging the fate of bush tax breaks expiring in and affecting income tax rates for wages capital gains and dividends some could be extended if offsets are found to stay within the budget framework mr conrad said and he seemed most intent on setting the stage for a larger debate on tax policy most likely in the next congress when a new administration will be in power rather than attempt a permanent solution to the alternative minimum tax an increasing burden on middle class families the budget assumes only a two year patch so the issue will have to be addressed again in the context of the expiring income tax rate provisions in at the same time mr conrad is promoting his own tax agenda focused on improved collections and tackling offshore tax havens a "rapidly developing problem" for the treasury he said "were trying to create an incentive here for the kind of tax reform discussion that is necessary " he said "you need time you also need fundamental tax reform you need to create incentives and we have some things kind of lining up as incentives for tax reform " republicans are sure to attack the democratic proposal as too rich both in taxes and spending education child health veterans and community policing programs all receive boosts above mr bushs budget in the new fiscal year beginning oct domestic appropriations would grow by &# billion to &# billion above what the president allowed in his february budget these increases come on top of the domestic spending now being added by house democrats to an emergency funding bill for the iraq war mr conrads plan includes no deficit reduction reconciliation instructions to achieve savings from government benefit programs like medicare and medicaid instead his approach will rely on a more incremental process in which senate and house committees are required to come up with savings or revenues to offset future initiatives for example in the case of the popular state childrens health insurance program the budget will allow as much as &# billion for five years but all but &# billion of that must be offset by the senate finance committee if it chooses to expand the existing state federal health program
