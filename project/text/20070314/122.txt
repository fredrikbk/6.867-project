the time in the spotlight for these concertos and soloists is brief new york philharmonic this week wfmt radio network thursdays at p m check your local listings broadcast can be heard online at wfmt com new york most nights principal trombone joseph alessi sits near the back of the stage at avery fisher hall during performances of the new york philharmonic the cellos are arrayed in front of him the woodwinds to his right but recently mr alessi stood in the spotlight as soloist at the world premiere of a trombone concerto commissioned for him by the philharmonic written by pulitzer prize winning composer melinda wagner the vibrant minute piece displayed mr alessis considerable talents and made a bid for a permanent spot in the repertory unfortunately if past experience is any indicator the work is not likely to be performed again by its orchestral birth mother in the philharmonic introduced an eloquent trombone concerto for mr alessi by christopher rouse that was later awarded a pulitzer the piece hasnt been played by the philharmonic since then although more than orchestras world wide have performed it of course the odds are against second hearings for many new works not just concertos for orchestra members and the philharmonic has a better track record than most of concertos commissioned for new york philharmonic members since the season four have been subsequently presented here or on tour an informal sampling of nine other major symphony orchestras found that three had not undertaken any concertos for their players during the same year period and the other six had commissioned a total of works only three of which were repeated in concert the orchestras that reprised a single work were chicago cleveland and san francisco those that did not repeat any were cincinnati los angeles and philadelphia so why bother since commissioning and rehearsing a new concerto takes time and money martha gilmer vice president of artistic planning for the chicago symphony says it enhances audience identification with orchestra members and nurtures the players indeed performing solo with their orchestras helps keep principal players happy counteracting the anonymity of symphony life many of these musicians initially pursued or aspired to solo careers but orchestral underdogs like the trombone bassoon or tuba dont have as much concerto repertory as say the flute or violin so orchestras commission works for them "many people just dont view the trombone as a solo instrument " laments mr alessi "yet tommy dorsey was world famous and played solos in front of his band constantly " players often approach management casually about solos raising the subject during tours or meetings or they might add a sentence requiring "a solo opportunity every three or four years" into their "renewable agreements " which periodically allow orchestra members to discuss aspects of their employment mr alessi says he had a "gentlemans agreement" that management would try to commission another work for him the recent mishmash of a program at the philharmonic seemed designed to fulfill as many of these obligations as possible which diluted the attention these fine players deserve the concert is being broadcast nationally this week on "the new york philharmonic this week" over the wfmt radio network check local listings there were adroit performances by principal flute robert langevin and principal harp nancy allen in mozarts pretty but innocuous concerto for their respective instruments four horn players were highlighted in schumanns appealing "concertstuck " gershwins brass laden "american in paris" closed the program it was preceded by ms wagners new concerto for mr alessi a substantial well crafted piece it exploits the beauty of mr alessis sound as well as the trombones high register full of rhythmic complexities and technical challenges particularly in the mercurial first movement the concerto uses the trombone as a member of the ensemble or pits it against the orchestra throughout the work brass choirs and myriad colorful percussion effects lend interest to the musical texture which can be delicate at times as in the quiet opening where the trombone plays a foreboding passage over harp timpani strings piano horn and woodwinds in the second movement marked "lush and dangerous" in the score ms wagner enables the trombone to shine in extended passages of bluesy dissonance laced melody although future performances might plumb greater depths in the work it was deftly conducted by music director lorin maazel mr alessi played his part with a liquid tone and consummate skill it will be interesting to see how this work fares my survey of six leading music publishers found that most concertos for orchestra members receive zero to three performances after their premieres less than a dozen of those introduced since have had between and subsequent performances granted some start life with the odds against them how many composers can write a truly captivating concerto for the low rumbles of the contrabassoon others simply arent that good though its unfair to compare a piece that has had only three or four rehearsals to warhorses honed to technical and interpretive perfection over decades the rare exceptions are adopted by numerous orchestras and gradually enter the concert repertory two examples of the latter are american composer joseph schwanters atmospheric "percussion concerto" which has had performances by orchestras here and abroad and chinese composer tan duns novel "water percussion concerto" which has had performances the latter employs water bottles miked water basins resonating chinese gongs dipped in water and the like these works were among the four new york philharmonic commissions given additional outings by that orchestra its not surprising that both are percussion concertos with built in excitement as virtuosic soloists scurry from drums and marimbas to other colorful instruments "in todays visual age " says norman ryan a vice president at schott music corporation "orchestras feel these works will connect with their audiences " and their composers write in an accessible largely tonal idiom that is easier to prepare in the limited rehearsal time available for new works than those written in more complex harmonic language like ms wagners yet her works provide sufficient color and thematic unity to draw listeners in "i would love to play eight performances of her piece on tour " says mr alessi who has been the philharmonics principal trombone for years "ive never done that my challenge is to get more written in the time i have left " one hopes they wont be abandoned at birth ms jepson writes about classical music for the journal
