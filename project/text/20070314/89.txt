criticized a restructuring plan that could have led to a sale of the companys mobile unit pirelli recently has been pushing for a strategic alliance between telecom italia and spains telefonica sa that would include telefonica buying a minority stake in olimpia those talks have stalled the government hasnt commented on that possible tie up other large european telecom players that have recently been interested in acquiring telecom italia are steering clear of the situation now according to people close to the matter because pirelli still values its indirect telecom italia stake on its books at a premium finding a buyer at the right price could be difficult "theres a process of consolidation going on so telecom italia is a target " said luigi pugliese a telecom expert and vice president at booz allen hamilton in milan who has consulted for several italian telecom operators including telecom italia in the past "but the underlying problem is the price at which pirelli is asking which could discourage foreign buyers " a large european telecom operator could find significant synergies by combining some operations with telecom italia he said "but there is a strong political risk"
