can an ohio radio station reinvent itself yet again for years a tiny ohio radio station called woxy dodged regulatory roadblocks by morphing from an old school broadcaster into a web only radio station and then into an arm of an online cd store now woxys nine lives may be running out last week after years of artificially low royalty costs to encourage internet radios growth the federal copyright royalty board raised the royalty rates that web radio stations must pay to play music the upshot the annual cost of running woxy could more than double to around &# million far exceeding the stations &# to &# million in annual revenue the boards decision could still be appealed or rescinded by congress but woxy manager bryan jay miller says "i dont see the situation getting any better " he would know since mr miller started working at woxy as a college student years ago the station has struggled to overcome several regulatory obstacles that have hurt little radio stations one change came in when the government increased the number of radio stations a big media company could own leaving less room for independent radio stations that pushed many smaller radio stations onto a new medium the internet today more than million people listen to internet radio including independent web only stations like woxy accuradio and soma fm which stay afloat through advertising and listener donations but new regulations have now reached the online stations the copyright royalty board increased the fee they are required to pay to music performers to cent a song per listener retroactive to on top of the fees they already pay to songwriters and composers and that fee will increase each year rising to cent by whats more small webcasters like woxy used to fall into a special category that paid royalties based on total revenue or expenses not the number of songs they played now theyll be held to the same rules as everyone else for san francisco based somafm the change pushes its fees for last year from &# to more than &# far exceeding its revenue of &# chicago based accuradio expects last years royalties of &# to jump to &# above last years revenue of &# "this will kill my business the moment i have to make a months payment under this new rate " says kurt hanson who runs accuradio the change is especially dispiriting for woxy which has transformed itself so many times to cope with the changing radio landscape the station first got a boost in when a married couple doug and linda balogh quit their high paying jobs in chicago and used their savings to buy the then struggling oxford ohio station within a few years the baloghs had started playing "alternative" music from then obscure bands like u and r e m on the station that drew the attention of national music magazines record labels advertisers and local listeners in dustin hoffmans character in "rain man" mentioned woxy and tom cruise signed a t shirt which the djs mounted on the wall then came the telecommunications act of which deregulated the media industry and made it easier for radio conglomerates to snap up local stations as advertisers shifted their spending to the big radio chains woxy lost advertising deals that had helped it thrive during the s in early the baloghs told mr miller they would have to shut down their woxy radio station because its revenue wasnt growing fast enough "it takes a lot of energy to be a david in a goliath world and we werent young anymore " says mr balogh instead the baloghs proposed that mr miller and three other woxy djs start an internet only broadcast at woxy com after they got online mr miller and the three djs started experimenting with music that wasnt big in the midwest but was popular elsewhere like underground hip hop some longtime fans stopped listening but woxy also attracted a new following online "i has listening the woxy everyday " a fan emailed from brazil yet by going online woxy com ran into a hurdle unique to web radio imposed by the digital millennium copyright act of regular broadcasters pay royalties to composers and songwriters but a dmca rule calls for web radio stations to also pay a fee to performers the government set the fee for small radio stations at to of revenue or of expenses whichever was higher combined with the other costs of streaming music over the internet that meant the cost of running woxy began exceeding its revenue in woxy got some cash from an angel investor it declines to name last year mr miller decided to charge a subscription fee causing many listeners to flee in september mr miller posted a notice on woxys web site saying it would have to shut down that got the notice of silicon valley entrepreneur bill nguyen who had been exploring web radio and had recently started an online cd trading start up called lala inc within a week mr nguyen purchased woxy for less than &# million plus lala stock options lala quickly began trying to make woxy profitable by letting listeners tap into woxys cd library to develop their own playlists lala then streamed the amateur song lists over the internet as a song plays listeners can click on a button to buy the cd from lala so far the experiment is breaking even mr nguyen expects to spend &# to &# million to run woxy this year and to bring in about as much revenue from listeners who buy cds but with the new rules from the copyright royalty board mr nguyen estimates his costs could increase to &# million turning woxy into a money loser mr nguyen doesnt yet have a solution for woxy which currently has about unique listeners monthly he says he may restrict the ability to create songlists to users who are actually buying and selling cds on lala he is also considering altering his cd selling model so that listeners would use their own cd collections to stream music to each other online rather than tapping woxys collection thus reducing his royalty fees he also plans to work with other web radio stations to appeal the royalty decision "if the copyright board does this theyre going to kill off a lot of internet radio " he says if the new royalty rules stick record labels will get higher fees from online radio stations but some small labels worry about the long term consequences sue busch head of radio promotions at seattles sub pop records says most radio executives she knows rarely play new independent music relying on business consultants to tell them which songs are likely to be most popular the woxy djs she says play songs they enjoy themselves "there arent too many radio people who will just chit chat about music they like " she says "were pretty big on taking care of people who have taken care of us "
