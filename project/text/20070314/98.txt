politics &amp economics chinas inland frontier beckons big lesser known cities hold growth prospects for foreign firms beijing one might not expect to find a top quality international hotel in the chinese hinterland but that is what jiaozuo a coal producing city in northwestern henan province will get in july a square foot facility on the citys single major road the modernization and continued growth of huge but lesser known urban centers in chinas interior presents the latest challenge for foreign companies doing business here laying the groundwork on a potentially rich frontier beyond the coastal cities where markets are becoming saturated among the companies that have started looking at less developed inland markets as money spinners after years of profiting from chinas first tier cities are diesel engine maker cummins inc retailer wal mart stores inc and days inn china part of u s based wyndham worldwide corp which will operate a new hotel in jiaozuo as part of the companys expansion outward from prosperous coastal towns still international business machines corp in a survey due for release today says china based foreign companies have acknowledged the need to move inland but havent acted swiftly enough harry tan days inn chinas chief executive remains the unconventional corporate figure who has ventured out of the coastal comfort zone into such cities as erdos in inner mongolia and yuci in central shanxi province "were not advising companies to abandon the current strategy" of operating on the coast says louie cheng an ibm consultant who authored the study with alan beebe director of ibms institute for business value "were saying expand your strategy to the mass markets " the study surveyed more than foreign companies that have operations in china the mass markets identified in ibms study include anshan in liaoning province and tangshan in hebei province average salaries there are at least lower than those on the coast ibm says even with their weaker purchasing power chinas inland cities can be rich pickings for companies that learn how to tap them accounting for of chinas billion people cities that beijing considers "tertiary" third tier and lower generated of the nations gross domestic product in by contrast of chinese live in what are considered first and second tier cities which contributed of gdp in many of the little visited locales have populations of more than one million people including growing numbers of well off residents who have vacationed in the major cities experiencing consumer culture they want more of back home geographic barriers have come down for foreigners since china joined the world trade organization and had obligations to gradually liberalize its economy allowing foreign firms to go deeper into the country yet many companies havent been nimble enough to cater to the newfound consumerism inland some analysts say top tier cities including beijing and shanghai already are crammed with foreign and local brands a situation that could threaten corporate profits in the years ahead the tertiary cities are expanding faster than the developed ones one reason during the next years about million people equal to russias current population are expected to migrate to those cities from chinas most remote rural areas foreign companies that move inland will be able to tap this robust consumer base if they know how to sell distribute and design for inland customers the ibm study said it isnt clear how many foreign firms in china have begun to go inward according to a report the american chamber of commerce in china produced last year companies that have operated six or more years in china tend to have ventured to second tier cities such as chengdu in sichuan province however most companies remain tentative about having ventures in more remote places "people are clearly planning doing their due diligence and building up their political capital" by regularly visiting local officials says james zimmerman amcham chinas chairman "anyone in china now would be doing that and should be doing that " but anxiety about local corruption and confusing laws still discourages many foreign businesses from going local the amcham china report said mr beebe of ibms institute says that while china based executives may appreciate the need to outgrow the major cities they wont necessarily get the support from headquarters where the idea of chinas market may consist of beijing shanghai and not much else at some point businesses will have to broaden the notion of china to include the less popular cities and figure out ways to operate there he says days inn chinas mr tan has a word of advice for the venturesome localize although chinas national tourism administration has rated days hotel and suites jiaozuo as five star the price for each room at the opening will be around yuan or about &# less than half of what many peer hotels in major cities charge the low price is pegged to local spending power because of this the hotel has resorted to cost containing measures such as smaller rooms than are standard for five star facilities and marble imported from the middle east rather than italy jiaozuo has almost no nightlife unlike guangzhou and shanghai where clubs and restaurants abound so mr tan intends to promote in hotel entertainment a room karaoke lounge a chinese restaurant with private rooms a square foot sauna and a korean hot pot and barbecue restaurant jiaozuo residents hired to work at days hotel and suites are getting trained from scratch managers have been brought in from top tier cities on short term assignments mr tan says mr tan says china rookies shouldnt start thinking tertiary cities are where they should set up shop shanghai and other first tier centers remain where new businesses need to build brand credibility "when i go to the small cities they always ask if i already have something going in beijing " he says
