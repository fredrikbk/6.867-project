the afternoon report gms rocky road online edition general motors finally rolled its fourth quarter earnings into the showroom after weeks of tinkering with its accounting but some investors worry the auto giant may be seeing progress on its restructuring only to get its fenders bent by labor tensions and subprime exposure gm is generally seen as making greater headway than its big three brethren in taming structural expenses and bringing production closer in line with demand and indeed it scratched its way back to profitability in the fourth quarter net income was &# million vastly better than the gaping loss of &# billion that gm posted a year earlier critically its north american automotive operations lost just &# million a far cry from the &# billion lost a year earlier analysts seemed to be rather less than enthusiastic however peter nosvold of bear stearns wrote in a note to clients that gms automotive margins came in well short of expectations even as the company sped up some of its cost cutting and as revenue per vehicle jumped pointing to sales incentives and higher steel prices looming down the road mr nosvold said he doesnt "expect a material improvement in this profitability trajectory very near term " gm chief financial officer fritz henderson said the company is not "declaring victory " gm shares fell some analysts are waiting to see whether the next leg up in gms earnings will come from wage health care and retirement concessions from the united auto workers gm has made a great deal of noise about its health care burdens in recent years saying that its deep legacy costs hamstring it when competing with foreign rivals such as toyota motor which dont face anything like the same labor issues the two sides are scheduled to sit down and begin bargaining later this year but some on wall street wondered whether hints of progress at gm will muddy the waters "we remain skeptical that the uaw will agree to significant concessions given how much it has offered in recent years " said robert barry of goldman sachs adding that "uaw members will be asking why cut retiree healthcare benefits when there are a host of other things to try first " another troubling labor issue is skulking around the company still needs to reach a deal with its former parts unit delphi and the uaw mr henderson said that would unlock &# billion in savings but declined to give a timetable for a pact like many other companies gm has also found itself stuck holding a slice of the subprime mortgage mess yesterday the auto maker agreed to pay &# billion to former financing division gmac to make up for subprime lending losses and mr henderson said that gmac in which gm still holds a stake will remain under pressure because of its exposure to the weakening housing market some economists say the subprime meltdown may also lead to a broader macroeconomic malaise and that too could trip gm "it is not inconceivable given what is happening now to mortgage originations that we end up with something closer to a decline in home prices this year " merrill lynch economist david rosenberg wrote in a note falling home values could leave consumers

iraq by march though debate on the bill appeared to be welcomed it is given little chance of passing once it is actually subjected to a vote nonetheless democrats view the debate as an opportunity to
