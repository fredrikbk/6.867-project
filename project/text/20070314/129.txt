what is your k costing you as congress regulators scrutinize hidden charges employers begin to ditch high cost plans negotiate lower fees the dollars youre salting away in your company sponsored k plan will someday help fund a well earned retirement meantime the company managing your retirement savings account may be whittling away at that money to pay for all sorts of stuff even a telephone help line  k plans arent required to make clear how much participants are being charged in fees and there can be a lot of them including charges to cover independent audits tracking and maintaining accounts advisory services as well as help lines and of course the basic expense of managing funds in a plan in fact investing in a fund through a k often can be more expensive than buying it through a retail brokerage account now as congress and federal regulators look into whether the plans expenses are justified and whether fund firms should be required to disclose more information employers are taking steps on their own to cut costs for their workers some companies are ditching high cost funds and replacing them with cheaper investment options some are getting more aggressive about negotiating lower fees and many are taking extra steps to make sure their employees understand the fees they are paying employers often help pay the bill but a survey by consulting firm hewitt associates showed workers have been shouldering a growing share of many plan fees in recent years participants can find fund expense ratios in a prospectus but theres typically no clear breakdown of how much each participant is paying for various plan services like accounting or custody of plan assets fees in k s are becoming increasingly important as the plans become the primary retirement savings vehicle for many americans even a small reduction in fees can result in huge additional savings when an employee retires decades later at the end of about million individuals participated in k plans with assets totaling &# trillion companies running the plans say fees are adequately disclosed and that too much disclosure can be detrimental if participants can easily compare the costs some in the industry argue employees might plow all their money into cheap but low return investment options like a money market fund others say that if employees saw all plan expenses they might not want to participate at all which would be a "worst case scenario " says pamela hess director of retirement research at hewitt associates the growing tension over k expenses spurred federal lawmakers at a congressional hearing last week to probe whether spotty disclosure of fees makes it difficult for employees to know if they are getting a good deal in their k plans and the labor department which oversees k plans is drawing up new disclosure rules on fees some employee groups also have filed lawsuits against their employers for offering plans that allegedly charge excessive fees funds in a k can come with many layers of fees for instance a retail investor can buy class a shares in the american balanced fund which invests in both stocks and bonds for a sales charge and pay annual expenses of but the same funds r share class which is designed for retirement plans carries an annual expense of this breaks down to for services like plan administration and record keeping for management expenses and in so called b fees which are intended to compensate the k plans financial adviser chuck freadhoff american funds spokesman says the ongoing costs in the retirement share class are higher because "the retirement plan business is inherently more complicated and slightly more expensive " to cut costs for its employees i&amp i sling inc an aston pa manufacturing company plans to move the

annual fees to of assets invested from about currently saving about participants a total of about &# a year other employers are switching from mutual funds the traditional k investment to cheaper exchange traded funds which are similar to mutual funds but trade on an exchange like a stock the average expense ratio for an etf is about compared with for the average diversified u s stock mutual fund "its like somebody opened up the floodgates " says darwin abrahamson head of invest n retire llc a firm that provides etf based k plans he estimates his company will end the year with &# million to &# billion in assets up from &# million at the end of last year many employers are trying to learn more about their plan expenses traditionally employers havent fully understood these because theyre too complicated and because some fees are hidden "the providers in some cases are not totally forthcoming with all the fees " says david wray president of the profit sharing k council of america now some employers are hiring outside consultants just to help them understand the fees one retirement plan consulting firm plan sponsor advisors says it has seen demand pick up for in depth fee reviews for large k plans a number of companies are posting tables on their web sites or emailing them to employees that show total expenses attached to each of the k investment options some companies are saving by shopping around nordam group a tulsa okla aerospace company purchased all of its k services from one provider until early last year when it began shopping for services separately now different firms provide record keeping custody of plan assets and investment advice and the plans expenses are "substantially less" than they were under the bundled arrangement says jon day nordams vice president of finance one area of concern are the high fees complexity and potential conflicts of interest associated with so called revenue sharing agreements these often involve payments by a mutual fund company to a k plan provider to compensate the provider for services such as account maintenance these costs are often built into the expenses of the funds offered in the plans and help to increase the cost to plan participants a b fee for example is often used to make revenue sharing payments and to pay commissions to people who sell funds to k plans but critics say the revenue sharing payments can exceed the value of the services provided since fund fees are typically asset based charges longer term employees who have more money in a plan must pay a greater share of these expenses and since different funds have different amounts of revenue sharing built into their expenses certain participants may pay a greater chunk of plan administration costs just because they chose to invest in a particular fund yet revenue sharing arrangements are rarely explained to participants some k plans are seeking to save participants money and address potential conflicts of interest by dropping plan providers that accept payments from funds inside the plan candace walters president of hr works a fairport n y human resources firm was concerned that her k plan provider was pushing participants into funds that paid higher commissions so late last year she moved her plan to a provider that doesnt accept commissions from funds the move cut her plans investment management fees to from she says funds for your future millions of employees save for retirement in k plans but information on plan fees can be hard to come by funds in k s plans can add many layers of extra fees to cover costs of various services some employers are replacing high cost funds in their plans with cheaper alternatives like index funds many employers are beginning to post fund expenses on their web sites to keep workers better informed
