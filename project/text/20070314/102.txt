shows try to renovate moses reputation robert moses and the modern city the transformation of new york remaking the metropolis museum of the city of new york through may the road to recreation queens museum through may slum clearance and the superblock solution wallach gallery of columbia university through april robert moses the man who remade th century new york on a scale equaled only by sixtus vs transformation of th century rome and baron hausmanns radical reshaping of th century paris is a hot topic again he is the subject of three exhibitions two lectures two symposiums and a continuing stream of press coverage that todays architectural superstars can only envy he stands on a bright orange steel beam suspended over water a dwarfed manhattan skyline behind him supremely confident blueprints in hand in a life size photomural that opens one of the three shows under the title of "robert moses and the modern city the transformation of new york " "remaking the metropolis" presents his major public works at the museum of the city of new york through may "the road to recreation" focuses on his beaches pools parks and the parkways that tie them together at the queens museum through may "slum clearance and the superblock solution" covers housing and urban design at the wallach gallery of columbia university through april the curator of all three shows is hilary ballon professor of art history and archaeology at columbia university she has also edited the excellent book of essays that serves as the catalog in collaboration with kenneth t jackson professor of history and the social sciences at columbia as historical revisionism goes this reassessment is probably overdue but the rehabilitation of robert moses is not an easy walk down memory lane the reconsideration of a long career of wildly contradictory highs and lows has also had the unsurprising effect of awakening or rather reawakening the kind of passionate debate not heard since jane jacobs dealt the lower manhattan expressway its final fatal blow more than years ago revisionist scholarship questions received opinions and reassesses accepted points of view the acknowledged purpose here is to add balance to a story in which the brilliant restructuring of the public realm has been obscured by projects that rode roughshod over history and neighborhoods with an unfeeling arrogance of epic proportions that lingers in the collective mind dramatic photographs are used to reveal the scope significance and beauty of moses great public works the elaborate network of roads bridges parks and parkways the superb accessible long island beaches the astounding number of local parks playgrounds and public pools the cultural and international institutions that included lincoln center and the united nations the dominant theme is the magnitude of moses accomplishments and his remarkably prescient visualization of the needs of new york in the st century the argument is also made that an understanding of the ideology practices and resources within which moses operated explains both his extraordinary achievements and his most controversial behavior according to this thesis his activities were part of a general consensus he was doing what was being done at the time the fact that the gross misjudgments of his later years became apparent to many others but not to him as ideas about cities and planning changed makes this a troubling rationale what it all comes down to still and probably always will is the "good" moses versus the "bad" moses the "early" moses versus the "late" moses and how the "good" moses could create the glorious public works of the s and s and the "bad" moses became the symbol of the worst aspects of slum clearance and urban renewal in the s and s the evolution can be seen in the architecture he embraced over the four decades of his career moses was a traditionalist who believed that nothing should be built that was above public taste and yet his initial projects were designed in a contemporary manner enriched with handsome classical and deco details solutions highly praised by lewis mumford there is a stubbornly stunted architectural sensibility evident later when he moved from architects of reputation to big commercial firms and buildings of obdurate mediocrity pseudo colonial with cupola became standard issue for recreational facilities little brick outhouses in howard johnson style were all purpose replacements for calvert vauxs authentic victoriana in central park what moses understood was engineering what he really loved were his suspension bridges if we accept that he was a man of his times he obviously didnt get the message when times changed in the words of one of the books contributors owen gutfreund from being the right person in the right place at the right time moses became the wrong person in the wrong place at the wrong time planning in the early th century was broad and paternalistic its philosophy and practice grew out of the radical ideals of modernism and a belief in social reform that focused on public health and wellbeing moses agenda was a perfect match the more intimate humanistic view of planning as a small scale socially sensitive awareness of the street the neighborhood and individual lives had its catalyst in jacobss book "the death and life of great american cities " which became the bible of the planning revolution this approach would have had no appeal for moses even if he understood it when asked by his biographer robert caro if there was a difference between building parkways on open land and expressways in the inner city he replied "only that there were more people in the way " mr caros take on moses in his definitive work "the power broker robert moses and the fall of new york " published in when new york faced bankruptcy after a decades long downward spiral is considerably darker than the revisionist reassessment there was an embarrassing moment and a whiff of scholarly scandal when it became apparent that he had not been invited to participate in any of the well publicized events the subliminal suggestion intended or not was that it was mr caro who was being revised a discreet announcement followed of a special lecture set up by one of the shows sponsors an overflow crowd gave mr caro a standing ovation adding a little edge to the proceedings it was obvious that those who remembered the midnight bulldozers sent into central park to rip up a playground for more parking for the tavern on the green or the road that would have bisected washington square park with high speed traffic both opposed by "a bunch of mothers" were still clinging to moses image of audacious evil some there are still a few of us who manned the ramparts against his most damaging interventions and were submitted to his most creative vilifications were resisting his canonization the fight to kill the infamous lower manhattan expressway that would have destroyed soho much of the cast iron district and parts of chinatown little italy and the west village moses insisted there was nothing to save is a subject that defies detachment the parade of gorgeous images of bridges and beaches newly photographed for the exhibitions by andrew moore upstages the mute testimony of old letters and news clips protesting wholesale demolition of homes and businesses or the threat of an enormous elevated lane superhighway across th street that would have permanently dismembered manhattan the carefully inclusive narrative tells it all in safely worded labels that neutralize outrage the presentation achieves its purpose of comprehensive objectivity but its very evenhandedness is disturbing it is almost too cool there was nothing evenhanded about moses today there is great prosperity and renewed interest in thinking and building big as city and state officials wrap themselves in moses mantle and try on his shoes for size we hear upbeat talk about "breaking eggs to make omelets" and the way moses "got things done " many eggs were broken for his cross bronx expressway about if you count eggs as the dispossessed when he demolished the east tremont neighborhood rejecting an alternative route that would have done less damage new york suffers from planning amnesia a memory black hole between moses and the present in the late s and s the lindsay administration established local planning offices in all the boroughs that answered directly to the mayor and were staffed by the best and the brightest young professionals who vied for the jobs edward j logue a planner of vision as committed to social objectives as to economic development who revived boston in the s changed roosevelt island from a weedy wasteland with a derelict smallpox hospital into a mixed use mixed income community built around a philip johnson plan with main street as its spine when he headed the new york state urban development corp in the s he returned to new york in the s to put up the little houses in the rubble on charlotte street that symbolized hope and renewal when the south bronx had become the poster child for terminal urban decay you could say they were the right thing in the right place at the right time if logue had lived to be in charge of ground zero the commitment to a cultural commercial mix instead of a surplus of trophy towers would have been carried out and construction well started because he knew what mattered and he also knew how to get things done with all due credit to moses achievements he is not the man to emulate i do not believe that this is the message we are meant to take away he built in his own image larger than life on an unprecedented scale and he was the force majeure responsible for much of the beauty and efficiency of the city we know now fortunately he was stopped before he tore it apart ms huxtable is the journals architecture critic see related letter "letters to the editor
