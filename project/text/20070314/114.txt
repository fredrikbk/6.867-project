the evening wrap welcome home online edition president bush is coming home from a weeklong swing through latin america where he was frequently welcomed with angry protests considering what awaits him as he returns to washington however being hectored by hugo chavez might not seem so bad after all the president wrapped up his southern sojourn in mexico where he beseeched lawmakers back home to finally push through his "comprehensive" package of immigration reforms "im going to keep repeating it while im here in mexico that i know our country must have comprehensive immigration reform " said mr bush arguing that the key to better relations with mexico is to overhaul u s immigration rules that anger critics on both sides of the border the president said at a news conference that he sensed that sentiment in congress was turning in favor of his immigration plan which calls for the creation of a guest worker program and the opening of a path to citizenship for immigrants the legislation stalled out when republicans were in charge on capitol hill as conservative lawmakers sniffed that the reforms stack up as amnesty for illegal immigrants whereas democrats have appeared more open to getting a bill moving however a series of other developments may have pushed immigration reform rather far down on the agenda front and center is the uproar over what democrats characterize as politically motivated terminations of eight federal prosecutors attorney general alberto gonzales told congress that the firings werent instigated by the white house but emails between his former chief of staff and former white house counsel harriet miers that were released yesterday appeared to undercut that assertion the president said he was disturbed by the inconsistencies "any time anybody goes up to capitol hill theyve got to make sure they fully understand the facts and how they characterize the issue to members of congress " mr bush said at the news conference today "and the fact that both republicans and democrats feel like that there was not straightforward communication troubles me and it troubles the attorney general so he took action and he needs to continue to take action " mr gonzales who was at one time seen as a potential nominee to the supreme court has faced numerous calls for his resignation in recent days but he said yesterday that he would not step down and today mr bush backed him "what al did and what the justice department did was appropriate " he said "what was mishandled was the explanation of the cases to the congress " on top of all that the senate was preparing to begin debate on an iraq war measure bickering between democrats and republicans over the scope of earlier debates has prevented any previous resolutions including the symbolic measure opposed to the "surge" of troops into iraq from coming to the floor but today the senate voted to argue the merits of a bill that would call on but not require mr bush to withdraw all u s combat forces from iraq by march democrats in the house are also moving forward with legislation that would require u s troops to be out of iraq no later than sept a withdrawal measure will likely never wind up on the presidents desk indeed senate republicans seemed willing to let it creep onto the floor only because they are sure it will ultimately fail but democrats appear to be hoping that questions over the administrations management of the attorneys flap along with the still unfolding walter reed outpatient care controversy could lead to greater demands for accountability to congress
