the hubbell standard congressional democrats are in full cry over the news this week that the administrations decision to fire eight u s attorneys originated from gasp the white house senator hillary clinton joined the fun yesterday blaming president bush for "the politicization of our prosecutorial system " oh my as it happens mrs clinton is just the senator to walk point on this issue of dismissing u s attorneys because she has direct personal experience in any congressional probe of the matter wed suggest she call herself as the first witness and bring along webster hubbell as her chief counsel as everyone once knew but has tried to forget mr hubbell was a former partner of mrs clinton at the rose law firm in little rock who later went to jail for mail fraud and tax evasion he was also bill and hillary clintons choice as associate attorney general in the justice department when janet reno his nominal superior simultaneously fired all u s attorneys in march ms reno or mr hubbell gave them days to move out of their offices at the time president clinton presented the move as something perfectly ordinary "all those people are routinely replaced " he told reporters "and i have not done anything differently " in fact the dismissals were unprecedented previous presidents including ronald reagan and jimmy carter had both retained holdovers from the previous administration and only replaced them gradually as their tenures expired this allowed continuity of leadership within the u s attorney offices during the transition equally extraordinary were the politics at play in the firings at the time jay stephens then u s attorney in chicago was investigating then ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski and was "within days" of making a decision on an indictment mr rostenkowski who was shepherding the clintons economic program through congress eventually went to jail on mail fraud charges and was later pardoned by mr clinton also at the time allegations concerning some of the clintons whitewater dealings were coming to a head by dismissing all u s attorneys at once the clintons conveniently cleared the decks to appoint "friend of bill" paula casey as the u s attorney for little rock ms casey never did bring any big whitewater indictments and she rejected information from another fob david hale on the business practices of the arkansas elite including mr clinton when it comes to "politicizing" justice in short the bush white house is full of amateurs compared to the clintons and it may be this very amateurism that explains how the current administration has managed to turn this routine issue of replacing presidential appointees into a political fiasco there was nothing wrong with replacing the eight attorneys all of whom serve at the presidents pleasure prosecutors deserve supervision like any other executive branch appointees the supposed scandal this week is that mr bush had been informed last fall that some u s attorneys had been less than vigorous in pursuing voter fraud cases and that the president had made the point to attorney general albert gonzales voter fraud strikes at the heart of democratic institutions and it was entirely appropriate for mr bush or any president to insist that his appointees act energetically against it take sacked u s attorney john mckay from washington state in the governors race was decided in favor of democrat christine gregoire by votes on a third recount as the seattle post intelligencer and other media outlets reported some of the "voters" were deceased others were registered in storage rental facilities and still others were convicted felons more than ballots were "discovered" in a seattle warehouse none of this constitutes proof that the election was stolen but it should have been enough to prompt mr mckay a democrat to investigate something he declined to do apparently on grounds that he had better things to do in new mexico another state in which recent elections have been decided by razor thin margins u s attorney david iglesias did establish a voter fraud task force in but it lasted all of weeks before closing its doors despite evidence of irregularities by the likes of the association of community organizations for reform now or acorn as our john fund reported at the time acorns director matt henderson refused to answer questions in court about whether his group had illegally made copies of voter registration cards in the run up to the election as for some of the other fired attorneys at least one of their dismissals seemed to owe to differences with the administration about the death penalty another to questions about the attorneys managerial skills not surprisingly the dismissed attorneys are insisting their dismissals were unfair and perhaps in some cases they were it would not be the first time in history that a dismissed employee did not take kindly to his firing nor would it be the first in which an employer sacked the wrong person no question the justice department and white house have botched the handling of this issue from start to finish but what we dont have here is any serious evidence that the administration has acted improperly or to protect some of its friends if democrats want to understand what a real abuse of power looks like they can always ask the junior senator from new york correction jay stephens was the u s attorney for the district of columbia in not chicago and former u s attorney john mckay says he is a republican not a democrat both facts were misstated in yesterdays editorial "the hubbell standard " wsj march
