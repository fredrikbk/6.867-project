bargain basement foreclosure rise brings business to one investor mr barnes buys dregs from worried lenders a dozen for &# leesville s c when mortgage lenders get stuck owning dilapidated houses in shabby neighborhoods they often call james odell barnes mr barnes works the rock bottom of the housing market what his lawyer calls the "sub subprime market " he and his partners buy foreclosed homes by the dozens sight unseen often for just a few thousand dollars apiece they resell them to low income buyers who would have trouble qualifying for bank mortgages providing many buyers with seller financing "the reason the banks call me is i will buy anything " says mr barnes years old who often can be found puttering around his acre horse farm in this small town outside columbia times are good for mr barnes and they may get better the subprime mortgage market which serves people with weak credit records is in turmoil a surge in defaults has forced more than lenders out of business in recent months at year end of all subprime mortgages were in the process of being foreclosed up from a year earlier the mortgage bankers association said yesterday that number is expected to grow as rising overdue payments lead to more foreclosures bottom fishers like mr barnes will get more opportunities to snap up cheap homes mr barnes farms out most of the deals to a group of about investors around the country collecting &# for each deal he passes on to them last year he says he and the investors bought more than foreclosed homes mr barnes who never attended college says his real estate investment income topped &# million last year banks appreciate mr barnes few real estate agents are interested in peddling low priced houses in bad neighborhoods that have been acquired by lenders through foreclosure mr barnes is happy to buy such houses over the phone he doesnt inspect them or even visit them mr barnes and his investor friends dont fix up the properties they tack up handwritten "for sale" signs informing potential buyers of required down payments and monthly payments usually just a few hundred dollars each in essence mr barnes and his cohorts sell the houses on year installment plans the interest rates they charge are a steep about double the rate of year fixed rate mortgages for people with strong credit and the late payment penalties are tough the shaky credit of many buyers warrants it he say "nobody gets cheated " he says mr barnes and his partners normally sell the loans to other investors within six months at a steep discount george kastanes mr barness lawyer estimates that about of buyers eventually default on the loans so far the trouble in the subprime market hasnt dampened investor appetite for buying the kinds of loans mr barnes and his partners sell says bob repass managing director of bayview first funding a dallas based buyer of such loans the seller financing extended by mr barnes which doesnt involve any banks is very different from the subprime mortgages made by financial institutions he says some nonprofit groups that promote affordable housing question whether such deals are good for buyers they worry that poor people who buy run down houses without having them inspected or appraised might not understand what theyre getting into "youre setting them up for failure " says bruce marks chief executive of neighborhood assistance corp of america a nonprofit housing services organization based in boston low income people who cant get a conventional loan he argues often are better off renting until they can improve their finances mr barnes says hes giving such buyers what may be their only shots at home ownership low income people he says generally know how to recognize and fix flaws "poor people know how to install a hot water heater and they know how to paint" and even how to fix a foundation he says "poor people have a lot of ingenuity " last september ola gorby a year old mother of four who works

lenders usually hire real estate agents to market foreclosed properties mr barnes and his investors buy the dregs homes in depressed neighborhoods in cities like detroit and cleveland where there is lots of vacant housing or in rural areas where few people are looking for homes "real estate agents arent real motivated to deal with these houses" because their commissions would be so small says mr barnes "the banks just want them gone " until lenders sell the houses they have to pay for taxes insurance and maintenance mr barnes says that because the houses cost so little it isnt worth his time to inspect them before buying he guesstimates what theyre worth based on experience most buyers of foreclosed homes spruce them up before trying to resell them mr barnes wants nothing to do with
