return on the potentially high investment needed analysts say denmarks tdc as launched its full fledged internet protocol tv or iptv service in february while swedens teliasonera ab has begun a major marketing campaign in its home market norways telenor asa has some iptv services in sweden and is planning a launch next year but some analysts are cautious about the near term prospects for this new market amid concerns about whether the telecoms can compete with existing tv services particularly cable in terms of content "its something they need to do in order to try and secure future growth however theres reason to be cautious on the possibilities of quick success " said bengt moelleryd analyst at standard &amp poors equity research like telecom operators world wide the nordic companies are looking for new sources of revenue as traditional fixed line business declines iptv delivers tv programs over broadband internet to an ordinary television set via a receiver box operators france

a recent report the service is particularly attractive for nordic operators because of the high level of broadband penetration in the region in july broadband penetration in the nordic region ranged from of the population in sweden to in denmark the highest in europe european union figures show the eu average was around teliasonera was an early mover with iptv it launched services in sweden in

teliasonera is offering free iptv to broadband subscribers "tv will be of paramount importance " said teliasonera chief executive anders igel last month as the company presented fourth quarter earnings mr igel declined to say how much revenue the company is targeting depending on the success tdc has in denmark the company may start selling iptv service in other nordic countries telenor is developing an upgraded version that it plans to start selling next year across scandinavia telenor doesnt have operations in finland iptv is still a small portion of telecom companies overall revenue

revenue source for service providers " said per arne sandegren an analyst at idc in stockholm the three large nordic operators already had non internet television services before launching iptv telenor offers cable tv services in norway and satellite in all the nordic countries and tdc has cable tv in denmark teliasonera offers cable tv in denmark and the baltic countries one key advantage of iptv is its flexibility the companies say viewers arent tied only to broadcasters schedules meaning they can watch movies and other programming when they want in addition to regular tv teliasoneras offering allows subscribers to order and watch movies on demand surf the internet via the tv at home and view photos stored on teliasoneras server said erik hallberg senior vice president at teliasonera responsible for broadband services in sweden iptv can also reach a wider market than cable because it uses the standard phone network satellite tv reaches all areas however cable can
