legislators aim at a new misdeed on the road dwt driving while texting is email junkies woe linked to accidents olympia wash during the morning rush hour on dec the year old driver of a blue dodge caravan was traveling north on interstate outside seattle when he took his eyes off the road to scan an email on his blackberry the state patrol says and thats how he hit the white mazda which clipped the green honda which rammed the black toyota suv before spinning into the other lane and plowing into a city bus nobody was seriously hurt but the episode sparked a chain reaction of a different sort in the state legislature in the form of a bill that would make it a crime to "operate a motor vehicle while reading writing or sending electronic messages " "i think just about everyone realizes that text messaging while driving should not be acceptable " says joyce mcdonald the bills sponsor but the republican member of the washington house of representatives also recognizes that people call it "crackberry" for a reason she cheerfully admits shed probably scan her own device on the drive to work "if i didnt need my reading glasses to see email " forget dwi the big new traffic safety issue is dwt driving while texting ms mcdonald is joining a crowd of politicians seeking a crackdown in neighboring oregon pending bills would provide fines up to &# in one of them for any driver caught texting or holding a cellphone to an ear and in arizona a bill is pending that would make dwt a ticketable offense dwt is an extreme version of a whole new class of modern "distracted driving" issues lawmakers are wrestling with around the country as electronic devices become an ever more important part of peoples lives in and out of their automobiles lawmakers are being encouraged by insurance companies like allstate corp which has added an email fanatic to its stable of "multitasker" safe driving ads the campaign shows the "dedicated investor " who is balancing a blackberry and the business section of a newspaper on the wheel while he navigates his sports car through stop and go traffic another scene in the ad shows a driver changing his trousers while blazing down the highway driving while talking on cellphones has gotten the most legislative attention connecticut new york new jersey california and the district of columbia currently outlaw the use of handheld phones while driving and states are currently debating bills that would regulate their use behind the wheel according to the national conference of state legislatures some wireless industry supporters argue that statutes barring texting while driving are too specific what is needed they say is not narrowly focused legislation but a campaign to educate the public about all driver distractions in washington d c an industry lobby group called ctia the wireless association has begun tracking legislation including ms mcdonalds bill and scratching out a strategy to counter it "i dont think youd find anyone who would say that trying to text and drive is not reckless behavior " says joe farren spokesman for the group "if youre being reckless you should get a ticket " he adds that his group has taken no formal position on text message bills such as ms mcdonalds few driver distractions seem quite as frighteningly intrusive as attempting to read and type messages while weaving in traffic the first reported incident of dwt may have been in tennessee in when a man died while texting when he lost control of his pickup and plunged down an embankment in colorado that same year a teenager served days in jail after he struck and killed a bicyclist while texting a friend a study conducted by nationwide mutual insurance co that was released earlier this year found that of all drivers text message behind the wheel and of drivers between the ages of and dwt seems particularly common among kids ms mcdonald first considered her ban last october after she visited a high school and a group of students showed her how to send text messages by cellphone "they were sending messages secretly while they were sitting in class " she says "it wasnt long before it dawned on me that they were also texting while they were driving " the discovery enabled ms mcdonald to find a quick co sponsor across the aisle in democrat dawn morrell who said she had seen her own campaign manager texting behind the wheel "imagine these kids driving along while theyre breaking up with their boyfriends or whatever " ms morrell says "we laugh but its scary " a hearing was held recently on ms mcdonalds bill in an ornate legislative building adjacent to the capitol in olympia where she and others testified before a largely impassive group of house transportation committee members the legislature has turned down cellphone legislation eight years straight but this time it was clear the mood had begun to shift many legislators seemed keen to enact some restrictions one representative larry seaquist referred in the hearing to a bill that would "phase out" handheld wireless devices among drivers as "the save my wifes life act " sprint nextel corp which opposes legislation that would limit wireless devices in cars had a lobbyist in olympia that day sprint says curbing abuse is best handled through education and should focus on the full spectrum of driver distractions the company has begun distributing a series of four posters to high schools around the country that highlight this strategy one of the posters shows a burger and fries while the others show a tube of mascara a compact disc and a silver fliptop phone the caption on the phone poster reads "cell phone oz car lbs taking the wheel is a ton of responsibility " few opponents argue that driving and texting any more than driving and drinking is a good idea instead opponents focus on the dearth of statistics showing that wireless devices cause crashes indeed there are few data suggesting that texting causes more wrecks than say fast food a study conducted by the state of washington in blamed "driver distractions" for of the reported accidents during the first nine months of that year of that number the study said distractions prompted by "operating a handheld communications device " including text messaging came in fifth statistically in line with the grab bag category of "driver interacting with passengers animals or objects " but police in washington say not a day passes when they dont see a case of dwt and that the statistics may not reflect the extent of the problem many wrecks have an undetermined cause and dwt data rely on driver honesty current state law gives drivers little incentive to blab the reward for honesty is a ticket for negligent operation of a vehicle which draws a flat &# fine the only way to independently determine whether the devices were in use is cumbersome police would have to get a warrant to subpoena billing records but it would be hard to talk a judge into granting such subpoenas for a fender bender trooper jeff merrill says the driver of the dodge caravan on dec would almost certainly have gotten away with his carelessness had he not confessed "hes been very upfront about it " trooper merrill says trooper merrill said the biggest problem with ms mcdonalds legislation may be its enforceability though ms mcdonald says more than of her constituents who text behind the wheel would probably knock it off if the practice were outlawed the lawman is skeptical "hey weve all done it one time or another and i think people will continue to do it " trooper merrill says "but if youre going to do it you better be careful "
