drug war for booming biotech firms a new threat generics democrats bills would clear way for copies preparations in croatia the future of the biotechnology industry may lie in a steel and glass research center a few miles from the red roofed medieval buildings of the croatian capital zagreb inside scientists at u s generics maker barr pharmaceuticals inc are working on copycat versions of some of biotechs biggest hits drugs that cost the american health care system billions of dollars a year their goal is to sell them someday in the u s its a critical turning point for the biotech industry companies such as amgen inc and genentech inc have recorded spectacular growth over the past decade one reason for their lofty stock prices unlike the pills from traditional drug makers biotech drugs almost never face competition from generics even after their patents expire thats likely to change europe has already cleared the way for copycat biotech drugs and the u s congress now in the control of democrats is gearing up to do the same powerful democrats such as hillary clinton and charles schumer of new york in the senate and henry waxman of california in the house have proposed bills that have the biotech industry up in arms the bills would give the food and drug administration authority to approve biotech copies without the full testing required of originals "i dont think its whether it will happen its a question of when it happens " says barr chief executive bruce downey biotech companies are fighting to stall the legislation warning that knockoff medicines could pose serious risks unless the fda requires extensive testing before approval "these products are not identical and cannot be identical scientifically and commercially " says kevin sharer the chief executive of amgen biotech executives also say that if the door is thrown wide open to generics research into cancer and other diseases would be hurt and the economies of biotech centers such as the san francisco bay area would suffer a blow the waxman bill "would have a devastating impact on the industry " says genzyme corp ceo henri termeer global spending on biotech drugs totaled more than &# billion last year according to an estimate from ims health double the figure traditional drug companies mostly make "small molecule" drugs typically in the form of pills most can be cooked up by mixing chemicals in a series of well defined steps biotech drugs also called biologics are proteins manufactured in living cells scientists typically splice genetic material into bacterial yeast or mammalian cells which then produce the proteins a single molecule of these proteins may weigh times as much as a single molecule of the active ingredient in prozac simple tests can confirm whether a copycat version of prozac is identical to the real thing everyone agrees its a lot harder to do so for a drug like amgens epogen a protein that boosts red blood cells but generics companies say that thanks to scientific advances they can show their versions are effectively equivalent for makers of small molecule drugs no legislation is more important than the hatch waxman act of it says that to gain fda approval makers of generic small molecule drugs merely need to show that their products are equivalent to the originals generics dont have to go through extensive human trials like the originals do that legislation defines the life cycle of prescription pills on the u s market today thanks to patents drug companies usually have or years to sell their pills exclusively at a high price then the exclusivity expires generics makers rush in and the price plunges in recent years companies such as pfizer inc have lost billions of dollars in sales to generics hatch waxman didnt cover most biotech drugs then barely a speck on the market even as patents on some of the earliest biologics began to expire the idea of generic biologics got little traction in the republican led congress democrats are eager for savings to offset the cost of federal health programs last week the senate health committee held its first hearing on the issue "its going to be a fight no question about it " says rep waxman who calls the generic biologic bill one of his highest priorities the generics friendly waxman bill has won endorsements from the afl cio and aarp the influential seniors group major insurers and employers are also lobbying for it they argue that cheaper biotech drugs would save money for consumers employers and the government "as an auto company we face competition and we think the same thing ought to happen" in pharmaceuticals says annette guarisco a general motors corp executive who leads a pro generics coalition in lobbying for the bill the pharmacy benefit manager express scripts inc has told congress that generic biotech drugs could save americans &# billion over a decade more than &# billion of that projected savings is tied to anemia fighting epogen and another version of the drug sold as procrit by johnson &amp johnson the federal medicare program spent &# billion on amgens epogen in the government accountability office says the biotech industry and some independent analysts discount the express scripts estimate saying the initial savings are likely to be far lower contrary to express scriptss assumption amgen asserts epogen is protected by patents in the u s until and cant be copied right away even if generics legislation passes it requires considerable expertise to develop and test generic biologics that will result in fewer competitors and smaller price reductions than in the small molecule market biotech executives argue avalere health llc a research firm estimates the federal government might save only &# billion in the decade after a new law went into effect seeing the political winds turn against them biotech companies now concede that some form of generic biologics will come on the market eventually but they hope with conditions j&amp j has gone so far as to cite one of its own miscues as evidence that generic biotech drugs need testing in humans j&amp j sells a version of epogen in europe under the brand name eprex a few years ago about patients on eprex developed serious immune reactions j&amp j initially played down the possibility that the problem was unique to its drug later it admitted a tweak to its manufacturing process for eprex had probably led to the reaction j&amp j says it was able to find the problem thanks to its resources and expertise but the episode shows why regulators need to closely scrutinize generics "the testing requirements need to be substantial enough to minimize the risk " says audrey phillips j&amp j executive director of biopharmaceutical public policy planning another key issue in the washington debate is "interchangeability " if a doctor writes a prescription for prozac many states permit pharmacies to switch automatically to a generic version of the pill biotech companies want to ensure that the government doesnt allow automatic switching for biologics in one slide presented to hill staffers an amgen executive compared his companys drugs to chocolate cake made with a secret recipe a chef might taste the cake and attempt to cook up a copy but it will "not be identical and you will taste differences" in flavor and texture the slide said even the phrase "generic biologic" irks biotech companies because they say it implies incorrectly that the generics are exact copies europe has moved faster than the u s in paving the way for what it calls "biosimilars " in the pan european drug regulator the european medicines agency released a paper describing its stance on approving generic biologics the agency followed up with specific guidance on four top drugs including erythropoietin or epo the product sold as epogen by amgen two companies have already applied to market versions of epo in europe according to a report from citigroup one of the two is a small german company which has licensed u s and most european rights for its drug to hospira inc of lake forest ill the citigroup report says the other applicant is a group of companies including sandoz a novartis ag unit which declines to comment patents covering epo in europe are different from those in the u s and citigroup expects the first european generic to hit the market in last year sandoz won european and u s approval for its copycat version of human growth hormone a drug already sold by genentech and others human growth hormone is one of a handful of simpler biologics for which the fda can approve a copy without a change in the law mr downey the barr chief executive smells opportunity barr has long sought to develop generics with technical or other barriers that scare other companies off in mr downey lost out on a deal to buy a company developing generic biologics but a lesson from the due diligence stuck the science wasnt as gnarly as biotech companies made it out to be "the original argument was it couldnt be done " he says "it became evident to me that it was being done " he sent a barr executive to scour the globe for companies with biotech expertise the tour ended in croatia home of the venerable drug maker pliva founded in the company is known for discovering a top selling antibiotic licensed by pfizer and sold in the u s as zithromax since yugoslavias communist days the company has been a major supplier of raw materials for generic drugs in barr announced a deal to license plivas version of a white blood cell booster made by amgen called neupogen it was a risky move because republicans controlled congress and it wasnt clear when the u s would allow a generic neupogen last october barr upped the ante when it outbid a rival actavis group of iceland to buy pliva for &# billion pliva has also been working on a version of epo but it is behind european rivals mr downey says barr is studying how to proceed with generic epo and may focus on the u s market to oversee barrs biotech initiative mr downey dispatched christine mundkur a senior vice president from the companys woodcliff lake n j headquarters to zagreb the futuristic glass building where she works is shared with a giant of the traditional pharmaceutical business glaxosmithkline plc which bought plivas new drug development business last year the barr operation in zagreb has about employees barrs biotech process begins in several bedroom size labs on a recent day a scientist wearing a white lab coat and goggles used a pipette to squirt a clear liquid into glass test tubes her goal was to coax live bacteria cells in the tube to fuse with pieces of genetic material so the cells could start producing the protein that would become a biotech drug when scientists think they have a good copy it goes to the lab of marko velutic a year old chemist with a brown goatee who oversees the pliva lab that checks whether the copies match up with the originals biotech companies say thats impossible to know precisely but mr velutic is more sanguine "the tools are so much more sensitive than before " he says "we can see impurities and structures that we never could " mr velutic and his staff subject molecules to about different tests mapping out their impurities and exact weights among them running them through the mass spectrometer a big gray machine dubbed the maldi tof that sits in the center of the lab lining the walls in one of mr velutics labs are two shelves of thick yellow and blue binders packed with printouts of tests the company did to compare amgens neupogen to its own copycat version potentially the basis for a regulatory application to market the product in the u s amgen executives say that such lab testing isnt enough to demonstrate that copycats of their products are safe and effective and clinical trials are needed "you cant fully characterize it in the lab " says bill sheridan an amgen vice president "apparently subtle or minor changes in the manufacturing process can have a major effect " the stakes are particularly high with epogen he says because the red blood cell boosting hormone it replaces serves a unique function in the body any immune reactions caused by impurities in the drug could be serious pliva has a factory capable of making test batches of biotech drugs but it is far too small to serve the european or u s markets for major products barr recently broke ground on a &# million biotech factory about half an hour from zagreb due to be finished in mr downey says that if barr proceeds to develop epo for the u s market even that facility wont be enough "we have every confidence that we can do these products " he says
