business bookshelf the best way to labor away in our little boxes the cubicle survival guide by james f thompson villard pages &# office humor is an oxymoron at least that was the prevailing view until scott adamss "dilbert" comic strip and more recently british television import "the office" opened up this fertile ground for mainstream ridicule the latest entry in the growing corpus of workplace whacking is "the cubicle survival guide keeping your cool in the least hospitable environment on earth " by first time author and web site production coordinator james f thompson mr thompsons target the cubicle or "cube " as it is not so fondly known its surprising to learn that this ubiquitous steel and fabric prison was not invented until the s the dubious brainstorm of a colorado fine arts professor named bob probst his goal according to mr thompson was to encourage co workers to "freely exchange ideas and inspiration" and not as commonly believed to breed a legion of the undead who feel they are somehow unworthy of say a door to call the cube the "least hospitable environment on earth" is an insult to deserts not to mention deep sea hydrothermal vents but there is little doubt that the million or so of us who are consigned to cubicle life have a love hate relationship with our workspaces mr thompson says his aim is "to empower the cubicle inhabitant with information " that information is divided into sections on topics such as phone etiquette "never raise your voice" decoration leave the "hilarious" keg party photos at home hygiene "how can you not know you smell its like being on fire" and in cube exercises "put down your beer" adhering to the self help book template each section includes case studies "cube tips " illustrative dialogues and a quick quiz self assessment heres a quick quiz how seriously are we to take any of this the book is labeled "humor " of course and an authors note points out that all the characters are fictional there are some amusing comic bits such as a faux scientific profile of a life form known as the "office lamprey" a "parasitic eel like land mammal" from the family "petro intrudus uninvitus" and a cube farm maze titled "bathroom run " but going for flat out dave barry style yuks is not really what this book is about more common are straightforward observations such as "there is no substitute for washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water " and "its also a good idea to clean your desktop area routinely with a fresh cloth and antibacterial cleaner " good advice most definitely good office humor not unless you grew up thinking your mother was a comic genius the book is at its most affecting oddly enough when it drops the humor and advice shtick and shows a soulful side from time to time mr thompson reveals a touching sympathy for the people who live in this adverse environment reminding us that at the end of the work day we are all only human "love yourself and others " he says "take risks call your family even if you hate them " just remember if you call them from your cube do not raise your voice mr kihn is the author of "house of lies how management consultants steal your watch and then tell you the time "
