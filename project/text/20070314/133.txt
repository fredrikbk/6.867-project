why car batteries are dying young plethora of gadgets chargers onboard systems sap power beware the killer cup warmer michael pancheris new york shop specializes in modifying sports cars to improve their power speed and handling but lately he has taken on an extra job tending to his customers batteries car batteries traditionally needed to be replaced every three to five years but the interval seems to be shrinking to about two years says mr pancheri "we have seen an increase in failed batteries over the last two years from customers who have add on electronics like ipods and navigation systems " he says a steady increase in the number of electrical accessories in the average car is shortening battery life as vehicles are now being designed to operate more systems they still use the same basic type of volt battery that has been in use for decades in the past decade or so cars have evolved from basic transportation to something resembling dens kitchens and offices on wheels with everything from dvd screens subwoofer sound systems and mood lighting to built in refrigerators and cup holders that heat coffee and cool soft drinks the automotive aftermarket also offers an ever growing range of gadgets that help multitasking drivers and passengers talk eat find their way around and get their work done on the road for consumers the proliferation of onboard electronics means increased comfort convenience efficiency and safety in the form of computerized engine controls tire pressure sensors and powerful navigation and entertainment systems the downside all these power sapping accessories coupled with vehicles increasingly complex networks of electronic ignition systems pollution control devices security systems and display screens could be helping to drive up the death rate for car batteries even parked cars are using more juice than they used to it isnt that owners are simply forgetting to turn off the headlights or leaving their cellphones charging overnight there are many electronic devices in todays vehicles that continue to draw power even after the ignition is turned off electric fans under the hood may run for several minutes after a vehicle is turned off to cool the engine and navigation engine management and diagnostic systems need power to maintain memory and can slowly discharge a battery to where it cannot easily be recharged simply by running the car sales of replacement batteries which range from &# to &# jumped to million in compared with million a year earlier and an average of about million a year for the previous years according to data from industry mr a research firm in oak brook ill a spokesman for the firm says there are other factors that contribute to the jump in battery replacement for one people are keeping their cars longer and the frequency of battery replacement tends to increase in cars that are more than five years old other trends are also contributing to the strain on batteries diesel engines which are beginning to make a comeback in passenger cars require more starting power even the steady increase in the number of vehicles per household can mean that some cars are used less often giving batteries more time to discharge and deteriorate manufacturers test new vehicles to make sure they can be parked for a few weeks without their electronic systems draining the battery to the point where it cannot start the engine but these tests dont necessarily consider how consumers actually use their cars the volt car battery traces its origin to french physicist gaston plante who invented the lead acid battery in over time car batteries have generally become more powerful and longer lasting still ever increasing demands from motorists have kept their typical life span between three and five years they can last twice that long if they are cared for properly and not often exposed to extreme temperatures people have steadily spent more time over the past decade or two commuting eating watching movies and otherwise living in their cars but the auto industry was slow to change vehicle design to cater to motorists changing needs where using an accessory once meant plugging in to the cigarette lighter vehicles now have as many power outlets as a home office and spaces designed to hold cellphones and laptop computers for years batteries have been marketed as "maintenance free " and consumers have taken them for granted but the extra strain they are under in modern cars has many owners giving them renewed attention experts say its a good idea to disconnect the battery when a vehicle is parked for weeks at a time but it will still slowly discharge even when stored small charging devices called trickle chargers which cost &# to &# can extend battery life by keeping it fully charged when the car is parked but people shouldnt expect miracles from the extra effort at maintenance the biggest threats to battery health extreme weather and vibration often are impossible to avoid power failure a growing number of accessories and add ons are putting on strain on auto batteries here are some of the worst offenders security alarms satellite navigation systems dvd players
