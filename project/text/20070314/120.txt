the secret recipe for high taxes suppose you own a business and have a million dollars in cash with which you want to enlarge your factory or laboratory building more products providing more services and hiring more workers the federal government says it will tax your money away but says you will be better off and so will the economy how is that well the taxes the government says will reduce the federal budget deficit and a lower deficit means interest rates will decline so you will be able to borrow the money back to expand your business and at a slightly lower interest rate than prevails today feel better now if you dont you will not be thrilled by the house democrats paygo budget rule adopted earlier this year you will also want to watch the senate budget resolution being marked up this week in the budget committee which will set limits under the senates existing paygo rule these rules require that whenever the house or the senate legislatively expands mandatory spending mostly for entitlements or reduces taxes the hit to the budget must be offset by a cut in other mandatory spending or an increase in other taxes there is no logical reason to link taxes and entitlements in the budget as opposed to say taxes and discretionary spending or discretionary spending and entitlements the link is political paygo was deliberately fashioned in order to make opponents of tax hikes into villains for blocking new entitlements it also makes it harder to avoid tax hikes and trim government spending and it lets defenders of discretionary spending off the hook since under the house paygo rule increases in discretionary spending do not need to be offset at all paygo is a way of diverting attention from the wisdom taught by milton friedman the true burden of government is what it spends not what it takes in taxes whether funded by taxes or borrowing government spending diverts real resources manpower land and material from private to government use some economists claim that this damage and friedmans precept applies only to government purchases of goods and services not to transfer payments that just redistribute income but transfers do damage too by reducing recipients need and incentive to work and save higher tax rates on workers and savers also reduce their incentive to work and save the result is not a wash it is a reduction in productive effort taxes and transfers shrink the economic pie paygo reinforces the fallacy that it is harmless to raise entitlement spending if taxes go up to pay for it every recent revenue offset under the budget rules has been a tax on businesses or savers some "loophole" is shut down but too often that "loophole" is a legitimate cost of business whose elimination increases the tax bias against saving and investment and retards growth the paygo rule is a direct threat to the extension of the bush tax cuts or the enactment of any other tax cut in the future the marginal tax rate cuts in and the critical rate caps on dividends and capital gains in are all due to expire at the end of the caps take a whack at the double taxation of corporate income and provided over half of the spur to capital formation in the two laws the caps turned a lackluster recovery into a mini boom encouraging more dividend payouts and capital gains realizations plus a surge in job growth and wages if congress fails to extend the tax rate caps investment would take a hit the affordable capital stock would shrink worker productivity employment and wages would sag and revenues from corporate profits dividends capital gains payroll taxes and personal income taxes would fall contrary to popular rhetoric earlier paygo budget rules were not the source of the swing from federal budget deficits to surpluses in the period revenues surged thanks to a strong economy and the budget picture improved thanks to a more restrained growth in discretionary spending mainly reduced military spending lower interest on the debt after helped too still entitlement spending continued to climb paygos defenders say that deficits reduce investment by cutting national saving and raising interest rates and so the argument goes deficit reduction is good for business even if it means higher taxes no tax increases on saving and investment directly reduce private saving and the incentive to invest by contrast a deficit of any reasonable size has a negligible effect on interest rates mckinsey &amp company recently estimated the global stock of financial instruments private and government bonds stocks mortgages etc to be &# trillion at the end of and increasing by &# trillion a year squeezing another &# trillion of u s debt into the global portfolio over years would add only about to world assets and boost global interest rates by about thats half a percent of the interest rate not half a percentage point thus a corporate bond rate might rise to or about basis points the notion that a tax hike on capital will reduce interest rates by raising national saving is nonsense a corporate tax hike comes initially out of retained earnings or capital recovery allowances which are part of business saving the drop in the deficit is matched by a drop in business saving or by a drop in revenue from subsequent taxes on dividends and capital gains tax hikes on small businesses also depress saving national saving goes down not up the return on investment falls making savers and investors want to do less and thus we reach the absurdity of taking a million dollars away from a business owner that he owns outright so that he can borrow it back at instead of one democratic priority is to slow the spread of the alternative minimum tax bane of blue state taxpayers who itemize big state and local tax payments paygo would make it harder to fix the amt without dooming extension of the bush tax cuts beyond which would do more harm to economic growth than letting the amt annoy more taxpayers ideally the senate budget resolution would leave room to make permanent the tax cuts and to eliminate the amt paygo is a twisted crutch for a crippled budget process it is no substitute for a budget ethic of spending restraint it is bad government and bad economics mr entin is president of the institute for research on the economics of taxation
