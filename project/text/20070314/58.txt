gonzales testimony is undercut emails show white house justice aides orchestrated effort to fire prosecutors washington emails between white house aides and attorney general alberto gonzaless chief of staff show an orchestrated effort to fire several u s attorneys counter to mr gonzaless previous assertions that the firings werent instigated by the white house the emails released yesterday appear to conflict with statements mr gonzales and other top justice department officials made to members of congress in testimony and letters explaining the prosecutor dismissals some lawmakers and former justice department officials say mr gonzales a longtime friend of president bush who previously served as white house counsel seems to be acting more as presidential counselor than the nations top law enforcement officer mr gonzales who two years ago was touted as a strong possibility to be the first hispanic chief justice of the supreme court now faces demands for his resignation from some lawmakers and the prospect of frequent appearances before congressional committees investigating the u s attorney dismissals even some conservatives distanced themselves from him yesterday recent events show mr gonzales is "an echo chamber of the white house " says bruce fein former associate deputy attorney general under president reagan "when the president says jump he says how high " in a news conference yesterday mr gonzales accepted responsibility for what he called "mistakes " while defending the firings and rejecting calls for his resignation from democrats in congress justice department officials say mr gonzales wasnt aware of some of the emails and memorandums between his chief of staff kyle sampson and white house officials which set out plans for carrying out the firings mr sampson who resigned monday declined to comment yesterday "i believe very strongly in our obligation to ensure that when i provide information to the congress that its accurate and that its complete and i am very dismayed that that may not have occurred here " mr gonzales said "i was not involved in seeing any memos was not involved in any discussions about what was going on thats basically what i knew as the attorney general " the documents released yesterday are the latest explanations from justice department officials of what mr gonzales once described as an "overblown personnel matter " the initial reason cited for the removal of the federal prosecutors was normal turnover then the department said all but one of the attorneys fired were poor performers the prosecutors most of whom say they remain loyal republicans then spoke out to defend their reputations for mr gonzales the inquiry into the dismissals shows the flip side of his close ties to president bush he first served mr bush as his counsel when mr bush was texas governor and then he was appointed to the state supreme court he came to washington as mr bushs counsel before becoming attorney general the white house said president bush continues to have full confidence in mr gonzales "hes a stand up guy " white house counselor dan bartlett said in mexico where he was traveling with mr bush internal justice department documents turned over to congress yesterday show the ouster of the eight u s attorneys resulted from a white house initiative to fire all top prosecutors across the u s the documents appear to contradict explanations of the prosecutors dismissals justice department officials told members of congress for instance that the appointment of tim griffin a former assistant to karl rove as interim u s attorney in little rock ark wasnt an attempt to circumvent senate confirmation his office said in a letter to sen charles schumer d n y that the department "was not aware of karl rove playing any role in the decision to appoint mr griffin " in a recent interview with the wall street journal mr gonzales said of the ousters "i made recommendations to the president" that the changes be made emails from mr sampson detail plans to go through the motions of listening to congressional opinions on mr griffins appointment "if they ultimately say no never and the longer we can forestall that the better then we can tell them well look for other candidates and otherwise run out the clock " mr sampson wrote in a mid december email in a discussion of whether mr griffin should be referred to as "interim" u s attorney mr sampson adds that the department would use mr griffins appointment as a "test drive" of the attorney generals authority under new portions of the patriot act to make u s attorney appointments for unlimited periods of time without senate approval "there is some risk well lose the authority but if we dont ever exercise it then whats the point of having it " mr sampson said adding that it was important to mr rove and harriet miers who succeeded mr gonzales as white house counsel and was briefly a supreme court nominee that mr griffin be named u s attorney in many ways mr gonzaless elevation to the position brought the relationship between the white house and attorney general back to a time when presidents had close relationships with the person running the justice department president john f kennedy appointed his younger brother robert kennedy as attorney general a move that later helped to prompt the anti nepotism act of but some attorneys general have transcended their closeness to their patron with a definitive record edwin meese iii a political confidant of ronald reagan nonetheless helped to cement the conservative counterrevolution in the federal judiciary jess bravin contributed to this article
