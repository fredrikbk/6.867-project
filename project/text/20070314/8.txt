abbott escalates thai patent rift firm pulls plans to offer new drugs in spat with regime a decision by abbott laboratories not to launch any new medicines in thailand raises the stakes in a growing battle over patents between multinational drug companies and the countrys military installed government the unusual tactic also puts abbott in the awkward position of refusing to sell drugs for sick people in thailand in order to protest the actions of the countrys government the drug maker said it has withdrawn its drug applications from the government review process after the government revoked the companys patent for its blockbuster aids medication abbott has no plans to stop selling drugs that are on the market the thai government which took power following a military coup last year said in january that it would suspend patent protections for two drugs in order to make them more widely available to patients who need them these were the aids treatment kaletra made by abbott based in abbott park ill and plavix a blood thinning drug originally developed by sanofi aventis sa of france and co marketed in several countries by new york based bristol myers squibb co in certain situations including national emergencies world trade organization rules allow a government to unilaterally make or sell patented drugs without the permission of the drug companies however pharmaceutical companies have criticized thailand for stretching the scope of those rules because the thai government "decided not to support innovation by breaking the patents abbott will not submit applications or register new medicines and will withdraw current applications in thailand until the government changes its position " said jennifer smoter a spokeswoman for abbott abbott has withdrawn its applications for seven medicines including a new formulation of kaletra the aids treatment according to ms smoter abbott notified the thai government a few weeks ago after talks between the two sides broke down a person familiar with the matter said abbott risks drawing criticism for a decision that may keep lifesaving drugs from patients who need them "its not good for anyone even the american company because they will lose the market " said thawat suntrajarn director general of the ministry of healths department of disease control who said he was unaware of abbotts decision dr thawat said the thai government would continue to seek generics makers able to produce the equivalent of kaletra "im actually lost for words if they really are going to do this " said paul cawthorne the head of the thailand operation of doctors without borders which has campaigned for access to cheaper medicines "for me its just evil its appalling if they really are going to do this it reflects so badly on the multinational companies " mr cawthorne said that in recent months abbott assured him the new formulation of kaletra would be made available in thailand by this summer older aids drugs are often left ineffective as the virus that causes the disease evolves abbott says it wont pull the older version of kaletra from the thai market it adds that both versions of the drug are equally effective the prime difference is that the new version is more convenient to take abbott sells a yearlong supply of kaletra to thai patients for &# less than half the &# that the drug costs patients in the u s according to the company abbott sells the drug at an even deeper discount &# a person a year in certain countries in africa including malawi and kenya while abbott has clashed with governments before its decision to not sell some new drugs in thailand is unusual in july the u s company reached an agreement with brazil that lowered the price of kaletra while preserving the companys patent on the drug pharmaceutical executives say the thai governments decision which they say effectively steals the drugs from the companies that own them has left the industry with little choice "what the government is doing is very shortsighted " said teera chakajnarodom president of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers association an industry group in bangkok "the patients will need newer generations of antivirals" for treating aids but wont have access to them he said "this is serious for the health care of thailand in the future " dr teera said he was told yesterday by abbott of its decision to withdraw its applications it is unclear whether other big pharmaceutical companies doing business in thailand will follow abbotts lead "they are all looking at" the situation said robert broadfoot managing director of political and economic risk consultancy ltd based in hong kong while none of the companies like what is going on "they all want to do business in thailand but its got to be on what they consider acceptable terms " he said mr broadfoot said he doesnt have any pharmaceutical companies as clients but speaks with executives in the industry jean marc podvin a spokesman for sanofi aventis in paris said it was "too soon to tell" whether sanofi would follow abbotts lead adding that sanofi is "evaluating the options "
