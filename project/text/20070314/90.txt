politics &amp economics beijing clears intel chip plant marking a potential milestone and don clark in san francisco chinas government said it approved plans by intel corp to build a &# billion semiconductor factory in the country a potential milestone in chinas efforts to attract high technology investment intel hasnt confirmed or denied it is planning the facility but such a plant if built could mark a substantial advance over chinas current semiconductor manufacturing capability as a result the issue could prompt close scrutiny under u s export laws and provoke criticism from opponents of sending technology or manufacturing to china in a brief statement on its web site the national development and reform commission chinas top economic planning agency indicated intel had won approval to build a plant for fabricating semiconductor wafers the fundamental step in creating chips in dalian a northeastern port city the statement was the first formal confirmation from the government that intel is considering building such a plant after months of rumors about such a move intel has said it is interested in building a fabrication plant in china but it remains unclear if the company is committed to the idea or whether the commissions statement merely reflected negotiations with the company chuck mulloy a spokesman at intels headquarters in santa clara calif declined to comment on the chinese governments statement "weve said for some time we would be interested in future investments in china but we have nothing more to say about that at this time " he said the dalian plant would mark a major departure for intel likely aimed at building closer ties to computer makers that use its microprocessor chips china is the worlds second biggest market for personal computers after the u s by unit sales and the place where many pcs are manufactured for markets outside china intel the worlds largest chip maker by revenue already has assembly and test facilities in china and other developing countries such as vietnam but wafer fabrication plants known as "fabs" in the industry are in a different league they require several billion dollars to build and costly equipment that relies on highly trained technicians to run the chip making equipment as a result fabs arent usually located in countries based on low labor costs intel which operates fabs in the u s ireland and israel has yet to build one in a developing country such factories are frequently the focus of stiff competition between governments which offer tax breaks or other incentives to court chip makers one intel fab being constructed in israel trumpeted by former prime minister ariel sharon five months before intel confirmed the project is slated to receive as much as &# million in grants from the israeli government an intel fab would be a triumph for china in a decades long campaign to develop a semiconductor industry the government hopes that foreign investment will promote the development of domestic chip companies enabling china to eventually wean itself from expensive imported technology the country already boasts some fabs built both by home grown and foreign companies but they fall far short of intels capability to shrink the size of transistors on each chip which boosts chips calculating speed and data storage capacity some u s chip makers have been reluctant to bring their most advanced manufacturing technology to china fearing that they would help create new competitors in sales of sophisticated chips so industry watchers are eager to learn the level of technology that intel might bring to china the government statement indicated the plant would make chips with circuitry measured at nanometers or billionths of a meter that is one technology generation behind the nanometer chips that intel now sells and half the size of circuitry in the nanometer chips intel promises to deliver in the second half of this year a person familiar with the situation suggested that intel isnt necessarily targeting nanometers rather he said the company plans to introduce manufacturing technology that will be two generations behind the current state of the art when a plant in china begins operating which would likely be in three or four years in theory intel could use the output of such a plant for low cost computers to be sold in china and other developing countries but using outdated technology would be a major shift in strategy for intel said risto puhakka an analyst at vlsi research in san jose calif "i cant believe they would build anything but a state of the art factory " added mark edelstone an analyst at morgan stanley even at nanometers intel could run into problems with u s government controls on exports of chip equipment to china rules aimed at preventing the sale of technology that could have military as well as civilian uses intel could also face political opposition in the u s amid concerns that too much manufacturing is shifting to china the dalian plant "could bring a backlash in the u s " said allen pu a semiconductor industry analyst with sinopac securities in taipei sue feng and terence poon in beijing and chiu piling in taipei
