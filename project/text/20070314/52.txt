fiscally fit a child left behind terri and her husband gerry are at odds over whether gerald should repeat a grade online edition my husband gerry and i are at odds over a decision that could have a major impact on our son geralds future should he repeat the second grade by repeating second grade gerald may greatly improve his grades which if it keeps up will affect his ability to get into a good college potentially leading one day to a higher paying job by going on to third grade gerald will keep pace with his friends and avoid the social stigma and self doubt of having been left back and a college education isnt always the key to financial security and a happy life the first position is mine the second is gerrys and thats where we butt heads for much of the school year gerald has had a hard time keeping up with his classmates and weve struggled to keep him from sensing our frustration even twice a week tutoring hasnt been much help recently we met with his teacher guidance counselor principal special education teacher and an educational assessment specialist to discuss his progress and the consensus was that gerald is having trouble meeting his second grade benchmarks because he hasnt mastered first grade schoolwork they said he wasnt in danger of being left back right now but that gerry and i should consider having him repeat second grade i shouldnt have been surprised three years ago at my final parent teacher conference with geralds kindergarten teacher she expressed her concern about gerald being mature enough to handle the demands of first grade work "boys mature at different stages and gerald is still struggling to sit still and focus " she said discussing how her own three boys had matured at different paces she said she thought another year of kindergarten would allow gerald to mature and revisit the basics making him much better prepared to move on to first grade i was distressed and she sensed it "if he were mine " she said softly touching my hand "id give him another year" in kindergarten we had gerald tested at the end of kindergarten worried that he might have a learning disability but his pediatrician said all our son had was a good case of ants in the pants she agreed with his teacher that his maturity level was likely to blame for his school performance "its why most children born late in the year dont start school with their peers " she said "when theyre that young even a few months can make a huge difference " i asked whether holding him back was absolutely necessary and she said that was up to us "at his age hell get over it quickly " she said "the question is will you " good question the idea of gerald staying behind while his friends moved on tore us apart not because we felt like failures but because we feared what the taunts and teasing of his classmates would do to him some of geralds kindergarten friends already gloated over passing tests that he failed so we could only imagine what hed hear once they learned hed be left back we were even more concerned that watching his friends move on while he repeated kindergarten would make him feel inferior to them or worse that he was stupid and selfishly we considered the cost geralds private kindergarten cost more than &# a year so moving him to public school would slash our childcare costs in half because hed only need a few hours in the schools aftercare program then gerry and i agreed it would be best to send him on to first grade if he needed extra help we said wed hire a tutor gerald did struggle early in the school year and at first i worried wed made the wrong decision but after a few months his grades improved a bit and his teacher said shed seen real progress still his class clown antics were often disruptive and we spent much of the year trying different behavior modification techniques a sticker for good behavior a special treat for a week of stickers etc that didnt help much when gerald started second grade and the homework assignments started rolling in i got a sinking feeling in my stomach i knew how gerald had struggled with much more basic work in first grade and feared he wasnt ready for more complex words and equations and i was right his teacher contacted us soon after the start of the school year to discuss the problems he was having in class with behavior and schoolwork gerald was tested early in the school year and his reading and math skills were at a level of first grade third month three months later he was tested again and hed improved to first grade eighth month but by then he was in the fifth month of second grade recently we were devastated to learn hes profoundly deaf in his right ear which likely has hurt his development this week gerald and his classmates will undergo mandatory statewide testing and were not looking forward to the results after watching me agonize over geralds grades my mother delicately broached the subject of leaving him back she has plenty of experience with the decision my younger brother joe and sister melissa both struggled in school my mom pushed my brother on for the same reasons we had for sending gerald onto first grade she worried leaving him back would hurt his self confidence and self esteem but she later realized pushing him on had the same result the constant struggle to comprehend schoolwork his friends easily mastered made him feel like a failure by the time joe made it to eighth grade hed given up on high school let alone college since then hes worked various back breaking jobs some well paying with benefits others less so melissa was delayed by her health two heart operations left her far behind her classmates my mother had no qualms about holding her back in second grade when her teacher recommended it initially it was hard for melissa to accept and some of her former classmates wasted no time in making fun of her but eventually she accepted her fate and her classmates found other victims to taunt melissa says she only felt the sting of being left back at her friends graduation parties her grades improved and she enjoyed school and later went on to graduate from a post secondary technical school since graduation melissa has held a string of well paying office jobs with excellent benefits studies like this one from the bureau of labor statistics show that college educated workers make much more than high school graduates and are much less likely to be unemployed information technology specialists who watched their jobs get outsourced overseas can tell you a degree doesnt guarantee a consistent high paying job but it certainly doesnt hurt your chances with statistics and my own familys experiences as evidence i thought gerry would be convinced that gerald should repeat second grade but he wasnt "children will make fun of him and hell become an outcast among his friends " he said gerry admits that as a child he took part in taunting two former friends whod been left back and believes neither adjusted well to their younger classmates he fears geralds just not emotionally tough enough to handle the experience "if he needs more tutoring well pay for more tutoring but im against leaving him back " he says gerrys also not nearly as worried as i am about the possibility that gerald wont go to college "i can get him a good paying job in my union " he says referring to a discussion we had last year noting that these days a trade school education can be just as valuable as a college education where once gerry said he would never urge gerald to skip college and take a job in his labor union the way his own father did with gerry hes now having second thoughts watching gerald struggle with his schoolwork as gerry did when he was a child has him second guessing his strong desire for our son to get a college education "college isnt the right path for everybody terri " he said gently "it wasnt for me " by entering a labor union right out of high school gerry was soon collecting a salary on par with that of a college graduate his retirement and health benefits far outpace those of most office jobs these days and his strong labor union gives him uncommon job security gerry was able to buy his first home at and today his finances are more secure than some college graduates we know i countered that there are no guarantees gerrys union will be as strong a decade from now or that jobs like his will be as plentiful gerrys father easily got gerry a job in the union in the late s when he graduated from high school but can gerry guarantee the same for gerald when he graduates high school gerrys convinced he can and even went so far as question whether we should continue contributing &# a month to geralds college savings account at that point i exploded "no i will not give up on him " so where do we stand at an impasse were waiting for the results of geralds standardized testing which may end up making the decision for us if he doesnt hit all the required benchmarks if geralds educators agree hes able to progress to third grade ill lobby gerry to change his mind and petition his school to allow gerald to repeat the grade anyway because i feel our sons future is at stake for now ive asked his principal to put us in touch with parents of children who repeated the second grade so we can get an idea of what gerald may experience id also love to hear from any parents and educators whove had similar experiences with children or who repeated a grade themselves these days many parents start their kids in kindergarten a year later to give the children an edge over classmates hoping it will one day lead to better colleges and eventually better paying jobs but is this a good idea when is it appropriate to hold students back a year join me and your fellow readers in a discussion or write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com last weeks column on whether or not it was worth it for gerry to work overtime drew an interesting mix of comments in my forum feel free to join in the continuing discussion readers who emailed me agreed theyd prefer compensatory time over overtime pay if given the option read on for a sample of their letters which have been edited when i was paid hourly i learned to put far greater value on hour for hour comp time than overtime pay the take home pay rate for overtime after taxes resulted in my time being paid out at less than my standard take home pay the pay balanced out a bit when tax returns were filed but the difference wasnt enough to change my mind joe marsh i am a registered nurse who works in a hospital emergency department i believe in home life over working overtime if i do work overtime i want the highest rate of pay in the health care industry medical personnel are expected to work overtime leading to massive burnout and worker shortages luckily i live in a state that has just passed anti mandatory overtime legislation and i now take full advantage of it funny thing is where before i thought i was indispensable now my place of employment is actively seeking new employees to help cover overtime hours that are no longer being covered this is leading to safer care of patients by employing more individuals and not exhausting the current ones jerry l benson when my children were younger i never turned down overtime there was plenty offered and it seemed like easy money i would leave my house at a m and return about p m i started after my wife was laid off and we were comfortable with her staying home with our children versus a nanny or day care but after my overtime dried up and i lost of my income overnight i went on to work in a restaurant for diaper money three years ago i renewed my second job as a softball umpire id get home from my first job at p m say "hi" to my family and return from my second job at p m last year i took a break and realized all the time i missed with my family wasnt worth the extra money james m barry my wife and i are retired and our health leaves a great deal to be desired its nice to have the money but the time spent working overtime was lost for other things when we both had good health and that cant ever be replaced if we had it to do over again id choose a movie or quiet afternoon with my wife over overtime and im sure she feels the same money does not make people happy people make people happy arthur cash im a certified financial planner and i like how your column on overtime focused on the retirement component its important to look at just how much that extra &# in lost retirement savings means in future income using as a guideline that &# translates to &# per year &# per month or &# per week thats hardly enough to justify time away from family and your added responsibilities on the weekends depending on the annuity payout options those figures may not be accurate but its a good planning principle for most defined contribution retirement plans its not often that i advocate passing on retirement savings opportunities so its important for you and your readers to evaluate that extra &# per month against what their existing savings may provide if youve already got a decent nest egg and the time horizon to retirement is relatively short theres probably little added benefit to the overtime if someone is behind in their retirement savings then the additional income benefit may be a necessity it really depends on where people are starting from bill dion write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com
