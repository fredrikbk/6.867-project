the thai flu if you care about property rights or access to new medicine for the worlds poor keep your eye on the current fight over thailands attempt to confiscate drug patents the brawl is getting messier by the day in the latest news the journal reports that abbott laboratories has decided not to market any new medicines in thailand abbott will continue to sell drugs currently on sale in the country but it has withdrawn its applications for other drugs under government review this is a big decision for any company because it means forfeiting a large market and risking some negative publicity but it is also an entirely rational business decision after thailands military government decided to revoke abbotts patent for its new blockbuster aids drug in january thailands ministry of public health announced it would issue "compulsory licenses" for medications produced by abbott and sanofi aventis meaning that thailand will eventually produce generic copies of these drugs this followed a similar move against merck in november thai patients will be the losers at least in the short term though that is entirely the fault of the thai government in the long run abbotts withdrawal may have a salutary impact if it demonstrates to thai officials and other governments that they will pay a price for stealing intellectual property drug patents are a globally recognized way to guarantee a return on investment in producing new therapies and there will be no incentive to innovate if governments can revoke patents with impunity meanwhile the u s government is getting into the mix albeit a tad late hhs secretary michael leavitt has finally summoned the energy to lodge a formal protest with bangkok over remarks by one of its officials that thailand will arrest foreign nationals in the event of an influenza outbreak at a january meeting of the executive board of the world health organization thai representative dr suwit wibulpolprasert proposed holding western tourists hostage until bangkok received flu vaccines in a march letter mr leavitt said dr suwits comments "appear to contravene the spirit and provisions of the revised international health regulations" for how countries cooperate to curb the global spread of disease hostage taking is not among the preferred medical treatments for the flu would be kidnapper dr suwit was also an important voice advocating seizure of the drug patents and incredibly he and thailands minister for public health dr mongkol na songkhla have found supporters in high places in international health organizations peter piot head of the united nations joint program on hiv aids wrote in a december letter to the minister that bangkoks decision to retract mercks hiv aids drug patent was "a good example" of the countrys commitment to "provide access" to antiretrovirals and lower the cost of the drugs after an initial burst of common sense even the who is now supporting bangkoks theft director general margaret chan whom these pages praised in january for criticizing thailands ip abuse retracted her statement in a conciliatory letter to the thai government shortly thereafter "i deeply regret that my comments may have caused embarrassment to the government of thailand " she wrote "they should not be taken as a criticism of the decision of the royal thai government to issue compulsory licenses which is entirely the prerogative of the government " in seizing the patents thailand is taking advantage of vague language in a world trade organization agreement on intellectual property rights permitting compulsory licensing in a time of "national emergency" or for "public non commercial use " theres no such emergency in this case and in any case thailand hasnt bothered to lift the taxes levied on drug imports or address the often double digit markups on drugs as they wend their way through the domestic delivery system its even possible that bangkok is considering seizing the patents producing drugs at home and turning its state owned pharmaceutical monopoly into a regional drug store the whos executive board next meets in may unless dr chan and other officials start publicly supporting intellectual property rights theres a good chance thailands actions will be replicated elsewhere thats bad news for pharmaceutical companies and for everyone who cares about drug innovation and public health see related letter "letters to the editor the old socialist grab" wsj march see related letter "letters to the editor wto rules on patents compulsory licensing" wsj march
