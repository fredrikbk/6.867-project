northrops role in rocket bid diminishes northrop grumman corp s hopes for a prominent part in returning u s astronauts to the moon has suffered a second setback with the company now expected to play only a minor role in bidding for a government rocket contract according to people familiar with the matter last august a northrop led team that included boeing co lost a competition for a new generation of manned spacecraft valued at more than &# billion since then relations between units of the two companies became strained and according to these officials northrop will be relegated to a secondary role at best when a revamped boeing led team bids next month for the national aeronautics and space administrations latest rocket business northrops diminished role comes despite a broad partnership with boeing covering nasas manned space exploration efforts that the two companies previously suggested amounted to a marriage of equals the teaming arrangement was to be northrops way into the resurgence of manned space programs boeing already helped build the international space station is part of a joint venture operating the space shuttle and is bidding on parts of nasas new rocket the new rocket is expected to be nasas core launcher for manned spaced exploration for at least years potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars down the road the latest rocket contract is one of nasas highest acquisition priorities for it is particularly significant for northrop because the agency doesnt anticipate issuing any more comparable big ticket exploration contracts related to manned projects for perhaps as long as a decade northrop spokesman randy belote said the company long recognized that the rocket contract "isnt one in which we would have a significant role that doesnt diminish our interest in space programs " boeing which plans to announce its subcontractor team this month declined to comment the competition is to build the middle section of the so called ares i rocket expected to evolve into nasas next generation workhorse booster to launch an exploration vehicle proposals are slated to be submitted in coming weeks ares rockets are intended to help transport astronauts to the international space station and eventually to the moon and beyond a team led by alliant techsystems inc edina minn is expected to compete with the boeing led team and is viewed by many inside nasa and the industry as the favorite partly because alliant previously was selected as the prime contractor and integrator for the rockets first stage northrops upset loss of the separate spacecraft contract last year means that lockheed martin corp is leading the industry team developing and building nasas manned space vehicles right after the loss northrop indicated it would compete aggressively for future nasa rocket contracts and other work spokesmen said northrop was "well positioned" to use its expertise planned to leverage its "long term teaming arrangement" with boeing and was "in this for the long haul " tensions in the space exploration field arent expected to impact boeings relationship with northrop across a range of military programs the two companies work closely on missile defense technologies and electronic warfare and surveillance aircraft likewise northrop has a separate space unit which is aggressively pursuing unmanned spacecraft and cutting edge research on lasers
