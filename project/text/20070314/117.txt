uncertainty "over who will ultimately foot the bill " yesterdays foreclosures report general motors announcement of subprime related problems at gmac and pleas for new capital from yet another big industry player accredited home lenders seem to show markets they cant ignore the question of how deep the subprime problems extend though the federal reserve has pooh poohed such concerns some in the mortgage industry think overreaction to a "correction" among subprime lenders is provoking a liquidity crisis even as the shake out possibly strengthens the lenders who remain "you dont know who is swimming naked until the tide goes out " countrywide financials chairman and chief executive angelo mozilo said on cnbc as businessweek reports for the rest of the investing world already tottering on what some investors see as the crest of an era when risks were overly ignored that may be beside the point the dows fall yesterday was the second largest in four years erasing all gains made since the point plunge at the end of february "were kind of back to panic mode " stephen stanley chief economist for rbs greenwich capital tells the wall street journal "it definitely reflects concerns about the mortgage area and the possibility that it would feed more broadly into the financial system as well as the economy " the wider such panic is felt the more it builds pressure in washington for the government to step in and do something and politicians have begun to urge some kind of bail out for stretched homeowners the journal says the latest subprime problems coincide with the latest push by corporate america and allies in washington to roll back some of the constraints imposed after the enron and worldcom debacles timing that may undermine such efforts beltway fingers are already being

nuclear reflects what the trade publication calls "mtv networks vulnerable position as it loses young viewers to the internet " and it "raises major questions about the digital millennium copyright act the law that governs online piracy " the ramifications of how those questions are answered will be widely felt since the spat with viacom began youtube has said the dmca protected it from liability because when copyright holders ask youtube drops their clips the dmca contained important so called safe harbor clauses "provisions designed to protect access providers search engines web hosting services and others from liability for copyright claims if they met several conditions " the wall street journal explains "but now some legal experts say there is little consensus or precedent on how that protection applies to video sharing sites like youtube " among the most important issues will be how much youtube knew about clips on its site that potentially violated copyrights and whether it profitted from them the same safe harbor issue "is at the core of several other pending copyright cases " the journal adds including a suit by vivendis universal music groups suit against
