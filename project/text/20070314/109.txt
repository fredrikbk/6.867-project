borrowers with poor or sketchy credit histories "if left unaddressed the ripple effect on our communities and cities will be enormous " said sen chris dodd a connecticut democrat in a speech at a

in arrears rose to the highest level since during the quarter it said foreclosures were initiated on a seasonally adjusted of all loans the highest rate since the trade group started reporting the numbers years ago many in the mortgage market had expected the rise in arrears which was already apparent in lenders results and saw relatively low delinquency rates among borrowers with better credit as a positive but some noted that problems among certain types of "prime" borrowers specifically those who had taken out loans with adjustable interest rates were an ominous sign the data "show that mortgage credit quality problems go well beyond the subprime sector " wrote jan hatzius chief u s economist at goldman sachs in new york in a research note adding to those worries the commerce department offered some evidence that debt laden consumers may be curbing their spending it reported that retail sales rose a meager in february from january less than economists had expected

recession though rising remains too small treasury secretary henry paulson in an interview with the wall street journal echoed that relatively upbeat assessment he acknowledged that the wave of foreclosures has been "distressing" to "individual mortgage holders " but said that "the distress of the subprime mortgage market is something that should have been anticipated given the housing correction " mr paulson said "from the standpoint of the overall economy its largely contained " mr paulsons comments came as goldman sachs group inc his former employer reported record earnings and said it is pushing deeper into the subprime mortgage business ramping up its own operations and pondering the purchase of a troubled lender it didnt specify a potential target angelo mozilo chief executive of mortgage lender countrywide financial corp also sought to allay investors fears saying his company could find itself with less competition and more new customers after the subprime mortgage meltdown plays out in an interview with cnbc yesterday mr mozilo said countrywide has just of its loan origination coming from subprime mortgages and only about of its assets in the subprime area he said that after the shakeout in the subprime market is over countrywides mortgage business will likely find itself free of "all the irrational competitors " and that "looks very positive for us " still the subprime meltdown has begun to reverberate in washington where democrats in control of congress and those running for president have begun to seize on the issue exploring new aid to distressed borrowers as well as new regulations on lenders two presidential contenders sens dodd and hillary rodham clinton of new york raised the issue at the national league of cities convention "i share your concern about whats happening in the subprime housing market " mrs clinton the current democratic front runner told the crowd "lets work together to curb predatory lending and abusive practices " mr dodd as chairman of the senate banking committee has already held one hearing on the issue a month ago he hasnt proposed specific legislation yet but says legislation is among the options he is considering in the house a financial services subcommittee plans a series of hearings beginning march on subprime and predatory lending at the first hearing federal regulators along with industry and consumer groups will be asked to discuss recent federal guidance encouraging lenders to be more cautious when issuing loans with "teaser" rates that adjust much higher in a few years the hearings are expected to lead to legislation later this year rep barney frank the financial services chairman has said he wants to restrict the riskiest types of mortgages in that effort two north carolina democrats reps brad miller and mel watt are likely to take the lead reps miller and watt have previously proposed legislation called the prohibit predatory lending act aimed at cracking down on what they regard as abusive practices and strengthening consumer protections without restricting low income borrowers access to credit the legislation is based on a north carolina law that limits a variety of fees and financing methods common to subprime loans and which the two lawmakers say has been successful but even democrats may find themselves divided about how far to go in limiting the loans which as mr dodd noted have "been a wonderful vehicle for making it possible for an awful lot of americans who never could have even thought about owning a home to be able to get into that housing market " mr watt said in an interview yesterday that legislation is "more likely than it was last year " with democrats in the majority additional foreclosures and "more distress" about both predatory and subprime lending "the issues remain the same as they have been how do you set rules for the predatory side that dont impact access to credit on the nonpredatory side " mr watt said adding that democrats are trying to be "methodical" in deciding on an approach to the issue james r hagerty john d stoll greg hitt deborah solomon and conor dougherty contributed to this article
