the daily fix a banner day for pittsburgh as penguins strike arena deal online edition the pittsburgh penguins wont be getting happy feet after all the penguins announced a new deal with state and local officials to build a &# million arena that will keep the team in town and out of kansas city in the pittsburgh post gazette its pinch me time for bob smizik "the avalanche of good fortune that has rained down on the penguins in the past months continues with no end in sight " he writes "it all began in july when the nhl and its players union settled on a collective bargaining agreement that included a salary cap gone were the days when the penguins would have to sell off their high priced stars it only got better much better the next day with a monstrous stroke of good luck that came with winning the draft lottery by obtaining the first pick in the draft the penguins got sidney crosby who soon would become the best player the nhl and who will be for years to come " young mr crosby is on the mind of the pittsburgh tribune reviews joe starkey "its nice to be nice to the nice " he writes "thats a frank burns line from m a s h and it fairly describes the tuesday afternoon news conference announcing the penguins arena deal everybody thanked everybody then thanked everybody again for good measure thank you no thank you too bad nobody thanked the person most responsible for the fact the penguins wont be playing in kansas city next season and are in fact bound to pittsburgh for the next years " mr crosby he writes "made the penguins relevant again crosby brought the fans back to the arena and to their televisions mario lemieux gov ed rendell mayor luke ravenstahl nhl commissioner gary bettman and allegheny county chief executive dan onorato all made it a point to thank those fans yesterday during the news conference at the heinz history center the irate e mail and phone calls were wonderful onorato said but the real statement fans made was packing mellon arena as they did last night when they gave lemieux an ear splitting ovation before the national anthem but would the place be packed if crosby hadnt come along " the place is packed and for all the best reasons the penguins are a team on the rise and it would have been cruel for them to relocate and start winning stanley cups as the quebec nordiques did when they transformed into the colorado avalanche though the post gazette finds room for something of a competing perspective from thomas w butch a lifelong penguins fan who relocated to kansas city seven years ago mr butch runs through his bona fides before writing that "i ultimately concluded that the pens belonged in pittsburgh this was less magnanimous than it was genetic as any pittsburgh expatriate would tell you our sports allegiances are encoded in our dna even the thought of driving eight miles to the sprint center versus flying to see the penguins in action was not sufficient to sway my belief that they belonged perched on the hill atop pittsburgh now that that outcome is secured i would only tell you that kansas city would have been the best possible adoptive home for the pens in fact it is strikingly similar to the burgh it is no more a backward cow town than pittsburgh is a polluted post industrial waste site just change the occasional yinz to an occasional yall substitute kcs world class bbq for pittsburghs world class italian and modify your inbred disdain for philadelphia to a similar rivalry with st louis and you would sometimes swear you are in the same place " on espn com scott burnside calls the deal a win for hockey fans everywhere "they can give thanks that a good hockey town wont lose its team over a squabble that has always been more politics than pucks " he writes "they can give thanks that a team that might have a bushel of stanley cup rings in its future wont be awarded to another city like some raffle prize at the local rink they can give thanks that the league after enduring a number of public relations hits in recent days got this one right " your ncaa mens field of is set niagara beat florida a&amp m in the mens tournament play in game helped by points from clif brown and the rattlers inability to hit free throws in fairness you might clank a few too if youd been in three states in three days the purple eagles reward they get to play seed kansas in chicago on friday yipes still the lawrence journal worlds tom keegan checks in with proud niagara alum calvin murphy living proof of the dangers of taking the little guy lightly mr murphy he writes "was overlooked by nba scouts once upon a time and they lived to regret it he scored or more points six times during his college career it didnt matter that murphy was a second team all american as a sophomore and first team as a junior and senior scouts werent even impressed that murphy scored points against syracuse the only numbers they valued were the ones listed under the height column foot the houston rockets drafted murphy with the first selection of the second round he made the all rookie team in and was elected to the basketball hall of fame in " still the history isnt on niagaras side and thats putting it very very mildly since the tournament expanded to teams in seeds are "its been grass vs a lawnmower david without the slingshot " cracks adam kilgore in the washington post but he adds that "despite the bleak history there is a growing sense that one of them could win this season and if not them then a team like them in a season to come the vs game may be the final vestige of dominance the haves of college basketball can cling to as the have nots storm the castle gates but how much longer can they hold on to it " sylvia mackey met eleanor perfetto in october at a reception for nfl veterans and their families hosted by the baltimore ravens she watched dr perfetto guide her husband ralph wenzel across the floor to where mrs mackey sat with her husband john and she immediately knew mr wenzel had dementia just like mr mackey does "on that evening last october mrs mackey added another n f l wife to her growing network of women who seek her guidance and support as their husbands deteriorate mentally " alan schwarz writes in the new york times "her husband john was a hall of fame tight end for the baltimore colts in the late s and early s and is probably the most notable victim of dementia among former football players mrs mackey said that she regularly communicates with about women like dr perfetto as they learn to handle their husbands dementia which often begins as early as their s i know about in all mrs mackey said and if i know there are probably or out there " mrs mackeys efforts helped spur the creation of the plan an effort made by the nfl and its union to aid former players with dementia thats laudable but as mr schwarz writes the players dont qualify for the leagues disability insurance program thats because neither the league nor the union considers dementia a football related condition despite growing evidence to the contrary stick with mr schwarzs story after the jump for a harrowing look at whats happened to mr mackey and mr wenzel former teammates who cant remember each other found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to us at dailyfix wsj com and well consider your find for inclusion in
