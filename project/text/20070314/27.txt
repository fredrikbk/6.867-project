business world ethanol liberation movement president bush and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva struck a blow last week against the forces of intolerance obscurantism and parochialism we refer to the u s farm lobby not that amalgam of hostile states and islamic crazies who presumably benefit from the u s oil "addiction " it would be feckless to tell ourselves that ethanol is a cure for terrorism or islams difficulties with modernity or the challenges of global interdependence but as churchill observed long ago the best kind of energy security is a diversity of suppliers hence the significance of mr bushs brazilian holiday washington has come to an important crossroads will we double down on the mistakes of the past using subsidies and protectionism to foster the domestic ethanol industry and its confluence of interest groups that ever afterward will insist on maintenance of its subsidies and protection or will we support a free global market in biofuels which would genuinely improve u s energy security far more quickly than many imagine it would also help to cut down to size a new generation of petrodollar dictators administration officials have been generous with assurances to the farm lobby that last weeks brazil agreement is no prelude to repealing americas egregious cent per gallon tariff on most imported ethanol washington simply wants to help brazil export its technology so other nations can become low cost producers of ethanol but the u s isnt looking to welcome all this cheap motor fuel into its own market banish the thought somebody didnt get the memo to president silva who directly drew attention to the u s tariff "they talk a lot about free trade but they like to protect their own products " he said and couldnt have been more right a big question now is where the emerging coalition of renewable energy enthusiasts venture capitalists and security hawks will come down the capitalists as always will be tempted by handouts and mandates to assure the immediate success of their ventures vinod khosla a prominent silicon valley ethanol promoter occasionally talks a good game about free trade in biofuels mostly though he offers silly self interested demands for government favors to protect the ethanol industry from "manipulation" of oil prices by big oil the security hawks meanwhile seem bent on rushing into a devils bargain with the unfortunate wrinkle of surrendering their souls upfront their conspicuous spokesman former cia chief james woolsey has been pitching the most extravagant woo at corn growers "american farmers by making the commitment to grow more corn for ethanol are at the tip of the spear on the war against terrorism " he told the annual meeting of the virginia soybean corn and grain association ethanols boosters clearly grasp the adult facts of our political system namely the disproportionate representation of rural interests in the u s senate by turning energy policy into an adjunct of farm politics they hope to assemble a mighty host of interest groups voting blocs and elected officials to move the country toward greater reliance on biofuels in his talks with farmers mr woolsey makes clear his goal down the road is cheaper ethanol from crops other than corn but satan will insist on his due and were more likely to end up with a high cost subsidized domestic ethanol industry with the motive and political clout to maintain the wall against imports how many of the u s ethanol refineries already in operation depend on tax handouts mandates and import tariffs to keep themselves profitable probably all of them how many of the on the drawing board would be uncompetitive at world prices probably most and many of these are being built with federal or state grants only enlarging the coalition for protectionism the functional truth is the corn lobby wants to participate in opec not challenge it and american trade policy has been a big wet favor to hugo chavez who knows he has much to lose if brazil and other southern hemisphere countries were to become prolific exporters of motor fuel to international markets president bushs heart appears to be in the right place he doesnt keep mentioning switch grass for nothing switch grass is a prime target for fans of cellulosic ethanol derived from agricultural waste and non food plants it would be cheaper to produce than corn ethanol and wouldnt compete with food crops for prime agricultural land his brazilian gambit suggests he understands americas true security lies with a thriving and diverse trade in biofuels based on the combined strength of all the worlds consumers and producers mckinsey estimates brazil alone might need as much &# billion in investment to meet potential export demand for sugarcane based ethanol billions more are being mustered for cellulosic ethanol including the possibility of supercheap chinese ethanol from rice straw but whether entrepreneurs find the necessary capital may depend on whether investors believe the u s market will be open and washington will be supportive of free trade in biofuels thats why the ethanol interests beginning with corn country republicans sen john thune and sen charles grassley in a conference call with reporters last week are gearing up for a fight over mr bushs brazilian ethanol policy mr bush says the tariff isnt an issue but of course it is every step consistent with u s support for a global market in ethanol is a harbinger of tomorrows battle to repeal the tariff and let the domestic ethanol industry defend its place in the market on its real virtues not its ability to pull political strings see related letter "letters to the editor batteries can power us to oil independence" wsj march see related letter "letters to the editor distilling
