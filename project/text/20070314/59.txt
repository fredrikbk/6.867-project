halliburton plays catch up ceos part time stint in middle east is move to cash in on year boom halliburton co s chief executive joins the swelling ranks of westerners hoping more face time in the middle east will help them cash in on the regions investment surge and bustling oil field activity the oil field services companys announcement this weekend that chief executive david j lesar would set up an office in dubai and spend a portion of the year there is a grand gesture intended to pick up business in the region mr lesar follows others who are courting increasingly powerful government and national oil company executives from the middle east and asia the three year surge in oil prices and the regions vast reserves have helped turn dubai a semi autonomous state and part of the united arab emirates into an oil boomtown the move marks the latest effort at corporate flattery amid a surge of investment in the middle east and a rush by oil companies to solidify their presence there

adnoc "everyone is trying to grow their presence in the middle east " said c k poe fratt senior oil fields services analyst at a g edwards the challenge of expanding in the middle east is particularly acute for halliburton because in recent years it has been inextricably linked with the u s government its former chief executive dick cheney became the vice president and its logistics contract for the u s military turned halliburton into a giant defense contractor and effectively an arm of the u s military presence in iraq moreover in it generated about half of its energy services revenue or &#

in any tax benefits to the company because its structure remains about the same analysts say halliburtons work is international by nature and probes into its conduct have been largely focused on its activities outside of the u s one criminal probe that has involved investigators in the u s united kingdom france switzerland nigeria and japan is into whether a halliburton led construction consortium paid bribes to nigerian officials through a british agent the company has said it is cooperating u s probes into halliburtons work for the military have focused on procurement operations in
