property owners feel right at home in china as communists ease ban buyers rush to snap up houses and apartments beijing sun guangxin is moving on up from a cramped government dormitory to a deluxe apartment in the sky or at least the seventh floor decades of communism were supposed to suppress the desire to have a home of ones own but these days owning a house or apartment here is a badge of pride a far cry from the cultural revolution when property owners were persecuted this friday as chinas lawmakers wrap up the annual meeting of the national peoples congress they are expected to pass a landmark property law its expected to put on paper what has already been true in practice china is a land of private property with some of the highest rates of home ownership in the world in before china embarked on housing reform that allowed urbanites to purchase their state owned apartments at cheap prices privately owned homes accounted for less than of urban housing stock since then chinas rates of home ownership are as high as in the cities according to some estimates topping u s homeownership rates of about a fire sale of millions of apartments held by state owned enterprises has transferred an enormous amount of wealth into private hands creating a new class of urban property owners these new homeowners have been willing to band together in law courts and tenant organization to fight for their common interests such as increasing the quality of service provided by property managers many advocated for the passage of the property law on blogs "the development of chinas real estate industry changed chinese peoples way of life and also changed chinas economy " says gu yunchang professor and vice chairman of the china real estate research association and an architect of housing reform the proposed law is intended to bring together and clarify those regulations already on the books governing property ownership it is also designed to help chinas legal system better handle an increasingly freewheeling market economy that is still ruled by the party whose chinese name literally translates as "the common property party " the symbolic value of a law enshrining private property rights in a country that is still nominally communist has sparked a heated debate over chinas identity the property law was expected to be passed last year but it was tabled by the leaders of the communist party after strong opposition critics fear the law abandons chinas communist roots and will further aggravate the already growing income gap between rich and poor it does little for example to help the majority of chinese who are still farmers living on land leased from the state land confiscation has sparked riots across chinas countryside but there are some practical elements of the law that are expected to help further increase the ranks of private property owners one of the key provisions the new law appears to allow leases on land to be extended forever meaning families could potentially pass on property to their children for example in china the state still owns all land and home buyers and business owners are only able to lease it for years or less lease holding is common in countries like the united kingdom where theres a clear legal precedent for how to renew but chinas patchwork laws left unanswered what the future could bring that worried people like yin na and her husband larry liang a young white collar couple who just bought an investment rental property in a huge project being built in beijings commercial district "i paid attention when i read theyll automatically renew the year lease " says ms yin who now feels more reassured thanks to the new law the hunger for a place of ones own has helped ignite chinas real estate market into levels that some worry could overheat in the past two and a half years prices for the sort of mid market mass housing mr sun bought have soared in beijing and in shanghai says anna kalifa head of beijing research at real estate firm jones lang lasalle while there are plenty of speculators and local regulations to curb them around of purchasers are buying for their own use "there have been huge wealth gains people complain about rising housing prices but the flip side is massive wealth creation " says ms kalifa the real estate boom has had a huge impact on the economy city skylines are a forest of cranes and property prices are rising as high as the new towers being built according to euromonitor since the market for home furnishings in china almost tripled to &# billion last year there are plenty of commercial real estate buyers as well including investment banks such as morgan stanley and goldman sachs which have invested millions of dollars into towers in shanghais bustling commercial districts all this was unimaginable less than a decade ago when nearly everyone in the cities lived in state owned housing provided by the government as part of cradle to grave welfare shortly after the communist party took power in all property was nationalized housing was distributed along with work by the early days of economic reform in the s urbanites were living in cramped dilapidated apartment blocks badly maintained by the state owned companies which couldnt afford to upkeep on the few pennies tenants paid for rent then during the economic downturn sparked by the asian financial crisis in the late s then premier zhu rongji sought to turn the untapped housing market into an engine of economic growth similar to the u s and started selling off state owned apartments at a fraction of their market value mr sun a year old who works as a trade development official for the government spent the earliest years of his life living with parents in the poor countryside of chinas northeastern shandong province then they slowly started climbing up the economic and property ladder eventually last year they were able to help their son with the down payment on the modest two bedroom apartment in the eastern suburbs of beijing where old factories are getting torn down and replaced by vast new apartment complexes "owning my own home will give me a sense of belonging " he says at a purchase price of about &# the apartments mortgage takes up a little more than half of his salary though it has already appreciated in value he says standing in the unfinished concrete shell of his apartment mr sun points to a computer generated design of his new apartment on his mp player which also displays photos a light purple living room with a large screen television and light blue and light green for the bedrooms "i want everything modern " he says but for mr sun the most important part of the property law is that it will protect the place he can call home and where he plans to host his friends to watch a soccer tournament on his new big screen tv and in six years when hes years old he wants to move up again "to a place with square meters or maybe two apartments one just for my parents to come visit " he says sue feng and mei fong contributed to this article
