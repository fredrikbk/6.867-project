measured media lose in spending cuts big buyers are turning to new internet venues tracking firm suggests in a sign of how major advertisers are shifting money out of traditional media ad tracking firm tns media intelligence reported that the nations biggest advertisers cut their spending on "measured" media such as tv print and internet display ads by in though u s ad spending grew overall while some of the decline may reflect overall cutbacks in ad spending by big marketers it likely signals that big companies such as procter &amp gamble are reallocating some of their ad budgets to new internet ad venues which arent measured by tns such as paid search advertising social networking and online video not surprisingly the report showed that growth in ad spending on traditional media particularly newspapers and radio continued to slow dramatically while spending on internet display ads is accelerating but it also highlighted a significant slowdown in ad growth among cable channels after several years of robust increases most stunning was the performance of spanish language media television newspapers and magazines showed sharply higher growth rates the latest confirmation that advertisers are recognizing the value of spanish language consumers while most of what tns reported isnt likely to surprise anyone in the ad or media industries the raw numbers are valuable for confirming the broader trends among the most ominous points in the report at least for traditional media outlets were spending figures for auto advertisers long among the biggest ad spenders in the u s driven by big cuts at general motors and daimlerchrysler the domestic auto industry pulled a total of &# billion or out of "measured" media in that was the single biggest reason why overall ad spending by the bigger marketers fell says jon swallen senior vice president of research for tns media intelligence if the auto industry had spent at the same levels as the previous year total ad spending in the u s market would have increased he estimates "this is staggering when you think about it " he says "talk about a pivot point and the seesaw swinging one way or another that is a major impact " gm spokeswoman ryndee carney says the company doesnt confirm ad spending figures but says she thinks that the tns data under report spending in nontraditional and digital media "we dont show that our spending dropped as significantly " she says noting that a larger portion of the car manufacturers budget is directed toward new media instead of more traditional media a chrysler spokesman echoed that thought another big marketer that was reported as cutting spending on measured media was johnson &amp johnson down overall much of the cut occurred in j&amp js national tv budget which accounts for of the companys total ad spending the national tv budget was down or &# million while "measured" web spending rose slightly the tv cutback follows j&amp js decision last year to sit out the "upfront" tv ad sales market where networks sell most of their ad inventory j&amp j said this week it planned to sit out this years upfront as well "as a matter of policy we do not comment on ad spending " a spokesman for j&amp j says also showing lower spending were big media companies time warner which put less marketing support behind its aol online service and news corp these figures dont necessarily reflect the full story for the media companies as much of their ad spending occurs at their movie studios which have aggressively moved into categories of online marketing not measured by tns driven by consolidation and increased competition the telecom industry reported significant growth in ad spending with nearly all the major companies including at&amp t verizon comcast deutsche telekom which owns t mobile and vonage reporting double digit growth rates ad spending in the telecom category grew in to &# billion as for categories of media tns estimated radio to be virtually flat up with local radio and network radio both down while national spot radio gained while newspapers were down and magazines up particularly startling were the television numbers which confirmed that cable advertising is now growing almost as slowly as network tv advertising after rising by double digit percentages in each of the past few years spending on cable channels was up only to &# billion advertising on network television increased in after dropping the previous year the cable slowdown was largely due to a drop in ad revenue among "general interest" cable networks which tns says includes tbs and tnt both owned by time warner and nbc universals usa these channels have less specific niches than many other cable channels which can make it hard to attract viewers and advertisers niche networks focusing on topics such as sports news or cooking did better cables overall slowdown also reflects a shift of marketers to newer media media buyers say advertisers looking for niche or high profile audiences such as young men "were the first to migrate to cable and now those advertisers are moving from cable and broadcast to the internet " says john spiropoulos vice president group research director at publicis groupes mediavest "you can take some money from cable and get a similar reach from the internet " the slowdown had a big effect on cable network giants such as viacoms mtv networks which has been laying off staff lately to cut costs in contrast spanish language media enjoyed a banner year tns estimated that spending on spanish language tv was up to &# billion because of political advertising and the world cup tnss report also is likely to confirm some viewers suspicions about the amount of product placement particularly in reality shows such as foxs "american idol" and nbcs "the biggest loser " tns estimated that in an hour of a reality show of the time would be taken up either by commercials or by program scenes that included appearances by different brands judges on "american idol " for instance drink from cups marked prominently with the name of show sponsor coke suzanne vranica contributed to this article ad notes court tv seeks new
