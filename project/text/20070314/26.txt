chip makers face phone trouble the cellphone market is increasingly relying on a single semiconductor architecture which may spell trouble for chip makers supplying more sophisticated chips these makers include rf micro devices inc stmicroelectronics nv and skyworks solutions inc however the news is good for texas instruments inc a leader in the single chip movement single chip phones offer fewer features but have risen in popularity especially in emerging markets where prices matter more and sales are brisk projections suggest that such phones could represent of total handset shipments by the end of "its where the industry is moving at a noticeable pace " said cody acree a semiconductor analyst at stifel nicolaus "its not something thats off in the future " the move to a single chip architecture is a natural progression for the semiconductor market and follows a similar track in the personal computer industry where companies like intel corp are developing chips with built in graphics capabilities "certainly people want fancy phones but the bread and butter is at the low end " said roger kay president and founder of market research firm endpoint technologies associates "integration is always a threat to those that make discrete parts " while the phones are considered single chip they dont actually eliminate all other semiconductors the main single chip consolidates many of the processes but separate chips are still needed for some functions such as power amplifying switches and filters thinkequity partners analyst michael burton said that if of handset shipments contain a single chip architecture by the end of as he expects the gains wont be relegated only to low end and ultra low end phones "one of the biggest topics being discussed in the wireless sector today is the rise of integrated radio frequency analog and baseband system on chip solutions in handsets " mr burton said in a recent research report "texas instruments locosto solution has gained meaningful traction at tier and tier original equipment manufacturers " said mr burton referring to that companys single chip product "and infineons design win at nokia is further proof that soc architectures will likely gain a significant share of the handset market " dallas based texas instruments agrees that a single chip architecture wont be only for cheap handsets alain mutricy vice president and general manager of cellular systems at texas instruments said it also will find its way into midrange cellphones largely in emerging markets where initial cellphone purchases will spawn replacement cycles today there are billion cellphone subscribers with that number expected to reach four billion in noted mr mutricy michael markowitz a spokesman at stmicroelectronics a maker of discrete components for cellphones said that by the time midrange cellphones start incorporating a single chip architecture the company should have a product available he said the trend toward a single chip has a "minimal impact" since most of the phones using the single chip are in areas of the market that his company doesnt go after brian daly vice president of marketing at skyworks said that for the "foreseeable future" a single chip architecture will be needed only in the low end "voice centric" cellphone market he said consumers appetite for phones that include things like mp players cameras and videorecording will drive the need for radio frequency chips despite the expectations of growing demand for a single chip architecture analysts noted there will always be a market for cellphones with multiple chips because of consumers love for high end cellphones that do much more than make calls
