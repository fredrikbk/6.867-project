a principle embodied in the great writ of habeas corpus we take exception to debra burlingames commentary criticizing our representation of kuwaiti detainees at guantanamo "gitmos guerrilla lawyers " editorial page march we undertook this representation which ended last summer because an important principle was at stake the right of any individual detained within the jurisdiction and control of the u s government to have a fair hearing before a neutral judge to decide whether they should continue to be held indefinitely or should be charged tried and if convicted punished this right is embodied in the centuries old "great writ" of habeas corpus and protected by the u s constitution we realized of course that such a principled undertaking might not be popular but it is an established tradition of the legal profession to ensure that unpopular causes are represented where fundamental rights are at issue ultimately the supreme court in the rasul case confirmed our position that the guantanamo detainees have the right to habeas corpus we also participated in the debate in congress and the media about the principles implicated in proposals to terminate habeas rights for detainees however we did not hire the public relations firm ms burlingame criticizes nor did we lobby on behalf of the policies of kuwait with regard to the transfer of naser nijer al mutairi from guantanamo to kuwait the u s government unilaterally decided to do that for reasons it never disclosed to us or the public finally our lawyers did not have special access to guantanamo in none of the lawyers representing detainees were permitted to visit until late when the federal district court ruled the detainees had a right of access to counsel and security measures designed by the military authorities were put in place we are as proud of our role in the important legal debate on these issues as we are of our successful pro bono representation of the families of victims of on whose behalf we obtained &# million in awards from the victim compensation fund indeed in recent months we undertook a new representation on a pro bono basis with more than a dozen other law firms in seeking the supreme courts reaffirmation of its ruling in rasul entitling guantanamo detainees to the right of habeas corpus certainly we did not agree to represent the detainees on these issues out of sympathy with terrorists or enemy combatants we strongly support our governments efforts to apprehend and punish those responsible but in the collective efforts to fight terrorism we should not lose sight of the fundamental human rights on which our country was founded rohan s weerasinghe new york the writer is the senior partner of shearman &amp sterling llp i am quoted by ms burlingame as stating "the litigation is brutal you cant run an interrogation with attorneys " this heavily edited version of my quote is often cited in speeches and articles that attempt to stir up antipathy toward the attorneys who have taken on the cases of the guantanamo detainees their aim is to suggest that we are seeking to keep the government from doing its job the truth is that we are seeking to keep the government from breaking the law the repeated selective use of ellipses particularly the omission of the word "torture " fails to convey the true meaning of my words the full quote which appeared in an article by onnesha roychoudhuri in a march piece for mother jones reads "the litigation is brutal for them its huge we have over one hundred lawyers now from big and small firms working to represent these detainees every time an attorney goes down there it makes it that much harder to do what theyre doing you cant run an interrogation and torture camp with attorneys what are they going to do now that were getting court orders to get more lawyers down there lawyers are down there to interview their clients and statements that are coming out on a weekly basis referring to sexual abuse religious abuse the use of dogs " consistent detailed accounts from current and former detainees as well as memos from the fbi and accounts from a former military interrogator confirm that severe physical and mental abuse that is "tantamount to torture " in the words of the international red cross occurred at guantanamo in the days when the government thought it had created a black hole safe from the scrutiny of the courts and lawyers while other forms of abuse continue at the base ever since lawyers have been present there have been no more documented cases of dogs being used to terrorize detainees of female interrogators smearing fake menstrual blood on detainees of men being stripped and forced to put on womens underwear and of days and weeks of painful stress positions and sleep deprivation to the larger point of ms burlingames article cully stimson former deputy assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs similarly criticized the lawyers who are representing guantanamo clients mr stimson resigned over his remarks rather than attack the lawyers their stepping forward in these cases should be acknowledged as a proud chapter in american legal history michael
