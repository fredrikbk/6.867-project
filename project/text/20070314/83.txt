on demand may be path for qwest as qwest communications international inc chief executive dick notebaert weighs the companys future direction he may be betting that the tivo inc generation of on demand viewers will come to dominate television consumers with fewer consumers watching broadcast television when shows are actually on the air the denver based telephone company may forgo spending billions to build a broadcast tv service a gamble that larger peers verizon communications inc and at&amp t inc are undertaking instead it could opt for an on demand platform that could take hold as consumer viewing habits shift in a when i want it direction "i dont need channels " mr notebaert said in an interview "i dont even need i only need the programs i watch on occasion " the model of delivering television and movie programming directly through the internet has its advantages by avoiding broadcast tv qwest would circumvent the need to get permission from cities where demands have ranged from fees to more unusual requests such as direct fiber connections to public swimming pools the company however would still have to sign deals with television and movie studios which could prove difficult because many of them have taken to posting their content on the web rory altman a director at consulting firm altman vilandrie &amp co said the cost for such a project would be significantly less than the investment that verizon and at&amp t are committing qwest would continue to rely on its existing partnership with directv group inc for live tv the telephone companies face increasing pressure from the cable industry which has invaded the bells traditional business with a cheaper internet phone service verizon and at&amp t which like qwest were formed from remnants of the old bell telephone system began to upgrade their networks in recent years but qwest wasnt in a financial position to make such an investment verizon is spending &# billion to fully connect many of its homes directly to the network via fiber the higher connection speed will enable fios a higher speed internet service and television service similar to the cable model at&amp t meanwhile is spending &# billion to upgrade parts of its network with fiber lines and install software and equipment which enables a live internet tv offering called u verse qwest which has seen its financial fortunes rebound is watching the at&amp t deployment closely and may end up using the same technology for now the companys satellite partnership is what keeps it competitive with cables "triple play" bundle of internet phone and television services the company faces the stiffest competition in crowded markets such as phoenix and omaha neb where privately held cox communications inc operates and denver minneapolis and seattle where comcast corp has a presence whether qwest goes the at&amp t path or the on demand route depends on when total consumer viewing habits will change toward time shifting or grabbing live programming and watching it at a more convenient time mr notebaert said it could happen in as few as three years "if the timeframe is short we would be better off continuing to expand bandwidth and not deploying capital for iptv " he said "basically its once you accept time shifting as the norm " the notion of an on demand delivery mechanism is part of a concept called "video bypass " referring to the alternate delivery of content outside the normal broadcasting method there are other examples google inc s youtube which streams free videos to computers is considered a low end version microsoft corp offers television show downloads through its xbox videogame system qwest owns the delivery mechanism for video so it is logical for the company to want to derive additional revenue from it but critics say they believe that qwest will need to step up its capacity upgrade for such a service to work while mr notebaert says he believes current network speeds would be sufficient to deliver high definition video by compressing the data others are more skeptical "they have an inherent technical problem there " said gerry kaufhold an analyst at market research firm in stat the challenge lies in having enough capacity in the lines to carry large high definition signals fast enough so there is minimal lag time between when someone presses a button on their remote and when the program starts running qwest could eliminate the bandwidth problem by streaming content in advance to the set top boxs hard drive mr kaufhold said he noted that the service could work well in many of qwests more sparsely populated rural cities where the cable presence isnt strong for now qwest will continue to devote most of its capital toward increasing the bandwidth of its network and the quality of its facilities but the companys rollout will likely be more conservative than its peers "we would like to have bandwidth the day before you need it and not two years " mr notebaert said adding that good timing would aid in preserving profits and a return on investment mr notebaerts vision is similar to the product at&amp t offers to regions where u verse wont be available homezone utilizes a television set top box that integrates satellite signals from echostar communications corp and a dsl feed from at&amp t altman vilandries mr altman said that while homezone represents a reasonably integrated product that should help defend at&amp ts customer base its not a viable long term solution as demand for higher quality video heightens "in the long run customers will be savvy to the quality of the stream " said mr altman who works with many telecommunications companies mr notebaert warned that it was too early to be making comparisons to homezone and he stressed that its product would likely be different
