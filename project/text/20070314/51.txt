the northeastern port city of dalian it could draw criticism in the u s from opponents of sending leading technology to china as it would entail some of the most advanced technology for wafer fabrication a critical step in making semiconductors while intel already has less expensive manufacturing facilities in china for the less sophisticated work of testing and assembling chips the facility described by beijing appears to be a wafer fabrication plant or fab a far more expensive kind of factory where intricate microscopic circuits are etched onto silicon disks obtaining such a plant would be a triumph for china after its decades long campaign to develop a semiconductor industry as jason dean and don clark report it would also mark a major departure for intel likely aimed at gaining a stronger foothold in chinas fast growing chip market though intel hasnt confirmed or denied it is planning to build the facility beijing said it would make chips with circuitry as fine as nanometers or billionths of a meter about one thousandth the width of a human hair intels newest fabs make chips that use circuitry twice as fine still analysts said that even a plant using nanometer technology could run into problems with strict u s government controls on exports of chip equipment to china restrictions aimed at preventing the sale of technology that could have military as well as civilian uses u s chip makers have also worried that bringing their most advanced manufacturing technology to china could spur greater competition in sales of sophisticated chips that arent now built in the country the u s department of commerce sets complex restrictions governing exports to china of advanced equipment for making chips some of the rules require several government agencies to
