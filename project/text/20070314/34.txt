cultivating talent for a digital world in graduate school questions for rick boyko company adcenter the ad school at virginia commonwealth university title managing director professor talent or more accurately a lack thereof is the single biggest issue on madison avenue as the ad world tries to deal with the digital revolution ad agencies have to retrain executives in new ways of reaching consumers a dearth of digitally skilled talent is slowing agencies ability to respond to customer demands and complaints about a lack of minorities in the ad business continue to cause concerns rick boyko a onetime chief creative and co president of ogilvy &amp mather spent years grappling with the challenge of training young creative minds since hes been dealing with that issue head on as managing director of adcenter virginia commonwealth universitys graduate school for advertising in that position he has tried to create a new type of ad executive by revamping the curriculum to cover all kinds of media not just television to demonstrate his commitment he has decided to personally donate &# million to help the center pay for construction of a new building below mr boyko talks about why more focus on talent is needed wall street journal a lack of talent seems to be something that many on madison avenue these days are talking about how does the industry rate its ability to lure new executives with different skill sets mr boyko you have hit on the key issue that everyone is talking about the agencies the media buying firms and marketers are all talking about the need for new talent they are talking about talent that understands how to think differently work more creatively work collaboratively and to solve problems in new ways across a wide spectrum of media we have been saying we are building and growing the future leaders of the industry who all truly understand how to think in a media agnostic way the bigger issue is about how do they ad firms grow the talent they have that is where the industry could use more focus and more focus on educating its ranks wsj many agencies used to have extensive training programs why isnt that the case anymore mr boyko most of the agencies had terrific training programs years ago david ogilvy used to say that he did two things one create communications for his clients and the other to teach young people advertising most of that fell by the wayside few of those training programs still exist they were closed a few years ago during a downturn that is why advertising portfolio schools really got started because there was a real need for someone to fill that education gap while all the ad networks continue to say talent is the key issue they need to realize they have to support education i have found that is something they dont do easily wsj how can you ask young people to consider a career in advertising when the starting wages are so low some as low as &# a year to start mr boyko the salaries for young creative people coming into the business havent changed in eight years yet last time i checked inflation has driven prices for everything else up the industry needs to address starting salaries and they need to move north still it is a terrific business and that allows you to get raises quickly if you prove yourself while they are low to start they do ramp up quickly wsj madison avenue has come under fire for the lack of minorities why does this issue never seem to be resolved mr boyko i think the real issue is that the industry has not done a good job of reaching out to them we have done a good job of reaching out to colleges but where a lot of minorities start to make their career decisions is at the high school level we need to start to reach out to high schools and foster programs that make the industry seem exciting and get minorities interested in the industry at a younger age wsj are ad schools proactively trying to lure more minorities to help fix the issue mr boyko yes we are spending a lot of time trying to recruit minorities by going to colleges that have lots of minority students we are also working with the aaaa the american association of advertising agencies a trade group to develop a program for inner city high schools around the country to raise awareness and create early interest in advertising and marketing as a career opportunity right now advertising isnt on their radar they dont even think about advertising as a career choice that is one reason we have to seek out younger kids at high schools when i got to adcenter of the student body was minorities now we have which demonstrates how much we are focused on this wsj adcenter has begun to offer a course a graduate program to create a new breed of brand manager one who would work at the marketer that teaches them creative skills why offer this track mr boyko when i came here about three years ago i wanted to build a program that could have potential clients marketers coming out who not only could go direct to the marketing side but had the ability to judge creative how to think more creatively and work more collaboratively there is no program in the country like that so we brought together a curriculum that allows the different disciplines to work together so we have creatives art directors and writers who are working with brand managers and we have found that is unique if you go to an m b a program you are with other m b a students here you are working with creatives its important because it teaches them to think differently and allows for a more open exchange of ideas something that marketers are asking for wsj is the track of brand management something a person would do instead of getting an m b a mr boyko yes its in lieu of an m b a its a graduate program that gives a masters of science in marketing wsj why would you think that the procter &amp gambles of the world would be interested in someone without an m b a degree mr boyko many companies like procter &amp gamble and general electric are really pushing for more creative answers and solutions to problems yet most schools dont teach that that is what we are trying to do by having marketing students work alongside creative students our program is not a substitute for an m b a its just a different way for addressing a problem students coming out of our program are a different breed and could be an alternative to hiring an m b a wsj why are you personally donating &# million to vcu mr boyko i believe that talent is the key issue facing the industry today the only way to insure for a continued pool of talent and the next generation of leaders we have to invest in it the adcenter has a new building being built designed by clive wilkinson who has designed spaces for agencies around the world along with companies like google and disney
