second amendment showdown last weeks decision striking down the district of columbias ban on guns as unconstitutional under the second amendment flowed directly from the text history and original understanding of the constitution the u s court of appeals for the d c circuits decision rejected the ninth circuits "collective rights" theory and embraced instead the fifth circuits holding that the second amendment protects individual rights in so doing the d c circuit took a major step forward in protecting the rights of gun owners throughout the country in some ways the decision should not be at all noteworthy or surprising after all the text of the second amendment explicitly protects "the right of the people to keep and bear arms " and the d c gun ban amounted to a complete and total prohibition on citizens owning operational firearms in the district of columbia the challenged city ordinances prohibit the private possession of all handguns and also require that all long guns i e rifles and shotguns be disassembled or have trigger locks in place at all times this latter requirement has no exceptions so that even if a violent crime is underway in your home removing the trigger lock in self defense or in defense of your family constitutes a crime no state in the union has a prohibition as draconian indeed the constitutions of states like the federal constitution explicitly protect the individual right to keep and bear arms and the legislatures of all states are united in their rejection of bans on private handgun ownership forty five states go even further allowing private citizens to carry concealed handguns for self defense so how is it that the district of columbia could be so out of step with the rest of the nation and nonetheless arguably comply with the requirements of the second amendment the answer that the federal district court seized upon like an earlier ruling from the ninth circuit court of appeals in california is a theory popularized recently by several law professors and gun control advocates because the second amendment refers to "a well regulated militia " the constitution protects only the "collective right" of the militia and not the individual right of any citizen this creative theory useful for advancing the policy goals of its advocates runs contrary to the text of the constitution to the debates and original understanding of the framers to supreme court precedent and to the widespread understanding of state courts and legislatures for the first years of our nations history at the time of the founding the "militia" was understood to consist of all able bodied males armed with their own weapons indeed the militia act of not only permitted individual gun ownership it required every man to "provide himself with a good musket or firelock or with a good rifle " if the "collective rights" theory were to prevail the result would be that no individual in the u s could ever claim any right under the second amendment but rather that inchoate right would exist only collectively and amorphously for state militias such an outcome effectively reads out of the constitution what respected law professor sanford levinson famously described as from the perspective of anti gun advocates that "embarrassing second amendment " because the "collective rights" theory is unfaithful to the constitution and undermines the individual rights of all americans texas took the lead among the states in supporting the plaintiffs in the d c gun suit texas attorney general greg abbott assembled a collation of states texas alabama arkansas colorado florida georgia michigan minnesota nebraska north dakota ohio utah and wyoming who together supported the second amendment and the amici states presented oral argument in the d c circuit in the companion case to this one defending the individual right to keep and bear arms notably every state including texas believes that some regulations on firearms are both permissible and advisable for example the states are united in supporting restrictions on violent felons owning guns but all of the amici states are likewise united in the belief that the second amendment means what it says that the individual right to keep and bear arms cannot be completely abrogated as under the d c gun ban the district of columbia has pledged to appeal and this case could well find its way before the u s supreme court if so texas and the rest of the amici states stand ready once again to support the second amendment and we are confident that the court will in turn faithfully uphold the individual constitutional rights of all americans mr cruz is the solicitor general of texas he authored two briefs and presented oral argument for the amici states supporting the second amendment in the d c circuit see related letters "letters to the editor the right to bear arms does that really mean you " wsj march
