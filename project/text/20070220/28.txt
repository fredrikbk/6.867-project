be expected to meet with customers use technology in new ways and help win new business in short to help the los angeles based company grow "i had to sit down and do some soul searching " says mr shelman years old "it was a significant change it sounded exciting but it also scared the hell out of me " mr shelman who has been northrops cio for the last decade ultimately decided to stay in the
