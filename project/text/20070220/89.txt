sirius and xm agree to merge despite hurdles for regulators deal pits competition concerns against new technology the proposed &# billion merger of struggling satellite radio operators xm satellite radio holdings inc and sirius satellite radio inc sets up a crucial test for the nations regulators how to weigh the limits of consolidation against rapid changes in media technology the deal is structured as a "merger of equals " giving xm and sirius shareholders an equal stake in the combined company and potentially uniting a roster of talent that includes siriuss shock jock howard stern and daytime tv personality oprah winfrey one of xms biggest stars the agreement calls for sirius chief executive mel karmazin to serve as ceo of the new entity which would have more than &# billion in long term debt xm chairman gary parsons would be chairman but because xm and sirius are the only two companies licensed by the federal communications commission to offer satellite radio in the u s the deal is likely to face significant regulatory obstacles broadcasters said yesterday that they will fight the proposed merger and fcc chairman kevin martin released an unusually grim statement saying that the two companies will face a "high" hurdle since the fcc still has a rule on its books specifically forbidding such a deal which would need to be tossed the transaction also requires the justice departments blessing indeed xm and sirius may be rushing into a deal because they sense the regulatory terrain will only get tougher people close to the matter said that the two companies acted because the climate is already changing with the election of a democratic controlled congress future developments such as the possibility of a democratic president could make it even harder for the proposed merger to pass muster in their strategy the two companies may be subtly acknowledging the risks before them by conceiving their deal as a merger of equals and declining to say which company name would emerge ascendant they minimize the business risks should the deal fall through if for example the combined company were to be dubbed sirius xm could be vulnerable to a decline in sales during a regulatory review period that could last a year a person familiar with the negotiations said the two companies have set march as their "drop dead date " after which either side can walk away if approval is not granted the coming regulatory battle is likely to focus on the definition of satellite radios market the two companies are expected to argue that the rules established a decade ago which require two satellite rivals to ensure competition simply dont apply in todays entertainment landscape since a host of new listening options have emerged making the issue of choice in satellite radio less important for consumers executives cite a new digital technology called hd radio ipod digital music players internet radio and music over mobile phones as competitors that didnt exist when the satellite licenses were first awarded just a few years ago the two satellite rivals were the hot new technology on the media scene offering consumers greater choice in both music and talk programming in exchange for a monthly subscription fee but while both companies have continued to add subscribers steadily their growth has slowed in part because of the other new devices and services competing for the same potential listeners both xm and sirius have continued to lose money in the companies had combined losses of &# billion after losing a combined &# billion the year before their results havent been released but goldman sachs analyst mark wienkes estimates that sirius lost &# billion on revenue of &# million last year while xm lost &# million on revenue of &# million consumers and their advocates are likely to worry that a combined company would mean higher prices for satellite radio service both companies now charge &# a month but company executives say market forces would limit the possibility of higher prices "we are competing with companies that give away their product for free " said mr karmazin alluding to conventional over the air radio satellite radio customers will still be able to use their existing satellite radios for the foreseeable future but to take advantage of a combined service they probably would need to upgrade to a newer radio currently sirius and xm run on separate incompatible systems although a team of engineers from both companies has been working on a radio that could pull in both signals "the benefits to the subscribers are awesome " siriuss mr karmazin said in an interview "we can combine research and development resources and come up with cooler more advanced products that will satisfy them more were going to have the ability to negotiate better with our receiver manufacturers " the companies could also eliminate duplicative services for example xm features a christian music themed channel called "the message " while sirius has its own christian pop channel dubbed "spirit " by mr karmazins reckoning the two companies could eliminate such overlap and concentrate on unique shows and new technology to deliver it "theres going to be more consumer choice " mr karmazin said it remains to be seen whether the fcc shares that view in his statement yesterday evening mr martin said the fcc would certainly review the deal but "the companies would need to demonstrate that consumers would clearly be better off with both more choice and affordable prices " a larger problem for the companies however is opposition from broadcasters to whom mr martin has been an ally in the past two years ago the national association of broadcasters lobbied hard against xms effort to acquire wcs wireless llc for &# million the deal would have given xm additional radio frequencies and allowed it to expand its service broadcasters however complained that xm would use the acquisition to provide local programming which isnt allowed under its current license ultimately the deal fell through after languishing without action at the fcc for nearly a year the broadcasters quickly went on the offensive yesterday "when the fcc authorized satellite radio it specifically found that the public would be served best by two competitive nationwide systems " said nab spokesman dennis wharton "now with their stock prices at rock bottom and their business model in disarray because of profligate spending practices they seek a government bailout to avoid competing in the marketplace " the fccs five commissioners will need to be convinced that theres enough competition in the market to support a merger one issue the agency will likely consider fcc officials say is satellite radios popularity with consumers and the two companies long term prospects if they dont merge with the fcc currently immersed in whats likely to be a protracted fight over changes to media ownership limits it may not be an auspicious time to propose a deal to consolidate the satellite radio industry democrats at the fcc have been more assertive since their party took control of congress and some lawmakers have already begun to express doubts about the deal massachusetts democrat edward markey chairman of the house subcommittee that oversees the fcc said yesterday that he will review the proposed mergers effect on consumers "in light of the dramatic consolidation of radio ownership i believe that the merger of the only two satellite radio companies must be assessed with an eye toward ensuring that it does not have a similar deleterious effect on diversity on the dial and localism in radio coverage and reporting " he said in a statement under the deal xm shareholders will receive a fixed exchange of shares of sirius for each of their xm shares based on stock prices friday that meant that xm holders would receive &# for each of their shares a premium to fridays close of &# xm chairman parsons had argued for more people familiar with the matter said based on his companys more extensive deals with auto makers and its million subscribers compared with siriuss six million but mr karmazin stuck to his guns stressing siriuss bigger market capitalization and faster growth rate the market was already responding to the possibility of a deal on friday bidding xm stock up by nearly in agreeing to a premium for xm sirius is getting a larger ownership stake than if it had simply contributed its business into a new company so called "mergers of equals" have had a dubious track record according to a number of academic studies of big corporate transactions thats largely because under such plans companies can end up bickering over managerial control and strategy which can be distracting and ultimately costly to shareholders sirius and xm executives played down that prospect "synergies have become such a very large element of value compared to the individual values of the companies " said mr parsons though he conceded that the two sides debated for months about who should own the biggest part of the company "that drove us to look at it together " sirius has performed better in recent quarters at retail winning large numbers of customers who walk into a store to buy a satellite radio to add to their car but xm has positioned itself better for the future signing up more deals with auto makers such as general motors corp so cars roll off factory lines with satellite radios preinstalled expensive programming one upmanship has weighed on the stock prices at both companies for example in sirius said it would pay &# million over five years not including performance based bonuses to broadcast a morning show starring the colorful mr stern two weeks later xm said it would pay &# million over years to broadcast major league baseball "the strategic benefits of a merger would be tremendous " said craig moffett an analyst at sanford c bernstein "programming contract renewals would no longer be the subject of bidding wars automotive revenue sharing agreements and retailer commission deals would suddenly be uncontested " sirius was advised on the deal by morgan stanley and law firms simpson thacher &amp bartlett llp and wiley rein llp xm was advised by j p morgan chase &amp co and law firms skadden arps slate meagher &amp flom jones day and latham &amp watkins
