peripatetic but never pedestrian the friendship wordsworth &amp coleridge by adam sisman viking pages &# a single soul dwelling in two bodies " aristotles definition of friendship may come to mind in the course of reading adam sismans invigorating portrait of the english poets william wordsworth and samuel taylor coleridge aristotle discussed the nature of friendship while walking around his school he was the original peripatetic wordsworth and coleridge inhabited a chillier and unconfined landscape but their walking conversations fill mr sismans book they walk around the quantock hills and the lake district they walk across europe they even walk at night their strolls along the english coast in the s aroused suspicions that they might be napoleonic spies the distances can stun you coleridge traveled more than miles on foot in a single day just to see a friend during his long visit to france before the revolution wordsworth walked about miles on the continent no wonder coleridge wrote a poem called "perspirations a travelling eclogue " for many years wordsworth walked alone after his reunion with his sister dorothy she kept pace with him long skirts and all when coleridge befriended the pair in he felt that they were "three persons with one soul " coleridge composed much of his mysteriously compelling poem "the rime of the ancient mariner" while out walking with the wordsworths their friend william hazlitt described their different manners of peripatetic composition "coleridge has told me that he himself likes to compose in walking over uneven ground or breaking through the straggling branches of a copse wood whereas wordsworth always wrote if he could walking up and down a straight gravel walk or in some spot where the continuity of his verse met with no collateral interruption " arriving back home the men wrote at the same table passing drafts back and forth their poems began to intersect too famously they brought out "the lyrical ballads" in a book whose language and subject matter taken from ordinary life jump started a revolution in poetry but the collaboration was even more intimate coleridge suggested the opening stanza of wordsworths "we are seven " which coleridge then quoted in one of his own poems wordsworth wrote a couplet for "the ancient mariner" and borrowed a line from coleridge for "tintern abbey " as mr sisman describes it in "the friendship " this was "a type of dialogue or perhaps a duet in which one musician picks up and develops a theme from the other " they were not so much in love as in tune with one another once when they were separated coleridge said of a poem that wordsworth had sent him in a letter "had i met these lines running wild in the deserts of arabia i should have instantly called out wordsworth " although seemingly kindred spirits the two men were temperamentally dissimilar coleridge brilliant a shimmering conversationalist wordsworth shaded and restrained in company when they met in coleridge was the more renowned and settled apparently married to the woman of his dreams wordsworths prospects had withered he had fathered an illegitimate child in france and upon returning to england refused to follow any profession that would earn money with time however wordsworth became so domestically prudent that having married and begun a family he accepted a job as a government functionary and buoyed by coleridges belief in his genius wrote and published fluently but coleridges volatility proved fatal for the next phase of life he was a ramshackle family man and could never settle to his poetic work "you spawn plans like a herring " said robert southey his exasperated brother in law worst of all coleridge lost confidence in his gifts as early as at age he wrote to william godwin "the poet is dead in me " by his mid s coleridge was a bloated wreck drifting remote and solitary in his addiction to laudanum wine laced with opium "he lies in bed " dorothy wordsworth wrote "and never walks out " coleridge in his turn was frustrated by changes in his friend "never does he turn round or ponder whether one has understood him " he complained of wordsworth "but each word is followed by three four five syn or homonyms in a tiring sequence of eddies and in this manner for three four hours " eventually they had nothing to say to each other years later when coleridge was looking over some old journals that hed kept from the days when he and wordsworth had "together wantoned in wild poesy " he added a bitter note "my friend o me what a word to give permanence to the mistake of a life " but even this feeling faded with time the two never wholly reconciled but they lived long enough to share another journey abroad in this time in a carriage with wordsworths daughter dorothy one of mr sismans strengths is his willingness to portray each man fairly without taking sides above all he captures in the early part of his chronicle the exhilaration of so to speak falling in friendship that shock of recognition at a matching gleam in the eye perhaps aristotle deserves the last word "without friends no one would choose to live though he had all other goods " ms mullen writes for the new criterion the hudson review and other publications
