new albums from brazil melodic polyrhythmic and almost always about something that touches the heart brazils bossa nova and samba are the supple root of recent engaging albums by cibelle ceu lenine and shrift brazilians who tweak the tradition by drawing on outside influences and marisa monte a superstar in her home country who issued two fine discs here late last year "universo ao meu redor" emi her testimony to "the atmosphere surrounding samba " as she calls it and "infinito particular" emi a modestly experimental work that features string charts by philip glass and brazil native deodato now new albums by veterans caetano veloso maria bethania and gal costa speak to the elasticity of brazils music and reveal the sources of its evolution in the late s they and others blended bossa nova and other brazilian musical forms with rock to create what became known as the tropicalismo movement thus its not a complete surprise that theyd continue to explore new methods three plus decades later gilberto gil another force behind tropicalismo will release a new album "gil luminoso" on march its on the mg label mr velosos "ce" nonesuch is a fascinating addition to his growing legacy that was the subject of the cd boxed set "todo caetano" universal issued in newcomers to mr velosos music may want to start with the more manageable "best of caetano veloso" or the two disc "live in bahia " both on the nonesuch label on "ce " he blends his sweet now stately voice and nylon string guitar with straightforward percussion and a wheedling wah wah rock guitar recorded on tape the disc has a lean raw energy not usually associated with mr velosos recent outings but the new environment doesnt lessen the emotional impact of his performance it seems to drive him deeper into his songs "maria bethania sings the vinicius de moraes songbook" drg looks back before tropicalismo to bossa nova and samba her smoky tremulous voice has the imperial authority of portugals fado singers and yet retains the sensuality associated with her native music her muse here is the late de moraes a poet and musician who wrote the words to six antonio carlos jobim compositions covered here those of us who dont understand portuguese are at a disadvantage when accessing his contribution to the disc but ms bethanias elegant performance and the gorgeous string arrangements by jorge calandrelli deliver us to beauty by the way the album is a family affair ms bethania who is mr velosos sister is joined by jobims grandsons daniel and philippe and marcel baden powell son of the gifted guitarist baden powell who also wrote with de moraes gal costas "our moments" drg celebrates the music of brazil before the bossa nova revolution though lush and not overly reverent the disc is anchored in rhythms that cry for liberation from weighty surroundings yet ms costa shines bringing a good natured fluidity to the occasionally static environs the disc works best when it draws on the bossa nova tradition that was yet to come when the songs were composed for ms costas take on bossa nova try "live at the blue note" drg a triumphant in concert performance that includes nine jobim songs and was recorded in may at the intimate new york city nightspot ms costa fronts a small piano less combo that leaves her ample room to let her voice float with the joao gilberto like guitar of marcus teixeira perhaps as a nod to her american hosts she included the standards "as time goes by" and "i fall in love too easily " which she handles with mature grace but the focus is on the jobim classics "desafinado " "a felicidade " "wave" and "corcovado " among them ms costa recorded and released "our moments" in brazil before she appeared at the blue note where she performed three of its tunes each fares better in its live version jobim known as tom to family and friends never goes out of style so its difficult to declare a renaissance for his work but though he died in his previously unreleased or limited release discs continue to emerge among the latest are "the unknown" drg recorded in and issued in brazil eight years later as "tom jobim inedito " and "live at minas" drg recorded in both were released here last summer and the former continues to beguile particularly when one considers jobims continuing influence on his countrys new music the live set is little more than a curio for the non portuguese speaker as jobim enlivens his understated performance with vignettes about his songwriting partners de moraes dolores duran and newton mendonca with whom he wrote "desafinado" and "samba de uma nota so " known in the states as "one note samba " that said it is unadorned jobim a songwriter playing piano and singing his songs exposing the colors in the chords and unorthodox bass lines he prefers "the unknown" is a much more fully realized gem jobim reworked many of his most notable compositions for it including a few hed never recorded before and made the album with a group that included cellist jaques morelenbaum singer paula morelenbaum a notable jobim interpreter danilo caymmi on flute and vocals a string section and members of the jobim family the up tempo songs are lovingly redefined his new versions of "aquas de marco" and "garota de ipanema " familiar to american pop fans as "waters of march" and "the girl from ipanema " respectively are delightful and the explorations of jobims more brooding somber works are startlingly effective "the unknown" captures the breadth and depth of jobims remarkable body of work which remains the wellspring of a thriving musical movement mr fusilli writes about rock and pop for the journal
