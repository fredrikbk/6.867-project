retirement savings found adequate the u s national savings rate last year was a negative but we are still salting away enough for retirement or so say some researchers at issue are some recent academic papers which suggest that the outlook for retirees isnt that bleak the new research which has attracted a lot of media attention takes a broader look at the assets of those and older and suggests that many are better off than they thought but is it really time for people to throttle back their k contributions many economists say not so fast a host of other research by nonprofits private companies financial firms and academics indicates that baby boomers are in for a rude awakening if they dont start saving more and spending less "we continue to think people are going to be very vulnerable as they approach retirement in the future " says alicia munnell director of boston colleges center for retirement research which estimates nearly of working age households are at risk for being unprepared for retirement all researchers agree some americans struggle in the work force and will struggle in retirement there also is a percentage of affluent americans who are saving large amounts of money for retirement but the new research from economists such as john karl scholz a professor at the university of wisconsin at madison come to a different conclusion "overwhelmingly people seemed to have accumulated sufficient resources to maintain their living standards in retirement " prof scholz and his co authors studied people born between and and found that at least had saved enough for retirement "people are extremely anxious about doing enough" to save he said "its possible that anxiety is misplaced " a separate study by david love an economics professor at williams college and co authors from the federal reserve concludes that if you combine all of the assets of those and older including stocks bonds social security and housing most people will have enough for retirement "more americans than i would have expected are doing ok " prof love says he argues many baby boomers experienced large capital appreciation on their homes and other assets in recent years prof love foresees a big change in behavior unlike many in previous generations who typically passed their home on to heirs he assumes savings embedded in the home will be used for retirement the new research shouldnt be dismissed out of hand certainly the investment firms nagging us to save more have a vested interest in our salting away money into k and ira accounts but many economists look at the current saving situation with alarm in a speech thursday st louis federal reserve president william poole warned that people have too much credit card debt and not enough assets "many households would be much better off if they had consumed less and accumulated more wealth during their working years " where many researchers begin to disagree with the new analysis is its assumption that the experience of prior generations will pertain to the baby boomers and beyond critics such as ms munnell a former member of the council of economic advisors contend baby boomers face a different world than their parents and grandparents who lived in "the gold age of retirement " they note two big differences first of americans and older own their homes according to a report released in february by the fidelity research institute second many older americans receive a pension and retiree health care benefits future generations wont have those benefits pensions are declining one indicator the number of private pensions insured by the pension benefit guaranty corp has plummeted to in from in and yet boomers and future generations ms munnell says will have to wait until an older age than their parents and grandparents to receive full social security benefits another cost for boomers is that retirees must shoulder more of the burden of their health care as employer sponsored plans cut back or fall by the wayside from to the share of large employers offering retiree health benefits declined to from according to a report released in december by the kaiser family foundation and hewitt associates and medicare doesnt cover everything the nonprofit employee benefit research institute has put the cost of health care during retirement for a year old couple retiring in at &# if they live to yet the aarp public policy institute estimates that older baby boomers those born between and had a median net worth in of &# meaning half had more and half had less younger boomers those born between and had a median net worth of &# financial practitioners typically recommend that retirement income equal about to of preretirement levels and closer to to for higher income households who may expect traveling and other expenses at least in early retirement that level of income requires hefty savings
