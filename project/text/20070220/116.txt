yours is mine and mine yours nasdaq is trading more of big boards listings nyse more of nasdaqs in the eighth circle of inferno as described in dantes divine comedy one ditch includes a group of people who are constantly bitten by snakes the serpents then mutate into the person theyve just snacked upon while the bitten turn into snakes the process repeats ad infinitum something similar might be happening to nyse groups new york stock exchange and to the nasdaq stock market both exchanges recently reported increased market share in issues listed on the other guys market only to see the share of their own listings decline for january nasdaq reported that "matched share" volume of nyse listed securities rose to from for january meaning that more nyse listed shares are being traded on nasdaq at the same time however the nasdaqs share of trading in its own listings fell the big board meanwhile said its share of nasdaq listed issues rose to in january from for the same time period a year ago like nasdaq though it lost share of trading in its own listings this suggests their market share losses might not be all that worrying the nyse and nasdaq have other competitors but they have mostly lost market share over the years to each other another effect of the spread of electronic trading dont panic investors have been inundated lately with news of troubles in the subprime mortgage markets which cater to borrowers with shaky credit but some wall street analysts say its time to chill out about subprime blowups "in the past an upturn in consumer delinquency rates from very low levels did not signal an imminent recession and is unlikely to crater consumer spending again " chief citigroup strategist tobias levkovich wrote in a recent note mr levkovich said its important to distinguish between investors affected by subprime tremors and those shielded from it yields on credit default swaps which offer a kind of insurance on bond defaults have widened for bonds tied to subprime mortgage lenders but mortgage backed securities and bonds of home builders have hung in there the market in other words is sending mixed signals richard berner economist at morgan stanley made a similar argument recently calling fears of a wider credit crunch "dramatically overblown " though there could be more risky subprime loans mr berner said "disciplined industry lenders" havent experienced early payment defaults unlike more aggressive lenders still he considers this a wake up call to investors who had gotten used to ignoring risk "complacency among market participants about credit quality has led to indiscriminate buying of high risk assets " he wrote all about the benjamins or not the assumption was that fed chairman ben bernankes congressional testimony sparked a market rally last week mr bernanke had a benign view of inflation which investors took to mean short term interest rates wont be heading higher soon but the timing of the rally looks funny barry ritholtz of ritholtz research &amp analytics noted that about a minute before newswires published text from mr bernankes speech a large buy order for stock futures tied to the s&amp p hit the tape one possible explanation is that someone got an early look at the speech another theory was that a stock trader likely at a large wall street firm decided to goose stocks immediately before the speech hoping the rest of the market would interpret the move as a positive reaction to mr bernankes speech either way it worked quite well for someone
