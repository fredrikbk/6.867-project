who needs jacques bauer twenty nine defendants went on trial last week in a spanish courtroom for complicity in the march madrid train bombings that killed commuters and injured another among the accused jamal zougam a year old moroccan immigrant who once ran a cellphone business in june spanish police raided mr zougams apartment where they found jihadist literature and the telephone numbers of suspected terrorists but the spaniards judged the evidence insufficient to arrest or even wiretap him today the moroccan is believed to have furnished the cellphones through which the train bombs were detonated in raiding mr zougams apartment the spanish were acting on a request from french investigative magistrate and counterterrorism supremo jean louis bruguiere earlier mr bruguiere had also warned the canadian government about a suspicious algerian asylum seeker named ahmed ressam but the canadians took no real action on dec mr ressam a k a the millennium bomber was arrested by u s customs agents as he attempted to cross the border at port angeles wash with nitroglycerin and timing devices concealed in his spare tire it would be reassuring to believe that somewhere in the ranks of the fbi or cia america has a jean louis bruguiere of its own but we probably dont and not because we lack for domestic talent investigative prowess foreign connections the will to fight terrorism or the forensic genius of a gallic nose what we lack is a system of laws that allows a man like mr bruguiere to operate the way he does unless were willing to trade in the constitution for the code napoleon we are not likely to get it consider the powers granted to mr bruguiere and his colleagues warrantless wiretaps not a problem under french law as long as the interior ministry approves court issued search warrants based on probable cause not needed to conduct a search hearsay evidence admissible in court habeas corpus suspects can be held and questioned by authorities for up to hours without judicial supervision or the notification of third parties profiling french officials commonly boast of having a "spy in every mosque " a wall of separation between intelligence and law enforcement agencies frances domestic and foreign intelligence bureaus work hand in glove bail authorities can detain suspects in "investigative" detentions for up to a year mr bruguiere once held suspects on terrorism related charges the courts eventually cleared of the suspects some of whom had spent four years in preventive detention at their trial in the u s mr bruguieres activities would amount to one long and tangled violation of the first fourth fifth sixth and eighth amendments to the constitution and thats not counting the immense legal superstructures that successive supreme courts have built over and around the bill of rights in france however mr bruguiere though not without his critics is a folk hero equally at home with governments of the left and right the main point in his favor is that whatever it is hes doing it works "every single attempt to bomb france since has been stopped before execution " notes a former interior ministry senior official "the french policy has been to make sure no terrorist hits at home we know perfectly well that foreign policy triangulation is not sufficient for that even if it helps us go down a notch or two in the order of priority jihadist targets so weve complemented our anti u s foreign policy with ruthless domestic measures " thats something that u s civil libertarians who frequently argue that the bush administration should follow the "european model" of treating terrorism as a law enforcement issue instead of a military one might usefully keep in mind as lawyers david rivkin and lee casey argue in the forthcoming issue of the national interest "the napoleonic civil law system offers considerable advantages to the state in combating terrorism especially in terms of investigative tools and a level of secrecy that are simply unavailable in the ordinary common law criminal prosecution and trial at least as governed by the united states constitution " again review the contrasts between american and european practices except in limited circumstances the u s does not allow pre trial detentions but according to figures compiled by the u s state department of individuals held in italian prisons in were awaiting trial or the outcome of an appeal while spanish law allows for pre trial detentions that can last as long as four years for terrorism suspects in the u s the posse comitatus act forbids the use of the military in law enforcement work and paramilitary units are relatively rare by contrast most european countries deploy huge paramilitary forces italys carabinieri frances gendarmerie nationale spains guardia civil even britain which shares americas common law traditions has been forced by irish and now islamist terrorism to resort to administrative detentions trials without jury the famous diplock courts and ubiquitous public surveillance wiretapping is authorized by the home secretary that is a member of the government rather than an independent judge in the early days of the northern irish "troubles " the government of edward heath placed some suspects without charge in internment camps ironically it was the decision to treat terrorists as ordinary criminals that led to the famous hunger strikes of bobby sands and his ira crew all this calls into question the seriousness if not the sincerity of european complaints that under the bush administration the u s has become a serial human rights violator europeans have every right to be proud of civil servants like mr bruguiere and a legal tradition that in many ways has been remarkably successful against terrorism but that is not the american way nor can it be if we intend to be true to a constitutional order of checks and balances judicial review and a high respect for the rights of the accused when president bush declared a war on terror after it was because he had no other realistic legal alternative and when the rest of us make invidious comparisons between europe and america we should keep our fundamental differences in mind there is no european nd airborne and there is no american jean louis bruguiere write to bstephens wsj com
