business technology h p charges hard into software ceo hurd gambles on branded business bundle to boost growth hewlett packard co has a strong brand in personal computers and printers now the company is placing a big bet on the power of its name in a different business software h p which is announcing its first quarter results today is beginning to offer a new bundle of h p programs that underscores the importance of business software to the strategy of mark hurd h ps chief executive in the coming weeks the company will host corporate chief information officers at meetings held in places such as sports arenas and movie studios to promote the software package the combination will include openview a venerable piece of software with a loyal following and programs developed by mercury interactive corp whose &# billion acquisition by h p was announced last year but the well known mercury and openview brand names are both being scrapped to be replaced by the umbrella name hp software the new moniker is being touted in ads declaring that h p is turning the information technology world "on its head " first though h p has to invert its spotty track record in the field and a perception that business software is less profitable than it once was one customer who sees benefits is julius tomei senior director and chief information officer at advance transformer a maker of lighting components owned by philips electronics nv his company uses both openview which helps companies manage and monitor their computing gear and programs from mercury that help companies develop and test software mr tomei said he is eager for h p to make the programs work better together yet the company risks alienating long time customers if it bobbles efforts to integrate the two product lines or if its sales team isnt trained to market both effectively "all of this will come down to how well h p executes on this combined plan and combined organization and i think the biggest area i would focus on is sales and execution " said tim&lt th&gt grieser an analyst at market researcher idc software isnt new for h p an h p program called newwave which worked with microsoft corp s windows to add graphical commands for personal computers was seen as important enough to be named in by apple inc in a landmark copyright infringement suit against the two companies that apple eventually lost h p in also introduced openview now one of the most popular tools for managing networks of computers the market research firm idc estimates that international business machines corp generates the most revenue in computer management software while h ps is no in market share h ps openview is no in the idc rankings for such programs excluding those managing mainframe computers yet software has remained a sideline accounting for of h ps &# billion in total revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter ended oct the software business posted operating losses in the companys and fiscal years ibm by contrast gets about of its revenue from software and of its operating income mr hurd who became chief executive in the spring of is determined to rewrite that history in the fourth quarter revenue rose to &# million and operating margins swelled to from a year earlier mr hurd keeps betting more chips on software after the deal for mercury announced in july a smaller purchase followed in bristol technology a maker of software that monitors customer transactions in january mr hurd hired thomas hogan former chief executive of software maker vignette corp to kick software into an even higher gear one problem in the past mr hogan said was that software was such a small part of h ps business that there wasnt much pressure from upper management to pay attention to profitability some customers have worried that h p might divest the software business if it wasnt a reliable money maker "we wanted to get the business profitable and making healthy contributions to h p to alleviate that fear " mr hogan said at a meeting in boston this month with h ps salespeople handling software mr hogan promised to arm them with training and resources to sell an expanded portfolio of products the company is introducing a compensation model common in the software industry with a low fixed salary and more opportunity for bigger sales commissions than h p had offered before the top of software sellers will win a trip to a "warm and sunny place " said david gee a vice president of marketing for h ps software business mr gee says h p retired the brand names mercury and openview and pursued a single brand strategy because there is far more equity in the larger h p brand which includes printings pcs and servers among other technology going forward he says there is an opportunity to increase sales of h p software within the combined customer bases of h p and mercury many of which have never been called on in the past by mercury or h p salespeople he adds that the company will tightly integrate with h ps services arm as it goes out and sells the new portfolio dislodging competitors is likely to remain a challenge for h p consider the decision by openview user integra telecom inc which provides telephone and internet services for businesses and last year decided to buy electric lightwave which used ibms tivoli netcool management software integra which wanted to standardize on one program evaluated both vendors and decided to go with ibm "ibm had more robust functionality and at a better cost than h p openview " said julie rouzee integras chief technology officer h p said it will become more competitive with the expanded hp software portfolio which is styled as a kind of universal dashboard for corporate chief information officers helping them prioritize their budgets manage the software they own and test and monitor the quality of programs they develop yet all vendors must cope with a movement away from the traditional style of software sales based on getting companies to upgrade to new versions of products every few years most companies now offer their products on a less lucrative subscription model or they offer "on demand" online services that dont require customers to install and manage their own business software "the h p approach is costly " said rebecca wettemann research vice president for nucleus research inc "certainly in terms of delivering rapid innovation and keeping costs managed the on demand model is a better one " mr gee noted mercury has used an on demand model and will continue to do so h p is evaluating other parts of its software offerings to see if the approach will fit them too he said
