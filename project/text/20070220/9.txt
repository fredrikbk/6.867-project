anxiety high moving for schools some families are uprooting their lives in search of a perfect private education to me its better than leaving them a house or my k boston it isnt uncommon for parents to search beyond their neighborhood for the best school the ogormans searched the entire country settled in the well groomed los angeles suburb of san marino derek ogorman worked as an insurance broker his wife mary ann took care of their two girls both stellar students at top ranked local schools but in when the family visited a nearby private high school they expected the girls to attend they came away disappointed after an extensive search the ogormans found the perfect fit the winsor school winsor famed for its academic rigor and participatory classes is also known for the academic success of its students about a third of its latest graduating class went to ivy league colleges the hitch winsor is in boston after months of debate the ogormans sold their house mr ogorman who was born and raised in los angeles quit his job and the family moved to a small boston apartment it would take three months and most of the familys savings before mr ogorman years old found an insurance job in the new city "no place is perfect but i wanted the place that was the most perfect for us and them " says ms ogorman "to me its better than leaving them a house or my k " across the country a small but growing number of parents like the ogormans are dramatically altering their families lives to pursue the perfect private school for their children while past generations of parents might have shifted addresses within a town to be near a particular school or shipped junior off to boarding school these parents are choosing school first location second "i hear about it all the time " says patrick bassett president of the national association of independent schools or nais in washington d c germantown friends school in philadelphia says four families have moved to the area in the past two years so their children can attend the school hathaway brown school an all girls school in shaker heights ohio reports five such families four of which moved in the past few years "its been a little more frequent in the last two or three years " says sally jeanne mckenna admissions director at polytechnic school of pasadena calif in the frenzy over private day schools this is a new extreme one that reflects the anxiety many affluent parents feel about securing their childrens futures "its one of the great ironies of american life were much wealthier than ever before but were more worried about our kids " says robert evans a wellesley mass psychologist and school consultant "people who by any measure are doing well now are much less confident about the future " the phenomenon is driven by rapid changes in technology which give many parents geographic latitude with their jobs the internet has created a national marketplace for schools with troves of information on most any school in the country and even particular administrators available within a few clicks parents are also looking to schools to provide a source of values and community for their children replacing neighborhoods churches or workplaces educators say sometimes its also a source of community for parents as well school "is the new town center " says naiss mr bassett "its becoming the priest the minister adding a much larger dynamic of social expectations " the vast majority of parents still send their children to their local public schools of those who opt for the private sector the number moving to cities for schools may be higher than administrators realize because parents occasionally bend the truth at interviews admissions officials say school officials speculate some may be reluctant to admit to pursuing a school with such fervor that concern didnt affect ms ogorman "its a crazy world and they need to be equipped both from an educational and social standpoint " she says since the familys move "i think i breathe a little easier knowing im doing the best that i can " carol baldwin moody decided her daughter should attend germantown friends where she herself had been a student at the time ms moody and her family lived in brooklyn the new york city borough where her husband ronald had grown up in they moved to rural new hope pa for the next year and a half ms moody commuted five hours a day to her new york based job as chief compliance officer at tiaa cref a pension and annuity giant in ms moody left tiaa cref for a similar job at another company so she could work near her daughters school two days a week she spends three days a week in columbus ohio mr moody quit his job as a district executive for the boy scouts of america to drive jessica the miles to school and back hes now a stay at home dad "it may not be what id envisioned doing at this stage of my life but ill do it if its the best thing for my child " says mr moody parents argue that with todays flexible and more uncertain labor market moving for school makes more sense than it did in an earlier era when families usually moved for work "when i started my career at general motors they moved your family every three years " says edward case who worked for four other companies before retiring as chief financial officer of formica corp last year "but you could have expectation as i did that you had a job for life the world isnt like that anymore " the case family moved to philadelphia in so their four children could attend germantown a move that required mr case to drive two hours each way to get to his job the cases chose not to move in when he switched jobs again this time to germany mr case estimates he spent five weeks out of every six in stuttgart in he took a job in new jersey that required an hour and forty five minute drive each way before ending his career in cincinnati he flew there during the week returning on weekends the family says the time apart was worth it "its a fantastic community to grow up in " says emma case a year old senior the second youngest of four case children "ive known three out of my five best friends since the first grade " ms case says her father often traveled even when they lived together and so his absence wasnt notable a number of school officials hail parents involvement saying it reflects a growing realization of how important it is to find the right school william christ head of hathaway brown points to one family who moved to cleveland so their daughter could attend the school and moved back to california after her graduation "they knew a lot about our school and knew exactly what they wanted for their daughter " he says at the same time the phenomenon heightens the pressure on everyone involved "it creates an unbearable set of expectations " says michael thompson an arlington mass psychologist and school consultant "if my parents moved for me dont i have to be deliriously happy with school how many seventh graders are deliriously happy it could overwhelm the childs experience because the parents are so invested " then there are the admissions officers whose yea or nay can determine the destiny of an entire family "we handle these candidates carefully the decision carries great weight " says laura myran admissions director at germantown friends the stakes werent lost on either the ogormans or winsor schools small admissions staff "i dont want to make a mistake " ms ogorman recalls telling the school at one point "if we do and you do thats pretty scary " the ogormans odyssey began in the fall of when the two girls year old mary catherine and year old colleen visited a top private school in los angeles although both children wanted to attend an all girls school the hollywood influenced culture of this one left them cold curious to see if anything would fulfill her vision ms ogorman began searching the internet dozens of pamphlets from around the country flooded the family home both girls homed in on winsors simple brochure filled with photos of fresh faced young girls and examples of class artwork and lively academic discussions soon ms ogorman was staying up late into the night searching the internet to learn everything she could about the school the teachers and its administration she loved that the school while academically rigorous didnt emphasize advanced placement classes and the fact her girls wouldnt receive grades at first giving them more room to take risks for her it was a refreshing new approach "so many things i read spoke to me " she says when the ogormans contacted winsor and told their story the school was skeptical "at first it was a little off putting to be honest " says pamela parks mclaurin winsors admissions director "i thought well there are wonderful schools everywhere you need to move cross country to find the right school " but administrators were soon taken by the ogormans sincerity and down to earth nature and grew impressed that a family without significant wealth was willing to sacrifice so much "it went from being off putting to quite flattering even inspiring " ms mclaurin says in los angeles the ogormans debated their options night and day reaction from friends and family didnt help many were confused or thought the idea ridiculous but the girls wanted to go "we really wore out our wood floors in our house " ms gorman says "we sat down and talked with the girls about what it really would mean what they would have to give up " mr ogorman had worked as an insurance broker for years and was reasonably confident he could secure a similar job in boston in the end "we said we had to try " he says in march winsor accepted both girls when one admissions letter was stuck in the mail kristy wells winsors admissions office manager who became close with the family phoned up ms ogorman to give her the good news her reaction they both remember "oh my god ive got to sell my house " the house sold in less than a week and the ogormans were in boston by aug sitting in one of winsors conference rooms recently mary catherine and colleen who was wearing a blue winsor sweatshirt both expressed happiness their peers are friendly and the stress level is lower than in san marino as to her parents "i feel thankful really really grateful to them " said mary catherine usually the quieter of the two "im kind of surprised they would do this for me but im very thankful to them for doing it for our education " mr and mrs ogorman are still grappling with the basics of east coast life such as bostons myriad roads and its aggressive drivers life in a two bedroom apartment is a big change its swanky urban decor stems from the units origins as a model home the family cant afford the &# tab to move their furnishings money from their home sale is being plowed into the girls tuition which totals nearly &# a year on a recent gray december day sitting in her new living room ms ogorman said shes still adjusting she talked about the china the family traditionally used at thanksgiving and her clear blue eyes brimmed with tears with the reminder of her former life their finances depleted ms ogorman said she soon plans to return to work "some days you feel like the odds are stacked against you when derek didnt have a job for three months but then colleen comes in excited about a greek test they had " she said "those moments are great "
