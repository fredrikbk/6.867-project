the virtue of patents there is a large risk that congress may deform the patent system rather than reform it for in its quest to modernize the antiquated and underfunded system for protecting our inventions congress has trotted out an easy target so called "patent trolls" to justify changes that would stifle innovation benefiting large technology companies at the expense of smaller ones "patent trolls" are typically companies that buy patent rights from inventors then receive royalties from other companies who actually use the patents inventors get either a single payment or a share of the royalties in some cases trolls like other patent owners must go to court to enforce their patents and like any group some of them use abusive litigation against large technology companies in the hopes of extorting settlements but large technology companies often "troll" themselves using their own portfolio of thousands if not tens of thousands of patents to sue smaller firms financially unable to defend themselves and when the claims are unmerited or frivolous this is a rather convenient way to stifle competition thus it is right to end frivolous trolling but the right way is through narrow targeted reform unfortunately some reform proposals cast too wide a net and would hurt small technology companies ability to benefit from their own inventions first congress is considering proposals that would excessively limit the ability of small technology companies to amend pending patent applications known as "continuation" patents these patents however are a primary way that emerging technology companies protect themselves one invention can actually consist of tens of smaller inventions but it can be prohibitively costly for an emerging company to file patents covering all of them and sometimes the potential value of a component invention is not apparent until a market develops later thus limiting these patents too much would just reward copycats with resources and not the innovators second congress is considering greatly expanding the ability of large technology companies to challenge smaller companies patents even after they are issued as a witness testified a cheaper faster alternative to litigation for challenging the validity of patents would help eliminate the need to pay for many licenses this however is wrongheaded already well funded companies have proved their willingness to pile multiple challenges in multiple proceedings on smaller firms currently for example a large company can challenge a patent both in court and with the federal patent office forcing a small firm to fight on two fronts adding yet another battlefront would simply hurt smaller firms who are often pushed to the brink of bankruptcy defending their rights without ensuring greater justice finally these and other proposed reforms would materially increase the costs of filing for patents this could devastate emerging companies which pour all of their resources into the tools and people needed to turn their ideas into products they often are not patent savvy or cannot afford the huge expense of filing good patents to fully appreciate how vulnerable emerging companies can be keep in mind that patents can cost anywhere from &# to &# in silicon valley the price for a good quality patent is about &# does it seem absurd that these relatively small sums could stand in the way of emerging companies ask yourself whether don hewlett or steve jobs could have afforded the patents necessary to protect themselves if their filing and litigation costs surged at the same time a larger company sent lawyers to their garage doors by weakening the patent system congress would harm the ability for smaller companies to benefit from their innovations if they cannot reap these benefits they will not have the money to invest in commercializing their innovations and bringing them to market and without that money they will be unable to invest in other new products and technology meaning that innovation could become the purview of a few large companies with big budgets there is however a reason why so many advances come from garages living rooms and basements large companies do not have as much freedom to pursue creativity to where it might lead them emerging companies however often begin as research and development firms who only later try to generate revenue to help them reach the critical mass so that they can become true manufacturers so when you hear about patent trolls think of segway inventors of the two wheeled self balancing transportation device think of andre pavel the inventor of the walkman personal stereo and yes think of h p and apple decades ago they each were at the forefront cutting edge technology and had to defend and assert their patents to become what they are today ms peter is general counsel of immersion corporation and recently served on a judicial committee on patent litigation reform in texas
