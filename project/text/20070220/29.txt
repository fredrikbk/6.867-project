crude reality soaring energy use puts oil squeeze on iran there is less to export as consumers learn to love appliances cars ahvaz iran iran sits on one tenth of the worlds known oil supplies but is using so much energy these days it may start rationing gasoline as soon as next month part of the reason lies with people such as year old seyd jessem moosavi no one in mr moosavis family had an automobile when he was growing up he was the first to buy one followed quickly by his father now all five of his brothers have cars and mr moosavi just bought one for his year old son he also recently opened a car wash where he stood on a recent afternoon in this southern iranian city directing customers from the busy street to his corps of young scrubbers "with no car wash in the neighborhood and more and more cars i thought this would be good " he said mr moosavis booming new business underscores one of the biggest challenges facing iran today as the country has grown wealthier selling oil and gas iranians have themselves become large consumers of energy government subsidies which make energy nearly free to consumers and businesses stoke the demand further at the same time a combination of western sanctions and iranian policies has discouraged foreign investment in oil fields causing production to stagnate the result irans oil exports could dry up in as little as a decade according to some who have studied the situation thats a looming disaster for iran which derives about of its export income from the sale of oil "the industry is in a crisis " says mehdi varzi a former iranian diplomat and national oil company official who heads a london based consulting company varzi energy the impact would be felt far beyond iran the country produced million barrels of oil a day in almost of the worlds total supply according to the organization of petroleum exporting countries it exported an average of about million barrels of that each day should those sales decline irans largest customers japan and china would scramble for other supplies pushing up prices for everyone avoiding an export squeeze is one reason iran argues it needs to consider nuclear energy but that ambition has contributed to a diplomatic impasse with the west bush administration officials describe irans nuclear program as little more than a ruse to conceal what they say is a hidden effort to build nuclear weapons iranian officials deny that arguing that nuclear plants could handle some of the soaring domestic energy demand leaving more oil and gas to export and avoiding difficult domestic choices indeed several other middle east countries including egypt and the worlds largest oil exporter saudi arabia also are investigating nuclear energy programs citing similar reasons irans energy woes could make it more vulnerable to international economic sanctions say officials from the u s and other countries who favor strengthening the set of punishments the united nations security council has placed on the country even many iranian officials concede that the longstanding ban the u s has placed on american oil companies working in iran has hampered the countrys ability to develop its oil fields adequately others however suggest that sanctions can also make it easier for the iranian regime to blame outsiders for the disruptions that solving the problem could entail once seen as little more than a giant petrol station to the world middle eastern oil suppliers are now becoming some of the largest consumers of energy anywhere they are attempting to diversify their economies often by encouraging energy thirsty industries such as refineries and processing of metals like aluminum meanwhile record numbers of young people are growing up and establishing households already the middle east and north africas population of some million consumes almost as much oil as billion chinese iran where a huge population bulge is reaching adulthood is confronting the export crunch earlier and more acutely than others iran already consumes more oil than all but other countries on earth according to the international energy agency which monitors the world energy market in iranians used the equivalent of of the oil they pumped from the ground exporting the rest last year they used in irans natural gas industry the pinch has already begun although iran has of the worlds gas reserves the country imported more than it exported in in january iran briefly cut off gas exports to turkey as the iranian government struggled with a surge in domestic use during a stretch of cold weather irans leaders are keenly aware of these problems but in recent years theyve avoided making difficult choices as global oil prices climbed export revenues rose even as the amount of oil exported has remained steady or even fallen nonetheless the situation is already wreaking havoc with the governments budget iran subsidizes most energy including gasoline diesel and many other refined products consumers and businesses alike benefit overall energy subsidies cost the government as much as &# billion equivalent to almost a quarter of the countrys entire economic output according to bijan zanganeh a former iranian oil minister that spending is fanning inflation in the broader economy "its unacceptable and it cant continue " he says yet in ahvaz its clear that pushing oil and gas production higher and demand lower wont be easy khuzestan province the center of the countrys energy industry already generates of irans electricity but thats not enough to keep electricity flowing here in the provincial capital all the time residents of the city whose population has grown by one third in the past decade to million are packing more people into the warrens of apartment blocks within the older city center and theyre also moving into new housing sprouting up all around the fringes of the city meanwhile inexpensive consumer appliances have flooded the country in recent years from low cost manufacturing bases like china and turkey even young couples of modest means can now afford new refrigerators air conditioners and microwave ovens better off ones buy the luxury items blenders juicers egg cookers and coffee makers that fill an ever widening number of shops in the heart of the citys traditional bazaar the appliance section alone now takes up two city blocks side by side with vendors displaying barrels of pistachios and dates and clothing "financially im able to afford it now " says vahid javadi a year old schoolteacher shopping in the bazaar for a washing machine with his wife ibrahim marwani a year old electrician spends most of his workdays trying to upgrade rickety old electrical wiring for customers "these days they want to overhaul everything " he says he had to redo the wiring in his own house he says to keep up with the growing need for power as hes purchased two refrigerators two televisions a stereo dvd player and two air conditioners that "run around the clock" during summer days when temperatures regularly reach degrees some of the middle easts first oil came from wells not far from ahvaz starting in when persias british overseers began drilling operations in the nearby desert ever since khuzestan province has been the center of irans ascent to the ranks of the worlds top oil producers under the regime of the last shah mohammad reza pahlavi iranian oil production reached million barrels per day in five years before the revolution ushered in ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and the islamic republic that rules the country today oil production crashed as the turmoil of the revolution segued into an eight year war with next door neighbor iraq oil fields and refineries were bombed and crucial maintenance ignored by the early s only about million barrels per day were being pumped from the ground ahvaz and the nearby port and refining centers of abadan and khorramshar were especially hard hit saddam husseins iraqi forces invaded khorramshar and shelled ahvaz and abadan many residents fled when the war ended in the cities were key to an intense program pushed along by national desperation to get the countrys oil industry back on its feet in abadan one of the countrys largest refineries largely destroyed by iraqi shelling was slowly brought back into operation it still only processes about half the barrels a day of crude it did at its prerevolutionary peak but residents of the city still point to that comeback with pride since it was accomplished with very little foreign capital or expertise oil production also climbed back to close to million barrels a day in the late s those comebacks which were achieved with little outside assistance helped the clerical government in tehran consolidate its power but many of irans producing oil fields are now old and overall could be losing production of as much as barrels a day each year that shortfall has to be made up with new production or the countrys overall oil output will fall yet to keep up exports iran will also have to keep ahead of iranians own thirst for gas and oil which is growing at a double digit pace so far it is losing the race much of the problem is waste a recent study by a parliamentary committee said that of the countrys electricity is lost before it even reaches consumers due to rickety infrastructure corruption and mismanagement but an even bigger problem is the consumers themselves thats because subsidies make energy practically free in iran discouraging any serious energy conservation gasoline for example costs about cents a gallon at the pump thats encouraged an explosion of use as iranians add new cars while continuing to use fuel guzzling old models it has also encouraged a brisk smuggling trade as iranians buy millions of gallons of fuel at the subsidized price and truck them into neighboring pakistan turkey afghanistan and iraq for sale at market rates demand has now far outstripped the countrys refinery capacity the government has shelled out at least &# billion on gasoline imports alone so far this fiscal year which ends in march much of that money was drawn from the countrys rainy day oil surplus fund which is supposed to be used only on capital projects or during periods when global oil prices are low next year if nothing is done to change the situation the bill could top &# billion government officials have warned so plans to begin rationing fuel are being drawn up but the government nixed a similar initiative last year for fear of a political backlash this time president mahmoud ahmadinejad says the government is serious about cutting back consumption though he acknowledged recently its politically impossible to get rid of subsidies and raise pump prices the to that would require anytime soon in ahvaz gasoline quotas arent likely to win the government many fans "im concerned " says year old taxi driver farzad mesbinia adding that he heard that if rations are imposed he would be limited to gallons of subsidized gasoline a day "with that i cant get by " he says as he inches his cab forward in two long queues at a busy gas station here to alleviate these problems and the looming export squeeze the government has also embarked on a massive plan to try to boost oil and gas production but there are problems with both initiatives the azadegan oil field located about an hours drive west of ahvaz near the border with iraq underscores some of them the field discovered in the late s is among the largest deposits in the world it holds about billion barrels of oil and could one day produce as much as barrels a day iranian officials estimate its the kind of field u s oil majors would be keen to help develop were it not for u s government sanctions on iran preventing them from participating in iran signed a deal to allow a japanese company inpex to take a stake in the field and develop it but for years the project remained stalled by the need to remove land mines left from the war the u s also urged japan behind the scenes to scale back its involvement in the project as irans confrontation with the international community over its nuclear program has escalated after years of dispute between the iranians and japanese over why the project wasnt proceeding inpexs stake was cut to last year management of the project was handed over to an iranian company the upshot little progress has been made in getting the oil out of the ground and without significant new foreign participation thats unlikely to change according to many observers inside and outside irans oil industry overall industry officials estimate between &# billion and &# billion is needed to get irans oil production back on track adding refinery capacity in hopes of cutting fuel imports has proved an equally tough slog although the iranian government has now allotted &# billion to the task of building three new refineries and boosting the capacity of the existing ones including the one in abadan in addition to that the government has taken the unprecedented step of allowing some private entrepreneurs to step into the energy game jamal hayat is hoping to take advantage of that opening born in ahvaz mr hayat moved with his parents to tehran as a youth he calls khuzestan province "the ideal place" for a &# billion refinery and electrical power plant he and his brother who was born in abadan are trying to build between the two cities of their births "this is the province of black gold " says mr hayat five years after the brothers approached tehran officials for permission to build the refinery however the planned site for the plant remains a fallow field in the desert the hayat brothers now hope to complete construction in a year bhushan bahree contributed to this article
