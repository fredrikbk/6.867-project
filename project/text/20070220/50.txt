geithners balancing act the feds go to man for financial crises takes on hedge funds the federal reserves mission to prevent financial system meltdowns once was relatively straightforward it watched over banks through which most of the nations money flowed the feds job is a lot trickier now much of the nations borrowing and lending is done outside its jurisdiction via securities dealers derivative traders bond markets hedge funds and private equity firms having extended well beyond ordinary deposits and loans regulated banks routinely do business with those less regulated players thats the challenge facing timothy geithner president of the federal reserve bank of new york since his solution work with other regulators to scrutinize all market players and then use persuasion and threat to unite the finance industry behind the common goal of minimizing systemic risks "one of the things that was obvious when i started this job was that the role of banks had changed dramatically as had the nature of the way credit markets worked " mr geithner says "you could not do your job without spending a lot more time and effort staying on top of these broader changes " the fed chairman in washington runs monetary policy but the nations financial markets are centered in new york so the president of that fed bank often has been the unofficial go to man for crises from the stock market crash to the near failure of long term capital management mr geithner has solidified that role both fed chairman ben bernanke and treasury secretary henry paulson seek his advice about new risks posed by hedge funds mr geithners task is a balancing act he has an influential bully pulpit but cant appear to invade the turf of other regulators many overseas and every move he makes to minimize perils on his turf might drive them to less regulated corners of the market his approach is now being tested last summer his staff examined major u s banks lending to hedge funds which cater to deep pocketed individuals and institutions and use borrowed money to make often risky bets on stocks interest rates corporate credit worthiness and currencies mr geithner was troubled by things they found though risk management had improved since the ltcm crisis some collateral or margin requirements were remarkably loose he concluded that a minor shock could spiral into a crisis he imagined the result in a september speech in hong kong "as financial firms demand more collateral funds are forced to liquidate positions adding to volatility and pushing down asset prices leading to more margin calls " around the same time the hedge fund amaranth advisors was losing billions of dollars on natural gas trades mr geithner determined that was unlikely to trigger a downward spiral its bets werent widely copied and most were on regulated commodity exchanges not the over the counter market amaranth "was more a th than a st century financial crisis " mr geithner says nonetheless he expanded his inquiry into hedge fund borrowing officials from the new york fed and other u s and european regulators in december questioned four european banks two u s banks and three u s securities dealers the regulators shared their findings with the firms in hopes they would learn what their peers considered to be state of the art risk management the real test will be whether the firms accept tougher steps some agree that competitive pressures have reduced margin requirements but say new rules arent needed others say lower collateral is a legitimate and safe way to win business regulators "have not reached agreement on what to do " mr geithner says mr geithner was raised in africa and asia the son of an international development official he joined the treasury as a career staffer in he advanced under clinton treasury secretaries robert rubin and lawrence summers who liked his analytical ability and his willingness to disagree "hes the only guy that would walk in and say on this one larry youre full of it " mr summers says at treasury and later at the international monetary fund mr geithner helped formulate responses to financial crises in mexico thailand korea and turkey he wasnt an obvious choice to run the new york fed predecessors were bankers economists or fed insiders not mr geithner now years old nor did his youthful appearance project their gravitas investment banker pete peterson led the search for a successor to william mcdonough the previous new york fed president mr rubin recommended mr geithner mr rubin recalls that after meeting mr geithner mr peterson reported back "hes years old " mr peterson recalls only remarking that he looked young mr rubin assured mr peterson that his candidate was "sophisticated" and "deeply experienced " after mr geithner got the &# a year job he grilled staffers on the thinking behind fed rules "walk me through how we decide whats enough capital in the system " he asked they explained that international regulators decided in the late s that banks should generally set aside of their assets not because that was how much was needed to withstand a crisis but because it was the most banks could set aside in their then weakened condition mr geithner pressed will it be enough in the future it had been enough so far his staff responded but they were nervous such socratic debates were common when mr geithner worked for messrs rubin and summers some find the exercises invigorating others frustrating to some mr geithner seemed to prefer debating a question over reaching a decision mr geithner often seems to be trying to avoid tying himself down his speeches warn against complacency on the trade deficit inflation hedge fund leverage and even income inequality but seldom specify what should be done and they can be harder to interpret than the famously opaque remarks of former fed chairman alan greenspan mr geithners hong kong talk in september led some to conclude that he backed regulating hedge funds others disagreed he was only "teeing up issues for debate " says jack gaine head of the managed funds association trade group nonetheless he quips it read like "a textbook on biochemistry " mr geithner defends his style "most consequential choices involve shades of gray and some fog is often useful in getting things done " the model for mr geithners approach was his effort to fix problems with credit derivatives which act as insurance policies against corporate defaults barely in existence a decade ago they now make up a multitrillion dollar market in mid the new york fed and britains financial services authority discovered widespread problems in the market with mr geithners support an industry task force headed by former new york fed president gerald corrigan urged steps to fix the mess in july mr geithner then approached leading firms to develop a strategy at a london airport that fall he happened upon michael alix bear stearns &amp co s risk management chief mr geithner asked him if wall street had a "collective action problem" one that nobody would address unless their competitors did too mr alix agreed that was the case regulators then summoned industry leaders to a meeting and demanded action they agreed to a series of targets and deadlines to clear up the mess in september they reported progress "he managed to move the industry to do things that are in the interest of long term financial stability without prescribing how to do that " says mr alix "to my knowledge it hasnt been done except in times of crisis " mending the credit derivatives mess was in some ways easy because everybody agreed on the solution that may not be the case with hedge fund borrowing "its easier to say collateral looks uncomfortably thin than to say whats enough " mr geithner says
