the afternoon report supreme business online edition the nations highest court reined in juries inclined to make a statement by slapping misbehaving companies with huge punitive damages awards in a decision that further curbs a phenomenon that business advocates say had spun out of control the supreme court in a ruling for altria groups philip morris threw out a &# million punitive damages award granted to a smokers widow by a jury in oregon writing for the majority justice stephen breyer said the award must be overturned because the jury hadnt been instructed that it could punish philip morris only for the harm done to the plaintiff in the case and not for the broader harm that the company might have caused to the general population of smokers justice breyer said that punitive damages awards driven by a desire to punish a corporation for harm to individuals not involved in a particular lawsuit amounts to a taking of property that flouts due process "to permit punishment for injuring a non party victim would add a near standardless dimension to the punitive damages equation " he wrote "the fundamental due process concerns to which our punitive damages cases refer risks of arbitrariness uncertainty and lack of notice will be magnified " the opinion amounts to a victory for businesses and other advocates who have been trying to bring what they say is a badly needed measure of reason to jury awards critics argue that a trend toward whopping punitive damages awards is a grave threat to businesses which could be pulled under the waves if juries attempt to punish firms for issues not argued in a particular lawsuit the justices didnt opine on whether the award in the oregon case was itself excessive since the justices found the punishment standard employed in the case to be incorrect they said they had no legal avenue to rule on the size of the award nonetheless the ruling builds more momentum toward curtailing the amount of money juries dish out to plaintiffs todays ruling adds to a case involving insurance giant state farm where the court ruled that punitive damages should generally come to no more than nine times the size of actual damages the
