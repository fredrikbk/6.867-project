in new orleans black clubs try mardi gras revival with membership down parades are a struggle zulus sell sponsorships new orleans cherice harrison nelson plans to mark mardi gras today by donning a bead encrusted suit and winding her way through the streets as part of a "tribe " the procession extends a tradition dating back to at least the s when african americans began masquerading here to show respect for native americans who once hid runaway slaves before hurricane katrina hit the guardians of the flame tribe often marched with at least a dozen extended family members and friends but this year ms harrison nelson a year old elementary school teacher will be joined by just two other marchers the substitute "chief" will be year old kevin cooley jr standing in for a man who decided not to attend this year because of illness and money problems this year mardi gras "is not necessarily what id like it to be but it is what it is " ms harrison nelson says sewing an emerald green bead smaller than a grain of rice onto a costume after the storm flooded her home ms harrison nelson lived in hotels as carnival season culminates today with organized parades in new orleans and nearby communities some black social groups are struggling to bring back their version of mardi gras many members still are scattered across the country wrestling with insurance claims bureaucracy and memories that are hard to reconcile with katrinas devastation others who have returned are too broke or worn out from the past months to deal with floats and costumes "we didnt want to put that burden on our members " says lionel hicks former president of the krewe of claude a largely black organization in slidell la which decided not to parade this year parading would have cost the members roughly &# to &# each for beads doubloons and pecans the groups signature trinket to throw to the crowd mr hicks still needs furniture for his fixed up house to outsiders new orleanss ability to celebrate one of its most important cultural traditions has become a barometer of how far the city has come in its recovery since the deluge of aug but mardi gras also has become a reminder of how differently white and black new orleans are rebounding from the hurricane while katrina battered residents of every race and income level some largely white neighborhoods like lakeview are gaining momentum as relatively affluent homeowners rebuild their houses and even buy neglected properties nearby to speed the recovery process progress is much slower in black areas such as new orleans east a middle class neighborhood and the lower ninth ward where more than a third of pre katrina residents lived below the poverty line thousands of public housing units remain closed in new orleans there are a variety of mardi gras celebrations there are big parades with floats organized by private membership clubs called krewes there are walking clubs whose members often march together in themed costumes and there are mardi gras indians most of them black known for wearing flamboyant feathery costumes while drumming and dancing in poor neighborhoods tourists usually dont see during all of mardi gras there will be parades this season up from in new orleans had carnival parades in attendance is expected to improve from last years about a third of pre katrina levels the citys current population is roughly estimated at down from few lingering signs of the storm remain along the primary parade route in largely white uptown except spray painted rescue markings and the mostly idle streetcar line on st charles avenue only of the citys roughly mardi gras indian tribes participated last year and the number is likely to grow only slightly today says joyce marie jackson a louisiana state university professor who has studied the groups for more than a decade in new orleans black mardi gras climaxes in a raucous "under the bridge" celebration on fat tuesday in a rough section of the city beneath an interstate overpass that gathering last year attracted thousands of people who came to dance and reconnect with friends six months after the storm last week bruce "sunpie" barnes a year old musician was power sanding the new floor in his two story house in the broadmoor neighborhood of new orleans he pulled out a skeleton suit that he wore last year when he hit the streets as part of the north side skull and bone gang at about a m warning about guns and drugs "keep living like that you got to come see us " went one song as much as he cherishes mardi gras mr barnes needed a break from the slog of post katrina life so instead he has traveled with his wife and children to suquamish wash where he is playing a gig with his band the louisiana sunspots "i have a family i have to take care of " he says the zulu social aid and pleasure club stages the citys oldest predominantly black carnival parade which goes near the french quarter this year the club is expecting one of the highest turnouts in its year history a big boost is coming from a move they made last year to sell sponsorships for &# apiece to ride in zulus parade says zulu board member lester pollard jr buyers get a costume including frizzy wig turtleneck and grass skirt and a spot on a float the parades total price tag is likely to hit several hundred thousand dollars ten zulu members died during katrina many of the several hundred pre katrina members arent in new orleans anymore and probably wont come back for mardi gras says david belfield a zulu member for years he lives in a federal emergency management agency trailer near his gutted house in the gentilly neighborhood mr belfield sued unsuccessfully to halt last years parade complaining it was too soon for a big party "were in a little bit better shape " he says but "its a hard life being here " jaime cooper part of a mardi gras indian tribe called the white eagles hoped to make a suit that could be worn over his wheelchair known as "loco " he is living in a fema trailer and suffering from bedsores that will keep him out of the celebration "we thought wed be able to get things fixed up and get back to our old lives" by now he says mardi gras indian tradition calls for a new costume every year so ms harrison nelson has been sewing until midnight to finish the three suits needed for this mornings procession katrina destroyed her supply of beads including some from her late father who organized the tribe in participating in mardi gras is more than a party for her "people who want to mask like me they mask from a place that is very deep in their soul " she says "you make sacrifices in your relationships your financial obligations " this year ms harrison nelson and the two children who are joining her will be wearing white to symbolize rebirth they plan to visit a section of louis armstrong park where enslaved blacks were allowed to socialize the cemetery where her father is buried and a bayou used as an indian passageway the last stop her new house built by habitat for humanity she picked up the keys thursday
