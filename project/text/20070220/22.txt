chinese takeout foreign investment has been a motor of chinas growth flowing into more than half a million mainland enterprises and accounting for &# billion in asset value now the balance of investment is set to shift in the other direction china will deploy its accumulated assets abroad to secure resources needed for future growth making that nation an even greater driver of the world economy under plausible assumptions and with adjustments to bring reported figures closer to the actual underlying flows we project that chinas outward direct investment odi will overtake fdi inflows as early as official figures show a rapid increase of odi to &# billion last year a increase over latest statistics split odi between to asia to latin america each to north america and africa to europe and roughly to australia and new zealand but the official total substantially understates the actual flows since it includes only overseas investment carried out by chinese registered firms and not odi channeled through offshore registered chinese entities especially via hong kong taking such unreported flows into account actual chinese odi may be higher according to a recent calculation by deutsche bank this would produce a figure of &# billion one major factor boosting odi in the next five years will be chinas continuing quest for raw materials and energy a quest led by major state owned enterprises the deals produced are typically large often more than &# billion given chinas ample cash hoard these agreements and acquisitions are likely to grow in number and size news that china is setting up a state investment agency with up to &# billion of the countrys international reserves for diversification abroad highlight the momentum behind this investment push as for smaller deals these are often channeled through overseas subsidiaries where financing is much easier to arrange than in china energy deals include investments in iran kazakhstan venezuela and russia while lenovo bought ibms personal computer business in britain apart from the deal with the rover motor company chinese firms have made investments in london and in northeast england as odi grows so too will the nature of fdi change last autumn as the inflow touched &# billion beijing released new policy blueprints on the role of foreign capital in chinas growth strategy with ever higher trade surpluses and international reserve levels beijings leadership is aware that the economic policy context is changing dramatically business as usual is no longer a viable policy option burgeoning surpluses are transforming policy priorities across the board subsidies are giving way to targeted incentives to attract foreign capital into priority sectors and regions the leadership wants more "quality" investment rather than the quantitative approach of the past as a result chinas fdi inflows are likely to stabilize or even decline modestly under guidelines drawn up last autumn by the planning agency the national development and reform commission fdi will be required to respect tightened environmental guidelines and support coordinated regional development in the booming coastal areas it will focus on high tech industries telecommunications and services especially banking and finance to support a modern financial sector and promote innovation including technology communications appropriate legal environment and education but this does not mean as some commentators have assumed that chinas open door policy for fdi will be overtaken by economic nationalism the red carpet will just be rolled out on a more selective basis since china has no need for inflows of money the challenge for policy makers will be to target remaining subsidies in an intelligent way minimizing ad hoc political meddling while limiting the market distortions that inevitably ensue meanwhile it is important to realize that fdi is not quite what it appears it is becoming apparent that a sizeable proportion of this investment capital is not foreign at all rather it is money that arises from within china itself that does a "round trip" out to hong kong and tax havens before returning home in the guise of overseas investment that qualifies for tax breaks not available to domestic investors however the government has already approved a draft bill to abolish the preferential tax rate for fdi it is expected to come into law in march and becoming effective at the beginning of there will be a uniform rate instead of the rate for fdi and for domestic firms this change in tax treatment should help weed out some low value added fdi whose contribution to chinas economic development is debatable once environmental and social infrastructure costs are taken into account it will also discourage "round tripping" in search of tax breaks while both factors should depress official fdi figures the overall quality of the investments should rise regionalism will remain strong with provincial governments encouraging pet projects but the increasing marginalization of the "shanghai faction " which dominated the leadership under former president jiang zemin has enhanced prospects that authorities around the country will fall in line when beijing sends detailed policy guidelines in the future rather than going their own way to attract foreign investment regardless of how it fits into national planning the presidents steady process of appointing trusted associates to key provincial posts will also help in this respect though how far beijing holds sway over the fastest growing region guangdong must still be open to question as its capital investment outflows overtake its inflows in the next five years china will become the fifth largest global foreign investing nation behind the united states britain germany and japan this prospect will to put it mildly take some getting use to as will the leveling off or even decline of incoming investment capital at a minimum the prospect of this change raises the question of how the leading players in the global economy the u s europe and japan will react if the past is any guide global financial markets will happily welcome this potential new client with seemingly unbounded needs for financial services of every kind but the politics of chinas emergence will undoubtedly prove much more complicated balancing the shifting positions of power and interdependency in the global economic arena will guarantee a challenging future for international policy makers for some time to come messrs brainard and
