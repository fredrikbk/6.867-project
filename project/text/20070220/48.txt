for investors strong enough is good enough economic sweet spot gives just the right lift to keep stocks climbing it is the kind of surprise investors love to get the economy seems to be just a little stronger than most people expected not enough to worry anyone just enough to push stocks higher data on items such as fourth quarter economic growth and consumer spending have come in a tad better than markets expected late last year as a result the dow jones industrial average has continued its steady rise and stocks that do better in a strong economy have been among the leaders the dow jones transportation average which sagged late last year amid worries about an economic slowdown has become a leader again smaller stocks which depend more than big ones on the ups and downs of the economy are back on the rise with middle size stocks among the big gainers the mood is downright bullish "the economy is operating in a very sweet spot " says david kotok president of money management firm cumberland advisors in vineland n j which manages &# million in stocks and bonds amid solid growth with minimal inflation world wide the worlds stock markets are feeding on one anothers success "with a little bit of good news the surprise could be that they could work their way a lot higher " mr kotok says that kind of optimism has powered stocks higher since july skeptics who have been wrong so far point out that things look so good that it would be hard for them to get better few money managers see signs of any serious trouble and that is a disquieting sign of complacency to some of the most skeptical investors some predict small gains some predict big gains some predict small declines but almost no one sees a big decline on the horizon investors have heard such warnings for months now and by and large they have ignored them to their profit some see the sweet spot continuing for months or even years with the economy resilient and the inflation rate moderate if the skeptics are right it would be time for a pullback neither the dow industrials nor the standard &amp poors stock index has seen as much as a pullback from a high since july the longest period without such a pullback since the markets are getting "positively giddy " says russ koesterich senior portfolio manager at barclays global investors in san francisco he sees a pullback coming "you have to question whether for the short term this is a good time to be putting money to work " he says he worries that because of the economys strength inflation could pick up that could force the federal reserve to raise interest rates higher rates hurt corporate profits by raising costs for businesses and consumers and a fed rate increase could send major indexes down or more he says so he likes "defensive" stocks such as those of health care and household products companies whose steady businesses keep them stable in most economic and market conditions he likes european stocks he worries that smaller u s stocks among the big gainers could fall harder than large ones on any bad news because they are more volatile and more dependent on good economic news janna sampson director of portfolio management at oakbrook investments in lisle ill adds that inflation has remained tame in part because oil prices fell back last fall from summer highs if they stay down inflation probably will remain under control and the fed probably can avoid raising interest rates she says she thinks that is likely the risk is that no one including the experts is very good at predicting the price of oil "i dont think the fed has a much better handle than i do on oil prices " ms sampson says she is focusing her investments on companies that will be able to pass on higher prices in case inflation stays high such as waste management inc and automatic data processing inc she says she doesnt think the market will stay tranquil "i think we are going to have a lot of volatility based on what people think the fed will do and how fast the economy is growing and what oil prices are doing " she says although she says she thinks broad indexes will finish the year higher there are some investors who think the economy may be less robust than it appears they point to the most recent data late last week showing consumer confidence housing starts retail sales and industrial production all a bit weaker than expected they think a less robust economy would be good news because it could induce the fed to cut interest rates later this year to give the economy a lift interest rate futures markets show investors once again pushing up the odds that the fed will cut rates later this year lower rates would help stocks just as higher rates would hurt that kind of scenario supports "this kind of placid low volatility upward drifting market " says jeffrey kleintop chief investment strategist at pnc wealth management the investment advisory arm of pnc bank in pittsburgh so he isnt buying into the recent gains in stocks of companies that would benefit from a strong economy he prefers some areas that didnt rise as much last year such as health care and technology stocks which he thinks could catch up some managers add that if u s growth turns out to be softer than it has appeared foreign stocks could continue to do better than u s stocks especially some of the foreign markets that havent soared of late "we like places like hong kong and japan that have lagged behind " as well as some markets in continental europe suggests max darnell chief investment officer at first quadrant in pasadena calif which oversees &# billion in investments
