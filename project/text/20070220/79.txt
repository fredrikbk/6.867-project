politics &amp economics a twofold approach to tehran u s s strategy in and outside iran runs the risk of backlash as irans power in the middle east grows the bush administration is pursuing a two pronged strategy of directly challenging tehran in places such as iraq and lebanon while seeking to exploit fissures believed to be emerging in irans social and political systems the strategy includes military movements to underscore american resolve as well as financial pressure to drive a wedge between irans leaders and the countrys merchants friday the treasury department announced sanctions on three iranian energy companies u s officials say the strategy isnt designed to court a war still it is fraught with risks iran could misread or overreact to some american moves strategists at the pentagon say u s attempts to target iranian agents operating inside iraq could stoke a larger response from tehrans paramilitary forces such as the iranian revolutionary guard corps there are signs this escalating pressure is having some effect on iran and opening opportunities for advancement in u s foreign policy whether containing irans nuclear ambitions or underpinning a democratically elected government in lebanon but rather than seeking a quick fix to the contest against iran bush administration officials say they are bracing for a long struggle to curb tehrans influence in the region "we are convinced that sooner or later the costs will be so high that they the iranians will have to come to the negotiating table " said nicholas burns the state departments point man on iran "i dont believe a conflict with iran is inevitable weve got time " u s efforts to confront iran are driven by decade old fears that the islamic republic will seek to export its anti american revolutionary doctrine across the middle east irans growing influence in the region also could further embolden islamist militias like hezbollah and hamas fighting israel and imperil u s access to mideast energy reserves many middle east analysts are skeptical about the bush administrations ability to induce political change in iran siding with saddam hussein in the iran iraq war washington further radicalized iranian society while strengthening iraqs despot attempts by the reagan and clinton administrations to reach out to relative moderates in iran resulted in diplomatic frustrations and political embarrassments u s officials mapping the emerging strategy toward iran have depicted a security posture that in many ways echoes the containment washington employed against the soviet union during the cold war this entails confronting pro iranian groups wherever they operate in the world while using economic and military tools to undermine the government in tehran the administration has sought to stoke internal opposition to president mahmoud ahmadinejad by increasingly choking off his countrys ties to the global economy white house officials say tehrans business and clerical elite are increasingly at odds with the iranian presidents confrontational stance toward the international community on issues like irans nuclear program and israels right to exist and they fear his stance could isolate them internationally the treasury is moving to exert more pressure on tehran by imposing financial sanctions on three iranian companies allegedly involved in supporting tehrans nuclear program the policy prohibits u s companies from doing business with the three firms which are all owned by the atomic energy organization of iran and freezes any assets they may have in the u s u s officials say these measures underpin a wider push by the international community to impose financial penalties through the united nations on iranian companies and individuals believed to be aiding tehrans alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons jitters in irans financial markets and the poor showing of candidates associated with mr ahmadinejad in recent iranian elections are fueling optimism within the bush administration that such measures are starting to have an impact u s officials also point to recent editorials in iranian state owned newspapers criticizing many of the iranian presidents policies "this is not a monolithic government" in iran mr burns said last week in a speech at the brookings institution a washington think tank disaffected ethnic groups are stoking opposition to the government last week an ethnic baluchi separatist group claimed responsibility for bombing a bus carrying revolutionary guard cadres in the eastern province of sistan baluchistan tehran had originally blamed the attack on the u s while washington has denied involvement some u s officials say the u s should exploit irans ethnic fissures to restrain tehran ethnic kurd turk and arab minorities have historically opposed irans largely persian central government the largest potential flashpoint between iran and the u s remains iraq president bush pledged to increase efforts to choke off what he says is irans funneling of munitions and arms to shiite militias there critics say the white house is overstating irans involvement in iraqs discord potentially to blame tehran for some u s setbacks senior bush administration officials say drawing redlines in iraq is crucial to blunting tehrans ambitions throughout the region elsewhere in the middle east the u s and its allies have intensified proxy battles against iran in recent weeks in lebanon the u s and saudi arabia have increased economic and military aid to the government of prime minister fuad siniora to ward off efforts by hezbollah lebanons radical shiite group which is backed by iran to grab more power the bush administration has also increased aid to the palestinian authority and its leader mahmoud abbas in a bid to blunt the power of iranian funded hamas critics of the bush administrations iran strategy say successes may prove short lived u s efforts to arrest or kill iranian agents in iraq could fuel a backlash by iranian backed shiite groups in iraq and other countries and potentially spark a wider middle east war they say pushing for the removal of mr ahmadinejad the iranian president meanwhile is unlikely to significantly moderate irans positions many iran experts say for one the presidents popularity could rise if washington is seen as overtly trying to topple him many other iranian officials have voiced a commitment to maintaining irans nuclear program and irans broader society is seen to be behind it
