enlightened self interest pakistan wants a stable prosperous afghanistan in regard to said t jawads feb editorial page commentary "the taliban in pakistan" and the feb editorial "taliban spring" pakistan subscribes to the view of mr jawad the ambassador of afghanistan to the u s that strengthening the traditional leadership in the tribal areas and isolating the terrorists will bring peace security and prosperity to both countries talibanization is their common enemy and therefore should be fought tooth and nail jointly by both countries if indeed mr jawad and the afghan government are sincere then it will be more fruitful for them to talk to the pakistani government through institutional links rather resorting to the blame game passing blame for the ills of afghanistan to pakistan will certainly not help mr jawads assertion of "institutional support for extremism" is absolutely baseless when seen in the context of a recent spree of suicide bombings in pakistan including at islamabad airport by terrorists which killed army troops police officers and civilians how can pakistan support those who kill its citizens there is no doubt that the nexus between drugs and terrorism is a major contributor in escalating and sustaining insurgency in afghanistan a substantial amount of illicit drugs found in the world have their origin in afghanistan why have the coalition forces not been able to eliminate poppy cultivation in afghanistan there is no such thing as writ of the government in the vast territory of afghanistan and the afghan government is confined to kabul i agree that the increased strength of u s isaf international security assistance force troops will not only result in qualitative improvement in the security situation in the country but also reaffirm their resolve to take the taliban bull by the horns during the spring offensive pakistan has all along been advocating that afghanistan deserves more u s attention and troops to defeat the taliban also massive reconstruction is required to bring about improvement in the quality of life of the afghan people who are still in a state of disillusionment and despondency but i totally disagree that the north waziristan agreement has provided "taliban sanctuary in pakistans waziristan province and more than doubled the number of raids into afghanistan " nato and isaf have maintained that the incidence of violence has decreased in the adjoining areas of afghanistan during the past months gen david richards former nato commander during a tripartite commission meeting last month said that "military efforts of pakistan to contain insurgents on its territory had resulted in fewer attacks on the coalition forces fighting the taliban in afghanistan " there is no "abdicating of responsibility to control the border " not a single soldier has been withdrawn from the tribal areas as a result of a "truce " pakistan deployed troops to nab the taliban and al qaeda insurgents who fled into tribal areas when u s forces bombed afghanistan pakistan has established checkpoints as compared with on the other side manned by isaf nato afghan forces and pakistan has suffered more than casualties more than double those of of the coalition forces keeping in view the sensitivities of the international community and the human rights organizations pakistan has decided not to mine even selected areas of the border pakistan supports a stable prosperous and vibrant afghanistan because of guaranteed dividends for pakistans security and prosperity a stable afghanistan would allow us access to central asian republics pakistan also sees itself as a hub of economic communication and trade activity linking central asia south asia and west asia this dream can come true only when there is peace and stability in afghanistan m akram shaheedi press minister embassy of pakistan washington
