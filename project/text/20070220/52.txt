home depot tries to make nice to customers to stem exodus of shoppers retailer beefs up floor staff and refurbishes many stores john parsons of shreveport la owns a year old house that needs constant repair and for years he was a regular customer of a nearby home depot store about a year ago he switched to a lowes cos home improvement store even though it is farther from his house because he received better service there "the people at home depot dont want to talk to you " he says "they hide or they say theyre busy " home depot inc grew to become the worlds largest home improvement chain largely on the strength of its skilled workers many of whom were former plumbers electricians and carpenters who were eager to impart their knowledge to do it yourselfers they took pride in helping customers find just the right shade of latex paint or an elusive size screw but service began to slip over the past six years in order to cut costs the company started hiring more part timers and added a salary cap that drove off the more seasoned workers the retailer also moved about of workers to overnight stocking positions ostensibly to clear the aisles of clutter but it left customers searching in vain for someone in an orange apron to ask about picking out the proper power tool now as it attempts to ignite sluggish sales under a new chief executive home depot is trying to reverse a reputation for shoddy service under former chief executive robert nardelli who resigned jan home depot management focused on measuring all aspects of the stores productivity and too often ignored shoppers "we were busy writing reports instead of taking care of the customer " says shane moore manager of a home depot store in mesquite texas in the past year mr nardelli moved to improve the shopping experience the retailer spiffed up displays added workers and rewarded stores for improved customer service a customer satisfaction survey published today by the university of michigan indicates home depot narrowed the gap with lowes last year but home depot executives say they still have a long way to go customers can only hope home depot gets it right the atlanta based chain sells roughly &# billion of merchandise every year making it the no retailer in the country after wal mart stores inc but whereas a wal mart customer may be willing to accept indifferent service in the name of cheaper bananas or underwear a home depot customer attempting to fix that leaky sink has very different expectations last summer james mcavoy of ophelia va hired home depot to install sliding glass doors in a room in his house overlooking the chesapeake bay it turned into a nightmare that isnt over the subcontractor home depot hired installed the doors incorrectly and the room flooded ruining the carpet furniture is still strewn throughout the house as they wait to have the problem resolved "home depot just got too big too fast and took their eye off the ball " mr mcavoy says frank blake home depots new chief executive has made restoring home depots once vaunted customer service his no priority home depot announced last week that it was considering selling or spinning off its &# billion wholesale supply division in order to devote more attention to its home improvement stores mr blake will soon divulge just how much money he plans to devote to shoring up customer service and refurbishing the stores but many of the steps he plans to take already have been communicated to his troops mr blake repeatedly has told managers that the stores will be liberated from many of the time consuming mind numbing tasks the home office required them to do over the past six years under mr nardelli stores had to measure everything from how many pallets were removed from a truck per hour to how many extended warranties each employee sold per week "they are trying to get as many aprons on the floor as possible " says mr moore the manager of the texas store who was visited recently by a top home depot sales executive "we are not to let a customer go untouched " mr blake has reached out to the companys revered founders bernie marcus and arthur blank for help in reviving the companys customer service mr marcus recently spent eight hours with mr blake touring stores and has praised the new top executive nonetheless he believes mr blake has his work cut out for him "executive staff must spend more quality time in the stores and training programs must be reviewed reinstituted and implemented " mr marcus said in an email response to the wall street journal the company recently upped the number of training hours to six a month from four when mr nardelli arrived in december he inherited a company that had grown so fast that it lacked many of the systems and disciplines that other companies its size needed to ensure smooth operations he centralized merchandise ordering and improved store safety records for instance but as sales slowed mr nardelli attempted to control costs by cutting the number of full time workers in favor of part timers an unpopular move he reversed a short time later before long the company had a morale problem instead of waiting eagerly on customers workers too often would be found huddling in an aisle griping about management in the past year mr nardelli realized that he had shortchanged the stores he appointed a chief customer officer inside headquarters to improve customer service each week a team of home depot staffers scour up to customer surveys rating dozens of store qualities from the attentiveness of the sales help to the cleanliness of the aisles bruce wing a private chef and handyman from missouri city texas says home depot needs to bring back "knowledgeable salespeople who had been in the trades" instead of an inexperienced staff who dont know anything about the companys products or how to use them
