ahead of the tape after subprime lax lending lurks elsewhere investors who dabbled in subprime mortgages have learned that risk is a four letter word the lesson might need to be applied elsewhere before too long the shakeout in the subprime mortgage industry which caters to high risk borrowers claimed more victims last week resmae mortgage a brea calif lender said it was filing for bankruptcy protection and selling assets accredited home lenders holding reported a fourth quarter loss of &# million in part because it was forced to buy back nonperforming loans it had sold the week before subprime specialist new century financial said it expected to report a fourth quarter loss and restate results british bank hsbc holdings said its subprime business was even worse than thought hsbc in particular shows how lenders mismeasured risk hsbc assessed the financial health of borrowers using credit ratings known as fico scores now the bank acknowledges the scores werent a good predictor of the subprime fallout that ensued when housing was hot subprime mortgages seemed like a sure thing in the percentage of subprime mortgages on which payments were or more days late was at its lowest level since the economic boom of the late s according to research firm first american loanperformance the default rate has since soared could this happen to other borrowers mortgage lenders rely on fico scores for conventional mortgages too and easy money hasnt been limited to mortgages yields on junk bonds the debt of the least creditworthy companies have never been as low against comparable treasury yields as now the same is true of emerging market debt defaults on these bonds are low as they were in subprime a few years ago but how comforting should that be low returns on treasury bonds have left investors clamoring for risky assets with higher returns subprime mortgages were only one area that fed the desire during the boom mortgage originators relaxed standards coming up with exotic loans that made it easier to buy homes with little or no money down because they resold loans to financial institutions originators thought they would offset the risk because they owned such a broad swath of subprime mortgages that had been packaged diced and sliced into tradable securities many financial institutions and investors thought they would spread out their risk too now investors are forcing lenders to buy back some bad loans due to the early defaults the risk many thought they had offset has returned to haunt them what was surprising says ubss head of asset backed securities research thomas zimmerman is how soon after the housing market cooled so many subprime mortgages went south the downturn has been marked by an unexpectedly large number of "early defaults " for which borrowers stop paying shortly after getting their mortgages mr zimmerman sees "soft fraud" in the mix of defaults someone might take out a mortgage buy a home avoid payments and live rent free until the marshals come nobody seemed to realize the risks inherent in extending mortgages with loose standards that left borrowers with little skin in the game the question worth asking now where else has lax lending been going on if the answer is far and wide things could get uglier send comments to justin lahart wsj com
