future of chrysler rests with zetsche how daimler ceos view of u s unit has evolved embarrassing results last september after issuing an embarrassing profit warning daimlerchrysler ag chief executive dieter zetsche was asked in a conference call if hed consider selling the auto makers ailing chrysler group "i think the simple answer " mr zetsche replied "is no " within weeks however as the depth of chryslers troubles became evident the answer changed to maybe the company is now actively exploring a sale and working with bankers to prepare the detailed financial and operating data potential buyers will need to put a value on chrysler raising the prospect that the auto maker could auction off its u s unit in the coming months two people close to the matter said daimlerchrysler has already received several expressions of interest in chrysler from around the world since saying last week that it was considering "all options" to turn the unprofitable unit around these people said it is unclear what kind of price chrysler would command its value will depend on the details of operating contracts that would be negotiated with any buyer covering the sharing of platforms design and engineering services initial analyst estimates have ranged from billion euros to billion euros about &# billion to &# billion although a few have suggested it has no value because of its mounting loses and burdensome union contracts and any sale or spinoff is likely to be a complicated transaction that would unfold over several months yet the fate of chrysler may not be determined by its value but by the personal conviction of mr zetsche at least some top executives at daimlerchryslers stuttgart germany headquarters are determined to try to sell chrysler or spin it off to existing shareholders rather than restructure it again one of those close to the matter said so far mr zetsche hasnt yet indicated his preference a third person close to daimlerchryslers top management said a daimlerchrysler spokesman reiterated that the company is looking at "all options" and declined to comment further a former mercedes engineer mr zetsche has a close connection to chrysler and the detroit area he ran chrysler from until and pulled off a surprising but ultimately short lived turnaround although he slashed jobs and closed plants his direct style and ability to deliver results eventually won the admiration of employees union leaders and even rival executives before leaving detroit to take over as both ceo and head of the mercedes division he bid farewell to hundreds of chrysler employees gathered in an atrium at its technical center promising "i will always be a chrysler guy " until recently mr zetsche had remained upbeat about chryslers long term potential and the wisdom of having the division work closely with the companys mercedes unit in an interview last june despite slumping sales and ballooning inventories mr zetsche said he was "totally convinced we are heading in the right direction with chrysler " he added that he was working to "really finish the merger" and to make chrysler and mercedes cooperate more closely when chryslers summer sales effort fizzled it became clear its string of profitable quarters was coming to an end in late july mr zetsche warned chrysler would stumble to a loss of about million euros in the third quarter several weeks later however he was back on a conference call with analysts this time to acknowledge chryslers loss would be as much as billion euros barely able to conceal his anger the normally affable executive called the announcement "utterly unacceptable" and acknowledged it was an embarrassment to him still he said there was no thought about selling chrysler and he repeated that position a few days later in an interview "i dont think thats a topic for today im as much a chrysler guy as a mercedes guy more so than anyone in this company so its evident i would want to take chrysler to the levels of performance we think are possible " mr zetsche said as the weeks dragged on mr zetsche continued to publicly rule out a chrysler sale even as some of his aides wanted to keep the option alive last october during a conference call with analysts his chief financial officer bodo uebber repeatedly declined to rule out the idea of selling chrysler triggering a spike in the companys share price as investors pounced on hopes of a demerger but within hours the company issued a statement saying "there are no plans to sell chrysler " in fact mr zetsche later acknowledged the real debate over chrysler was just beginning at his company after the october conference call he said last week "we revisited our strategy for the entire group including the chrysler group this was a process where we tried to understand better where we are and what the potential options are " meanwhile some shareholders renewed calls for daimlerchrysler to jettison its u s division by the time daimlerchryslers supervisory board met on feb to approve a restructuring plan for chrysler mr zetsche and his top lieutenants agreed they now had to consider "all options" for chrysler neal e boudette contributed to
