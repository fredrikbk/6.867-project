scor likely isnt done pursuing converium swiss reinsurer converium holding ag spurned a takeover proposal from french rival scor sa but the courtship isnt likely over and it may be the first of many this year in the european insurance sector converium said yesterday its board rejected a proposed offer of three billion swiss francs &# billion made by scor over the weekend if merged the two companies could leapfrog several competitors to become one of the worlds five largest reinsurers depending on how its measured reinsurance firms essentially backstop insurance companies biggest risks in return for a cut of their premiums scor said it secured a stake in converium and approached the board regarding a proposed offer of francs a share for the rest a premium to the stocks closing price friday a stake would require a formal offer according to swiss securities rules scor said it is convinced that a tie up makes sense so it is unlikely that chatter about a merger between the two will end there scor said a merger with converium was "a unique strategic opportunity to create a top five global multiline reinsurer in this time of market consolidation " converium said the offer "fundamentally fails to recognize the value of converiums franchise and growth prospects and is not in the interest of converium its shareholders and its customers " a converium spokesman noted that scors official stake will be filed publicly this week and that converium remains focused on growth and profitability targets laid out in recent weeks a scor spokesman declined to comment beyond the companys statement the scor offer could be the first of several in the insurance sector this year cost cuts and below average claims have left many european insurers with billions more than regulators require to back up their policies at the same time maturing insurance markets in the u s and europe have lead analysts to expect single digit premium growth particularly in property casualty coverage in coming years some players may seek growth by buying up rivals with todays excess cash "i think it will be a busy year " said joseph rohm a financial services analyst with t rowe price group inc in london "because of all the excess capital being generated and the difficulties some companies will have finding growth i think well see a lot more deals " analysts have estimated that european insurers finished with more than billion euros or about &# billion more in the bank than regulators require greater scale typically benefits insurers by potentially lowering their borrowing costs this will be a greater focus in coming years as new solvency rules expected in will favor companies with broader diversification this could lead smaller participants such as scor and converium to weigh merging "this offer is a good example of the kinds of deals we might see this year " mr rohm said scors move follows the takeover by swiss reinsurance co of general electric co s reinsurance operations a deal that was aimed at boosting both companies capital strength and global reach a takeover by scor would create a company with substantial life and nonlife business with annual premiums of about billion euros it would catapult the combined entity close to the worlds largest reinsurers led by swiss re munich re ag berkshire hathaway re a unit of berkshire hathaway inc and germanys hannover re ag analysts said the timing of the bid was sensible as converium shares are relatively inexpensive due to the companys restructuring but some such as oddo securities analyst nicolas jacob warned that investors worry scor would have to make another call on capital markets to finance a merger and that the move indicates a troubling strategic shift toward the risky nonlife reinsurance sector where converium is focused scor came close to financial collapse in after losses from contracts written in the s plunged it deep into the red it was saved by capital increases of more than billion euros and a huge restructuring plan its focus shifted toward life reinsurance which has a steadier claims record than the more volatile property and casualty reinsurance sector that is often prone to huge claims from catastrophes scor shares fell to euros in paris yesterday converium rose nearly to francs in zurich converium is still smarting from a heavy restructuring in the wake of a massive reserve shortfall in the u s in which required the company to issue new shares reduce staff and leave the u s reinsurance market although it has since turned profitable and boasts a strong capital base converium is still rated triple b by most rating agencies a level deemed too low for a reinsurer to do bulk business however converium expects an upgrade to the crucial a level later this year once an industrywide probe by the u s securities and exchange commission is expected to be finalized such a step wouldnt just boost its share price but also likely help spur premium growth and
