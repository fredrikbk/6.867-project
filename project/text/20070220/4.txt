airbus delays overhaul amid four nation dispute paris louis gallois won kudos for whipping frances strike plagued state railway into shape today the french turnaround artist is attempting what may be an even tougher act reviving airbus the european aviation titan in the latest sign of how difficult that task will be airbus owner european aeronautic defence &amp space co yesterday surprised investors and employees by postponing a long awaited announcement of airbuss big makeover plan called power as in the french railway saga the year old mr gallois is facing heavy political crossfire only this time on an international scale eads blamed the power delay on unresolved differences over how to divvy up work among the four countries who built the company a problem that has plagued airbus since it was created as an industrial consortium in mr gallois who is both chief executive of airbus and a co ceo of eads issued a statement calling for a fast solution to the dispute "which overcomes national issues " airbus urgently needs to slash costs and increase efficiency its a superjumbo jetliner is billions of dollars over budget and development costs for its proposed a long haul airliner have soared and a weak u s dollar is sapping airbuss competitive position because the company prices planes in dollars but incurs much of its costs in pricey euros or british pounds mr gallois last month said power "will lead to a complete reorganization of the company " planned elements include selling some airbus facilities cutting staff and increasing the number of components on each plane that are bought from outside suppliers but since airbus presented a rough outline of power in october politicians and labor unions in its home countries of france germany britain and spain have been girding to fight a loss of jobs and national prestige in the shake up workers in france and germany the two largest players in airbus have recently staged protests germanys ig metall the countrys most powerful industrial labor union is demanding a plan that "is not one sided and favoring one country " spokesman daniel friedrich said french labor unions have issued similar calls government officials around europe have sought to signal support for airbus by endorsing its efforts to streamline but at the same time they have undermined mr gallois by warning that airbus could lose political support if the pain from power isnt evenly spread inside airbus and eads meanwhile months of management upheaval have soured already tense relations among the four nationalities restructuring airbus will be even tougher because of a paradox although the company is struggling on many fronts its plants are now working overtime to deliver a record number of planes for the third straight year while airbus faces ominous strategic challenges some of which will require cost cutting the only problem many factory workers perceive is how to maintain the breakneck pace of production "if mr galloiss restructuring plan is brutal and painful workers wont understand " said pierre henri coat an official at frances confederation francaise democratique du travail or cfdt labor union "how can we cut jobs when they struggle to deliver all the planes on order " the controversy over power meanwhile is complicating plans for the proposed new a model the a is airbuss late response to the success of rival boeing co s strong selling new "dreamliner " airbus wants the two engine a slated to enter service in to be manufactured more efficiently than previous models have been but that will require restructuring moves of the sort called for in the power plan management says "the business plan of the a is dependent on the success of power " mr gallois said in december when eads approved plans to invest billion euros &# billion to build the twin aisle jetliner underlining the links between power and the a program eads said in a statement yesterday on the power delay that a board meeting late sunday came to a halt because directors failed to agree on how to divide work on the a among the four countries according to a person familiar with the situation representatives from germany britain and spain felt that france would get proportionally more high value work than the other countries an airbus spokesman declined to comment because politics and nationalism are unlikely to stop buffeting airbus company officials investors and customers hope mr galloiss vaunted management skills can overcome the obstacles a former ceo of two french state owned aerospace companies mr gallois served on the eads board from its formation in last july as the aerospace group plunged into chaos after airbus announced crippling delays building its superjumbo jet mr gallois stepped in as co ceo of eads then in october when airbus ceo christian streiff quit after barely days on the job mr gallois jumped in to fill that post too mr gallois had spent a decade taming restive labor unions and intrusive politicians as ceo of frances state railway societe nationale des chemins de fer in the process of modernizing sncf he earned a reputation for diplomacy but forcefulness benedikt weibel who sits on the board of sncf and headed switzerlands railway company until late last year said mr gallois has the requisite financial expertise of a ceo eads said in its statement that the board will meet again "within the coming days " mike esterl in frankfurt contributed to this article
