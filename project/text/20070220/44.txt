eurolinks daily view strategic pressures on iran are growing online edition the u s s escalating pressure on iran appears to be having some impact opening up opportunities for real advancements in u s foreign policy whether containing irans nuclear ambitions or underpinning a democratically elected government in lebanon but rather than seeking a quick fix in its contest with iran as the u s did in iraq by launching a war bush administration officials say they are bracing for a protracted struggle to curb tehrans influence in the region the bush administration is pursuing a two pronged strategy of directly challenging tehran in places such as iraq and lebanon while seeking to exploit fissures believed to be emerging in irans already fractious social and political systems the emerging strategy includes military movements to underscore u s resolve as well as increased financial pressure to drive a wedge between irans leaders and the countrys merchants on friday the u s treasury announced new sanctions on three iranian energy companies its notable however that the european union has taken the opposite tack expanding trade with iran even as brussels has professed concern about a nuclear armed tehran while u s officials insist the u s strategy isnt designed to court a war with iran it still is fraught with risks as jay solomon and yochi dreazen report iran could misread or overreact to some american moves and strategists at the pentagon concede that u s attempts to target iranian agents operating inside iraq could stoke a much larger response from tehrans paramilitary forces such as the iranian revolutionary guard corps meanwhile a longstanding iranian vulnerability is growing its oil exports while the energy industry accounts for some of irans export income such oil shipments may be poised to go into a steep decline as bhushan bahree and bill spindle report some industry researchers say they can see the day perhaps years off when iran may have no oil to export unless it dramatically changes the policies affecting its oil industry such an outcome would not only rob world markets of a major source of supply it would also leave the iranian government

com article sb html hormone help while studies of the safety of menopause hormones have shown that blood clot risk is lower with hormone patches compared with pills most experts say the message hasnt gotten to many doctors or women themselves part of the problem is that blood clot data tend to get published in cardiology journals that may not be read by internal medicine doctors or gynecologists who typically prescribe hormone drugs another problem is that no clinical trials comparing oral patch and other forms of hormone drugs have been conducted this week however as tara parker pope reports the medical journal circulation offers some of the strongest evidence yet that the risks of hormones are dramatically reduced when the drugs are absorbed through the skin in patches and gels rather than taken as pills the study by french researchers shows that one of the most serious risks associated with hormone use blood clots could be all but eliminated if women switch to a skin delivery system like the patch but even the data from the circulation study isnt considered conclusive because it is based on observational evidence rather than a clinical trial where a specific treatment is
