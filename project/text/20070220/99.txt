the middle seat stuck on a plane why nightmare delays happen faa rules company policies prod airlines to wait it out calling in the red cross this winters spate of nightmare incidents where travelers have been stuck on grounded airplanes for as long as hours exposes a lack of action and communication by airlines and airports as well as problematical faa rules that discourage flights from returning to gates though rare travel nightmares with long onboard waits do seem to be occurring with more regularity financially strapped airlines are stretched thin gates planes and employees are often scheduled to maximum capacity with little room to handle disruptions especially when severe winter weather hits in addition with planes packed airlines are more hesitant to cancel flights since passengers may have to wait days for an open seat airports are busier these days too that means a lot more planes vying to land after a storm plus one overriding cause bad decisions at airlines during an ice storm in new york this past wednesday jetblue airways corp let several flights sit for hours toilets overflowing nothing to eat but snacks and ironically cabins so hot and stuffy that doors had to be opened to let fresh air in though some trapped passengers had been sitting since early morning jetblue didnt call the port authority of new york and new jersey which operates kennedy for help until p m the port authority has buses and staff available for emergencies around the clock and buses began rolling quickly says port authority spokesman pasquale difulco by p m the evacuation of people from planes to jetblues terminal was wrapped up the airline says it jetblew it by waiting too long to call for help because faulty weather forecasts suggested planes would get to take off "our biggest mistake was waiting too long to realize we were not going to operate and then we waited too long to call the port authority for help " spokesman bryan baldwin said passengers also complained that they could see empty gates at airport terminals jetblue says it did commandeer a couple of extra gates at an international terminal but "that should have been an option we took greater advantage of " mr baldwin said while rival domestic airlines may have been reluctant to help jetblue says in future jams it will ask to use available gates at international terminals jetblue operates with a philosophy to fly every trip no matter how late the new york based carrier typically has the lowest rate of flight cancellations among major airlines that worked well last winter when a predicted blizzard wasnt as bad as forecast and jetblue kept flying while other airlines had already canceled flights but this year jetblue got caught its operations jumbled jetblue had problems that continued through the weekend flights were canceled wholesale because the airlines operations department was slow to get planes and crews back on track other flights have had similar fiascoes this winter on dec storms in dallas forced amr corp s american airlines to divert planes to other airports and passengers on several flights were left stranded one planeload flight sat for nine hours in austin texas until the captain taxied the airplane to an empty gate even though he hadnt received permission the austin airport says american never asked to use other gates or get buses to unload passengers "its an airline issue they know we have it available " said airport spokesman jim halbrook american says its austin manager did ask for help with extra gates but at the time none was available the airline says the main reason why planes sat was because workers hadnt given up hope of getting them to dallas now because of the fiasco american has since instituted a policy capping the time passengers can sit on diverted planes at four hours part of the problem is that airlines pilots and often passengers are reluctant to throw in the towel planes wait in line hoping for a break in the weather and wait and wait last july aaron gruen sat for eight hours on the ground in harrisburg pa after his united airlines flight from chicago to new york was diverted because of bad weather in new york for hours the pilot told passengers he didnt want to go to a gate because hed lose his place in line to get to new york and the flight likely would be canceled the plane refueled twice before united gave up and offered to bus passengers to new york the faas air traffic control system can penalize flights that go back to a gate even for a temporary bathroom break air traffic controllers generally take flights first come first serve unless the airline can badger officials into giving a flight higher priority or trade places in line with another of its own flights indeed last month a jetblue flight ended up on the ground for eight hours at jfk because it returned to the gate and then was required to file a new flight plan the faa says why not grant some kind of "suspended" flight status to a long delayed trip that needs an hour to go to a gate and let everyone get some food and relief the faa says that isnt needed because airlines share an "advocate" inside the faa command center any airline can ask the advocate to lobby for giving a flight higher priority duty time limits also can discourage pilots from taking planes back to gates federal rules give pilots a total work day of hours with only eight hours actually at the controls of an airplane a pilot cant start a new flight with a scheduled time that would push over eight hours in the cockpit but the pilot can continue any delayed flight up to the hour limit if a flight goes back to the gate it technically ends so if the pilot is close to the eight hour limit he or she cant start a new flight to get the plane to its destination but if the flight sits on the ramp without going back to the gate the pilot gets the hour window peggy gilligan faa deputy associate administrator for aviation safety said the way to avoid that problem is for a stranded flight to return to a gate early and preserve enough of the pilots eight hours of available flying to complete the trip once the weather clears but that means losing a flights place in line and potentially angering passengers who want to get out of town frequent travelers are willing to sit for a few hours but often not six eight or hours some airports have stepped up planning for stranded flight situations in san antonio where about flights sat waiting to get to dallas on dec the local airport rolled an emergency plan into action similar to a tornado or flood hitting town the fear some people would be stuck on airplanes overnight the san antonio fire department set up a shelter at a local high school and called in the red cross to provide food local city buses were sent to the airport to move passengers by night many of the planes did depart and only people slept in the shelter overnight said airport spokesman david hebert since then airport officials have been involved in discussions with airlines and others on how to better prepare for stranded passengers and possibly help with customer comfort when planes are parked fully loaded "we all know its probably going to happen again " said mr hebert some industry watchers have argued for "passengers rights" legislation that would force airlines to compensate customers for excessive delays and compel them to meet basic needs like food and bathrooms if the penalties are stiff enough advocates argue airlines will improve service in u s airlines thwarted a congressional move toward passenger rights requirements by adopting a voluntary "customer service commitment " the european commission however invoked seemingly tough passenger rights rules that took effect in and force airlines to compensate travelers for lengthy delays but the bark is worse than the bite the european rules carry numerous exceptions airlines arent held responsible when bad weather is involved or when flights are delayed by air traffic control congestion mechanical problems are exempt since government doesnt want to pressure carriers into unsafe operations security related delays are exempt too the exemptions cover most of what goes wrong in airline operations indeed the european commissions ombudsman last month found that the commissions own promotional leaflets overstated passenger rights by promising compensation for long delays the leaflets have been withdrawn
