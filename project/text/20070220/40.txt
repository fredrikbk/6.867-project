estate entrepreneur in a few short months year old mr torres and his new company sdt waste &amp debris services llc under new guidelines from the city have attempted to clean up the image of waste removal in the historic neighborhood with its sleek polished trucks glitzy marketing and experimental cleaning methods sdt illustrates how small outsiders can come into stodgy industries and get noticed by shaking up protocol what mr torres and sdt are doing is a "totally different approach " says mark wilson president of the french quarter business association instead of just flushing streets with water mr torres is testing new scents such as lemon or eucalyptus to reduce the squalid odor the companys giant flusher and sweeper trucks are painted in an unusual black and white style

and residences not serviced under city contracts as well as other parts of the state mr torres also is running a series of glitzy local tv ads more reminiscent of beer marketing than garbage the ads feature local musicians and pithy slogans such as "you cant beat the bull " mr torres efforts stem in part from a new resolve among new orleans officials to change the way their most visible neighborhood is perceived "when we came back from katrina we looked at things differently " says mr wilson "we cant market this city or bring back tourism without the quarter being clean " the citys longstanding contract with trash giant waste management inc expired last year and the company didnt bid again "we felt that we preferred not to do it because we couldnt meet the bid specifications and didnt feel comfortable going forward " says wes muir a spokesman for waste management veronica white director of the new orleans sanitation department says that when she thought about the specifics for the new contract "i thought about disney world and how you always see someone with a broom and dust pan in the street sweeping " per the citys request there is now a cadre of human street sweepers on duty even when trucks arent rolling in total sdt puts in hours a day cleaning the quarter five days a week of pressure washing and has twice daily trash pickup today fat tuesday is d day for both
