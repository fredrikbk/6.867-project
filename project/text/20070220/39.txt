emails reveal backdating scheme mercury complaint claims wide efforts among executives as part of a years long scheme to backdate stock options at mercury interactive corp former executives allegedly altered documents repeatedly changed the dates of some option grants and sent each other emails discussing the improper practice according to a court document that has been at the center of a battle over confidentiality in the case in one email quoted in the court document filed in state court in california by shareholders suing the former executives a mercury finance executive wrote to another official about using "magic backdating ink" to manipulate the date of an options grant another employee whose grant allegedly was backdated was told in an email that "the stock price drop made us change the grant date" and "you will be happier with the new price " in another incident described in the filing insiders allegedly covered up fax headers on documents to disguise the fact that an options grant was approved by directors long after its purported date the court document appears to provide some of the most vivid evidence yet of how options backdating took root and flourished inside a company depicting a culture of lax controls in which top executives openly discussed how to manipulate the dates of options to make them more favorable to themselves and other insiders mercury was one of the first companies ensnared in the options backdating scandal and it previously has admitted that its top executives improperly altered the dates of more than option grants between and the mountain view calif software company which was acquired by hewlett packard co late last year for &# billion previously restated years of financial results reducing its pretax income by &# million from to nearly all because of options related problems most of its top executives from the period in question have left the firm mercury is one of about companies being investigated in a broad federal probe of options backdating last week a former chief executive of take two interactive software inc and a former general counsel of monster worldwide inc separately pleaded guilty to options related criminal charges in new york stock options a popular compensation tool give employees the right to buy a companys stock at a preset "strike price " typically the market price on the date of grant in theory recipients cant profit unless the share price rises at some companies executives improperly backdated grants by pretending options were issued at an earlier time when the market price was lower thus increasing the potential profit the new information about the mercury case is contained in a page shareholder derivative complaint originally filed in september under seal in superior court in santa clara calif against four former top executives of the company on feb the judge overseeing the case james p kleinberg ordered it dismissed on a matter of standing ruling that the plaintiffs no longer have a stake in the company after h ps purchase it is unclear if the plaintiffs will appeal that order which didnt address the complaints merits several news organizations have been waging a legal battle to have some documents in the case unsealed the former mercury executives have opposed unsealing the documents judge kleinberg has ordered the documents opened to public view but they remain sealed pending appeal a copy of the complaint was appended to another filing in the case and a dow jones news service reporter obtained the document from the courts files late friday neither dow jones &amp co nor the wall street journal is a party to the legal attempt to unseal the documents although filed on behalf of two shareholders the complaint says it was prosecuted "at the request of" a special committee of mercurys board which last year decided to support the shareholder suit against the four former executives the complaint appears to lean heavily on documents and other information from an internal probe overseen by mercurys board the defendants in the case are sharlene abrams and douglas p smith both former chief financial officers susan skaer a former general counsel and kenneth klein a former chief operating officer the complaint alleges the four granted themselves more than three million backdated options locking in a total of &# million in immediate paper gains in total the four made "millions in illicit profit" by selling mercury shares valued at about &# million the complaint alleges jared kopel an attorney for mr klein said only "we cant comment on a document that the courts ordered to remain under seal " brandon wisoff an attorney for ms abrams also cited the confidentiality order in refraining from commenting patrick robbins who represents mr smith said "this complaint contained irresponsibly inaccurate and incomplete recitations of events involving mr smith who did nothing wrong we are gratified that the court has dismissed these claims " an attorney for ms skaer couldnt be immediately reached to comment in past news reports an attorney for ms skaer has denied she did anything wrong email messages discussing backdating were frequent among mercury executives the court complaint says in one exchange from may officials debated how to set the date of an april grant even though the purported date had passed weeks before "what is the date for the april grant going to be " susie fregoso a payroll manager asked ms abrams on may "right now i have it as april with a price of &# you had mentioned that this might change any news " in another email exchange from aug discussing whether an employee could be retroactively included in an already issued option grant which would have been improper unless the company took a special earnings charge assistant controller kathy hawkes tells ms fregoso "i betcha that sharlene abrams will overrule these types of things and we will use her magic backdating ink " according to the court records another april email appears to describe how former chief executive amnon landan and ms abrams supposedly backdated a grant to a new employee who was promised stock options in her job offer letter the trouble was mercurys stock price was falling and the officials wanted to wait to lock in a lower price "the reason the paperwork was not sent out is because the stock price drop made us change the grant date so that you could get the lower price " says the april message to the new hire from ms fregoso the payroll manager as quoted in the filing "the new grant is being approved next week by sharlene abramsamnon landan i know it has been a while but believe me you will be happier with the new price " it ended with a smiley face emoticon in a mid march email general counsel ms skaer wrote to mr smith the finance chief suggesting they use a date two weeks earlier for a grant to new employees "unless we think the price will be better than that later this month" according to the complaint "let me know what youd like to do " she added in addition mercury officials falsified records including hiring agreements to cover their tracks the court document asserts mr smith was hired as an executive vice president in mid according to the complaint the board approved a grant of options to mr smith on july when mercurys stock price was &# it claims ms abrams and ms skaer falsified mr smiths employment letter to make it appear he was hired on may and then priced his options on that date when the share price was &# the backdating added &# million in potential profit to the grant according to the complaint a may employment letter was drawn up for mr smith which he signed and dated may the complaint says bogus compensation committee minutes dated may also were drawn up claiming the board approved mr smiths grant on that date the complaint says but electronic "metadata " or electronic tagging information shows that the minutes werent created until july it adds other documents were falsified in early according to the records at the time mercurys share price was rising and the defendants allegedly decided to backdate an option grant to mr smith and ms skaer to early november when the stock was significantly lower in january mr landan the former ceo sent an email to outside directors seeking their consent for the earlier date the complaint claims when the directors faxed back the consent forms bearing the november grant date the complaint says "skaer or someone at her direction intentionally falsified and altered the documents by whiting out the january fax dates at the top of the return faxes " the supposed alteration failed because one of the faxes was sent upside down and the original date was left on one of the documents the complaint alleges final approval for the grant wasnt obtained until a feb board meeting when the defendants allegedly changed the date yet again to one several days earlier in november that was even more favorable to them the complaint says
