their proposed &# billion merger by arguing that new technology such as ipods and internet radio offers consumers alternatives to what would be a single satellite radio provider for the entire country one obstacle standing in the way of a possible merger is a federal communications commission rule forbidding such a deal but sirius and xm are expected to argue that the industry landscape has changed over the past decade and the rule isnt compatible with the variety of entertainment choices available today the wall street journal writes the rule could be changed but fcc chairman kevin martin said the companies hurdle is high they would need to prove that the deal would provide consumers more choice and affordable prices the journal notes the merger proposal would also have to be approved by the justice department the national association of broadcasters which represents am and fm radio stations is unlikely to be swayed by the satellite radio stations arguments spokesman dennis wharton noted that when the fcc authorized satellite radio "it specifically found that the public would be served best by two competitive nationwide systems " the journal reports sirius ceo mel karmazin expects to be able to prove the deal is in the public interest and that satellite radio stations have a small audience compared with other ways consumers can get audio entertainment the new york times

the countrys wealth oil exports fuel subsidies which drive down the cost of gasoline to about cents a gallon are adding to the problem the wall street journal reports by discouraging conservation even as demand outstrips the countrys refinery capacity a lack of foreign investment in oil fields due to western sanctions and government policies has caused production to stagnate and according to some who have studied the situation irans oil exports could dry up within a decade the journal says such a situation could spark a sharp rise in oil prices as the countrys two biggest customers japan and china would be forced to look elsewhere to fulfill their oil needs irans looming energy problem is one argument it has used to justify it nuclear ambitions and other oil exporting countries such as egypt and saudi arabia are also exploring nuclear energy programs the journal writes the bush administration says iran is more interested in producing nuclear weapons than nuclear energy and favors stronger economic sanctions but some observers say such measures could make it easier for tehran to blame outsiders for the unpleasant steps it may have to take to tackle the looming energy crisis as
