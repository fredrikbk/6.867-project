journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources foreign policy should u s troops withdraw several factors may prevent iraq from sliding into civil war when arguing the pros and cons of withdrawing u s troops from iraq many on both sides assume the departure would leave behind bloody chaos either by al qaeda taking over a full blown sunni shiite civil war or a kurdish power grab but national security reporter robert dreyfuss says that the u s is not the only force preventing these things from happening other obstacles exist that would survive a u s withdrawal he says to begin with there arent enough foreign fighters to convert iraq into a haven for al qaeda he says al qaeda fighters represent only to of the sunni insurgents forces even if those few managed to take control of the sunni insurgency stiff opposition from kurdish and shiite forces would bitterly fight against any al qaeda base even if shiite sunni battle lines are hardening and death squads seem able to kill in some areas with impunity mr dreyfuss says this is as bad as it is likely to get without heavy military equipment like artillery and tanks neither side will be able to break into the others territory a territorial impasse is more likely than a full blown civil war if the u s leaves it is also feared that the kurds could provoke a kurdish arab civil war by fighting for independence and the oil fields in the north but mr dreyfuss says that the kurds would be far less likely to attempt this with their main backer the u s military gone from the region mr dreyfuss says peace in iraq is more likely after a u s withdrawal polls show that despite their differences most iraqis are against the fighting by extremists and in favor of a unified peaceful iraq as well as a u s withdrawal the washington monthly march politics presence of power couples grows in democratic field hillary clinton might have been part of the first husband and wife team to offer voters a

successful team saying at a recent campaign stop in new hampshire "im the one person republicans are most afraid of because bill and i do know how to beat them we have consistently and we will do it
