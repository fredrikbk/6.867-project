a cultural conversation with edward mendelson hes honored w h auden with a lifetime of devotion new york when edward mendelson flew to kirchstetten austria in october to attend the funeral of w h auden the poets niece rita auden greeted him with friendly puzzlement then she asked mr mendelson whether his father had come too "i said i think i am the person you think is my father " recalls mr mendelson who in april at age had been named by auden as his literary executor at the time the decidedly junior literary scholar who first met the poet as an undergraduate was editing a volume of audens essays by mr mendelsons account he had won audens respect by his attention to detail and willingness to tell his idol when his work in this case an essay on shakespeares "romeo and juliet" didnt measure up "auden had enough moral intelligence not to want to have his own way in everything " mr mendelson says today at mr mendelson professor of english and comparative literature at columbia university occupies a position at the summit of auden scholarship he has overseen a stream of publications including most recently an expanded edition of "w h auden selected poems" vintage books and a new hardcover edition of "w h auden collected poems" modern library both are being released in connection with the centenary of audens birth which is tomorrow "ive wanted to put out new editions for years " mr mendelson says over lunch at a japanese restaurant near columbia "the publishers were a lot more interested when the centenary arrived " centenary observances in the u s canada and britain are listed at http audensociety org a web site maintained by mr mendelson who moonlights as a columnist for pc magazine tomorrow night at cooper union in new york the poet james fenton the auden scholar nicholas jenkins and the writer adam gopnik will read from audens works mr mendelson will participate in auden tributes tomorrow at yale university in new haven conn and on march at the nd street y in new york where auden himself frequently appeared mr mendelson notes that audens reputation has only grown since his death his verse has resurfaced in everything from political speeches and commercials to the films "four weddings and a funeral" and "the man who fell to earth " and the play "the history boys " the last two invoke "musee des beaux arts " with its famous opening lines "about suffering they were never wrong the old masters " mr mendelson says that the first president bushs references to "a thousand points of light " a phrase attributed to speechwriter peggy noonan may have drawn on audens "ironic points of light" in "september " why does auden remain so popular mr mendelson says that in "a culture designed to tell you that the individual person does not really matter " auden addresses readers as individuals and takes as his central concern their "moral relation" with one another his poetry also has a "visionary quality" that involves "seeing the infinite value of whats right in front of you " he says in his elegy to yeats auden declared that "poetry makes nothing happen " his own verse vaulted him to a precocious celebrity born in york england into an upper middle class family wystan hugh auden became identified with a circle of oxford educated poets that included louis macneice stephen spender and cecil day lewis his early poetry published by t s eliot in was often obscure deliberately so according to mr mendelson but his lyrics with such memorable lines as "lay your sleeping head my love human on my faithless arm " and his left leaning political anthems of the s secured his position as a leading poet of the th century in these youthful poems says mr mendelson "he would try out attitudes he would write leftist poems to see how they felt " but auden came to view some of these poems as dishonest and ejected them from his canon he also discarded some of his later christian inspired verse mr mendelson says but those poems were not so sorely missed "i think he felt that the political situation required him to say things that were not true for the sake of a political cause " mr mendelson says "later he found this whole idea deeply revolting " auden revised as many as three quarters of his published poems in mr mendelsons estimate "collected poems" preserves all the poems that auden wished to keep in their final form in the more compact "selected poems " mr mendelson uses audens original versions and restores some missing works including "spain" and "september " which was widely quoted after mr mendelson is editing "the complete works of w h auden " which will provide all the variants of audens poetry the fifth volume of the series featuring audens s prose is due out later this year from princeton university press in auden immigrated to america with his friend and collaborator christopher isherwood and seven years later became an american citizen he taught at the university of michigan and at swarthmore college but based himself mostly in manhattan making a living by writing prose and lecturing at michigan he met chester kallman a graduate student who became first his lover then his close companion and a collaborator on several opera libretti including stravinskys "the rakes progress " in auden reconverted to christianity and christian themes figure importantly in his subsequent poems including the much anthologized "in praise of limestone" and "horae canonicae " considered by mr mendelson an underappreciated masterpiece for all his devotion to auden mr mendelson sometimes seems a bit bemused at audens popularity he remembers his surprise for example at the avalanche of phone calls he received about the poem "funeral blues " used in "four weddings and a funeral " he has since added it as well as some of audens lighter verse to "selected poems " "funeral blues " says mr mendelson "takes a cliche and it moves it a little bit farther and turns it into a work of art for years people thought auden was chilly emotionally when it was exactly the opposite auden was the most obviously emotional poet you could think of " an aspiring poet himself mr mendelson grew up in the village a block from audens st marks place apartment one of his teachers at the university of rochester told mr mendelson that auden held informal "office hours" at home so the "very nervous" and "deeply shy" student found the poet listed in the phone book and scheduled a visit "i went over and had nothing to say " mr mendelson recalls "but auden was a very generous figure to shy visitors and he just talked at me for about an hour and gave me a cup of coffee " audens generosity mr mendelson says extended to people he had never met "he always answered letters he got into a big correspondence with a canadian burglar who discovered his poetry in jail " says mr mendelson "one of his friends told me this wonderful story of auden coming in and waving a letter from the canadian burglar and saying ive got him reading kafka " mr mendelsons own next encounter with auden was more propitious by then he had completed a doctoral dissertation on auden at johns hopkins university and was teaching at yale when auden was invited to speak on campus mr mendelson was enlisted as his escort at one point auden told him that he had long wanted to assemble a collection of his essays but had forgotten much of what hed written not so mr mendelson he had it all photocopied from libraries and archives he left the poet "obviously so pleased to be taken seriously" alone to peruse the stack of papers impressed auden asked mr mendelson to edit the collection with his help and eventually to become his literary executor in the u s auden was very much a public figure a fixture on television and radio in time magazine researched a cover story about him but it never ran according to mr mendelsons account "the managing editor said the last writer we had on the cover whom i think was tennessee williams was a homosexual and were not going to have two in a row " at the end of his life says mr mendelson auden was "very lonely " in part because he and kallman spent several months a year apart they joined each other for summers in europe "he was never lonely when kallman was around " says mr mendelson who observed the pair interacting like "an old married couple " finishing each others sentences these days mr mendelson who knows many auden poems by heart says he always has "a few in my head the one that i say to myself as i walk down riverside drive is going to be different depending on mood or circumstance or the weather " mr mendelson describes himself as an intensely private person unlike auden he was unwilling to invite a stranger to his apartment who is only reluctantly responding to the "tidal wave" of interview requests spurred by the centenary he also plays down the importance of public tributes "the way you honor a poet is by sitting home and reading him " says mr mendelson "im sure thats what he wanted most " ms klein is a cultural reporter and critic in philadelphia
