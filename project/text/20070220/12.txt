boss talk cooking up changes at kraft foods studying rushed consumers ceo rosenfeld orders up menu of complete meals northfield ill after irene b rosenfeld became chief executive officer of kraft foods inc in june she spent months talking to employees and peeking inside consumers kitchens from suburban chicago to the capital of china ms rosenfeld concluded the nations largest food maker whose household name products range from jell o to maxwell house coffee to velveeta cheese had lost sight of how its offerings fit into consumers lives deep cost cutting had eaten into krafts product quality eroding the strength of some brands and causing the company to lose market share workers were afraid to speak up when they saw problems today at an analysts conference in scottsdale ariz ms rosenfeld plans to unveil a new strategy to reignite krafts growth as it gets ready to spin off from altria group inc instead of just selling meal components kraft will make more complete meals like prepackaged salads and ready made sandwiches with its oscar mayer meats and planters nuts ms rosenfeld wants to expand in developing countries cut costs without hurting quality and put more decisions in the hands of local managers her plan faces many obstacles and most of krafts peers are struggling to achieve the same kind of growth ms rosenfeld who is years old and holds bachelors masters and doctoral degrees from cornell university spent more than years climbing the ranks at kraft before becoming ceo of pepsico inc s frito lay in recently she sat down with the wall street journal to explain how kraft will create better new products and how american cooking is changing excerpts follow wsj whats next for kraft ms rosenfeld we are about to take this great portfolio of ours in a new direction thats more consistent with the reality of consumers lives today we have all kinds of capabilities in terms of manufacturing and selling and distribution weve got complementary products that go together cheese and crackers ham and cheese coffee and cookies our challenge is how do we leverage those assets to accelerate our growth wsj how will you make the new products pipeline stronger ms rosenfeld part of the strategy is really about looking at our products through the consumers eyes rather than through our manufacturers lens cheese is a perfect example our cheese segments are based on our manufacturing processes we have processed slices natural chunks jar cheese not exactly the most appetizing kinds of descriptions consumers are using processed slices to make sandwiches theyre using natural chunks to snack theyre using jar cheese to dip and spread so if you start to focus on it from the consumers perspective it opens up a whole world of possibilities to what new products one might offer wsj when you first came back to kraft one of the things you did was to go to consumers homes and watch them what were you looking for ms rosenfeld we have all kinds of studies that weve done but there is no substitute for seeing with your own eyes how people actually use the products when i went to beijing the consumer whose home i was in offered me some tang she poured it out and i started to gulp it down and almost burned my tongue because they drink tang hot and i didnt know that we havent really spent a lot of time thinking about the solubility of our tang product in hot water wsj do consumers really want healthier foods or do they just think they want them ms rosenfeld everybody wants to eat healthier the issue is no one wants to make trade offs to do that we have technologies and research and development ideas that will allow us to meet the needs for healthier foods without having to give up on quality if you were to eat our sugar free jell o pudding for example its indistinguishable from our base pudding i feel very confident that we not only can do it but that its a key piece of our strategy going forward wsj how will the spinoff from altria change how you go forward ms rosenfeld we can take on more debt which will give us more flexibility to deliver returns to our shareholders it allows us to use our stock as an acquisition currency which we havent been able to do i believe internationally we will have a focus on acquisitions wsj how do you change the image of products that may have been sophisticated a generation ago but have lost some of that appeal ms rosenfeld if you back up to what made kraft such a strong company it was about offering peoples favorite foods in what was then a convenient form thats exactly what were talking about doing today thats why we make jell o today in ready to eat form were about to come out with jell o with fruit in it thats ready to eat people dont like jell o any less today than you and i did when we were growing up but theyre living their lives differently wsj do people still want to cook ms rosenfeld a lot of people consider microwaving their nacho chips with cheez whiz on it as cooking i think consumers very much like to cook i think the definition of cooking has changed dramatically whereas our mothers were more inclined to using their oven and their stove when they cooked todays consumers think about using their microwave they think about assembly as opposed to necessarily cooking im excited about this new product we just launched in january called deli creations these are hot sandwiches that are made with our high quality ingredients like oscar mayer meats kraft cheese and a and grey poupon sauces but whats so cool about them is you stick them in your microwave it takes seconds and it tastes freshly baked wsj do people feel like thats cooking ms rosenfeld in all honesty no but they certainly feel theyve eaten a substantial quality meal as part of this notion of changing our lens we are beginning to have more complete solutions in our offering of products today a lot of what we make are what youd call components we make the meat we make the cheese we make the mustard we make the steak sauce increasingly there are many consumers who dont have the time or the interest to put it all together themselves wsj how will the supermarket look in years ms rosenfeld we ought to see together the kinds of things that go together today if you want to make a salad you have to go to the produce to get your lettuce you have to go to the meat and cheese sections which are in two different places to get your meat and cheese and then you have to go to a third section to get your salad dressing so increasingly i think a big part of what well see in the future is better thinking about how to organize the store wsj as a manager how do you unleash creativity in an organization that is big and has an established culture ms rosenfeld in many cases its about getting out of their way we should not make daily operating decisions out of headquarters we have very talented managers in our local markets and they are in the best position to make some of those operating decisions wsj youre one of the highest profile female ceos in corporate america what is that like ms rosenfeld i am mostly proud of what ive done as a businessperson it just so happens that im a woman as we spin off from altria i will assume the additional title of chairman theres been a lot of discussion about whether i should use "chairman" or "chairwoman " ive chosen to use "chairman" just because it gets too complicated to have these asterisks next to your name at the end of the day its not about the "woman" part its about the "chair" part  tips for growth from irene b rosenfeld  instill a mindset of candor courage and action  face issues head on  get the team focused on what matters most  give people the tools they need and get out of the way  test and learn most big ideas didnt start that way
