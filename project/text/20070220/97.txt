the daily fix chargers turn to uncle norv in quest for first super bowl online edition marty schottenheimers career nfl head coaching record in the regular season in the playoffs norv turner in the playoffs seven years after mr schottenheimer replaced mr turner in washington mr turners replacing mr schottenheimer in san diego leaving his post as the san francisco ers offensive coordinator after just one season mr turner will inherit a team ousted from the playoffs last month a contributing factor in mr schottenheimers firing los angeles times columnist t j simers mocks the choice "turners raiders teams were against afc west opponents in his two forgettable years on the job but obviously that win really impressed the chargers brass " mr simers adds "a wax likeness of tom landry wouldve been a more inspiring hire especially since it appears chargers gm a j smith has made it clear with this decision he will really be the teams coach " but mr smiths heavy touch was a given going into the hiring process john clayton writes on espn com "after a number of turbulent years in which general manager a j smith and coach marty schottenheimer just couldnt find a way to get along the chargers were looking for a nice guy who wont make waves " mr clayton writes "turner is the perfect choice in san francisco people in the office refer to him as uncle norv turner is such a nice guy office employees and players loved coming by his office just to enjoy his company and conversation say goodbye to dysfunction in san diego " besides the coaching record of new englands bill belichick who outcoached mr schottenheimer in that playoff game last month was when he was fired in cleveland in in prior head coaching stops mr turner like mr belichick way back when lacked the players to win nick canepa writes in the san diego union tribune "turner didnt have enough of them especially in oakland where not even the devil himself ok al davis has been able to win lately and washingtons roster didnt exactly resemble that of the steelers when he got there " ron rivera the architect of the chicago bears fearsome defense ok fearsome pre super bowl also interviewed for the chargers spot he didnt get it was canned in chicago and then took a lesser job in san diego as the linebackers coach mr rivera was a member of the bears team that went and won the franchises last super bowl head coach lovie smith has now severed ties with that team "smith was nowhere close to the nfl in " don pierson writes in the chicago tribune "when he pays homage to those bears teams of the s its more by request than refrain more duty than desire there soon will be a note of resentment if its not that way already smith and ditka might agree on ditkas observation that the past is for cowards one thing you cant call smith is timid " more prosaic considerations of personal rivalry also played a role the tribunes david haugh adds "riveras popularity in chicago could threaten to exceed smiths if the bears are successful again next fall only a fool hires his potential successor and smith is no fool " columnists agree that nascar driver mark martin is a sympathetic figure who in a perfect world would have won the daytona on sunday but theyre split on whether he deserved to win in the imperfect world weve got mr martin universally considered the best driver never to win a championship or daytona and the nicest driver period was leading the field in the final lap less than a car length ahead of kevin harvick when chaos erupted behind them the spins and crashes didnt affect the two leaders but nascars decision not to fly the caution flag meant the race was decided at the finish line rather than by who was leading when the flag flew mr harvick edged out mr martin by the length of a car hood and mr martin was gracious in defeat "dont feel sorry for him " ed hinton writes of the runner up in the orlando sentinel "hes a mighty big little man his heart is so held together by scar tissue it cant be broken anymore he can handle this he already has and now a nation knows what his peers always have he towers over all the rest in decency and dignity " the controversy over the nonexistent caution flag only helped nascar extend its sporting dominance on a weekend when the nba all star game the less said about that the better was overshadowed by the daytona "in our current sports world buzz translates to bucks " bill dwyre writes in the los angeles times "for its transgression nascar may be forced to apologize all the way to the bank the people at the indy can only wish they had these problems " more than years after its first game and years after its only championship the wisconsin mens basketball program is for the first time ranked no in the associated press poll that stay may be short lived on sunday the badgers travel to big rival ohio state tops in the coaches poll this week in the green bay press gazette mike woods fondly recalls bygone drives to madison "to watch the badgers get flogged" before celebrating coach bo ryans accomplishment "wisconsin is known for many things but producing top notch high school basketball players isnt necessarily one of them " he writes "but nine on the member uw roster are home grown three of the five starters are sorry about this cheeseheads there is but one mcdonalds all american on the team this isnt duke or north carolina or kansas or arizona schools that annually welcome on board two or three picks of the litter every year this is a team of largely unheralded high school players many key members who have stuck around for their senior seasons who have been molded and shaped into something special by ryan and his staff " speaking of kansas the no jayhawks are loaded with talent but havent won an ncaa tournament game the last two seasons wisconsin has won three in that span heading into last nights game at kansas state the jayhawks hadnt proven themselves to be adequately tough joe posnanski writes in the kansas city star but the win in a hostile environment the programs th straight in manhattan but against an unusually good wildcats team allayed doubts "those kansas state fans had come to see the dreaded streak die " mr posnanski writes "they wore black and they stomped the floor and they threw confetti and they brought live chickens " the environment of the university of illinoiss assembly hall will no longer feature chief illiniwek a school mascot for years "good gosh i cant begin to express how glad i am that well never see this nonsense anymore " bryan burwell writes in the st louis post dispatch "every time ive attended an illinois game and seen the chief do his so called tribal dance around the court i felt completely and utterly creeped out people kept telling me this kid in the grease paint without a drop of american indian blood in his veins was performing a tribute to the illiniwek tribe i kept thinking it never felt right in the same way it never felt right to hear pat boone sing tutti frutti " andy murray the worlds th ranked tennis player who turns in may followed up his impressive showing at the australian open a gripping five set loss in the fourth round to no rafael nadal by defending his sap open title this past weekend mr murray had to overcome the hard serves of " ivo karlovic who lost just one of his first service games at the tournament including upsets of james blake and mardy fish the second and third ranked americans on the tour respectively in the times of london simon barnes writes that mr murray has left the land of promise and entered perilous territory "to be a promising young man is one of the most seductive roles that life has to offer " mr barnes writes "you are cherished and made much of and yet you dont actually have to do anything " but after his recent play mr murray "has gone into that bleaker and uglier place where losing really matters making promises is easy murray has now started keeping them " tip of the
