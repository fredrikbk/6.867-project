their behalf in northern louisiana yesterday may come to symbolize racial disparity in the criminal justice system state police put attendance at yesterdays demonstration at to though organizers said a much larger crowd came to march at jena a town whose official population is roughly according to the associated press the protests far more peaceful and even festive compared to the civil rights marches four decades earlier were led by a familiar cast of activists who included jesse jackson and al sharpton the focus of their outrage was the treatment of six high school students and a dispute that began under a tree in august of last year a black student at jena high school asked the principal if he could sit under a shade tree where white students usually congregated he was told yes but two nooses were hung from the tree the next day as tension escalated the school held an emergency assembly where according to black students lasalle parish district attorney reed walters warned students he could "take away their lives with a stroke of my pen " as the new orleans times picayune reports mr walters denies he made the remark a short time later six black students allegedly beat a white student unconscious in a schoolyard fight and though the victim of that fight was well enough to attend a school function that night five of his teenage assailants were booked on charges of attempted murder the charges were eventually reduced amid pressure from critics and mychal bell the first to be tried was convicted this summer of aggravated battery and conspiracy to commit the crime but a judge threw out the latter charge and an appeals court last week ruled mr bell shouldnt have been charged as an adult in the first place because he was years old at the time of the fight mr walters has said he will appeal that ruling the state supreme court and as the new york times reports even as demonstrators were marching yesterday mr bell remained in jail despite a courts order for his release mr walters has said race has nothing to do with the charges the gist of protesters complaints is that in a town that is white mr bell and the other defendants were unfairly prosecuted while the white students who hung the nooses received only in school suspension as punishment but many participants said they were hoping to draw attention to similar racial inequality in the justice system throughout the country "theres jenas in atlanta theres jenas in new york theres jenas in florida and there are jenas all over texas " mr sharpton told the protesters as the washington post
