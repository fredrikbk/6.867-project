lee bollinger tough guy mahmoud ahmadinejad has his doubts about whether the holocaust happened he thinks the jewish state should be wiped off the map his regime funnels sophisticated munitions to shiite militias in iraq who use them to kill american soldiers oh and by the way his regime also executes homosexuals for the crime of being themselves maybe if columbia university president lee bollinger were aware of the latter fact he would reconsider his invitation to the iranian president to speak on his campus next monday mr bollinger notoriously voted in not to readmit an rotc program to columbia absent from the university since ostensibly on the grounds of the militarys "dont ask dont tell" policy regarding gay service members never mind that other upper tier schools including princeton dartmouth cornell and the university of pennsylvania all have rotc programs never mind too that in the columbia student body voted in favor of readmission by a margin in mr bollingers view "the university has an obligation deeply rooted in the core values of an academic institution and in first amendment principles to protect its students from improper discrimination and humiliation " mr bollingers position might at least be coherent were he not now invoking the same principles to justify his invitation to mr ahmadinejad whose offenses to gay rights and any other form of human dignity considerably exceed the pentagons after promising that he would introduce the president "with a series of sharp challenges" including irans "reported support" for international terrorism he went on to say that "it is a critical premise of freedom of speech that we do not honor the dishonorable when we open the public forum to their expression " were all for free speech and the vigorous exchange of intellectual differences though we dont see how mr bollinger can be given his decision to discriminate against young men and women who seek to make careers in the military we also dont quite see how the right to free speech a freedom mr ahmadinejad conspicuously denies his own people is tantamount to the right to an illustrious pedestal columbia is a selective institution in its choice of students as well as speakers its choices confer distinction on those whom it selects were it otherwise mr ahmadinejad would surely have better uses for his time we will say this for mr bollinger the tough guy act he promises for mondays introduction will be something to watch this time the irrepressible mr ahmadinejad were sure will bow his head in awe
