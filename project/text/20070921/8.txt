pay &# billion for a stake in carlyle group the parties in that deal also showed awareness of political sensitivities before the deal was announced yesterday carlyle notified key players in congress and the u s treasury "as a courtesy " said carlyle co founder david rubenstein while neither mubadalas investment in carlyle nor the chinese governments investment in the blackstone group is subject to official u s government review remarks from senior u s treasury officials have led to fears of a possible backlash against investment from the sovereign wealth funds "we tried to send a message to the markets and to the regulators that we have no desire to participate in blackstones management or have control " said jesse wang a senior official of chinas state administration of foreign exchange speaking at a federal reserve bank of san francisco seminar earlier this month "but we got feedback that people still worried about our motive " meanwhile as blackstones share price fell the deal was
