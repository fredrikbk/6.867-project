bernanke cites housing culprit global factors contibuted to home price boom bust more than fed chief says washington federal reserve chairman ben bernanke responding to critics who contend the federal reserves low interest rates earlier this decade helped create a housing boom and bust said global factors that held down long term interest rates world wide were a more important factor mr bernanke told lawmakers at a house hearing on the nations housing slump that while fed policy does work in part by influencing asset prices "i think the primary factor leading to increases in house prices not only in the u s but in many countries around the world was the generally low level of inflation adjusted long term interest rates in global capital markets " treasury secretary henry paulson told the same panel that a group comprising the treasury the fed the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission is reviewing accounting and valuation of derivative investments "particularly for complex narrowly traded products that become difficult to price in times of stress " many wall street firms have made big bets on subprime mortgages home loans to borrowers with sketchy credit by investing in complex securities backed by those loans as defaults on subprime mortgages have mounted the value of those investments has plunged worsening a credit crunch in the housing market the multiagency group is also examining financial institutions liquidity risk management practices and their treatment of credit products as well as the role of credit rating agencies in structured finance products he said the working group may come up with recommendations to alter regulation or policy in certain areas mr paulson said innovation in the capital markets often "moves ahead of regulation and policy " and that there may be a need to strengthen certain areas in which oversight is lax or ineffective between early and june the fed reduced short term interest rates to from in a series of moves beginning in june it started raising rates reaching in june from early to mid the year treasury yield the primary determinant of long term mortgage rates generally fluctuated around mr bernanke said that as the fed "lowered interest rates to and raised them gradually mortgage rates did not respond very much " the fed cut its short term rate to this week to cushion the economy from the housing slump and related credit crunch mr bernankes remarks echo those of his predecessor alan greenspan in mr greenspans recently released memoir and related interviews "i find this issue that the federal reserve created the housing bubble just utterly devoid of any awareness of who created all the other bubbles " mr greenspan said in an interview last week with the wall street journal many countries have seen home prices rise more than in the u s in particular britain and australia whose central banks didnt lower rates as far as the fed did mr bernanke was a fed governor from august to june over that period he not only backed mr greenspans low rate policy he also provided theoretical and empirical justification for it in speeches and research some economists say mr bernanke and mr greenspan are minimizing the feds contribution to the housing boom thomas lawler a housing finance consultant in vienna va says the feds low rates helped both subprime and adjustable rate mortgages gain market share from fixed rate mortgages arms he said grew from just of mortgage originations in to almost a third in brian sack who worked with mr bernanke at the fed and is now at forecasting firm macroeconomic advisers points out that expectations of short term rates help determine long term rates the year treasury yield was about a percentage point lower with the feds easy policy than if the federal funds rate its main target for short term interest rates had remained around to he said he said that the fed intended to boost housing at the time because the rest of the economy was so weak both men say it is harder to attribute the continued increase in home prices in and early to the fed a new study by economists jonathan wright of the fed and david backus of new york university attributes the continuance of low long term rates during that period to lenders willingness to accept a lower premium for lending over long rather than short periods due to "some combination of diminished macroeconomic and financial market volatility more predictable monetary policy and the state of the business cycle " mr bernanke and mr paulson gave a nod of support to allowing fannie mae and freddie mac to purchase mortgages larger than their current limit &# but cautioned that raising the limit should be a quick temporary measure coupled with reform of the two government sponsored enterprises fannie and freddie along with many democrats on capitol hill have said raising the limit would improve the availability of the larger "jumbo" mortgages mr paulson agreed that that market "is not functioning as normal "
