politics &amp economics china is in bind to raise energy prices beijing the chinese governments struggle to contain inflation is impeding its ability to revise energy prices a change seen as important to improving efficiency and curbing pollution chinas government long ago relinquished direct control of prices for most ordinary goods and services but it still sets domestic prices for some items including electricity and fuels in theory those prices should be regularly adjusted to reflect global market prices in practice china hasnt raised gasoline or diesel prices since may despite crude oil prices that have surged since that time pricing for electricity also continues to be subsidized now with authorities focusing on consumer price inflation that hit last month the highest rate since there is less likelihood domestic fuel and power prices will be allowed to rise to meet market levels because that would add to popular discontent but because prices are as chinese officials concede "artificially suppressed " they effectively lead consumers and industry to waste energy cheap gasoline encourages people to drive more and cheap electricity encourages more use of polluting coal fired power plants the result is a threat to the governments own commitment to improve overall energy efficiency by a year "energy and natural resource pricing reform should have a high priority to help achieve the governments energy conservation target and curb over rapid investment expansion however the current high headline inflation leads to delay in rolling out the reform measures " said wang qing an economist with morgan stanley in hong kong worries about inflation continue to rise a survey issued yesterday by the peoples bank of china showed only of households are satisfied with current prices a low another central bank survey of bankers showed their confidence in the economy also hitting a low with most anticipating higher interest rates will be needed to combat inflation the government said this week that for the remainder of this year it wouldnt raise the prices of goods that it controls which include in addition to fuels and power a few oddities such as salt and tobacco that move may have little impact on the inflation rate because its jump has been driven almost entirely by shortages of pork and eggs prices of items other than food have been rising at a pace this year but the move underscores how public unhappiness with higher food prices has put the government in a sensitive political position "we feel china cannot straighten out prices all at once this is a rather long term process " chinas chief energy policy maker chen deming of the national development and reform commission said earlier this month citing the social impact of higher fuel prices on farmers and other people with low income "they are waiting for a good time" to raise energy prices "but they havent found it " said sun mingchun an economist with lehman brothers once the surge in food prices starts to recede probably in the second quarter of next year the government may have room to act he said china in the past couple of years has made some progress in overhauling energy prices the government no longer tries to control coal prices for instance and it has created a system that allows coal burning power plants to pass on part of any increase in fuel prices to their customer the national electricity grid but consumer and industrial prices for electricity remain below market rates because of government subsidies
