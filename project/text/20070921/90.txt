schip of state congress will soon ship the white house a bill that throws huge amounts of new dollars at the governments health insurance program for children president bush will veto it what happens next will demonstrate whether the beleaguered mr bush has any hope of getting his party to toe the fiscal line in upcoming spending battles and by consequence whether republicans have any hope of restoring their fiscal credibility with voters its a big moment all the more so because the battle over the state childrens health insurance program or schip is a perfect first example of how democrats intend to play their spending fights this fall theyre demanding at least &# billion more than mr bushs own generous &# billion schip increase any congressional republican who votes against this hike will be accused of leaving "poor kids" to suffer without health care the goal here as it will be in all the big money fights to come appropriations bills a farm bill will be to make it too politically hot for republicans to stand by their spending principle so far that strategy is working a treat sen mitch mcconnell and rep john boehner both understand that this fall is their big opportunity to make things right with the base at least on spending prior to next years election theyve been exhorting or perhaps better to say begging pleading beseeching their members to think about the lost gop brand and to help president bush snap shut the government wallet at least in private the members keep assuring their leaders that yes yes they get it but as schip shows this resolve wafts away in the face of any democratic press conference accusing republicans of meanness toward children it was none other than ranking finance committee sen chuck grassley who helped craft the &# billion senate schip increase the iowan went so far as to suggest he was being a fiscal prude because his bill was cheaper than the blowout &# billion expansion from house democrats that proved a good enough excuse for more than a dozen other spend happy republicans to help give democrats votes for the bill in early august for the record thats one more vote than sen harry reid needs to override a presidential veto this bodes ill for big spending battles to come despite last years pledges to restore budget discipline democrats have been so busy chasing phantom justice department corruption and paying back campaign contributors with symbolic votes that theyve yet to finish a single spending bill with just nine days left in the fiscal year theyll have to pass a continuing resolution next week to allow the government to keep running it also means democrats are all but assured to try to finish the budget by wrapping most or all of the spending bills into one giant omnibus provision you can bet that jalopy will screech in at many billions of dollars higher than mr bushs top line number you can also bet that hanging from its sides will be special interest booty galore money for roads bridges katrina victims low income seniors homeless veterans and border security all this will be designed to make it difficult for republicans to vote it down and if temptation isnt enough democrats will also claim that gop members who sustain a presidential veto will be responsible for shutting down government or take the farm bill the house version of which has earned a veto threat because of its lack of reform and because it is the first in decades to include a hefty tax increase to pay for all its handouts democrats will allege that farm state republicans who vote against it are traitors to their ag constituents who stand to continue getting big subsidies sitting between his party and a potential spending binge is therefore the presidents veto pen the fight over schip has moved to the house where most republicans to their credit voted against the initial bill but with house democrats now promising to pare back the legislation to senate size and to remove its more offensive provisions gop opposition is crumbling more than a few are thinking about next years elections and how nice it would be to avoid claims that they helped throw impoverished kiddies to the health care wolves many house republicans in fact are working under the assumption that mr bush will compromise and give them cover for blowing through his initial schip limit they cant quite bring themselves to believe that the white house would put them in the very public and embarrassing position of having to override their own president on a question of fiscal responsibility and to be fair why should they for six years the administration failed to pick a fight on spending when republicans controlled congress instead letting every highway bill farm giveaway and pork project rush through the white houses newfound spending religion has unfortunately come at about the same time the presidents poll numbers have gone in the tank dont think at least a few republicans wont use that as an excuse to buck him now yet its precisely the position mr bush is going to have to put his own republicans in if he hopes to remain relevant in the ensuing spending fights the big spenders on both sides of the aisle are sniffing for any sign of white house weakness and will rightly view any slipping or sliding as license to break the piggy bank if the president rolls on schip hell be rolled on every spending question from now until he packs the china mr bush seems to understand the bigger stakes and only yesterday gave a feisty speech outlining yet again why he intends to veto the current schip legislation and warning yet again that he wont back down congressional republicans would be wise to take him at his latest word for their own sake the recent gop campaign over earmark disclosure is good politics and a start to recognizing voter anger over washingtons spending ways but its also a one trick pony conservatives voters will see the bigger test of re found fiscal responsibility in whether its washington representatives are willing to say no to big new government spending that begins with schip see related letter "letters to the editor the veto pen is mighty" wsj sept
