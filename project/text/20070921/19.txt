before he became prime minister earlier this year in cowley a sprawling town of about people just outside oxford manufacturing goes back more than a century the oxford steam plough co began manufacturing engine driven farm equipment in the area in william morris opened morris motors co in a factory here in and the plant has been stamping out cars ever since in morris introduced a small boxy car produced at the cowley plant called the morris mini minor it was an instant hit providing affordable transportation to an increasingly mobile and affluent society and becoming a swinging s icon between and the peak of production some people were employed in a massive complex of buildings here over the years the plants various british owners underinvested in the operation one owner british leyland was taken over by the government in as leylands assets were divided and sold british aerospace took over its car making operations which were operating under the rover name the production of minis and other models dwindled "this used to be a cold run down and pretty dismal place " says phil ewers years old who started working in the car factory in "there were so many leaks that the joke was you didnt need to shower at home on rainy days just do it at work " driving recently through the blackbird leys housing project built in the s to house workers mr ewers recalled how the area became a haven for drugs and crime in the s blackbird leys with a current population of was at one time among europes largest housing projects a bridge connecting the project to an extension across a brook became known as beirut bridge "it was a war zone " he says in bmw bought rover and its cowley plant it ceased mini production altogether in that same year mr ewers took a buyout and he now drives a taxi in march bmw sold off rovers assets its off road division land rover went to ford a group of british investors bought the rover cars unit for gbp about &# at the time bmw held onto the mini brand name and the cowley factory beginning in bmw began producing a redesigned mini at cowley showcased in movies including s "austin powers in goldmember" and s "the italian job " it rode a wave of enthusiasm for smaller cars and retro designs bmw made more than minis in cowley last year and the plant became the only bmw operation world wide to operate seven days a week in april the plant produced its millionth bmw designed mini from the brink of closure seven years ago the plant now employs workers bmw has hired many eastern europeans to keep plant costs down and there are now more foreign born employees here than british workers bmw says families now fill the parks of blackbird leys shops have opened and new cars are parked in many driveways reported incidents of crime are down in blackbird leys in the past five years according to oxford official statistics car related crime is down over the same period domestic burglary has fallen and violent crime the percentage of working age people claiming low income benefits dropped from to the data show "there is a lot more stability " says andy johnson whose family has served traditional british fried breakfasts to factory workers for three generations just outside the factorys boundary on a recent morning at johnsons cafe he stuffed bacon eggs and sausage into bread rolls for plant workers "foreign ownership has kept jobs in oxford " offshore ownership deals have also brought hardship say critics for an illustration a visitor to the bustling johnsons cafe need look no further than the condiment bottles on its tables hp sauce a thick brown and quintessentially british condiment has been a u k staple for more than a century until earlier this year it was produced about miles northwest of here in a district of birmingham called aston in pittsburgh based h j heinz co bought the sauces producer hp foods for about &# million heinz moved hp sauce production to the netherlands where it had spare factory capacity aston produced the last bottle of british made hp sauce in march in front of the empty aston factory signs on a barbed wire perimeter warn that demolition is in progress two miles away in washwood heath are the deserted sheds that once housed a factory that for many decades made londons subway trains it was closed in by alstom sa the french company that moved production to continental europe since astons unemployment rate has risen to from and washwood heaths to from well above the current u k average of "were told its good for everyone if foreign companies come in and invest in the u k " says zeff qurresshi who worked at the hp factory for years most recently as a maintenance engineer "but thats not true heinz was not investing it was deinvesting taking assets out of the country " heinz says it considered manufacturing in the u k but by moving production the company expects to save about &# million over the next decade a company spokesman says critics say offshore buyers may also move top managerial positions abroad for companies with valuable intellectual properties the losses could be greater still for example following the sale of some large computer game designers to foreign firms including microsoft corp and japans sega sammy holdings inc programming jobs may be at risk of leaving the country but so are revenues for things like marketing tie ins "it is not just the money you get from intellectual property it is the leverage this gives you into other areas such as merchandising " says ian livingstone a product acquisition director at eidos which is owned by sci entertainment group plc the last major british owned game designer he notes that one of scis creations lara croft tomb raider spawned a franchise including merchandise of the gun toting heroine and two blockbuster movies starring angelina jolie the auto business is vulnerable to job losses if production is shifted abroad during a downturn according to a parliamentary inquiry into the british motor industry in march foreign owners may "choose to err in the direction of axing jobs overseas rather than at home " the report said french car maker psa peugeot citroen sa announced in april that it was closing a plant in the english midlands to take advantage of manufacturing capacity in france earlier this year russian businessman nikolai smolensky moved production of tvr a niche sports car maker he had bought two years earlier out of the country bmw has brought new investments and revenue to cowley the munich based manufacturer says it has spent more than &# million on the plant since the factorys workers whom bmw calls "associates " handle parts of the assembly while robots turn stamped sheet metal into a finished mini in just six hours more than cars roll off the line every day the machinery is german and crates lining the floor are stamped with german instructions but bmw says it is increasingly buying british after an upgrade last year of the plants parts come from local suppliers up from says plant manager oliver zipse many suppliers are now located within an hour of the plant parts arrive in sequence as needed typically no more than four hours before they are installed mr zipse says the cowley plant used to import gasoline engines from brazil but since it gets them from a factory that bmw built in britain in that plant now makes all of the four cylinder gasoline engines bmw installs in its vehicles world wide bmw has contributed more than &# billion to the british treasury from income tax as well as social security payments for its workers corporate tax property tax and sales tax on its products according to a report by oxford economic forecasting that was commissioned by bmw overall the company was responsible for about jobs and contributed about &# billion to the u k economy in a figure that also includes bmws rolls royce production in the south of england according to the report the auto maker has grown to become one of the largest employers in the oxford area after oxford university and britains national health service "when there was british management there was never any money " said pat nolan an engineering manager who started working in this factory in now he says "youve got a feeling of future youve got a feeling of good times " marc champion contributed to this article
