exchange world shrinks stock market tie ups are at a fever pitch but obstacles abound the accounting world has the big four the auto sector had the big three and stock exchanges once a fragmented industry with dozens of players may be headed toward a big five or six but how they get there will be fraught with competition and political wrangling this week two of the worlds best known exchanges nasdaq stock market inc and london stock exchange group plc took steps toward joining the group of surviving players that someday soon may comprise just a handful of giant exchanges exchanges after all offer a simple product systems that match buyers and sellers of all types of assets while they differ in the details of how efficiently they work and the rules they use merging them under deep pocketed parents brings two major advantages strengthening the brand of the surviving exchange and reducing costs by spreading the best trading technology across as many countries and markets as possible all on one platform it sounds simple and analysts and industry executives are sure the world will end up with a handful of big exchanges but antitrust concerns interloping bids and protectionism can wreak havoc on any exchanges plans yesterdays surprise tussle over the fate of one of the exchanges involved in the latest round of deal making showed that the road to get there wont be smooth the battle began when nasdaq unveiled a deal to roughly double its size by joining forces with scandinavias omx ab exchange operator and borse dubai based in the fast growing middle eastern emirate as part of the deal dubai agreed to buy nearly all of nasdaqs stake in the london stock exchange under the plan nasdaq would take control of omx of stockholm while borse dubai would become one of the biggest shareholders in nasdaq with a stake borse dubai would have a voting stake one of its affiliates would be the beneficiary of a trust with another a stake without voting rights that would be managed by an independent trustee and eventually sold but just as nasdaq chief executive bob greifeld was presenting the plan to analysts the qatar investment authority snapped up a stake in omx raising concerns that qatar would keep building its stake and nasdaq and dubai wouldnt have enough shareholder votes to win the omx in that case the dubai nasdaq alliance could fall apart as could the nasdaq omx deal mr greifeld has been pushing for since may there also are political questions that need answering before exchange mergers are sealed while the middle east can produce nationalistic reactions in the u s including some yesterday on the nasdaq dubai deal even proposals to merge european and u s exchanges endure questions of how regulation will work to protect investors and set fair standards for market participants exchanges also have to balance governance in a delicate manner to maintain equal representation from different countries further although the rules that dictate the way stocks trade in europe and the u s are becoming more similar it will take years of prodding by exchange operators to persuade national regulators and policy makers to synchronize the rules to make seamless global trading a reality eventually mergers of stock exchanges could simplify international investing to the point that individuals would be able to buy and sell local stocks as easily as ones based in obscure corners of the world there also are unique implications in mergers between exchanges such as nasdaq and the lse because they play a role in setting governance and financial standards for companies that list shares for the public on their markets in time listing a companys shares on one of the "big six" exchanges could carry the same type of imprimatur as having financial records audited by a big four accounting firm but for the substance to match the style exchanges when they merge would have to improve their listing standards to the level of the top markets instead of letting each market keep its own standards most deals involving exchanges have been widely applauded for promoting efficiency for investors and increasing cooperation between players in an interdependent global economy as a result exchanges such as nyse euronext frankfurts deutsche boerse ag and chicagos cme group inc themselves public companies hungry to increase profits continue to survey the landscape for more deals the global giants wont all look alike cme which trades high margin derivatives products like futures and options has grown by creating products and selling them internationally from a base in chicago cme and other derivatives players could follow this approach buying nearby exchanges to cut costs and fill product lines others that have stock market units like nyse and deutsche boerse may continue to show interest in scooping up exchanges in different continents to increase revenue and expand their global reach meanwhile many smaller exchanges "will have to go" away either by closing their doors or selling to a larger market said lawrence leibowitz an executive at nyse euronext at a conference in new york yesterday with some small regional exchanges in the u s "were not really sure why theyre there anyway " he added increasingly deals between exchanges have to cross national borders or oceans as local deals become harder to justify on antitrust grounds in short some think exchanges are getting too big this year for instance the two big chicago futures exchanges the chicago mercantile exchange and chicago board of trade merged to form cme after a century of rivalry but not before a testy antitrust review in which many wall street brokerage firms complained about the potential market power of the new derivatives trading behemoth in six of the eight announced or completed major exchange related mergers or crossed national borders up from of the deals in and the of the deals from according to research from wall street firm goldman sachs group inc brokers and investors will likely check consolidation globally when it appears that the survivors might have too much pricing power over fees for trading but technology has helped keep costs down enabling exchanges to become for profit companies while paving the way for the fevered pace of mergers not everyone is clamoring to merge in asia western exchange operators have been working to buy small minority stakes or sign joint venture agreements but full fledged mergers could be years away
