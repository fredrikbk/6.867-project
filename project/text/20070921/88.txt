politics &amp economics democrats stall on gun records bill despite support background check measure staggers in senate amid infighting washington after people were shot to death at virginia tech in april the new democratic house moved quickly to close an administrative gap that allowed the killer to buy two guns despite a history of mental troubles it was a rare political alliance between the national rifle association and its foes on the left who together seized the moment to try to make federal background checks on gun purchasers more effective but with students back on campus the democratic controlled senate has yet to act and the bill is in jeopardy "im getting anxious " says paul helmke president of the brady campaign to end gun violence "i get concerned that the longer we are away from virginia tech folks are going to ignore the problem " for democrats in congress this has been a frustrating year with numerous presidential veto threats and republican delaying tactics in a closely divided senate a minimum wage increase took five months to enact with a new fiscal year starting oct spending bills are incomplete and a stalemate continues over policy in iraq but the saga of the gun records bill is something different a self inflicted wound for the new majority after the house bill passed in june speaker nancy pelosi d calif personally appealed to democratic senators to pass it without amendments "i wanted it to be taken up right away " she said "if its clean its over " but senate judiciary committee chairman patrick leahy a turf conscious vermonter insisted that the bill go through his panel and in the process reignited an old fight with his democratic colleague sen edward kennedy of massachusetts for house democrats the delays were all the more frustrating because the bills basic framework was already familiar from past congresses a mix of carrots and sticks to encourage states to share their mental health and felony records with federal authorities in the virginia tech case the shooter was able to buy firearms in part because relevant court records werent forwarded to the national instant criminal background system the data center that helps conduct background checks the nra lent its support to the bill and to protect its flank against rivals on the right it also won new language that for the first time allows someone banned from possessing a gun to appeal at the state level to have those rights restored some gun safety advocates criticized this concession but the bigger problem turned out to be infighting among democratic senators mr leahy who dislikes federal mandates complained that his small state would be hard pressed to meet the house deadlines for sharing information and therefore risked being penalized but it wasnt until august that he advanced his package which ran almost pages more than the house bill and added provisions that split the law enforcement community both measures promise new federal money to update records while states face future aid cuts if they dont comply mr leahys version has a richer "carrot" and gentler "stick " narrowing the records that must be shared and giving states twice as long before mandatory penalties can be imposed but the chairman then also reopened a fight with mr kennedy by including amendments to an existing law that allows retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons across state lines enacted in the law enforcement officers safety act continues to meet resistance from states and cities such as new york as an intrusion on local control mr leahys proposed changes would make it easier for retired officers to get around these obstacles and also lower the years of service needed to qualify to carry concealed weapons from to pressing for the changes is the member fraternal order of police a politically influential group that claims close ties to mr leahy and his top staff the fop says it is only asking for "tweaks" to the current law mr leahys office argues that as a former prosecutor he has a natural alliance with the police organization and has long been active on law enforcement legislation critics of the safety act in the law enforcement community point to the fact that mr leahys involvement in the issue grew after a brouhaha with the new york post over whether the democrat was obstructing the awarding of medals of valor to police and firemen killed on sept sen leahy angrily denied the charges and after the fop came to his aid he took a higher profile role in support of the bill today sheriff and police chief lobbies oppose reopening the issue "we warned the senators that it was something we had a lot of heartburn with " says gene voegtlin legislative counsel for the international association of chiefs of police in crowded cities the prospect of out of state retired officers unknown to the local force and not subject to the same training is a worry new york city police commissioner raymond kelly is a critic for example and mr kennedy vowed a fight on the senate floor "its outrageous this makes no sense " mr kennedy said in an interview mr leahys relations with mr kennedy a former judiciary chairman have long been strained friction has risen in recent years because of the massachusetts liberals lead role on immigration legislation a topic within the judiciary committees purview mr leahys office says it is "baseless" to suggest he was retaliating by adding safety act provisions to the gun bill party leaders are dismayed and a top democrat predicts "that bill is going nowhere " senate majority leader harry reid d nev will be reluctant to devote floor time to a messy fight sen charles schumer d n y an early proponent of the house bill has begun planning for a back up strategy if sen leahys package stalls mr schumer said and the chairmans office agrees that the chairman has promised the gun records bill will move as a standalone piece of legislation mr leahy says he is the wronged party if house democrats had consulted with him more in advance "the bill could be on the presidents desk right now " mr leahy says "i think we have made the bill much better and provided far more reasons for the states to comply " he says "i dont see how we have it delayed it at all were ready to go " bogged down the seemingly straightforward passage of a gun control bill has stalled april virginia tech student seung hui cho kills people before taking his life may senate judiciary committee backed by chairman patrick leahy approves a bill that would make it easier for retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons across state lines june in response to virginia tech killings a bill to improve federal background checks for gun
