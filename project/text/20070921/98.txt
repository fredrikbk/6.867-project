the daily fix weight of great expectations splits chelsea and its manager online edition the strange strained union of chelsea owner roman abramovich and manager jose mourinho is no more early thursday morning the london soccer club announced tersely that by "mutual consent " it was parting with its manager twice a premier league champion and the winner of europes club soccer championship with his former club fc porto the arrogant manager battled frequently with english soccer writers who belittled his smug statements and occasional tantrums yet in his exit he emerges a sympathetic figure to many because mr abramovich the tycoon owner and his officials had unreasonable expectations of greatness nay dominance "it was chief executive peter kenyon who took mourinho to the brink this week with his latest job specification for a chelsea manager the requirement of two champions league wins in the next few years " james lawton writes in the independent "this said kenyon was necessary if chelsea were to become a world brand the desperate home draw with lowly rosenborg of norway in a more than half empty stadium promptly made the projection as heavy as it was absurd as was kenyons demand of mourinhos predecessor claudio ranieri that not only did he win but by five goal margins and with at least one of the strikes coming from long distance chelsea have locked themselves into a surreal collision of big money and big ambitions and not as much hard nosed football knowledge as required to get through an afternoon at hackney marshes the site of sunday amateur matches " the daily telegraphs henry winter will miss mr mourinho "english football is a quieter more monochrome place without this portuguese peacock " mr winter writes "this is a sad moment truly sad we always knew this special man would leave one day packing his bags in the middle of night muttering darkly about the cloying presence of those in power who dared limit the orbit of this coaching comet a rebel with a cause this maverick of the managerial world was driven by the pursuit of trophies anonymous as a player mourinho chased vicarious fulfillment in organising more gifted practitioners to amass silverware if roman abramovich feels he can gather up titles and cups with mourinhos ease he is in for an unpleasant surprise " but times of london columnist simon barnes says mr mourinhos unmatched ego helped do him in "footballs traditional belief is that the team are an extension of the managers nature " mr barnes writes "why you may ask were chelsea not flamboyant feisty cocky maverick paradoxical intermittently brilliant because mourinho is primarily interested in power the maverick side of his nature is merely the way he set about claiming power for it is power not perversity that defines him as a result the team were in subjection to the manager this wasnt a team who cut loose ever this wasnt a team you watched for the sake of this player or that player " what will chelsea be like now under mourinho deputy avram grant no ones really sure sam wallace writes in the independent because no one really knows mr grant an israeli who helped shepherd his nations team to the brink of world cup qualifying mr wallace nonetheless takes a stab at profiling a quiet coach with some unusual tactics "as the manager of the israel national team grant once showed his players a clip from the mel gibson film braveheart in order to motivate them before a game " mr wallace no relation presumably to william wallace writes "he also commissioned a film director to interview members of the israeli public on what the national team meant to them and then had those clips edited into a video to inspire his players " the san diego padres have gotten hot winning seven games in a row to move two and a half games up in the nl wild card race and just a game back of the arizona diamondbacks in the west san diegos rookie third baseman kevin kouzmanoff is also on a roll hes reached based safely in straight games and has reached respectable batting stats after a horrendous start to the season "kouzmanoffs numbers practically demanded a demotion " tim sullivan writes in the san diego union tribune "good thing then that his resilience is remarkable good thing then that kevin kouzmanoff had the pluck to persevere " the philadelphia phillies endured their own bad start and bad luck to climb within a game and a half of the nl east lead that they have done so in spite of a wretched pitching staff defies received baseball wisdom rich hofmann writes in the philadelphia daily news "it is riveting some nights many nights this furious battle against the baseball elements against the games very history " mr hofmann writes "nobody reaches the postseason with this kind of pitching the phillies september earned run average is now which isnt even their worst month of the season and which has still somehow left them breathing you tell yourself it is not possible but here they are lashed to the mast bailing furiously still afloat " the new york mets have helped bail out the phillies pitchers by imploding losing six of seven games five of those by the bullpen new york daily news columnist filip bondy analyzes the awkward position of preternaturally calm mets manager willie randolph "if only he would throw a public temper tantrum randolph might do himself some good " mr bondy writes "that is what it always comes down to during slumps in new york fans and talk show hosts want to see managers get mad and hurl the water cooler they want billy martin larry bowa or lou piniella they want somebody some player to pay for these losses randolph stubbornly argues for moderation and he is probably right " the boston red sox have similarly squandered a big divisional lead now down to one and a half games in front of the surging new york yankees new england columnists today point out that boston is all but assured a playoff berth but doesnt look like it will do much with it "there is no great reason to feel optimistic about the chances of the red sox " bob ryan writes in the boston globe a fair point one that was also made about the new york yankees the chicago white sox and the st louis cardinals who all suffered through late season struggles yet went on to win the world series think sports spying starts and ends with the new england patriots and their coach bill belichick think again belichick disciple nick saban the coach of alabama has spurred fears among his sec rivals that he might spy on their practices "nine months and three games on the job and saban has gotten under the skin of more southern football coaches than a swarm of mosquitoes during two a days " kevin scarbinsky writes in the birmingham news "advantage alabama " meanwhile as print journal readers know well using telescopes and other devices to steal opponents signs was a fixture of baseball until major league baseball banned mechanical spying in former cleveland indians pitcher bob feller a hall of famer tells cleveland plain dealer columnist bill livingston such aids may have helped clinch at least two s al pennant races and at womens soccers world cup the danes are accusing chinese policemen of filming their practices why the sudden run of sports spying "in all probability it is due to the ready availability of spies now that the cold war is over and even maverick espionage professionals like jason bourne prefer to enlist the help of a guardian journalist rather than some ruthless finely honed professional warrior " harry pearson writes in the guardian floyd landis lost his long running battle to clear his name as arbitrators rejected his appeal of doping charges banned him cycling for two years and stripped him of last years tour de france title yet the panel which found testing procedures wanting was hardly definitive in its ruling as mr landis considers an appeal "the rest of us are left to consider whether an appeal can possibly resolve any of the ambiguities in the evidence whether it can help improve the anti doping adjudication system which is what landis said he set out to do and whether it would be good or bad or indifferent news for cycling which continues to thrash around in the quicksand of bad faith " bonnie d ford writes on espn com washington city paper columnist dave mckenna who has ably chronicled the washington redskins innovative efforts to collect more money from their fans has a new target "for the season opener against miami kiosks inside the stadium rented out hand held video monitors about the size of an iphone " mr mckenna writes "for &# per day or &# for every sunday home game this season ticketholders can get scores and highlights of other nfl games while watching the skins of course that sort of stuff comes with the price of admission almost everywhere else " perhaps not coincidentally the redskins scoreboard has stopped showing highlights meaning it fits right in among its brethren in "perhaps the worst scoreboard town in the land " as mr mckenna describes the nations capital tip of the fix cap to readers thomas r cervino david hallisey don
