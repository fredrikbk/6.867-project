brokers head scratcher on wall street this week there was goldman sachs group inc and there was everybody else during a brutal third quarter in which reeling mortgage markets and costly borrowing slashed revenue at some of its biggest rivals goldman reported impressive results marking its second best three month performance ever one key driver a series of savvy "short" bets that home loans and securities tied to them would fall and a &# million gain from the sale of a holding for the smaller rival bear stearns cos hedges werent able to prevent an decline in fixed income revenue that helped lop off nearly two thirds of its profit from the same period last year overall goldman reported net profit of &# billion or &# per share for the quarter ended aug a increase from the same period last year driven largely by lucrative short positions in the mortgage arena goldmans fixed income currency and commodities division hit record net revenue of &# billion accounting for a big chunk of the firms overall net revenue of &# billion a pop from last year at bear profit declined from the third quarter of last year to &# million or &# per share a figure that missed consensus estimates by according to thomson financial pounded by an downturn in fixed income revenue and a loss in its troubled asset management unit in which two internal hedge funds collapsed costing the firm &# million bears net revenue dropped from the same period last year to &# billion the diverging performance of the brokers capped a week of mixed results from wall streets biggest investment houses lehman brothers holdings inc kicked things off tuesday with results that beat expectations modestly morgan stanley which has a diversified business and is most often compared with goldman followed wednesday with a surprisingly weak performance while a diverse business mix and strength in banking and stock related activities offset bond unit losses for lehman and goldman both bear and morgan stanley were caught out in different ways by the turbulent credit markets the bottom line is despite the mixed bag of results investors got pretty much what they wanted assurance that the firms are weathering the credit market storm still some investors remained concerned about earnings quality in part because the firms all benefited from a tumble in the value of their own debt accounting rules require firms to take a gain on such declines if they are applying market values to some forms of debt or financial instruments at bear stearns the already dismal quarter would have been even worse without about &# million in such gains morgan stanley which also had a rocky quarter said it booked &# million in such debt related gains while goldman said it benefited from nearly &# million in this way lehman didnt specify its gains but said they helped lower to &# million the hit the firm took from markdowns on loans and securities morgan which has enjoyed a series of robust quarters under chief executive john mack was hit by losses from a failed quantitative trading strategy and steep losses on loan commitments to clients the firm said profit had fallen from the same period last year missing analysts expectations the street continued to show its disappointment in the firm yesterday sending its stock down for the second day in a row as goldmans strong results only made morgans look that much weaker morgans shares closed down &# or yesterday at &# but investors took a different tack when it came to bear sending its shares down a slightly better performance than goldmans analysts reasoned that investors who in recent weeks had questioned whether bear could weather the markets turmoil now believe the firm is a survivor because its book value a widely watched measure of a firms net worth has held up despite its recent woes if thats the case bears shares looked cheap and offered more opportunity for improvement than goldman in recent weeks for example investors drove bears share price down to a level that was almost equal to its book value per share a measure of a firms net worth the lower that ratio goes the cheaper a stock becomes signaling trouble goldman on the other hand is trading at a multiple of about times book value according to credit suisse estimates bears price to book multiple is at times "the market looks and says can goldman sustain a return on equity whereas bear is at a return " said brad hintz an analyst with sanford c bernstein &amp co return on equity is a measure of efficiency that is derived by dividing a companys profit by its net worth part of that optimism at goldman and bear suggested the worst of the mortgage sector implosion and the dry spell for leveraged loans might be over but with brokerage performances that were all over the map some investors remained unconvinced money manager gregory church whose yardley pa based church capital management oversees about &# billion in investments said he will hold his goldman shares and avoid the other wall street firms for now "id like this to settle down before i warm up to the bears and the morgan stanleys of the world "
