weekend journal review books the re enchantment of the world a secular age by charles taylor belknap harvard university press pages &# we live in a strange time in which religious belief seems to be flourishing church attendance is high evangelical preachers are household names and traditionalist congregations are more populous than ever and yet one has only to turn on the television go to a movie theater look at a newsstand or read about say sex education courses in the public schools to feel that our society is almost militantly at odds with revealed religion and biblical teaching meanwhile tracts on atheism ride the best seller lists alongside books of soft spiritual uplift from mega church pastors what age are we living in exactly a secular one says charles taylor the distinguished canadian philosopher and political theorist and winner of the templeton prize but his answer is complicated and in no way meant to suggest that religious sentiment is fated to disappear anytime soon far from it "a secular age" tries to explain the modern world to itself in all its contradictions these include within a secular culture the persistence of profound religious conviction and fervent religious observance in previous works such as "the sources of the self" and "the ethics of authenticity" mr taylor had described the genesis of a distinctively modern self consciousness as well as offering a broadly "communitarian" reflection on the strengths and limits of liberal society "a secular age" is the culmination of mr taylors intellectual project a project aimed ultimately at defining what it means to be modern the appeal of mr taylors work lies in its fairness he does justice to the achievements of modernity e g its self governance humanitarian ethics and respect for rights even as he raises unsettling questions about the "expressive individualism" and nihilism that shadow so much of modern life his prose can be demanding but he writes with a certain elegance too he is at home in francophone culture and philosophy as well as anglo american scholarship he leans to the left politically having been active for decades in canadas new democratic party but not dogmatically in recent years the catholic dimension of his thought has become more pronounced but his capacity for critical self examination is strong and his mode of argument almost dialectical tacking among differing points of view even extreme skeptics are likely to follow his arguments with interest and at least provisional sympathy mr taylor wants to discover what it means to live in a secular age to engage "secularity " as he puts it the question that he asks at the beginning of his book and that he repeats in different ways throughout concerns how we have moved from a god centered world of religious "enchantment" to a world where "belief in god is no longer axiomatic " he does not believe as some "secularization" theorists do that "exclusive humanism" what most of us would call atheism is the natural position that society arrives at once it has dispensed with religious "superstition " exclusivist humanism mr taylor argues has much less to do with the imperatives of reason and modern science than its newest proponents would like to think well before darwin he shows there was an ethical impulse that identified unbelief with daring courage and true self sufficiency this impulse one might say is fundamental to modernity but so is a religious one in mr taylors view the "desire for eternity" is deeply rooted in the human soul and the structure of reality modernity is not headed toward the unilateral victory of an atheism that mistakes itself for reason but if mr taylor takes aim at dogmatic secularism he has little time for religious triumphalism either he recognizes that "belief in god isnt quite the same thing in and " naivete is no longer available for the believer or the unbeliever alike the world where religion could simply be taken for granted where the self experienced the spiritual as a palpable fact no longer exists and will in all likelihood never exist again there are many reasons for the loss of religious naivete mr taylor says and for the secular mentality that may follow from it rejecting transcendence altogether the protestant reformation plays the central role in mr taylors narrative by denying the sacramental by identifying all "magic" with "black magic " by giving rise to a "work ethic" that has deep links to commercialism the reformation helped to pave the way much against its intentions to the world of anti religious humanism modern philosophy did its part too its rationalism describing a world of free individuals bound only by contracts to one another broke self consciously with the christian and classical past in terms not so different from those of the radical theorist michel foucault mr taylor laments the rise of a "disciplinary" society with its "rage for bourgeois order " he tends to romanticize premodern european "carnivals" as expressions of a chaotic lively antinomian impulse within christianity now lost in the new bourgeois order he says god became depersonalized and moralism became bound up with materialism but the bourgeois order mr taylor also notes gave rise to vigorous critiques of "soullessness " too friends of modern liberty such as adam smith and alexis de tocqueville lamented a "degeneracy " an eclipse of civic spirit and moral virtue others such as nietzsche took the critique of soullessness in an illiberal direction advocating a kind of dictatorship of the dominating will mr taylor sees modernity as a "supernova" that explodes into radical expressions of itself some dogmatic and some self critical mr taylor might have said even more about philosophys role he ignores for instance the "machiavellian" turn to this worldly necessity and away from transcendent virtues he slights lockes radical emphasis on "self ownership " an idea that seems to deny god his dominion but the broad picture he paints is compelling more than anything else mr taylor shows how powerless scientific materialism is to give a full account of the human soul how little justice it can do to human agency and lived experience the dominant "therapeutic" approach to human well being for instance often reduces men to instruments by confusing sin with pathology and by undermining the idea of human responsibility evolutionary psychology can be similarly reductive secular man senses the inadequacy of such approaches and thus confronts "cross pressures " thanks to modernitys own narrowness say its tendency to adopt a forgiving relativism its reluctance to see repellent actions as evil he may even feel intimations of transcendence again from time to time mr taylor playfully evokes the words of peggy lees song "is that all there is " and the answer comes back more by implication than dogma "no there is more " secularism mr taylor believes is dependent on what it denies and can never wholly "disenchant" reality it is true mr taylor acknowledges that there is no going back we are now in some divided way inevitably secular as a society and as individuals but it is necessary and legitimate to challenge radical secularism even on the political plane mr taylor is no advocate for the religious right or any movement with a "christianizing" political mission but he makes a persuasive case that religion is a crucial source of moral and political responsibility finally "a secular age" in a secular age has the great merit of showing that philosophical reflection need not end in fashionable nihilism or pragmatic utility nor above all must it deny the "desire for eternity" that animates and elevates the human soul mr mahoney a co editor of "the solzhenitsyn reader new and essential writings " is a professor of political science at assumption college
