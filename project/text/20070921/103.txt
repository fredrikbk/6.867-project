the numbers guy keeping the debate in politics to this side of pants on fire when presidential candidates volley numbers at each other and toward voters the truth sometimes gets caught in the crossfire in recent weeks ron paul overstated the u s death toll in iraq and afghanistan rudy giuliani overstated the impact on national crimes rates of declining new york rates during his mayoral tenure barack obama overstated the potential impact of an increase in voter turnout among black voters in the south and john edwards chose the higher of two government estimates of the number of americans without bank accounts to emphasize a point those statistical stretches were identified and corrected by a pair of web sites aiming to keep close tabs on the factual claims of the candidates factcheck org a project of the annenberg public policy center of the university of pennsylvania monitored the last presidential race as well it was joined two weeks ago by politifact a joint venture of the st petersburg times and the congressional quarterly that rates candidates claims on a so called truth o meter which has six settings ranging from "true" to "pants on fire " while the media covering the race often incorporate a degree of fact checking into their coverage of candidates speeches and ads these sites focus solely on verification thats a critical function in an endeavor where the solitary goal is to win votes "the incentives are far too great to twist a fact or exaggerate something if thats going to get you elected " says brooks jackson director of factcheck org the site may check any candidates claim that its editors and reporters find interesting but certain numbers crop up frequently candidates "use numbers very selectively " says bill adair editor of the site and washington bureau chief of the st petersburg times "they cherry pick to get the best numbers they can " adds mr jackson "candidates do like to use numbers because it makes them look authoritative and knowledgeable but quite often those numbers dont reflect reality " most campaigns didnt respond to my request to comment about the sites a spokeswoman for chris dodd who was criticized for overstating his own poll numbers said "we always appreciate being kept on our toes " but ron pauls spokesman jesse benton dismissed the critics who said the candidate overstated military casualties "they want to go ahead and chide him for rounding up the number a little bit " he said "thats something that seems a little silly " mr benton also criticizes politifact for its investigation of mr pauls claim that he votes for laws only if theyre "expressly authorized by the constitution " the site showed him a list of laws it said mr paul had supported but mistakenly included some he had opposed mr benton says the eventual posting which called mr pauls claim false didnt include the erroneous laws mr benton says the paul votes didnt result in any government spending mr adair responds "were trying to be as thorough as we can in determining if the claim is accurate " politifact took issue with mitt romney for saying in a comment about president clinton that "our spending on national defense dropped from over of gdp to today " he took the figure from the reagan years more than six years before mr clinton took office romney spokesman kevin madden says it was a deliberate choice to "clarify just how dramatic the cuts were " he says his candidates claims were "accurate and supported by the facts " mr adair says the site gives campaigns a chance to offer evidence to support their claims but not to add more commentary "we dont want this to become a vehicle for them to deliver their talking points again " he says pushback from campaigns is just one factor that makes political fact checking tricky business as the six levels of truth on politifact suggest its not always simple to pin down exactly what a candidate means and then to find an objective standard to compare with his or her claims a recent entry on mr giuliani puzzled over his claim that democrats are seeking to raise taxes by to the site pointed out that the numbers are right if hes talking about an increase in tax revenue not tax rates that claim got a rating of "half true " mr jackson of factcheck says his site concluded that dennis kucinich overstated health insurance company profits when he pegged the number at &# billion but it couldnt come up with one solid number either the sites dont measure the overall truthfulness of any single candidate and they dont expect to change the nature or accuracy of political discourse when asked if his site had changed how candidates used information in mr jackson says the bush campaign lowered its count of the times john kerry voted for tax increases after the press picked up on factchecks criticism of mr bushs number "thats the most dramatic change i can give you " he says "and it amounts to nothing " the sites do however help voters wade through the discourse "i hope we can show voters how to deal with it process it and get reliable information " mr jackson says email me at numbersguy wsj com read daily commentary about numbers and join a discussion with
