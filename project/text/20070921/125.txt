weekend journal taste the trend in trends "microtrends the small forces behind tomorrows big changes " by mark j penn was published a couple of weeks ago its title reminds one of the best seller "megatrends " by john naisbitt mr naisbitt also has a new book out "mind set " on how to interpret trends the internet search giant google has recently decided to offer consumers the google trends labs which allows you to see how frequently topics you enter have been searched for by other google users a retail industry think tank at the university of california riverside has announced a new trend in trend prediction prediction markets which will it says produce more prescient predictions about online sales trends is there a trend here mr penn a pollster for hillary clinton thinks so he writes "you cant understand the world anymore only in terms of megatrends or universal experiences in todays splintered society if you want to operate successfully you have to understand the intense identity groups that are growing and moving fast and furious in crisscrossing directions that is microtrends " microtrends may be on the cutting edge but trends are fairly new as well only in was the word "trend" first used in its popular sense as a description of a social tendency in an obscure british government report the "trend" was formally christened in when the british statistician r h hooker used it to describe the linear pattern traced by what we would now call a moving average "the curve or line representing the successive instantaneous averages i propose to call the trend " in the century that followed "trend" gradually gained a new meaning which suggests casting a line into the future that has no connection to what we already know in the s "trendy" became a popular adjective meaning what is voguish up to the minute and by extension likely to soon become passe "trendiness " the noun form was used in two dramatically different ways when uttered by the naive or popular minded it was deemed to be a good thing deployed by someone knowing or sophisticated it was used in a mildly contemptuous sense in malcolm gladwells book "the tipping point " we find a dialectic between the two he describes how trendiness when it gathers enough steam becomes a trend the tipping point for trend analysis was mr naisbitts publication of "megatrends " which went on to sell nine million copies what was the appeal a new york times reviewer denounced the book for of all things its cheerfulness "what is striking about mr naisbitts forecast is its irrepressible optimism if you are depressed by the recession or have nuclear nightmares try megatrends everything is better than you think and this chipperness may explain the books rise on the best seller list " the book was a slap in the face to the jimmy carteresque malaise that the chattering classes of the time felt was proper even in the reagan years in the event mr naisbitts predictions have worn well he foresaw internet networking the information society economic globalization and the rise of democracy malcolm gladwell added a dash of science to trend analysis he looked at the mathematical patterns exhibited by the spread of epidemics in human populations and applied them to the spread of fashions and ideas among human minds of course there was a scientific explanation for how infections work while there is no biological explanation for the mechanism of how one person wearing hush puppies can cause another to go out and buy a pair of the rubber soled shoes but that didnt stop million readers many of them hopeful entrepreneurs from buying copies of "the tipping point " now we have mark penns big small new idea microtrends have once and for all replaced macrotrends he proclaims "the niching of america" we are not a melting pot but a nation of niches accordingly he serves up microtrends out of thousands he says he could have chosen they include black teenagers going to church older men coming out as gay people getting tattooed meeting their spouses on the internet getting fatter and loving their pets children becoming vegans taking up knitting and being homeschooled the decline of baseball and football at the expense of archery soccer and skateboarding very few of the activities mr penn identifies as microtrends will be news to readers of newspapers and magazines most of which now have special lifestyle sections devoted to such things besides his surprise at the familiar kids are playing soccer mr penns trendwatching seems to lack historical perspective for example he celebrates the transition from a "ford economy" to a "starbucks" economy from an environment in which everyone could buy a car as long as it was a black model a to one in which we have the choice of hundreds of combinations of coffee strength milk treatment and fat level but he forgets that the u s auto industry went through its own "half caf triple latte" period in the s and s when consumers had a choice of thousands of combinations of colors and options and thereby gave an opening to japanese auto makers which sold a few well equipped models at a lower price in his quest to find microtrends mr penn also seems to miss the forest for the trees he marvels at a society that is fundamentally older yet working more but the increasing age of our society is driven by improvements in health besides having access to better medicine many have also given up tobacco and we have the blessing of technology that has made much work not a physical activity that wears us out but a mental activity that can be performed much later in life extending our usefulness and earning power the falling birth rate is also in part a function of our burgeoning information economy if we dont physically wear ourselves down we dont need to people our family with slightly younger versions of ourselves who can take care of us when our backs give out in our s childbearing becomes a matter of taste rather than necessity and we are healthy enough to have children at much older ages leisured enough to observe them at play at sports where all can participate not just an elite nine or team members or have pets instead all "microtrends" mr penn marvels at mr penn sees the future as a myriad of choices driven by individual tastes and it may well be but why are all these little trends possible because we live in a free society with a free economy and our choices in coffee sports and health care arent restricted by the government maybe thats a trend he can share with his client mrs clinton sometime mr schulman is the publishing director of the american a magazine of ideas for business leaders
