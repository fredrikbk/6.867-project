weekend journal the drivers seat volvo c volvo takes aim at the mini cooper urban hipsters and the like take note volvos new c goes on sale oct a jaunty hatchback with a turbocharged engine this dramatic three door will all but beg you to take it for a spin its sales pitch is alluring maybe even tempting enough to consider trading in your mini cooper after all the volvo is quite a bit bigger yet still a relatively small and sporty car it may not corner like its on rails but neither does the c wallow and push around corners like most front wheel drive compacts with a real back seat and larger cargo area than the minis it seems you might be able to avoid the resale shops delivery fee for those vintage chairs youve been eyeing certainly youll get some admiring looks from the denizens of your local independently owned cafe and the volvos price even seems doable starting at just &# not to dissuade you from being the first to park a c in front of your apartment building but reality suggests a few further considerations like youd better plan on making multiple trips to tote that furniture home provided you can wiggle any of it through the awkwardly hexagonal hatchback opening into the less than capacious cargo compartment that barely benefits from folding down the back seats oh and you might want to avoid keeping meticulous records of your fuel economy lest you arrive at the same conclusion i did miles per gallon overall stinks for a car this size the third point that the volvo costs nearly &# more than the far more practical but not so highbrow chevrolet aveo hatchback is probably immaterial thats because youd no sooner consider driving a chevy than you would building your wardrobe at wal mart still im betting youll easily overlook that first criticism as a fashion sacrifice whats a few cubic feet of cargo capacity in exchange for that way cool all glass hatch the fuel economy issue is more difficult to disregard as the five cylinder engines horsepower isnt really a fair trade but youll still jump on the c like deaniacs to the obama bandwagon as the car is too perfectly positioned not to ensnare you with its rhetoric now if youre outside the target demographic for the c say you live in some generic suburb of anytown perhaps you scrapbook rather than facebook or heaven forbid you have absolutely no idea what an iphone is youre as unlikely to understand the appeal of this car as you are to fathom why anyone wouldnt shop at wal mart to you the c just looks like a goofy little car a very un american one regardless of fords ownership of volvo "who drives volvos anyway " you might ask "other than college professors and communists " in the case of the c the answer can be found among the many brilliant ideas in daniel brooks "the trap selling out to stay afloat in winner take all america " mr brook names ikea target and trader joes lets add volvo to the list as retailers that have "grown wildly successful by noticing what mainstream economists and pundits have missed although education and income often track together for a whole class of people they dont " these predominantly young people tend to be well educated progressives "with a sophisticated sense of style but little more income than discount shoppers " says mr brook he describes this "enlightened consumer" demographic as largely disaffected with the contemporary status quo in america but seemingly unable to do much about it save for attempting to "shop our way out of this mess " so they buy fair trade coffee organic vegetables and michael graves designed teakettles from target and now the c curvy and stylish the c sticks to the swedish design philosophy that eschews the overt for the subtle yet its classy look is still irreverent its price while expensive compared to the appliance like economy cars of mass marketers such as general motors and honda still starts &# below the average retail price for a new car its also the least expensive volvo most important the c is a thoroughly foreign car its very size and design are a rejection of the american preference for bigger is better suvs and sedans the icing on the cake is a new customization program that allows buyers to select any combination of available colors and options a rarity in the auto industry which prefers to limit color choices and sell preselected option packages volvos "custom build" program carries a one time fee of &# which seems like a lot of money until you consider how deeply the angst ridden target audience craves any chance to express itself and how accustomed it is to doing this by way of materialism just ask the marketing geniuses at mini about their " " possible build configurations volvo should have no trouble meeting its goal of selling to cs per annum in the u s of course it helps that the c is a fundamentally sound automobile based as it is on volvos s sedan but unlike the sedan which is just another of volvos same package different size lineup the c is different or at least everyone buying one would like to think so
