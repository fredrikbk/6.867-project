politics &amp economics dream solution to recruiting illegal immigrant act offering u s citizenship may fill military void backers of legislation that could help hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants become citizens are trying to overcome political opposition by emphasizing the bills potential to help the u s military meet war time personnel needs the military has seemed receptive but some hispanic groups have expressed concern that the bill is a ploy to pull young latin americans into combat situations for which they wouldnt otherwise have volunteered months after the collapse of a broad immigration overhaul senate majority whip dick durbin d ill plans to offer by next week a smaller measure that could give illegal immigrants with high school degrees a path to citizenship the development relief and education for alien minors act known as the dream act is known for seeking to do that through education by giving undocumented immigrants a temporary window to complete two years of college after which they would qualify for legal status the proposal has a lesser known component that would offer the same opportunity to undocumented immigrants with a high school education who enroll in the military military experts say the dream act would significantly increase the pool of qualified recruits in the hispanic population which comprises the majority of illegal immigrants and which surveys indicate has a higher propensity to enlist than any other group although it is believed that some illegal immigrants serve in the armed forces they arent officially allowed to enlist "it would be tremendously beneficial to the military " says margaret stock a west point professor who studies immigrants in the military "it gives the opportunity to enlist hundreds of thousands of high quality people they will be encouraged to join the u s military " ms stock said dream act candidates are especially attractive because they arent school dropouts boast a clean record and will have been fully vetted by the department of homeland security "before even coming to the recruiters door " a study by the rand corp on military enlistment of hispanic youth found they are underrepresented in the armed forces despite their interest because they often dont meet some standards at the same rate as other groups such as graduating from high school "the military would love to recruit more qualified noncitizens " says beth asch a rand economist who specializes in military manpower "this is a potentially very recruitable group " on the senate floor tuesday sen durbin said the dream act would help solve the "recruitment crisis we face today " under the dream act he said "tens of thousands of well qualified potential recruits would become eligible for military service for the first time they are eager to serve in the armed services and under the dream act they would have a very strong incentive to enlist because it would give them a path to permanent legal status " a pentagon spokesman confirmed that defense secretary robert gates had been briefed on the bill declining to comment on the proposed legislation the spokesman said "we would never want to deny any qualified person the opportunity to serve our nation " about illegal immigrants ages to live in the u s according to the national immigration law center a washington advocacy group each year about illegal immigrants graduate from high school because of their illegal status these students dont qualify for federal and state grants and loans or work study programs only one out of undocumented high school seniors ends up attending college the bill would give temporary residency for six years to high school graduates who lived in the u s continuously for five years and arrived here by age during these six years youngsters who attended college for two years or served at least two years in the military would be eligible for citizenship because the bill boasts bipartisan support it has a chance of passing if its sponsors succeed in attaching it to the defense authorization bill anti illegal immigrant activists and some republican lawmakers who deem the dream act to be tantamount to amnesty are mounting an aggressive campaign against it while education has been highlighted in past attempts to pass the act its backers have been highlighting its military provision in july mr durbin told the senate "it turns out that many in the department of defense believe as i do that the dream act is an important part of making certain we have talented young men and women ready to serve in our military " bill carr deputy undersecretary for military personnel policy cited the dream acts role in addressing shortfalls in recruitment during a june telephone conference with representatives of veterans groups according to the defense departments internal news service mainstream hispanic organizations and student groups continue to rally behind the dream act which has been pushed since a few grass roots groups have started to voice concern that the bill is being used as a recruitment tool joining the military would likely be a more realistic option for undocumented hispanic youths than going to college given that many have limited financial means "we began to see the danger when the pentagon started to speak openly about how the dream act will help them " says jorge mariscal professor of chicano studies at university of california san diego "its a new tracking system to meet manpower needs at this time of extended occupation of iraq " "this bill amounts to an aggressive draft of hispanics " says fernando suarez del solar director of the guerrero azteca peace project an escondido calif organization that works with hispanic youth to discourage them from enlisting in the military
