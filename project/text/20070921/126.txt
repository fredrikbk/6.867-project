weekend journal tastings putting austrias best to the test for gruner veltliner a little caution reaps big rewards just a few years ago anyone who asked for austrian wines at most stores would probably be led to the australian aisle and anyone who asked for a gruner would have left the store groaning how things have changed wines from austria and especially its signature grape gruner veltliner a peppery white are widely available and widely discussed among wine lovers we have been writing about gruner veltliner for quite a while now but we had never conducted a broad blind tasting because there werent enough of them available nationwide but weve been monitoring that and now have found them in good stores just about everywhere obviously austrian wines are still a small part of any wine shops inventory but imports have risen sevenfold in just five years we figured it was time to put gruner veltliner to the test gruner veltliner is far and away austrias most popular grape more than a third of all of austrias wine acreage is planted to it its pronounced something like groo ner felt lee ner if you go to the excellent winesfromaustria com web site then click on "adventuretour" and then click on "wine rap " you can hear someone pronounce it and study some of the difficult language of austrian labels yes its true austrian labels arent much easier than german labels smaragd for instance is a special category of wine in the wachau region and yes you can hear it pronounced on the site we checked wine stores nationwide to make sure plenty of gruners were available and then ordered from stores in five states we set a price limit of &# and generally focused on younger vintages because these are the ones you are most likely to see we tasted them in blind flights over several nights having finished we would say that the excitement about this wine is justified but some caution is justified as well to get a sense of the excitement consider our notes on one wine "very serious wine and quite different from other white wines very very ripe but not at all sweet the ripeness creates a kind of big almost neutral base on which white pepper some lemon and some grapefruit play on the palate but its a somewhat serious almost somber wine not a happy go lucky fun white very much a food wine not a wine to sip and swirl some floweriness on the nose but no sweetness not fruity but ripe fascinating and fine " this turned out to be a from domane wachau and frankly when we looked at our notes and saw that it cost us &# we simply couldnt believe it what a deal some of the other wines were equally bold and interesting with tastes of grapefruit white pepper and very ripe white grapes these are clean fresh wines with the class of fine riesling but one problem we encountered was that there was an inconsistency of style with few hints on the labels while some of the wines were quite serious others were bright sunny and fun with little depth but plenty of upfront fruit they reminded us of the charm of an inexpensive chilean sauvignon blanc we enjoyed both styles but it was impossible to know from the label the price the region or the vintage which wine might be which even when labels indicated levels of ripeness and weight tastes varied from bottle to bottle in the wachau region there are three designations that are intended to give some indication of ripeness and quality from lightest to most full bodied steinfeder federspiel and smaragd more serious was the problem of inconsistency of quality while we enjoyed a majority of the wines more of them than we would have expected tasted flat and dull almost like bland industrial wine two wines tasted corked which was surprising since they were both closed with screw caps heres our fear austrian exports have increased so quickly and so dramatically that theres not enough good stuff to go around so were seeing more of the so so stuff we would strongly caution the austrian wine industry which is aggressively trying to increase exports to be vigilant about this the u s is an increasingly demanding and competitive wine marketplace where you cant assume youll get a second chance even the shapes of the bottles varied for no obvious reason and their size was no help either you might think for instance that a wine that costs &# in a liter bottle with a very plain label would be trouble but in fact that wine a from berger was utterly delightful and a wine wed serve at a party anytime all that said we would still urge you to go out of your way to find a gruner veltliner sometime soon these are generally far more pleasant easier to drink and better with food than most inexpensive chardonnays if you happen to walk into a wine store and see a handful of gruner veltliners that probably means the merchant is a fan and can give you some advice if you get one of the good ones you are in for a treat a white wine that truly tastes like nothing else dont miss that grapefruit nose and that long white pepper finish and if you do happen to taste one that leaves you cold dont give up on gruner try another one especially the next time you have veal melanie grayce west contributed to this column you can contact us at wine wsj com the dow jones gruner veltliner index in a broad blind tasting of gruner veltliner from austria primarily from recent vintages these were our favorites while there is suddenly quite a bit of gruner on shelves all over the u s its impossible to know what labels you might see these will give you an idea of some of the names tastes
