rather than spend afternoons lunching with the ladies at la goulue or picking out ball gowns at bergdorfs she puts in hour days at dylans candy bar the high end candy company she founded in manhattan thats rapidly expanding into fashion and "candy couture " "i never got the whole socialite thing " she says "i mean what do they do sit around and have lunch wear dainty clothes and go to balls id go nuts maybe its just my personality but being a socialite has no appeal " a new generation of heiresses is redefining what it means to be a socialite rather than trying to climb the social ladder through charity work and elaborate parties todays rich and restless want to make their mark in the business world they dont want to be ladies of leisure they want to be ladies of commerce more interested in creating their own brands than making the a list tory burch the philadelphia main liner and wealthy divorcee has her own fashion line thats carried by saks nieman marcus and other upscale retailers zani gugelmann another heiress has started a jewelry line while cosmetics heiress aerin lauder has launched a fragrance ivanka trump the donalds daughter is making a name for herself

want to be rich girls they want to have depth " granted a few socialites in the past used their money and status to launch brands especially in the fashion world lilly pulitzer a bored and rich housewife started selling fruit colored shifts at her orange juice stand in palm beach in the s and became a global phenom gloria vanderbilt carolyne roehm and caroline herrera also parlayed their gold plated names into fashion brands and profits the brooke astors and nan kempners of the world meanwhile remained content to host parties and spread their wealth to charities mrs astor who died this summer gave away millions of dollars in the new york area and aside from writing books never saw the need to launch a product "people like mrs astor were committed to sharing the wealth that was left to them through marriages or inheritances " says fraser seitel a public relations expert who represented david rockefeller and other friends of mrs astor during a feud with her son "they werent as interested in starting their own institutions whether it was in charity or business " yet while many of todays socialites call themselves entrepreneurs some spend more time socializing than selling fabiola beracasa daughter of media heiress veronica hearst proudly advertises her jewelry business but she is better known for her ubiquitous party appearances and dance routines on bar banquettes when she recently published her schedule for a typical workday in gotham magazine the lineup included an hour in the morning with her personal trainer a two hour lunch at manhattans le bernardin then a hair styling dinner and a party still there are a growing number of women who are rejecting both the party girl ways of paris hilton and the social registry strictures of old money to join todays entrepreneurial rich this new breed hates the term "socialite " which once meant grace and status but now implies laziness hedonism and catty social climbing a spokeswoman for ms burch for instance says the heiress "shies away from that label" since she spends most nights with her children or working on behalf of memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york her favorite charitable cause vanessa von bismarck has also forged her own path the daughter of prince and princess von bismarck of germany ms von bismarck says she avoided the aristocratic gatherings and social functions of her youth "there were a lot of girls i knew who were from similar families as mine " she says "they went to the balls and met some prince and married him and lived happily ever after now theyre just worrying about how theyre going to make the renovations on their castles thats not for me " after attending the london school of economics ms von bismarck worked in the city trading sugar futures after two years she grew tired of the london social scene which she says was filled with other european royals "its almost too comfortable " she says so she decided to start her own company and move to new york where her name and connections hardly mattered she launched bismarck phillips communications &amp media a pr firm that handles fashion labels such as christian lacroix hugo boss and max azria the company has offices in new york los angeles paris and london the only boost she got from her parents was a &# investment from her father to buy computers and create a "rainy day fund " her first office was a borrowed cubicle at a greek shipping company "it wasnt very glamorous " she says "but it was something that i created on my own " for dylan lauren her fathers success and fame as an entrepreneur was a bigger influence than the grand dames she would see on park avenue since the new rich have largely made their money from entrepreneurialism rather than inheritance many of their kids also are starting companies "it was contagious watching my dad create and design things " ms lauren says while she says she supports charities she adds that she declines most social invitations these days to focus on her business "my goal now isnt to become queen of the party circuit " she says "my goal is to create an empire of candy "
