the afternoon report mattels mea culpa online edition earlier this month after recalling some million toys mattel admitted that it could have done better overseeing subcontractors in china now the company is saying sorry to the entire nation of china on friday toymaker mattel apologized over its recall of millions of chinese made toys saying most of the items were defective because of mattels own design problems rather than faulty manufacturing the carefully worded apology was delivered by thomas debrowski mattels executive vice president for world wide operations at a meeting with chinese product safety chief li changjiang reporters and media not always the favorites of chinese officialdom were allowed in "our reputation has been damaged lately by these recalls " mr debrowski told mr li "and mattel takes full responsibility for these recalls and apologizes personally to you the chinese people and all of our customers who received the toys " to parse mattels apology it behooves one to take a broad view on the one hand chinese officials and manufacturers may well have reason to feel unfairly treated especially given the huge amount of bad press they got in no small part because of mattels problems in mr debrowskis statement he went out of his way to say that the "vast majority of those products that were recalled were the result of a design flaw in mattels design not through a manufacturing flaw in chinas manufacturers " but it also would also seem logical for mattel officials to take a respectful stance toward chinese officials as of its products are built there drew thompson the director of china studies at the washington based think thank the nixon center says maintaining good government relations is crucial for companies that want to build a lasting corporate presence in the country "its incredibly important " mr thompson said "its everything " bates gill who has worked as a china specialist at the center for strategic &amp international studies agrees noting that while its important to maintain good governmental relations in most countries it might be more so in a country like china "the government has a lot of control over the full range of factors of production in china " mr gill said "from land usage regulatory questions licensing labor all of these inputs for profitable production in china are you know controlled and can be manipulated by state authorities so you have to be cautious and make sure that those relationships are positive " china of course still faces nagging questions tied to lead paint usage in toys as well as tainted non toy exports to the u s such as food drugs toothpaste and seafood and just today another item made the list cribs the u s consumer product safety commission announced plans to recall one million chinese made baby cribs from u s manufacturer simplicity the cribs which have been linked to the deaths of at least two infants are made in china but again it remains to be seen where the
