the silicon shake up solar companies that dealt with shortage early prosper after oxygen raw silicon is the most abundant element on the planet but a shortage of a highly purified version of the stuff is shaking up the solar power industry giving companies that didnt exist a decade ago a chance to challenge longtime leaders this refined silicon the most costly and crucial element in solar panels has been in short supply for the past four years there are only about a half dozen companies world wide that purify silicon from sand and quartz and they havent built new refineries fast enough to keep up with rising demand thats left solar panel manufacturers who must also compete with computer chip makers for silicon to grapple with high prices from straitened supplies just as politicians and clean energy advocates are pressing them to cut the steep cost of solar to compete with cheaper less environmentally friendly fuels like coal most panel makers have signed costly long term supply contracts for silicon with fixed prices and huge upfront payments and pay even stiffer prices for silicon on the spot market if those contracted supplies fall short at the same time some have developed a slew of new strategies from recycling castoff bits of silicon to re engineering their production lines to make thinner more efficient cells some are even building or buying their own factories to make the silicon wafers that are sandwiched inside solar panels or purify their own silicon those companies that tackled the problem early have gained ground against more established rivals "the biggest players were much slower to move " said michael rogol a solar industry consultant for photon consulting in aachen germany "the biggest companies lost their steam" as a result sharp corp mitsubishi electric corp and bp plc subsidiary bp solar have all seen their growth slow after dominating the industry for years sharp the market leader by volume for the past seven years has stumbled after several years of double digit growth in large part because it didnt move to cope with the shortage quickly enough last year it produced panels that could generate megawatts of electricity or the equivalent of a single gas fired power plant about the same amount it made in ron kenedi vice president of sharp solar energy solutions group conceded that sharps growth rate had slowed because of the silicon shortage but that the firm was "working on all fronts" to be able to grow as fast as possible "everybody in the industry is constrained " he said to address the shortage sharp has signed long term contracts reduced waste and started recycling silicon at its factories as well as invested in new technologies like thinner cells it has also tried to climb up the supply chain sharp already makes most of its own silicon wafers and it spent &# million on its own silicon refinery in toyama japan that can produce tons of purified silicon a year sharp declines to say how much of its total appetite for silicon is satisfied by the new refinery but analysts estimate that tons is enough to account for about of the panels sharp made last year sharps struggles have left an opening for q cells ag the worlds second largest panel maker chief executive anton milner started to secure silicon supplies in early when spot prices began creeping upward the firm refused to sign long term contracts at high fixed prices instead it insisted on variable price contracts and looked for other ways to sweeten the pot for silicon suppliers such as dispatching engineers to their factories to help them improve their efficiency and quality control and then splitting the resulting savings with them mr milner recalls he used to handle most of the work buying silicon with only one other manager today a team of stationed in several countries works on it full time in february q cells acquired a stake of its main supplier rec group based in oslo the biggest maker of silicon wafers in the world q cells which was founded in and made its first solar cells in also started building a new factory at its headquarters in thalheim germany to make its own silicon wafers q cellss production grew to reach megawatts in and the company says it now has enough silicon supply to manage its rapid growth targets over the next decade but mr milner warns that soaring silicon prices will dog the industry "some companies are booking themselves into nasty cost positions for the future " he said thats a situation that could be facing germanys ersol solar energy ag last year it produced only megawatts of solar cells despite having the capacity to churn out more than three times that "our growth has been constrained by the silicon situation " said ersols director of investor relations sonja teurezbacher because it refuses to buy silicon on the expensive spot market ersol has had to wait several years for suppliers with whom it signed long term contracts in to begin deliveries the company used some of the proceeds from its initial offering and another roughly &# million capital increase this summer to fund additional fixed price supply contracts through ersol also bought a california company that recycles silicon in an effort to find an alternative source ms teurezbacher dismissed concerns that ersol could get caught overpaying for silicon in the next decade if the shortage lifts "we are very happy with the prices we paid " for chinas suntech power the fastest growing solar cell maker over the past few years the calculus was different from rivals unlike some of its competitors suntech said it was willing to spend for expensive spot market silicon to ensure that it kept growing and winning customers "we can do that because we drive down costs on everything else like labor and manufacturing " said steven chan chief strategy officer of the company the downside of this approach was seen in this years first quarter when some of suntechs suppliers didnt deliver and it was forced to buy large amounts of silicon on the spot market at sometimes triple the usual price margins dropped to in the quarter compared with in the year earlier period "wall street was not too happy with it " says mr chan adding that problem has been resolved suntech now has the fourth largest market share and some analysts think it could one day be the biggest solar company in the world while panel makers have been trying to lock in supplies keep some flexibility in costs and find alternative supplies one of the most effective ways to confront the silicon shortage is to use less of it sharp along with a slew of venture capital backed start ups and its archrival q cells is also pouring money into developing new solar cells that use less silicon or none at all some panel makers are adding mirrors or lenses to concentrate the suns rays and increase efficiency phoenix ariz based first solar inc recently came to market with the first "thin film" solar panels that use only of the silicon found in conventional solar panels the firms revenues are booming and its share price has zoomed up to &# at the close of trading yesterday since going public on the nasdaq at &# a share in june sharps mr kenedi is upbeat about the industrys ability to come up with such new technologies and innovations to solve the silicon supply issue "in a sense its a good problem to have because it means the demand for our products is very high " he points out "it is forcing us to do better " the silicon shortage has implications beyond solar companies bottom lines despite decades of hype and hope solar still accounts for less than of the worlds energy needs and is significantly more expensive than coal generated power it costs to cents to produce a kilowatt hour of electricity from solar panels compared with about three to five cents burning coal according to the international energy agency governments including japan germany spain and the states of california and nevada among others have created huge subsidy programs for solar the hope has been that as the technology spread it would achieve economies of scale and become less expensive yet the price of solar installations actually rose from mid to mid in part because if the silicon shortage said alistair bishop a renewable energy analyst with the german investment bank dresdner kleinwort they have since fallen about "the silicon supply is a huge issue for the industry " said mr bishop silicon refiners including the two largest germanys wacker chemie ag and the u s s hemlock corp are rapidly building new refineries but the tight supply isnt expected to let up before solar panel makers are feeling the heat "the politicians expect cost reductions " q cells mr milner said "how the silicon supply situation turns out will go a long way to determining whether solar is viable " yukari iwatani kane contributed to this article corrections &amp amplifications solar cells produced by first solar inc of phoenix dont contain silicon instead they use a different semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity a marketplace article friday said first solars cells contain small amounts of silicon wsj sept
