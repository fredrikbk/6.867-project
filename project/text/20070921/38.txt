falling dollar squeezes u s trade partners the dollars sharp weakening is creating a predicament for many u s trading partners few more so than oil rich saudi arabia like several other persian gulf nations the saudis have pegged their currency to the dollar for many years now the peg is under pressure because the weak dollar could stoke inflation in an oil rich economy that is already growing at gangbuster rates the dollar declined broadly yesterday falling against the euro the canadian dollar the japanese yen and the british pound the canadian currency briefly touched parity with the u s dollar for the first time in more than years like saudi arabia canada is resource rich and benefiting from the boom in global commodities meantime the euro pushed past the &# mark for the first time to set a new record with one euro buying &# late yesterday in new york the potentially imperiled link between the dollar and the saudi riyal was one factor weighing on investors saudi arabias currency has been pegged to the dollar since the link to the u s is especially problematic now because the federal reserve just lowered interest rates normally countries that link their currencies to the dollar follow moves in u s interest rates wednesday however saudi arabia said it would hold rates firm despite the recent cut by the federal reserve if the saudis cut rates that would only stoke growing inflationary pressures in july inflation in the kingdom rose to nearly over a year earlier up from just in the saudis might get rising prices anyway by not lowering interest rates in concert with the u s the country could see large inflows of capital seeking to take advantage of the difference in interest rates the money flowing into the country could also spur growth and consequently push domestic consumer prices up in may kuwait decoupled its currency the dinar from the dollar in response to similar concerns about an overheating economy saudi arabian officials say they havent any plans to abandon the peg to the dollar still some economists believe others may eventually follow kuwaits lead "well probably begin to see more countries maintaining a peg against a basket of currencies and not just against the dollar " says richard clarida global strategic adviser at pacific investment management co and an economics professor at columbia university currency pegs in the persian gulf "are facing a perfect storm " said steve brice an economist at standard chartered bank in dubai moving to lower interest rates when there is "strong growth and soaring inflation is fundamentally inappropriate " a move away from dollar pegs could add further downward pressure to the u s currency that wouldnt necessarily be a bad development for the u s since a weaker currency makes u s exports less costly abroad which helps to close the countrys large trade deficit that is a reason the bush administration has pushed china another critical trading partner with a pegged currency to allow its currency to appreciate an enfeebled dollar raises the risk that countries like saudi arabia and china with huge foreign exchange reserves would be less inclined to invest in treasury bonds and other dollar assets pushing u s interest rates higher in general countries can adopt several different approaches to exchange rates some like china stick to a regime of fixed exchange rates either against one currency or a basket of currencies and allow only very narrow fluctuations a second group including india adopts a policy of managed exchange rates where governments intervene in the currency markets others let their currencies float more or less freely china and countries in the persian gulf have seen an unprecedented flow of dollars into their coffers while linking a currency to the dollar can reduce volatility it also means central banks have very little room to maneuver in fighting inflation the advantages and drawbacks of a dollar peg have become a matter of intense discussion in the persian gulf because of the windfall from higher energy prices among oil exporters in the middle east inflation has jumped from an average of last year to so far this year according to morgan stanley qatar oman bahrain and the united arab emirates all tie their currencies to the dollar in the past there have been brief periods when saudi arabia hasnt followed movements in u s interest rates says caroline grady an economist at deutsche bank in london however the largest difference between the key policy rates in saudi arabia and the u s was and that lasted for just three months from december to february currently the difference stands at that could widen if the fed moves to lower interest rates again as many economists expect china is on the horns of a similar dilemma "i dont know what day theyre going to do it but theyve got to let the currency appreciate further and perhaps faster " says jim oneill head of global economic research at goldman sachs katie martin contributed to this article
