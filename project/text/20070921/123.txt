weekend journal taste de gustibus passage to india adam smith in a delhi market new delhi "i am convinced that you could buy enough spare parts in this market to build an entire airplane isnt it wonderful " so my friend shruti a diminutive sparky delhi native suggested to me as we forged through chandni chowk the sprawling market just down the road from the capital citys iconic red fort in a subcontinent still shaking off decades of socialist planning enshrined in its constitution even shruti is educating me on adam smiths invisible hand in a free market the real kind that is the first time she took me to chandni chowks maelstrom of commerce my feet froze in fear she grabbed my hand i shut my eyes and we plunged into a bewildering web of weaving couriers tooting cycle rickshaws buses bursting at the seams sacred cows sari clad grandmas and the occasional man stomping by with a pound bag of chilies perched on his head after a few minutes i stopped long enough to take a good hard look and then i noticed it order not a single laborer walks aimlessly around this place in every cranny nook and lane someone is selling something to someone even the men sitting on the sidewalks are ready for work "see " shruti points out "a painter with his brush a carpenter with files " and many of the shops are so good at what they do that they have been in business for hundreds of years selling exactly the same product continually refined this mind you is a market that predates smith himself built in by the mughal emperor shah jahans daughter jahanara chandni chowk covers several football fields worth of space the shopping conditions arent attractive at first glance many of the crumbling buildings dont even look stable its the top quality goods that draw the crowds theres no government imposing order and why should it as smith said theres a "certain propensity" in human nature to "truck barter and exchange one thing for another " so its natural that a certain kind of system guided by an "invisible hand " results chandni chowk must be the perfect place to watch it at work first stop parawthe wala established in by ghasni ram a brahmin who cooked only parathas a kind of fried bread for a small fee on a street of silvermakers he was so good at it that he was soon turning a pretty rupee and by the turn of the century more than paratha shops had opened nearby the street was soon renamed "paratha street " competition slowly winnowed out the weaker restaurants and more than years later only three remain including the original its fifth generation owner abhishek dixit tells us mr dixits shop embodies the division of labor described in the "wealth of nations " one man takes orders the second puts the ingredients into the dough and kneads it the third fries the bread and theyre pretty good at it "the last cook was here over years " says the slightly chubby genial mr dixit what does he think of competition "if mcdonalds opens we are not scared delhi is a food culture we sell different products " and how does he differentiate his parathas from those of the other two sellers just down the road "if the quality is high thats how i make money " does he advertise "never its only spread by word of mouth " we were ready to help after we stuffed down a few ourselves next stop anil sethi &amp sons an oxidized silver shop on a street laden with silvermakers staffed by the year old mr sethi and his two sons vikas and vishal shruti and i squeeze onto slim wooden benches facing mr sethi who produces a book of his wares lamps mirrors keychains earrings walking sticks cups jewelry boxes pitchers vases furniture yes furniture tablas sitar boxes candlesticks ashtrays in the form of little shoes an exquisitely crafted mirror who designs the products "i design everything myself " mr sethi declares did you study design or business "i dont have a business degree " he exclaims "if you are here " he says gesturing to his wares and his flourishing shop "you can do the business " how do you hedge the fluctuating price of silver "i dont " "he doesnt know what hedging is " shruti confides how long have you been in business "my grandfather founded this shop " have you ever advertised "everyone knows me do you like plain bangles " further down the road chiranji lal ram lal a tidy one room affair piled high with popcorn maize corn flakes dal and rice in a brutal commodities industry this shop has been in existence for more than years a small group of workers gathers to stare at the sight of shruti and me questioning the year old manager bishanchand when we ask him how hes stayed afloat he shrugs and says "im not worried " if you can survive in chandni chowk you can survive anywhere we end the day at a bangladeshi sweets store that sells curd like delicacies the line is long so its the best around shruti assures me as she wends her way to the front jostling for the best ones this is a woman who isnt afraid of a little competition ms kissel is editor of the wall street journal asias editorial page
