how two guys plan to unite america on july the idea is to wave towels for national reconciliation hulk hogan wants you freedom pa a year ago two longtime friends were driving through this small town of on the ohio river and its name got them talking it seemed to them that the nation was more divided than ever over the war and politics not to mention immigration race and abortion so the two of them bruce johnson a former disc jockey who delivers local fruit and vegetables and john maielli who has a silk screening and painting business came up with a wildly ambitious plan for national reconciliation what the country needs they thought was a unifying rally like event that would be free from politics and in which everyone could participate waving a towel seemed perfect towel waving has been local sport ever since a gravelly voiced sportscaster named myron cope came up with the pittsburgh steelers terrible towel more than years ago "a certain amount of energy is released when you wave a towel " explains mr johnson its democratic it doesnt require skill or money wavers feel kinship with fellow wavers as the event was envisioned millions of americans across the country would participate in a national wave simultaneously twirling above their heads a red white and blue towel called the "official uniting towel of america " organizers picked friday july when people are more inclined to feel patriotic it would take place at p m eastern time before most local fireworks go off on the east coast and at a decent hour in the west to give enough time for stragglers to join in the national wave would last minutes people come up with ideas like this all the time for weeklong bans on television watching or for days when people are supposed to bike or run or walk for charity many fizzle this one seems to be gaining traction getting the whole country on board was clearly going to be an ambitious task so the two men recruited two other local businessmen and founded the nonprofit freedom group of america they recruited area businesses to be sponsors and kicked in their own money they trademarked "national wave" and "official uniting towel of america" and hired an advertising agency to spread the word thats where professional wrestling legend hulk hogan came in "we needed a spokesperson " says mr johnson the group wanted someone not associated with a political party popular with young and old and known for helping charities several names were bandied about michael jordan and terry bradshaw were two "the one we kept coming back to was hulk hogan " says mr johnson he notes that mr hogan whose given name is terry bollea is a big backer of the make a wish foundation the ad agency called mr hogans agent darren prince whose west orange n j company prince marketing group also represents magic johnson and dennis rodman "i thought it was an interesting concept " says mr prince his clients get many requests for appearances and cant do them all he asked for more information and was impressed "this was not just an idea but something credible they had done their homework and research " says mr prince the freedom group had a plan to get other celebrities involved and mr johnson drove nine hours from pittsburgh to wisconsin to pitch the idea to vern fowler director of promotional and institutional sales for mcarthur towel &amp sports which makes terrible towels and also made the cubs world series towels many of which were left unsold and had to be burned under a licensing agreement "we hit it off right away " says mr fowler the company agreed to contract out the manufacturing unlike the event hands across america where people met at designated locations to hold hands and raise money for the hungry and homeless the wave wouldnt require any particular meeting point people would conveniently wave their towels in their living rooms at picnics in restaurants or at local parks boy scouts and girl scouts churches and schools could sell the towels to raise money for their organizations towels could be sold at retail outlets for a suggested price of &# companies could pay to be the official airline restaurant hotel or shampoo of the national wave fast food places could give them away as promotional items proceeds would go to charity mr prince says he faxed the information to mr hogan who called back that evening "i thought it was a great idea and im proud to be a part of it " he says although mr hogan isnt being paid prince marketing has been retained for an undisclosed fee to contact other celebrities and sponsors to volunteer on labor day mr hogan visited freedom which was picked as the official birthplace of the national wave because its where the idea crystallized and because its name is apropos after unveiling a two story electronic sign marking the days hours and minutes until p m on july he stood on stage with a wave mascot a college student wearing a nylon foot tall replica of the official uniting towel and pressed a crowd of several thousand people to wave commemorative towels "its time for us to make history right here in this town " said mr hogan "we have an opportunity to bring america back together again " that night he was interviewed on "the insider " the cbs entertainment news show celebrity web sites picked up the story the following week prince marketing sent videos of the labor day event to agents representing several celebrities including rosie odonnell who have had public squabbles with other celebrities they are being asked to back the unity theme by agreeing to make up at least for minutes with their nemesis maybe shake hands for the good of the nation for charity and for a photo op a caption will run under the picture of the momentary peace reading "if these two can unite for our country then we all can july " the celebrities were selected by the freedom group and its advertising firm ddaniel agency there are many possibilities if "view" co host elisabeth hasselbeck doesnt want to make up with rosie odonnell maybe donald trump will be willing ditto with al sharpton ideally the civil rights activist would make up with don imus who was fired by cbs for his disparaging racial remarks but if that doesnt work mr sharpton could make up with any number of other people "we gave ourselves a little slack to work with " says craig stanionis of ddaniel agency at this point none of the polarized celebrities have committed to a public fence mending but none have said no either a spokesman for ms odonnell says she cant commit at this time because she has a very busy schedule mr prince says he talked to hillary clinton friday night at a fund raiser at magic johnsons beverly hills house because he wants bill clinton to help out it could be a tough sell like mr hogan these people are invited to charity events all the time they are busy but mr hogan doesnt think its an impossible challenge "i think they can set aside their egos and differences for minutes for america they dont have to be best friends " he says meanwhile back in freedom don zahn mayor and town code enforcement officer is just happy his town can play a role "were proud to be the birthplace of the national wave " he says he hopes it might generate sorely needed economic development valvoline the last major employer in town closed its refinery in the s
