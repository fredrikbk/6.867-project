politics &amp economics bush bashes democrats on health differences over funding of insurance for children preview battleground washington with health care emerging as a crucial battleground in the election the white house and congressional democrats clashed over a major question in that debate how much help should the government provide to cover uninsured children president bush called a news conference yesterday primarily to accuse democrats of playing politics with the year old state childrens health insurance program which is set to expire on sept democrats and some senate republicans are pushing for a &# billion five year expansion of the program known as schip house and senate negotiators are finalizing a deal that closely tracks a senate passed bill extending coverage in the program to about eight million people mostly children up from about six million enrolled currently mr bush favors a &# billion expansion which the congressional budget office said would reduce current enrollment he is threatening to veto the version that congress is likely to vote on next week that raises the specter of a near term lapse in funds for the programs in about a dozen states "members of congress are putting health coverage for poor children at risk so they can score political points in washington " mr bush said democrats responded by accusing mr bush of disregard for the uninsured "its outrageous that there are nearly nine million uninsured children in america and over more since " sen edward kennedy of massachusetts said in a statement democrats and some republicans said mr bush was playing politics himself in hopes of appealing to fiscal conservatives who have been critical of recent federal spending some lawmakers said the president is being inconsistent because his administration has granted some states permission to expand their programs to cover adults and children at income levels that he now says are unacceptable mr grassley warned "political problems" would result for republicans if congress must repeatedly vote to extend the program for a few months at a time that may emerge as the fallback position if mr bush vetoes the bill and the stalemate with lawmakers continues many republicans worry about the potential political fallout from voting against health insurance for children an ideological debate is underlying the tussle mr bush alleges that democrats are trying to lay the groundwork for a vast expansion of government provided care that eventually would undermine private insurers "their schip plan is an incremental step toward the goal of government run health care for every american " he said democrats and their allies for their part say many states rely on private insurance companies to deliver government funded schip benefits democrats increasingly are supporting a mix of private sector insurance along with expansions of public programs as a method of providing coverage to all a theme of several presidential candidates health plans the fight over schip foreshadows a potentially much bigger fight in after the presidential election over how to expand coverage for health care even though the final agreement is expected to include a higher tobacco tax increase than was passed in the house republicans and democrats were predicting that about to house republicans might support the final legislation the senate is likely to have the votes to override mr bushs expected veto but the house probably wont to keep the program operating congress is likely to pass a temporary extension of perhaps three months that would put about a dozen states in immediate danger of running out of funds administration officials said
