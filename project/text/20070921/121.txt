weekend journal review theater just a cockeyed idealist the time of your life shakespeare theatre of new jersey f m kirby shakespeare theatre drew university madison ave madison n j &# &# closes sept merrily we roll along signature theatre campbell ave arlington va &# &# closes oct madison n j few artists have been done dirtier by posterity than william saroyan for a time he was one of americas best known writers and "the time of your life " his most successful play won a pulitzer in but then america fell out of love with saroyan and he had lapsed into half remembered obscurity long before his death in not even "the time of your life" has held the stage and when the shakespeare theatre of new jersey one of the best companies in the new york area announced a revival i was eager to see what they would do with a play so completely out of favor the good news is that it has turned out to be far more theatrically potent than i could possibly have imagined on paper theres nothing much to "the time of your life " which is set in a seedy san francisco bar just after the start of world war ii joe andrew weems sits and guzzles champagne as a string of variously eccentric drinkers come and go at plays end he rouses himself from his sozzled torpor does a good turn for an unhappy whore sofia jean gomez and returns at last to the world he had renounced thats all there is to it really except for the goofy good humor with which saroyan portrays the patrons of nicks pacific street saloon from harry blake hackler the hapless hoofer who longs to be a comedian but is utterly unfunny to kit carson edmond genest a half senile old man who claims to have been a sharpshooting pioneer saroyan fills the stage with characters whose cockeyed charm wins you over whats it all about no prizes for guessing that joe is a heartsore idealist whose natural optimism has been ground to dust by the great depression or that it is the coming struggle against fascism personified by a thuggish cop with totalitarian tendencies that brings him back to life saroyan makes sure you get the point just as he takes care to give joe a speech that rams home the plays stop and smell the flowers philosophy "why do i drink because i dont like to be gypped because i dont like to be dead most of the time and just a little alive every once in a while " more often though saroyan is content merely to turn his characters loose and revel in their peculiarities and paul mullins the director of this exceedingly smart revival has clearly encouraged his large talented cast to make the most of them just about everyone is memorable as is james wolks set a decaying downstairs saloon littered with such nostalgia laden items as an nra "we do our part" sign and an ancient jukebox that plays "im getting sentimental over you " no "the time of your life" isnt a deathless masterpiece but like so many american plays of the s and s it is an appealing piece of work that is more than capable of casting its spell on modern audiences if mounted effectively in the past couple of seasons ive seen revivals that made a persuasive case for such dusty chestnuts as "biography " "old acquaintance " "room service" and "susan and god " that the shakespeare theatre of new jersey has done as well by "the time of your life" is cause for rejoicing arlington va i have bones to pick with signature theatres production of stephen sondheims "merrily we roll along " so let me start by saying that this too is an important revival one that to my mind decisively establishes the viability of a show long thought flawed beyond repair sondheim buffs will of course want to see it many of them undoubtedly already have but you dont have to be a fanatic to be impressed by this hard headed soft hearted study of the high cost of success like the george s kaufman moss hart play on which it is based "merrily we roll along" runs in reverse it starts in the present showing us the hollow triumph of a songwriter who gave up music to become a hollywood producer then turns back the clock so that we can watch him selling out by installments the score is one of mr sondheims strongest but the shows unrelieved pessimism and structural trickery turned off broadway audiences and the original production closed after just performances fortunately mr sondheim and george furth who had previously collaborated on "company" kept on tinkering with "merrily " in time they came up with a much altered version meant to make us care about the fate of franklin shepard will gartshore the sondheim like songwriter who unlike his creator betrays his art and friends and lovers by jettisoning his idealism and going for the gold in this revised slimmed down version the shows ironic arc it begins in bitter disillusion and moves "forward" to a happy "ending" full of youthful hope for the future now makes dramatic and emotional sense eric schaeffer who as artistic director of signature theatre has earned a well deserved national reputation for his sondheim stagings has opted this time for a bare bones production similar in feel to a semistaged concert version it is alas too obviously based on john doyles recent broadway revival of "company " right down to the big black piano at center stage on which mr sondheims songwriter antihero accompanies himself a la raul esparza unlike mr doyles "company " though mr schaeffers "merrily" is visually static notwithstanding karma camps lively choreography most of the members of the supporting ensemble fail to make a sufficiently sharp impression but mr gartshore erik liberman and tracy lynn olivera who play the bosom buddies whose friendship is sundered by ambition are all completely convincing while tory ross packs a brassy comic punch as gussie franklins second wife dont be put off by these cavils the important thing about signature theatres "merrily we roll along" is that the show itself comes through clearly it is i suspect too sour an apple ever to be popular but stranger things have happened and in any case it can now take its rightful place alongside "company" and "sweeney todd" as one of mr sondheims most gripping studies of life without love
