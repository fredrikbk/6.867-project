weekend journal review film penns into the wild is beautiful stirring complex a rare movie of ideas assassination of jesse james hits its target given the subject of "into the wild " which was directed and adapted by sean penn you would expect it to be as big as all outdoors and so it is seldom has the call of the wild been answered by such soul filling images the cinematographer was eric gautier indeed theres a bit too much of it the running time is minutes and a few stylistic excesses like multipanel split screens could have been excised still too muchness is the essence of the story a heros gallant possibly mad and inevitably doomed attempt to channel too much experience and too many ideas through one young life that cant possibly hold it all mr penns screen version of the jon krakauer book is gallant in its turn but holds together remarkably well from seductive start to shattering finish the film is as stirring entertaining and steadfastly thrilling as it is beautiful when we first see the hero chris mccandless hes about to head off into the wilderness with his life stuffed into a back pack like any number of earnest hippies of the s but this isnt some catskill mountain idyll on the way to woodstock its harsh unforgiving alaska in the early s and chris far from being earnest burns with a desire to put all the trappings of civilization behind him "peril adversity and tolstoyan renunciation" were what his real life subject was seeking during a two year odyssey jon krakauer wrote in a preface to his marvelous book a kid from a prosperous though profoundly troubled east coast family his parents are ghastly but played with notable restraint by william hurt and marcia gay harden chris has a sweet spirit a generous heart a cruelly narcissistic streak not a word of his whereabouts to the sister he loves a smile that could cause sunburn an ambiguous or at least unexpressed sexuality a college degree and a scholarly mind seething with idealistic and romantic notions that he has taken not only from leo tolstoy but from jack london jack kerouac thoreau and inter alia the boris pasternak of "doctor zhivago " feature films dont usually deal with such complex characters and few roles of such complexity not to mention daunting physicality have been filled with such a beguiling sense of ease emile hirsch seems only seems unconcerned with his characters contradictions in fact this element of insouciance in his brilliant performance reflects the limits of chris mccandlesss capacity for self scrutiny chris who comes to call himself alexander supertramp wants to live the examined life of an aesthetic voyager but blunders into it with unexamined survival skills that he picks up on the road in the american west an inward looking "easy rider" with a northward looking itinerary and gorgeous music by eddie vedder "into the wild" interweaves to haunting effect chriss earlier ramblings through the lower with his desperate misadventures in alaska wherever he goes he meets likable people who understandably like him and who are touched by him personally or in an unemphasized way spiritually one of the movies few false moments is its most violent one an attempt to heighten factual references in the book with a physical attack on chris that evokes in its anachronism the life and times of woody guthrie clearly sean penn a virtuoso of rebelliousness in his acting and his life has found a soul mate in his hero just as clearly this singular director has been able to elicit rich forthright and revelatory performances from his cast emile hirsch brings excitement to every scene hes in and hes in almost every scene if you thought you had a sense of vince vaughns range wait until you see his delicious turn as a dakota farmer catherine keeners smart but thwarted hippie mother jan can break your heart no one could have had a sense of brian dierkers range since its his first shot at acting but hes a charming imposing presence as jans burly boyfriend rainey as for hal holbrook who plays a desert rat named ron franz everyone may have thought they knew what to expect at this point in his long distinguished career but what he does is a lovely surprise and a quietly moving tour de force "the core of our existence comes from new experience " chris tells ron by way of urging the reclusive old man to get back into the world moviegoers will argue the question of whether the young mans quest succeeds or fails is he a pilgrim who finds the transcendence he sought or a wounded bird flying blind on lofty ambitions or both theres no arguing however that "into the wild" is a new experience even though some of its countercultural themes and tropes may seem familiar its a mainstream movie of ideas that lives in a world of fateful action the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford is there anything new to say about jesse james after all these years no and yes is the answer presented by "the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford " a slow and somber but ultimately successful movie whose word title befits its exceptionally long running time of minutes minutes longer than "into the wild " no theres nothing radically new in this darksome western which was directed by andrew dominik adapted by mr dominik from the novel by ron hansen and shot by roger deakins weve seen outlaws with jesses pathology as well as outlaws who bonnie and clydewise come to ponder a notoriety which amounts to stardom but at the same time yes this films distinctive formal beauty mr deakins makes memorable art out of a locomotives headlight shining through the woods its eloquent music by nick cave and warren ellis and its defiantly slo mo dramatic development coalesce into a new picture of the life jesse james might have been living at the ripe old age of spare in its appointments meditative though still spasmodically violent in its rhythms and toward the end haunted by the knowledge that young robert ford who idolized him would be the instrument of his death a good part of the pictures fascination is brad pitts portrayal of jesse james as to use the elevated language of the narrator "increasingly cavalier merry moody fey " psychotic too of course this jesse looks like he hasnt had a good nights sleep in a decade but outwardly sane most of the time even stabilized by common sense "theyre all lies you know " jesse says dismissively of the newspaper and magazine articles that romanticize his exploits the most mesmerizing spectacle though is the most elusive one casey afflecks phenomenal close to the psyche performance as bob ford this sponge souled sycophant gives everyone who meets him the willies and no wonder hes at least as crazy as jesse as he swings between worshipfulness and paranoid fantasies that the object of his worship can read his turbulent thoughts in a sense no ones at home behind his shifty eyes first he plays a provisional version of himself a self of slightly more substance than the nobody he feels he is then he studies jesse as if preparing an impersonation in the coda a theater production that explains the movies title he goes back to playing himself but the self of seedy legend who must endlessly re enact on squalid stages the act of cowardice and betrayal that made him infamous exceptionally long movies usually use their length as statements of importance though as often as not they convey a sense of hapless self importance admirably and unexpectedly this one dodges the bullet of pomposity the language of its narrative like that of its characters may be elevated a literary western version of damon runyon but the words are intriguing challenging and occasionally very funny and the long wait is justified by the ritualistic theatricality of the murderous climax you must remember this as time goes by dvd tip theres no doubt that timothy treadwell the subject of werner herzogs chilling but enthralling documentary "grizzly man" became insane the mystery is what impelled the seductive self destructive and again narcissistic young man to go off to alaska and reinvent himself as a solitary savior of the grizzly bears who eventually killed him
