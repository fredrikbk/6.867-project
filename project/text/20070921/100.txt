the fda vs small pharma western europeans began using quinine as a medicine in the th century then again they didnt have to comply with the modern fda in a little noticed program announced last june the food and drug administration is cracking down on remedies like quinine these belong to a class known colloquially as legacy drugs that is they are generally recognized as safe and effective and have been prescribed by physicians for decades in some cases before the modern fda regime was created in but since they lack a formal fda stamp of approval theyre being yanked from the market in a more rational political world legacy drugs might be "grandfathered in " since the risks they pose are so few the fda however remains under intense scrutiny for handling of pharmaceutical safety in the aftermath of the vioxx furor so the agency is pulling out all the bureaucratic stops to mollify its capitol hill critics like pete stark and chuck grassley legacy drugs form about of the total pharmaceutical market and theyre generally prescribed not to cure illness but to relieve symptoms cough cold and allergy as well as other specialty medications theyre manufactured by several hundred small and medium sized companies the active ingredients and compounds are approved by the fda and the drugs are synthesized in fda licensed facilities legacy drugs then arent medical moonshine cooked up in somebodys bathtub nor are they new or experimental drugs nonetheless the fda is requiring them to be put through the same regulatory wringer some must complete a new drug application which requires clinical trials and can cost between &# million and &# million per legacy drug the alternative an abbreviated new drug application still costs over &# million thats a lot of money to reinvent the wheel these costs are of course passed on to patients in higher prices assuming the drugs remain on the market and their makers stay in business the industry has small profit margins and lacks the deep pockets and compliance teams that big pharma uses to navigate the fda bureaucracy oh and if one company completes a new drug application the fda simply clears the market of competitors by removing other longstanding versions from clinical use in the case of quinine the fda can at least point to about adverse events since the s thats remarkably few considering that doctors wrote about four million prescriptions per year before the fda descended quinine which can be a malaria therapy was mainly prescribed to treat nighttime leg cramps though the drug can lead to blood clots or irregular heartbeats all medications carry some risk and thats why there are supervising physicians but how to explain the fda assault on guaifenesin a commonly used ingredient in cough medicines to remove mucous from the lungs the fda action targets only timed release formulations i e "long acting" not immediate release and the fda admitted that it was not responding to any adverse events in other words the fda is going after a drug class based only on its unapproved status the turning of the screws has also eliminated unapproved products containing ergotamine for migraines and carbinoxamine an antihistamine the fda admits it is being "aggressive" and says it will only become more so in the future there is a better way namely for the fda to give these drugs a special regulatory pathway we hear that congressional legislation to that effect will be introduced shortly fda commissioner andrew von eschenbach talks a good game about faster drug approvals and better science but everywhere we look hes presiding over an agency making life harder for doctors patients and in this case small business
