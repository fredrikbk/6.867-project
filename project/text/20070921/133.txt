why bank of england didnt do more for northern rock london in a grueling and at times testy encounter with skeptical british lawmakers bank of england governor mervyn king yesterday defended his handling of the crisis at british mortgage bank northern rock plc and blamed flawed legislation for events that led to a nationwide bank run mr king said british and european union laws on corporate transparency had prevented him from providing emergency funding to the bank in secret that he said left no option but to offer a public bailout which resulted in scenes of unnerved depositors crowding bank branches throughout the country "i pressed for a covert operation but there was strong legal advice that it couldnt be done " mr king said he called for overhauling four pieces of legislation including an eu directive on market abuses to make it possible for the central bank to act covertly mr kings testimony didnt persuade all of the lawmakers that the central bank had been prevented from doing what was needed to avoid panicking savers "in the old days the governor wouldnt have resorted to blaming the lawyers " said michael fallon a conservative party member of the committee mr king denied that the bank of england had stood in the way of a takeover of northern rock by a larger british bank a deal that could have made a central bank bailout unnecessary he said the purchasing bank couldnt arrange a quick transfer of ownership for northern rock because of britains takeover code which "sets out a long and prolonged timetable" for doing so the bank of englands reluctance to provide cut rate funding has been cited as a reason the takeover had failed to come together criticism has focused on mr king who initially refused to join other central banks in pumping large amounts of cash into european markets to help banks stay afloat saying such actions would only reward the kind of risk taking behavior that had led to the problems earlier this week the british government took the highly unusual step of guaranteeing all bank deposits a move that many saw as a reversal of mr kings tough love approach to the global credit crisis since then the central bank has been more nurturing providing more emergency financing to banks and accepting a wider range of collateral including mortgages yesterday it made available an extra gbp billion &# billion in short term funds and further loosened its rules for bank reserves mr king long an advocate of central bank independence denied the bank was responding to government pressure the bank of england was given sole responsibility for setting interest rates in at that time it lost responsibility for supervising individual banks to the financial services authority but retained a role in maintaining the stability of the financial system unlike the european central bank which sets its own definition of price stability the bank of england aims to keep price rises within limits set by the government both the bank of england and the fsa work with the british treasury through a tripartite standing committee in dealing with financial crises any suggestion that the bank of england gave into government pressure in its responses to the northern rock crisis or the liquidity squeeze in europes short term money markets would weaken its credibility as an institution committed to keeping inflation in check
