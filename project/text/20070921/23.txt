dartmouth lets avoid divisive politics while i appreciate the ideological perspective that the wall street journal brings to the debate over dartmouths governance and that of academia more broadly i feel compelled to clarify some points raised in your sept editorial "dartmouth diminished " first and most importantly in its recent governance changes the dartmouth board maintained a critical role for alumni in the colleges governance alumni will continue to nominate eight members to the board as they have since the much referenced resolution of allowed the alumni to nominate five trustees and their successors the board expanded that number to seven in and eight in alumni will continue to have elections to nominate trustees and will still be able to petition directly onto the ballot something very few colleges in the nation allow their alumni to do and these elections will continue to be administered by the alumni council and association of alumni if those bodies follow a few basic principles designed to ensure fairness and clarity in the election process second the reforms are not a reaction to the petition candidates elected to the board in recent years the reforms are first and foremost designed to involve more alumni on the board and to ensure that the board has the variety of skills backgrounds and capabilities that it needs to meet dartmouths needs in an increasingly competitive environment they seek to achieve these goals while avoiding the further politicization divisiveness and costliness of a political campaign style selection process finally these reforms were driven by one simple overriding goal doing whats best for dartmouth and its current and future students dartmouth has never been stronger than it is today admission applications and selectivity student satisfaction faculty size and the college endowment all stand at record levels strengthening the colleges governance by bringing needed talents skills and perspectives onto the board without "bringing washington to hanover" will allow dartmouth to continue building on that outstanding position well into the st century ed haldeman chairman dartmouth college board of trustees hanover n h democracy ordinarily refers to government by the governed the dartmouth alumni at large are not being "governed" by anyone only those alums who choose to participate in the association of alumni or the alumni council are subject to its "democratic" governance its constitution and its electoral politics dartmouth college on the other hand is governed by its board of trustees in accordance with its own charter those subject to the governance of the trustees are the administration the faculty and the students not the alumni at large the association of alumni or the alumni council if you actually gave the administration the faculty and the students the democratic right to elect the trustees who would govern them can there be any doubt that the last four trustee elections would have had different outcomes but the administration the faculty and the students do not vote for any trustee charter or alumni accordingly there is not now nor has there ever been "democracy at dartmouth" as is currently being mistakenly argued by those who so stridently oppose the recent board action alumni do not have any legal or moral right to govern dartmouth the notion that simply by virtue of their having attended dartmouth alumni have a perpetual right to govern the college is preposterous john h mathias jr dartmouth class of chicago
