wash cycle atms become handy tool for laundering dirty cash with small deposits couriers outwit banks bag of money in queens at a m on march luis saavedra and carlos roca began going from bank to bank in queens new york depositing cash into accounts held by a network of other people according to law enforcement officials their deposits never exceeded &# most ranged from &# to &# around lunchtime they crossed into manhattan and worked their way up third avenue then visited two banks on madison avenue by p m they had placed more than &# into accounts say the officials who reconstructed their movements from seized deposit slips confederates in colombia used atm cards to withdraw the money in pesos moving quickly from machine to machine in a withdrawal whirlwind the officials say "the organization at its height was moving about &# million a month " estimates bridget brennan special narcotics prosecutor for new york city messrs saavedra and roca were arrested in june and charged under state money laundering laws officials say they were moving money for a colombian drug trafficking organization that sells cocaine and the club drug ecstasy prosecutors say the two men engaged in a laundering practice called "microstructuring " a scheme notable for its simplicity to evade suspicion by banks they always made small deposits in colombia getting at that money was as easy as pushing buttons on an atm microstructuring has emerged as a vexing challenge for law enforcement officials charged with stanching the illegal movement of money by drug traffickers terrorists and organized crime rings the deposits and withdrawals are so small they can pass for ordinary atm transactions its an extreme variation of a practice sometimes called "smurfing" the breaking down of large transactions into many smaller ones to evade detection by financial regulators that activity was criminalized by congress in when the money deposited by messrs saavedra and roca was withdrawn in colombia it was effectively laundered it was in local currency cash that was virtually impossible to trace new york officials decline to identify the drug traffickers connected to the case because their investigation is continuing this month mr saavedra years old pleaded guilty to second degree money laundering and faces prison time mr roca has pleaded not guilty his former attorney alex grosshtern says he lived with his parents until his arrest "if anything " says mr grosshtern "hes a very small cog in a potentially very big scheme " immigration and customs enforcement agent salvatore dalessandro estimates that the el dorado task force a multiagency anti money laundering unit that he runs out of new york has indicted or convicted about people this year alone for using microstructuring schemes to launder money "were talking millions and millions of dollars" laundered through microstructuring he says linked networks of atms have made it easier than ever to move money around the globe the number of atms in colombia for example more than doubled between and rising from to according to the banking association of colombia the international monetary fund has estimated that between and of the worlds gross domestic product between &# billion and &# trillion based on gdp data from the imf is laundered world wide every year experts say much of it flows through the u s financial system law enforcement has been hard pressed to keep up with money laundering schemes which criminals use to make proceeds from illegal activities appear legitimate authorities rely heavily on banks which are required to report all cash transactions larger than &# and to institute "know your customer" procedures to ferret out money laundering and other suspicious activity drug dealers in particular have lots of cash they want to slip surreptitiously into the banking system colombian traffickers want much of their money in colombian pesos so the cash they collect in the u s and europe has to be converted many money laundering schemes are complex employing layers of transactions to move money through multiple countries to obscure the trail in the past bank officials used the government mandated &# cash threshold among other things to trigger reviews but over the years and especially after sept the industry has turned to computer programs designed to detect unusual patterns of activity by individual customers money launderers now appear to be trying to avoid detection by moving money in ever smaller chunks "where it used to be six seven eight thousand dollar deposits to avoid the &# limit now i see" deposits of less than &# says frank di gregorio a veteran money laundering investigator with the queens district attorney and the el dorado task force "within the last two years is when i started to see the amounts go down into the hundreds " the small transaction amounts constitute "the ingenuity of this particular enterprise " says ms brennan whose office is prosecuting messrs saavedra and roca "even if you pick up on it heres a guy who made three &# deposits so what " banks are catching on because microstructuring usually involves deposits in the u s and withdrawals overseas it isnt hard for banks to program their anti money laundering software to detect it withdrawals often follow distinctive patterns such as occurring just before and just after midnight to outwit daily withdrawal limits agents with the el dorado task force say financial giant citigroup inc raised red flags early and aggressively by filing suspicious activity reports in and with the treasury departments financial crimes enforcement network or fincen citigroup which was one of the banks apparently used by messrs saavedra and roca declined to comment the two men also allegedly made deposits at commerce bancorp inc that banks vice president for anti money laundering vincent auletta a former fbi agent says the bank didnt know microstructuring "was as rampant as it was" until a meeting called by law enforcement officials last october to alert banks to the problem that meeting says mr auletta "was the genesis to tweak our software" for detecting suspicious activity but even if an individual bank alerts law enforcement officials to suspicious transactions it isnt easy to unravel schemes involving lots of accounts at numerous banks in late astoria federal savings a regional savings and loan association in new york alerted authorities that a single individual he turned out to be mr saavedra was making cash deposits into a variety of accounts but the accounts were not associated with mr saavedra because they had been opened under other names according to an official close to the case so authorities were unable to use that tip to unravel the network of more than accounts in six states that officials now believe mr saavedra used it wasnt sophisticated data mining that ultimately snared mr saavedra but old fashioned police work agents from the new york drug enforcement task force a unit led by the federal drug enforcement administration that includes city and state police officers got a tip in march about an illicit exchange that was about to go down at a mcdonalds restaurant in queens undercover agents saw a bag being handed to messrs saavedra and roca agents followed the two men to the metro motel a down market establishment in queens where the front desk clerks work behind bulletproof glass there the agents found &# lying on a bed and a table in rubber banded bundles as well as deposit slips from the six hour account deposit spree that the two men had allegedly finished that afternoon agents also found a notebook that investigators dubbed the "rosetta stone " it contained a list of more than accounts with such key information as account numbers mothers maiden names and personal identification numbers which were often easy to remember sequences such as the notebook had an extensive list of branch addresses in new york for many major banks they arrested the two men but figuring they had stumbled onto something unusual the investigators hatched a plan they released messrs saavedra and roca trying to leave them with the impression theyd been arrested by "a regular joe schmo detective who doesnt know anything about financial crimes " says one law enforcement official agents even returned the notebook although they kept a photocopy sure enough mr saavedra resumed his deposit excursions and authorities monitored him and his associates yet it still wasnt easy to unravel the web of transactions doing so ms brennan says required three assistant district attorneys a financial analyst and a "terrific" dea agent armed with an accounting and military intelligence background this june the two men were picked up again and indicted for money laundering mr saavedra a colombian citizen apparently in the u s illegally lived the life of a typical struggling immigrant until late last year when he moved to florida he resided in a working class neighborhood of queens occupying one room in a two bedroom apartment rented by a colombian family with two daughters law enforcement officials say the head of that family juan velasco appeared stunned when told that his familys former boarder had been indicted for money laundering mr velasco says mr saavedra never brought people to the apartment and that he never saw him with multiple atm cards deposit slips large amounts of cash or drugs mr saavedra drove a nondescript van and didnt wear expensive clothes he says mr saavedra worked nights putting up advertising posters in the subway and elsewhere effective microstructuring schemes require many accounts and opening them can be a labor intensive process law enforcement officials say they dont know all the details of how mr saavedra arranged access to the accounts it appears that he relied on people from colombia some of whom may be related to him or his associates officials say these people used foreign passports visas to the u s major credit cards or similar documents to open the accounts then passed on the account documents and atm cards to mr saavedra or his associates investigators say some of the account holders apparently filled out forms allowing them to temporarily maintain the accounts without a tax id number or proof of residency the banks were supposed to follow up to make sure the required documentation was eventually filed but that sometimes "fell through the cracks " says ms brennan the banks cooperated with the investigation she says in other microstructuring cases investigators say money laundering rings have offered people free vacations to the u s on the condition that they open numerous accounts or they simply pay people a fee perhaps &# to &# one current investigation involves a suspect who uses a laptop to keep track of more than accounts says mr dalessandro head of the el dorado task force suspicious atm withdrawals arent just happening overseas last october customers "emptied" several of astoria federals atm machines in brooklyn according to charles judson who heads security and anti money laundering at the thrift they used two atm cards issued by the savings bank of the russian federation or sberbank which imposed no limit on the amount these customers could withdraw he says over three consecutive days oct to they withdrew more than &# he says because astoria federal imposes a limit of &# per transaction the customers swiped their atm cards times on march a customer using an atm card from the russian commercial fuel and energy interregional bank for reconstruction and development or tembr bank swiped his card times to withdraw &# from an astoria federal atm in brooklyn in written responses to questions about the incidents sberbank and tembr bank said they obeyed anti money laundering laws tembr bank also said that it guarantees its clients privacy mr judson says that while the transactions may be legitimate he strongly suspects foul play he has notified authorities he says
