weekend journal review televison the perilous fight early along the way in "the war " and the way is a long one its clear that ken burnss remarkably detailed history of the second world war delivers all the brands trademark strengths it is no less clear very early that this history has been shaped by the filmmakers evident determination that it exude no whiff of the celebratory no hint of triumph or testament to the character of the nation hurtled into war in december such iron clad resolution isnt easy to sustain on a theme of this kind but mr burns manages to come perilously close in his seven part hour series airing over two weeks beginning sunday p m on pbs check local listings the result is a war documentary whose tone of unyielding glumness is itself at war much of the time with the story it tells with indeed the character of the americans who come so vividly to life in it the soundtrack with the exception of a few standards of the period does its part to establish that tone for this series so clearly bent on ensuring that it play no part in the glorification of war any war even if this one was as were clearly informed at the outset a necessary war the dolorous jazz arrangements by wynton marsalis that run throughout the film were the credits tell us created especially for this production who would doubt it dont ask about the background music for d day moving on we see the archival footage of u s soldiers advancing through german streets it is the troops are among the first americans to have made it across the rhine and victory is if not in sight close at hand by way of an accompaniment to this moment we hear on the soundtrack some faintly mournful twitterings when it comes to the dolorous to be sure theres nothing quite equal to the effect of the dreadful "american anthem" sung here by norah jones whose sodden notes sound at regular intervals the music selections were chosen by committee one learns its regrettable the committee didnt think to include more songs representative of the times particularly in light of the strangely slender attention the documentary pays in all these hours to that complex power that came to be known as the american home front they were a people transformed the americans of that front and they were about a lot more than the bond drives shown here or the victory gardens or even the women working mens factory jobs a good dose of spike joness priceless "in der fuehrers face " for instance would have told more about the spirit of the times than much else to be found on that soundtrack thats in addition to its effects likely to be magical on viewers spirits fortunately the americans whose histories the film follows exert a tonic effect of their own even when their experiences encompass the worst terrors of the war the producers concentrated their focus on people from four american towns waterbury conn mobile ala sacramento calif and little luverne minn it was in luverne that quentin aanenson a farm boy came to dream of flying planes which he would in due course learn to do for the u s army a fighter pilot he flew mission after mission in impossible numbers nearly killing himself twice in the process it is a challenge listening to the soft spoken urbane and decidedly worldly mr aanenson to imagine him as a farm boy plowing fields and wondering no doubt how to get out of luverne if there is no such thing as a good war as mr burns contends it is also true that wars can transform lives in ways few people would regret as the vast number of veterans learned who were able to go to college thanks to the gi bill long before the wars end this former farm boy now a man nearly broken by horrors seen the deaths of so many friends confided it all in a letter to his fiancee singularly eloquent testimony read today in the case of babe ciarlo of waterbury a young factory worker drafted into the army there is another kind of eloquence in the lying letters he writes to his mother about his perfectly secure life of comfort eating lots of pork chops and such all in the midst of his hellish existence in the italian campaigns from these historian geoffrey c ward author of the series script constructs one of the documentarys most searing narratives mr wards "the war" a riveting work published by knopf that fills out the portraits and the history bears it should be said little resemblance to the standard series companion volume also among the portrait subjects is katherine phillips of mobile ala whose every word one follows raptly and there are a lot of them the producers knew they had a natural when they found her the perfect voice of the home front she declares today with an assurance doubtless well justified that it would be impossible to find anyone her age who was not glad as she was and remains that america had that atom bomb to drop on japan in as history the series is inarguably valuable not only for its treatment of battles nowadays comparatively unknown like salerno and anzio but also as potential instruction for the fearfully large population of television watching somethings or older not quite sure whether it was the chinese or the italians who bombed pearl harbor the astounding narrative of the bataan death march told by a long embittered survivor glenn frazier isnt exactly boring history of which there is in fact none in these hours hours which include in extensive treatment the internment of japanese americans segregation of the military and the crimes of nazism mr burns has made it clear in various interviews that one of his prime intentions in this series was to undo the notion of world war ii as "the good war " or as he told a newsweek reporter this week with some abandon it was time to "just unwrap the bloodless gallant myth of the second world war " here mr burns has shown himself prone to some mythmaking of his own specifically the myth that there prevails in our times some notion that world war ii was bloodless americans knew it was not in and they know plenty more about the war now as they know too that it was not all gallantry and victories it requires a certain willed distance from reality to believe despite all the documentaries on the wars bloody toll its needless battles and misbegotten strategies which air regularly on television that a benighted america is in need today of a rescuer to save it from its illusions about the war mr burnss zealous effort to eradicate any hint of a "good war" aura has come at a cost to his series thanks to its scope and ambition and above all to americans introduced here those who went to war and survived to speak for themselves and the others whose lives spoke for them it is nonetheless a profound and moving work see related letter
