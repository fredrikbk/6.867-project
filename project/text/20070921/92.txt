showdown in lebanon beirut on wednesday antoine ghanem became the fourth anti syrian member of the lebanese parliament to be assassinated in two years he was the latest victim of a protracted political crisis in lebanon that both preceded and was exacerbated by the assassination of former prime minister rafiq hariri in february soon after that murder international pressure and a mass uprising dubbed "the cedar revolution" put an end to syrias year military presence in lebanon but syrian president bashar assad never reconciled himself to the forced departure now syria is trying to use the upcoming lebanese presidential election to reimpose its hegemony over its smaller neighbor next week lebanon will enter the constitutional period during which its parliament must choose a new president the election might allow the lebanese to finally be rid of syrias peon president emile lahoud whose mandate was forcibly extended by damascus three years ago however there is a real danger that it will be the final nail in the coffin of the cedar revolution the outcome will also help determine whether syria can win an important round in a regional struggle pitting its alliance with iran hezbollah and hamas against a loose coalition of forces including the united states the mainstream sunni arab regimes and european states amid heightening polarization throughout the middle east a syrian victory in lebanon could also exacerbate simmering tensions elsewhere in fact the election might conceivably not take place at all mr assad realizes that any successor to mr lahoud who seeks to consolidate lebanons sovereignty would be a barrier to the revival of syrian supremacy damascuss lebanese allies most significantly hezbollah agree hezbollah which presides over a semi autonomous territory with a private army of its own knows that only renewed syrian sway over lebanon would allow it to continue its struggle against israel and the u s iran backs syria both to keep alive tehrans deterrence capability against israel thanks to the thousands of rockets it has supplied hezbollah in south lebanon and because syria is a vital partner in allowing iran to expand its reach across the middle east there are also opportunities in this election for syrias adversaries the anti syrian lebanese parliamentary majority as well as the bush administration and its more reliable european allies believe that any new president must secure the gains made in when lebanon recovered its independence their priority is to prevent the election of someone who might turn back the clock the problem is that this anti syrian majority sits with syrias friends in the parliament which elects the president they must come to a mutually satisfactory agreement or lebanon will find itself even more dangerously divided than it already is this election is not just about a president it is also for many of those involved about existential issues hezbollah a revolutionary military party that feeds off conflict or "resistance" to survive has no place in a liberated liberal cosmopolitan country at peace with the world similarly syrias most prominent enemies the sunni leader saad hariri the druze chieftain walid jumblatt and the christian lebanese forces leader samir geagea all risk political and even physical elimination if syria triumphs damascus if it cannot impose its man or a cipher whose flimsiness would allow syria to gain ground will encourage its allies to create a political vacuum as leverage to subsequently push a favorite into office syria is also waging an existential fight the tribunal to convict those responsible for the assassination of hariri has been approved under chapter vii of the united nations charter and several weeks ago the dutch government agreed to locate the court in the netherlands the exact location as yet undecided for mr assad whose regime is a prime suspect in the hariri murder the signs are ominous by again bringing lebanon under his authority the syrian president doubtless feels he can hamper the courts proceedings perhaps until more favorable circumstances allow him to negotiate a deal similar to the one that got libyas top leadership off the hook for the lockerbie bombing in as well as that of a uta french airliner in in this context diplomatic sources in beirut note that the arab league secretary general amr moussa and some european states including the vatican had sought to delay formation of the tribunal however the progress on situating the tribunal suggests this effort failed that is why mr assad might after all be more interested in holding a presidential election now so syrian allies in beirut can gum up the tribunals machinery before its too late in this scenario damascus would want a weak consensus candidate who stands somewhere in the middle however the nub of syrias strategy could be to ensure that its comrades in beirut in collaboration with the christian politician michel aoun gain veto power in the government that will be formed after the election that veto power plus a limp president and syrias control over parliamentary procedure through the pro syrian parliament speaker would give damascus substantial influence in beirut including over administrative decisions relating to the tribunal and to the implementation of the u n resolutions to disarm hezbollah and maintain tranquility in the southern border area if syria does prefer a president to a vacuum this vulnerability must be exploited in coming weeks by those who want lebanon fully freed of syrian domination mr assad will play hardball but he faces some heat an israeli air raid against syria earlier this month though reported to be directed against some sort of nuclear facility may conceivably have been interpreted by syria as an effort to intimidate it before lebanons election in recent weeks moreover saudi syrian hostility has escalated to unheard of levels both king abdullah of saudi arabia and president hosni mubarak of egypt are fearful of syrias close ties with iran for these two countries a hegemonic islamist shiite iran threatens their regional power and their sunni led regimes this sunni shiite rivalry happens to be playing itself out in lebanon where the results could have serious consequences for the saudis and egyptians the u s also knows the hazards of the lebanese presidential election and the bush administration will not sign off on a president it regards as pro syrian the difficult situation in iraq like saudi syrian tensions will probably make the administration tougher in opposing candidates it doesnt like however the european states france spain and italy making up the bulk of the u n force in south lebanon worry that a void in beirut might harm their soldiers all have made it amply clear to syria that it must change its ways in lebanon but they remain vulnerable on the ground amid suspicion that syria played a role direct or indirect in an attack last june that killed six troops of the spanish u n contingent all sides even syria would like to avoid a lebanese vacuum at the end of november when mr lahouds time will be up if they can achieve their goals the danger is that in the quest for compromise we might be heading toward a lowest common denominator on the presidency thus giving syria and its allies precisely what they want a weak ineffective president followed by a decisive advantage in any new government that would only aggravate the current polarization in the country lebanon has the startling potential of becoming either the middle easts salvation or its nightmare what happens here will have serious repercussions for what happens in the region as a whole mr young is opinion editor at the daily star newspaper in
