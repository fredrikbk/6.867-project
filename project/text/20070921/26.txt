dreamworks duo spars with parent viacom in hollywood when filmmaker steven spielberg says jump most people ask "how high " not viacom inc less than two years after viacoms paramount pictures announced with great fanfare a deal to buy dreamworks skg a battle over its future has been slowing coming to a boil members of the dreamworks team headed by mr spielberg and co founder david geffen have been making noises that they may leave when their contracts allow it next year mr geffen made his first detailed public comments on the subject in an interview with the wall street journal "whether we renew our contract is unclear " mr geffen said confirming that he has been speaking to other studios "well continue to do what weve always done make eight movies a year but who we make them for is up for discussion " the normal hollywood response to such a problem would be to assuage the egos involved and play nice but paramount this week took a different approach playing down the financial importance to the company of the famed director and his production company at a goldman sachs media conference this week viacom chief executive philippe dauman said pointedly that the departure of the dreamworks crew would be "completely immaterial" to the companys financial outlook and the studio is planning for their possible exit in a statement yesterday mr dauman said his company had the "greatest respect and admiration" for mr spielberg and dreamworks and "we have consistently expressed the admiration with our words and with our actions " he added "the deal has been very profitable for us and we hope that they will continue their association with our company but if they choose to follow an entrepreneurial path and begin again we are prepared and confident that paramount will move ahead and achieve its goals without missing a beat " indeed the question is what impact the departure would have on viacom if the dreamworks team made good on its threat though the paramount studio looms large psychologically it is a relatively small part of viacom in viacoms filmed entertainment business accounted for of its overall revenue and just under of operating income but paramount could be right about the financial impact and yet still come out looking like a loser in the battle the spat comes at a time when there are questions about the growth prospects for viacoms core business mtv networks as the internet upends the tv industry mr spielbergs departure could send the wrong message about the companys talent relations to others in the film business and with hits like "transformers" and "blades of glory " dreamworks this year has provided most of paramounts hit movies the tensions show how in the movie business small disputes can escalate once ill will starts to flow past hollywood bust ups like the one between walt disney co and the founders of its miramax unit the brothers harvey and bob weinstein dont bode well for this latest saga disney and the weinsteins fought for years before parting ways still mr geffen says the dreamworks crew which also includes stacey snider the former universal pictures chief who heads dreamworks production efforts havent made up their minds yet the root of the dreamworks problem appears to be a classic case of sellers remorse mr geffen orchestrated the sale in for &# billion at the time the founders felt they had landed a good deal after a decade of mixed returns but dreamworks went on to blossom producing a string of hits including this years "blades of glory" and "shrek the third" from its sister company dreamworks animation which is a stand alone company that forged a distribution agreement with paramount at the time of the dreamworks acquisition dreamworks and dreamworks animation are expected to contribute the bulk of paramounts forecast &# million profit in light of that dreamworks executives have felt they havent been appreciated enough by their new owners says mr geffen "we want to function independently and get credit for our successes and failures " he says the dreamworks team isnt interested in starting another studio from scratch although he plans to keep a keen eye on developments in hollywood next year with question marks over the future ownership of studios like general electric co s universal pictures "were happy being in the arms of a studio " he says noting that before paramounts ownership dreamworks didnt make "enough movies to justify being a stand alone distribution and marketing company " he adds that if a studio like universal came on the market he would certainly look at it such rumblings have caused paramount to circle the wagons according to people familiar with the matter mr dauman decided this week to push back against dreamworks because the company has grown weary of defending itself in hollywood against the notion that it has botched the relationship in its long term planning viacom has included a scenario for paramount without dreamworks one of these people said mr daumans comments prompted a fierce response from dreamworks animation chief executive jeffrey katzenberg who said "to suggest that not having steven spielberg is completely immaterial just seems ill advised " he added "i think calmer heads need to prevail here " hollywood egos aside mr daumans comments werent totally off base viacom already has the cost of the deal to acquire dreamworks covered it sold the dreamworks title library of movies to soros strategic partners in a &# million deal last year it also reaped &# million by re negotiating existing contracts the fees that dreamworks animation pays paramount to release its movies a contract that came with the acquisition will more than make up the difference and thats before counting dreamworks movies dreamworks is expected to generate between &# billion and &# billion at the box office domestically in but signaling that it is steeled for the possibility of losing mr spielberg and company means that paramount is banking on the filmmaking prowess of its studio chief brad grey who was a key negotiator in the dreamworks acquisition a former talent manager and rookie at running a studio mr grey has yet to prove his mettle on the filmmaking front mr greys slate for the main paramount label looks strong however including a new "star trek" series and an adaptation of the childrens book series "spiderwick chronicles " it will also be boosted by the spielberg directed "indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull " a revival of the famous s franchise if messrs spielberg and geffen leave they would likely take the dreamworks name and ms snider with them but paramount absorbed many top dreamworks executives into the main studios ranks people who would likely not leave with mr spielberg its also unclear what would happen to dreamworks animation mr katzenbergs animation company has a seven year distribution agreement with paramount meaning it is likely tied to paramount for about four years beyond the moment when mr spielberg could leave in the event that there is a change of control of dreamworks animation it has the option to leave after five years if it pays a &# million penalty mr geffen said if the top dreamworks team went elsewhere he would expect both dreamworks and dreamworks animation to ultimately "end up in the same place "
