cross country restarting michigans economy midland michigan michigans state motto makes this confident claim "if you seek a pleasant peninsula look about you" si quaeris peninsulam amoenam circumspice indeed no other state in the union boasts more beachfront property than the wolverine state more important for much of the th century michigan was a model of prosperity a magnet for human capital attracting and retaining a critical mass of world renowned engineers and entrepreneurs and seemed destined to be an economic engine for the nation but then came the s and the state has been sputtering ever since today a deep fog has settled over a once bright business climate the state was always particularly vulnerable to the ups and downs of auto sales still michigan was a veritable gold mine for wealth building and wages until the s when automakers began ceding market share to competitors at a pace of just under annually rather than being fleet footed the "big three" ignored challenges suffered severe uaw strikes and accommodated uncompetitive compensation packages through this is a well known decline and fall conditions suggest that its more than a problem with the auto industry most recently the state has also experienced losses of headquarters and jobs in financial and pharmaceutical sectors e g comerica bank and pfizer even lumber yards motels and other low profile employers are hurting underpinning this downturn are a few economic myths that must be dispelled perhaps the most pernicious myth is that michigan is caught in a cyclical recession while chief economist of comerica bank i tracked monthly index movements of the state economy over a year period what i found in the data is disconcerting michigan is not in a cyclical decline quite the contrary vehicle sales in the u s have averaged million units over the past five years our decline has been a trend a steady downward slide net out migration from michigan according to the nations largest household moving company has been occurring for consecutive years as of early the net out migration of firms and population is so profound that some rental car companies in the state no longer allow one way rentals their fear is they wont find anyone to return the vehicles another myth that michigans business climate ranks in the middle of the pack among the states this ignores the fact that michigans private sector is contracting compared to the expanding tax bases of every other state the economic fog will lift when policies are enacted that make michigan a good place to do business for newcomers as well as for existing firms this wont happen if the legislators in lansing the state capital who advocate heavier tax burdens on the remaining taxpayers to subsidize or attract firms handpicked by government officials get their way these targeted subsidies simply redistribute scarce income nor is the governor jennifer granholm moving in the right direction her recent call to impose a tax on most services is a nonstarter but shes also calling for a new tax on the estates of wealthy residents giving those with the means an even more urgent reason to leave michigans slide will continue two fundamental reforms are essential if the state is to make a comeback michigan was a formidable competitor prior to when the state had no personal income tax why not return to these days by abolishing the states personal income tax and replace it with nothing even a slow phase out of the tax will allow the state to vie for business new jobs and private sector investment with fast growing florida texas and the nearly half dozen other states that do not levy an income tax if florida and texas two of the fastest growing states in the union can survive without income taxes michigan can too second its time for lansing to pass right to work legislation which would allow workers to take a job without also being forced to join a union there are other states with such laws on the books and those states are often the most competitive for new toyota honda and other auto manufacturing plants that are creating thousands of new jobs these are jobs michigan should compete for then there are "legacy costs" and not just autoworker compensation packages unfunded liabilities attendant to public sector employee pensions and health care stand at &# billion in michigan these rapidly rising costs are stealth taxes lying in wait when will this change state economic prospects are difficult to predict because organized labor the public education lobby in particular now controls most tax and spend policy levers michigans education lobby pressures the governor to pass higher sales taxes to be funneled into public schools pre schooling k and public universities but the notion that tax hikes will give us a more educated work force and therefore offer a competitive salvation is probably the easiest myth to dispel michigan education budgets have experienced meteoric increases over the past two decades but quality has not risen nor has the plethora of funding stopped the outflow of michigans most capable graduates voters appear now to be catching on to this ruse in november the education lobby sponsored a ballot proposal which would have guaranteed immensely higher pension and health care benefits to union members past and present it was decisively defeated if citizens can once again embrace the truth about competitive markets and adopt a welcoming attitude toward profit the fog may yet break up brightening our "pleasant peninsula " mr littmann is an
