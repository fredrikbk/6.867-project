human rights watch clarifies views on courts in their march op ed "the gitmo blues " david b rivkin jr and lee a casey suggest that human rights watch advocates prosecuting terrorists in international tribunals rather than in u s federal courts they even go so far as to imply that we criticized the prosecution of zacarias moussaoui because we viewed the federal courts as biased this is not true truth while we are extremely critical of the ongoing military commission proceedings at guantanamo given their lack of independence and due process we have no such concerns about the federal courts indeed we have specifically called on the u s government to transfer terrorism suspects from guantanamo to u s courts for trial in suggesting that groups such as ours see allegiance to the u s constitution as a sign of bias messrs rivkin and casey misrepresent our views entirely it isnt the promise of allegiance to the constitution that disturbs us it is the governments failure to abide by that promise joanne mariner terrorism and counterterrorism program director human rights watch new york
