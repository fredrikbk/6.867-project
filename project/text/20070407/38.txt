pursuits books spy tale duping al qaeda body of lies by david ignatius norton pages &# a few years ago i asked former cia director james woolsey to name the best spy novel he gave two answers for pure literary quality he picked "the spy who came in from the cold " by john le carre but for a clear and accurate picture of what case officers actually do he recommended "agents of innocence " by david ignatius mr ignatiuss fiction debut published in has become something of a classic in the espionage genre whereas many of its cold war brethren seem dated "agents of innocence " with its middle eastern intrigue and focus on terrorism feels like a gritty prologue to americas current challenges its authenticity owes much to journalism in the early s mr ignatius wrote about the region and its troubles for the wall street journal mr ignatius went on to write several more thrillers though entertaining they did not match the gripping realism of his first effort he also kept a day job today he is a washington post columnist and has traveled to iraq more than a dozen times now after a layoff of nearly eight years mr ignatius is back with another thriller "body of lies " its a welcome return the novel is closer in spirit to "agents of innocence" than any of his other work its central events take place in iraq jordan and syria terrorism is in the foreground and one of the main characters is the nephew of an important figure in the earlier book the story involves cia officer roger ferris and an ingenious effort to thwart al qaeda an operation inspired by a successful british plot to fool the nazis during world war ii that involves using a corpse as a ruse a cia honcho speaking in dialogue tailor made for hollywood describes the plan as "so totally off the wall it might just work " as it happens warner bros has already acquired the movie rights to the novel mr ignatius takes a dim view of u s efforts to fight the current war in fact he seems to take a dim view of many of his countrymen portraying americans as almost uniformly arrogant his depiction of a justice department lawyer who writes torture memos is ridiculously lurid and in keeping with a policy of leaving no fish in a barrel unshot mr ignatius takes a gratuitous jab at fox news yet when the author sticks to the middle east and sinister doings there the clever well paced "body of lies" is hard to put down many spy novelists are still adjusting to the post world but mr ignatius has made the transition handily no doubt aided by the fact that more than two decades ago he was already alive to the dangers brewing mr miller is a political reporter for national review and with mark molesky the author of "our oldest enemy a history of americas disastrous relationship with france "
