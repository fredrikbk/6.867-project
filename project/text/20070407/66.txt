the weekend interview with abdurrahman wahid the last king of java jakarta indonesia suppose for a moment that the single most influential religious leader in the muslim world openly says "i am for israel " suppose he believes not only in democracy but in the liberalism of americas founding fathers suppose that unlike so many self described moderate muslims who say one thing in english and another in their native language his message never alters suppose this and you might feel as if youve descended into neocon neverland in fact you have arrived in jakarta and are sitting in the small office of an almost totally blind man of named abdurrahman wahid a former president of indonesia he is the spiritual leader of the nahdlatul ulama nu an islamic organization of some million members indonesians know him universally as gus dur a title of affection and respect for this descendant of javanese kings in the u s and europe he is barely spoken of at all which is both odd and unfortunate seeing as he is easily the most important ally the west has in the ideological struggle against islamic radicalism conversation begins with some old memories in the early s mr wahid whose paternal grandfather founded the nu in and whose father was indonesias first minister of religious affairs won a scholarship to al azhar university in cairo which for years had been sunni islams premier institution of higher learning mr wahid hated it "these old sheikhs only let me study islams traditional surras in the old way which was rote memorization " he recalls speaking in the excellent english he learned as a young man listening to the bbc and voice of america "before long i was fed up so i spent my time reading books from the usis united states information service the egyptian national library and at the cinema i used to watch three four movies a day " as mr wahid saw it the basic problem with al azhar was that the state interfered in its affairs and demanded intellectual conformity a lesson he carries with him to the present day in he left cairo for baghdad university where he encountered much the same thing "the teaching suffered from conventionalism you were not allowed to go your own way " here mr wahid digresses into islamic history "in the second century of islam the imam al shafii began remodeling the religion " he says "he put into place the mechanism of understanding everything through law shariah now people cant talk about that anymore we cannot attack al shafii " the point is crucial to mr wahids understanding of islam as being something broader deeper and better than the tradition bound view of life imposed by traditional schools of islamic law all the more striking because mr wahid is himself a leading theologian of the shafii school it is equally crucial to mr wahids politics not to mention his relaxed approach to social issues "the globalization of ethics is always frightening to people particularly islamic radicals " he says in reference to a question about the so called pornoaksi legislation for the past three years indonesian politics have been roiled by an islamist attempt to label anything they deem sexually arousing to be a form of "porno action " mr wahid sees this as an assault on pancasila indonesias secularist state philosophy from the time of its founding he also sees it as an assault on common sense "young people like to kiss each other " he says throwing his hands in the air "why not just because old people dont do it doesnt mean its wrong " mr wahid is equally relaxed about some of the controversies that have recently erupted between muslims and the west pope benedicts regensburg speech from last september was "a good speech though as usual he pointed to the wrong times and the wrong cases " as for the furor over the danish cartoons of the prophet mohammad he asks "why should we be angry " and he dismisses sheikh yusuf qaradawi the al jazeera preacher who helped incite the cartoon riots as an "angry conventional" thinker what really concerns mr wahid is what he sees as the increasingly degraded state of the muslim mind that problem is becoming especially acute at indonesian universities and in the pesantren the religious boarding schools that graduate hundreds of thousands of students every year "we are experiencing the shallowing of religion " he says bemoaning the fact that the boarding schools persist in teaching "conventional" that word again islam but mr wahids critique is not just of formal islamic education he also attacks the wests philosophy of positivism which he says "relies too much on the idea of conquering knowledge and mastering scientific principles alone " this purely empirical and essentially soulless view of things broadly adopted by indonesias secular state universities gives its students a bleak choice "either they follow the process or they are outside the process " as a result western style education in indonesia has come to represent not just secularism but the negation of religion to which too many students have responded by embracing fundamentalism at the university of indonesia for example an estimated three in four students are members or sympathizers of the "prosperous justice party " or pks an ultra radical islamic party this raises the subject of religion and politics "for us an islamic party is not a thing to follow " he says adding that "religion and morality is tied to person not a party " to illustrate the point he observes that religious parties in the muslim world have more often been the handmaids of dictatorship than democracy "whenever governments tried to enforce their institutions they use islamic people as potential allies " the front for the defense of islam fpi a radical vigilante group that uses violent means to suppress "un islamic" behavior was he observes originally a creature of the indonesian military so why did mr wahid as a religious leader make the choice to go into politics himself he demurs at the suggestion of choice "i am against politics so to speak in i tried hard to convince people that the nu should not be in politics " he was overruled by others in the organization and eventually he founded the party of national awakening or pkb yet the party he insists is "based on non islamic principles " a fact he illustrates by pointing to a nearby aide who is an indonesian protestant "we have to go for plurality for tolerance " he also believes that the "only solution" to the challenge of islamic radicalization in indonesia is more democracy but what about the example of hamas which came to power through democratic means and of other groups like egypts muslim brotherhood that would probably do the same if given the chance mr wahids answer is to distinguish between what he calls "full democratization" and the "hollow imitation of democracy" that he sees taking place in indonesia as well as among arabs in palestine and iraq "the problem is not personalities it is institutions " he says "for the past years the americans have had not just jeffersons concept of the rights of the individual but also alexander hamiltons belief in a strong state " in order to function properly democracy requires competent government that can effectively uphold the rule of law it also requires a broadly understood concept of self rule which is missing in too much of the developing world "here ordinary citizens expect the government to do everything for them " he therefore takes a fairly dim view of iraqs democratic prospects "iraqis understood that saddam had caused them trouble " and were grateful to be rid of him he says "but as for the u s concept of democracy they dont understand it at all " the problem he adds goes double in the rest of the arab world where he says the prevailing view is that being a democracy is an expression of weakness while being a dictatorship is a sign of strength whats needed in other words is for countries like indonesia and iraq to find a way to combine effective government with a powerful respect for the rights of the citizen but how one goes about doing that is itself a deeper problem a problem of culture "how do we follow the west without becoming westerners how do you do that i dont know " in fact mr wahid has begun to develop an answer through two organizations he chairs the wahid institute run by his daughter yenny and libforall an indonesia and u s based nonprofit run by american c holland taylor which works to discredit islamisms ideology of hatred "its up to libforall to introduce both sides to muslims to show that common principles are also the principles of islam " mr wahid says "hundreds of thousands of muslim youth learn in countries where there is technological modernity we need to nurture the emergence of a new kind of people who think in terms of being modern but still relate to the past " in fact that perfectly describes mr wahid who is keenly aware of his own roots in both islamic and javanese traditions among his ancestors are the last hindu buddhist king of the javanese majapahit dynasty and sunan kalijogo a sufi mystic who married islamic and local traditions and according to lore defeated islamic extremism in the th century can mr wahid heir to this venerable tradition accomplish the same feat "right now the fundamentalists think theyre winning " he once told a friend "but theyre going to wake up one day and realize we beat them " mr stephens writes "global view " the wall street journals foreign affairs column
