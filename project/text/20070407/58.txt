ignited by an anonymous letter accusing him of personal misconduct according to people familiar with the situation mr heyer who denies engaging in any impropriety was unexpectedly ousted as chief executive officer this past week and in the process opted to forfeit an estimated &# million of severance compensation mr heyer who had been president and chief operating officer of coca cola co before taking over at starwood in has long been known for brusque often difficult relations with employees after investigating claims made in the anonymous letter sent to directors about two months ago board members pressed mr heyer to explain the large number of emails and text messages between him and female employees on a variety of topics outside normal working hours they also questioned him about his relationship with one particular female employee and about his hiring and promotion practices starwoods chairman and interim ceo bruce duncan has declined to comment on the specific reasons behind mr heyers departure on friday a spokeswoman for starwood which counts westin sheraton st regis and w hotels among its brands reiterated the companys earlier statement that the board had lost confidence in mr heyers leadership but added that "his style made some employees uncomfortable " in an interview the year old mr heyer characterized the situation as the ugly fallout from extensive strategic and structural changes he made while "transforming starwood from a real estate hotel company to a branding company " he says he doesnt know who wrote or sent the letter but believes it could have been someone passed over for a promotion "for an anonymous letter to basically destroy a reputation would be sinful " mr heyer said while acknowledging he can be a difficult boss he said the chain of events set off by the letter represented the "straw that broke the camels back" in his increasingly poor relationship with the company he left without his severance package because "life is too short" to mount a contested defense against the allegations "im burned out " he added "i wanted to walk away from this job with my head held high " starwoods board hired an outside law firm davis polk &amp wardwell to investigate the letters allegations people familiar with the matter say in the course of the probe mr heyers emails and text messages were scrutinized and found to include an "overwhelming body of evidence" that would have given the board reason to fire him for cause according to the person familiar with the situation his employment contract lists five reasons directors could fire him for cause one of them being "gross negligence or willful misconduct " the investigation uncovered emails and text messages between mr heyer who is married and a young unmarried female employee that were sent at times outside normal business hours and were of a suggestive nature "there were several provocative conversations and there was no question that the conduct was inappropriate for a ceo " this person said mr heyer said allegations of sexual advances made toward younger female employees "are absolutely not true they never happened " in regard to inappropriate email and text messages mr heyer said "to the best of my knowledge i didnt send any and i dont remember receiving any " he said the board didnt specifically question him about the content of his messages but rather about the volume of notes he sent and received mr heyers departure comes at a time of prosperity in the industry when he arrived at the company its shares were trading around &# per share on the friday before he resigned they sold for about &# apiece the company like rivals marriott international inc and hilton hotels corp has raised room rates as robust consumer and business travel have bolstered demand starwoods earnings rose during mr heyers tenure owing in part to a large transaction of hotel real estate announced in november in starwood reported net income of &# billion on &# billion of revenue the prior year starwood reported net income of &# million on similar sales the boards quick move to seek mr heyers ouster may be the culmination of simmering tensions over his leadership style which have built up over time despite satisfaction with the companys performance and mr heyers strategy but it also reflects the growing desire by corporate boards to act decisively when presented with evidence of possible executive misconduct in for example boeing co acted swiftly to replace then ceo harry stonecipher after emails revealed a relationship with a female boeing executive boeing said mr stonecipher who was married at the time was fired not for having an affair but for violating boeings code of conduct mr stonecipher acknowledged his conduct the letter received by starwood board members in mid february contained about specific instances that allegedly showed mr heyer had created a hostile work environment since arriving at starwood in october according to a person familiar the details of the situation the letter alleged for example that on at least one occasion mr heyer made inappropriate physical contact with a female employee outside a restaurant bathroom this person said mr heyer denied to the board and in an interview friday that such an incident ever occurred this same female employee last summer accompanied mr heyer and five other starwood employees on the corporate jet to a board meeting in greece mr heyer said this employee was part of the "generation next" program he created to cultivate younger homegrown managers in what he says is a "generation skipping exercise" authorized by the company this person was part of that project and mr heyer said he often took employees on trips aboard the jet to do work while flying he cited a recent trip on which starwoods general counsel accompanied him to spain simply to do work on the flight there and back "we got work done and we thought it would be fun " people familiar with the situation say mr heyer was also questioned by the board about his method of promoting employees and whether he fostered a culture of favoritism he says he responded to this question by noting that all promotions were done through a process and he wasnt on the promotion committee nonetheless the board determined that the women who had exchanged email and text message with mr heyer were essentially "unwilling victims" who felt pressured to curry favor with the ceo according to a person with knowledge of the matter mr heyers departure capped a stormy two and a half year run at the top of starwood after arriving from coke where he had been passed over for the top job mr heyer was hired by starwood at a time when then ceo barry sternlicht was looking for someone to replace him but mr sternlicht and starwood directors were aware of mr heyers reputation for a rough management style starwood directors received an extensive briefing about mr heyers difficult personality before they chose him as ceo "they went into this with eyes open " says one person familiar with his hiring process they learned in "nauseous detail" about the former coke presidents frequent clashes with colleagues there this person says the hotel chains due diligence included conversations with coke board members who told starwood recruiters that mr heyer didnt get the corner office at the beverage giant in part because he was so difficult to work with but mr heyer impressed the starwood board with his marketing background and his plans for the companys hotel brands upon his arrival he clashed with mr sternlicht who had moved to the executive chairman seat in may mr sternlicht abruptly left starwood and his seat on the board over the next year and a half mr heyer announced two new hotel brands acquired the le meridien brand sold a large chunk of starwoods real estate portfolio and announced a variety of branding and marketing promotions with a variety of consumer product and service firms in recent months the starwood board began to discuss its misgivings about mr heyer among its biggest gripes mr heyer spent little time at headquarters in white plains instead commuting from his home in atlanta under mr heyers contract starwood provided an atlanta area office but the ceo agreed to spend "at least a majority" of his workdays over a two month period either at headquarters or on company business trips since mr heyers departure starwood shares have hit new highs on speculation the company is now a prime buyout target the stock hit an all time high of &# a
