pursuits books the civics of poetry songs of ourselves by joan shelley rubin harvard pages &# poetry in america today how is it faring its a question that arises all the time indeed it sometimes seems that nobody can review a book of poetry or even quote a brief passage of verse without first presenting a few sweeping words on the health of the art the optimists will tell you that poetry is thriving they will note the proliferation of poetry readings and informal workshops poetry slams and fests and big money prizes the pessimists will talk about declining reviewer space and a shrinking market among trade publishers about feel good teachers of poetry who havent done their homework and magazines choosing to publish shorter and shorter poems this is a debate ripe for the complication and enrichment offered by joan shelley rubins "songs of ourselves " ms rubin has done innovative research into the wide array of social functions that poetry served from until her book delves into school recitation days and war memorial services the poetry of the summer camp and the verse speaking choir anthologies designed for americanization programs and as devotional aids many of her arcana are helpfully specific she gives us names and dates and statistics a reader can follow for instance how the poetry of classroom memorization slowly shifted proportions as a generation of troublingly "modern" writers robert frost t s eliot marianne moore belatedly impinged on th century stalwarts like henry wadsworth longfellow and william cullen bryant its a pity ms rubins prose doesnt have more sparkle although she avoids most of the jargon that congests so much academic writing she belabors her arguments and embellishes the obvious one chapter begins "a poem robert frost famously remarked begins as a lump in the throat frosts pronouncement referred not only to a physical sensation but also to an upwelling of emotion in the poet " the books subject is inextricably intertwined with joy the ecstasy of the poet in full creation and tedium the forced absorption of poetry by students with no appetite for it ms rubin seems bent on reflecting both in equal measure "songs of ourselves" includes more than footnotes an early indication that it proceeds like so much academic writing on the assumption of an adversarial reader quick to pounce on any bold declaration or undocumented detail rather than a companionable reader who driven by pleasure sallies forward in good faith good faith certainly abounds in many of the claims for poetry that ms rubin has collected the founders of declamation contests the creators of village pageants the womens club organizers of literary teas these people shared a belief in the redemptive power of verse poetry could strengthen both the intellect and the moral character of our children it could help transform the befuddled immigrant into an informed citizen it could soften racial prejudice it could draw us closer to god ms rubin is particularly interesting on the subject of the wartime uses of poetry during and after world war i she tells us "the writings of martyred soldier poets such as joyce kilmer and alan seeger were best sellers " and "more than ninety anthologies of poems about war and peace appeared while the fighting was in progress " in world war ii anthologies designed for the soldier like the easily portable armed service editions were naturally aimed toward uplifting and comforting ends yet with enough darkness of subject matter to acknowledge that an unflinching poetry is hardly admirable unless it first admits horror and cruelty what would some counterpart volume to "songs of ourselves" written say years from now make of the uses of poetry in todays wartime culture for our fighting soldiers in iraq and afghanistan poetry clearly plays a diminished role even so wherever violent death is both proximate and unpredictable poetry reliably serves an indispensable function offering concise phrases that can both bolster and commemorate much of ms rubins most telling research involves verse that lies "outside the channels of commercial publishing" poetry passed down informally through personal exchange or little remarked community ritual the author of a future incarnation of "songs of ourselves" will doubtless spend long hours combing through the blogs of combatants and their families unlike film or painted canvas a poem is at bottom insubstantial as "mere words " it can look sadly inadequate to the task of conveying wars enormity and tragedy this is a central theme in what might be called the greatest of all american war poems though it lacks a poems lineation the gettysburg address "the world will little note nor long remember what we say here " abraham lincoln observed yet it has been the business of poetry since homers time to undermine that appealingly modest sentiment when subjected to the tensions of a powerful nation in a tumultuous era the timeless appeals of poetry will naturally take distinctive and surprising forms ms rubin has chosen to survey some of these surprises over years of explosive american history from the lingering aftermath of the civil war through the ravages of two world wars to the technological wizardry of the th century she has chosen a field where the eternal and the temporal contend just the sort of terrain where poetry has always been most at home mr leithausers most recent book is "curves and angles poems" knopf
