pursuits leisure &amp arts between a rock and a wet place "you fall from feet its like hitting concrete you fall from to feet youre dead" kevin costner "the guardian" hat tonsai thailand about feet above the andaman sea im standing on a rail of rock not quite wide enough for all of my toes admiring the view my hands hold another rail of limestone protruding from the overhanging wall forcing my body to lean slightly backward as i crane my neck sideways to take in the panorama behind me its a somewhat awkward position but one that seems preferable to the alternative of letting go and hitting the water the horizon is dotted with limestone karsts like the one im clinging to weirdly tilted rock wedges weathered and eroded into fantastic yves tanguy shapes rising at improbable angles from the sapphire sea as far as the eye can see id come to this stunning southern corner of thailand to try deep water soloing dws which is rock climbing without ropes or any protective equipment over bodies of water deep enough to safely blunt the force of a fall all you need is a swimsuit and rock shoes or thats the theory of course if you become too tired to climb and fall off you might also be too tired to swim in mallorca the sports birthplace at least one climber has drowned add sharks waves and jagged rocks and the fun potential seems to diminish somewhat "its the purest form of climbing " says my enthusiastic friend dave it may also be the scariest not so much the climbing which was challenging enough to be absorbing without becoming terrifying or too hard getting down was another matter normally when you reach the top of a climb theres a trail to descend or you simply rappel the route with your rope with dws theres one way down jumping this proved harder than i had imagined a boatload of climbers were watching me urging me to leap my procrastination seemed to be cutting into happy hour back on tonsai beach where we were staying i dusted some pebbles off the ledge with one foot and counted the long seconds they took to disappear into the water below one two three i decided to admire the view some more twenty years ago tonsai was an obscure corner of the phang nga peninsula a series of deserted beaches walled off from the rest of the province by rugged limestone cliffs today tonsai is the rock climbing capital of southeast asia still secluded and reachable only by boat but popular enough during the winter dry season to resemble a bathing suit clad version of the united nations with a babble of languages being shouted by men and women scaling the surrounding rock walls about of the visitors to tonsai are climbers ropes and climbing gear are as common there as tanning oil and trashy novels are at most other sand and surf resorts its not uncommon to be on the beach at tonsai and see someone swan dive off a cliff feet up only to parachute to safety in a heartbeat but even climbing feet above the ground with a rope to stop your fall in case you slip can grow mundane day after day why not get rid of the rope for years some elite climbers have been doing just that scaling ultra hard routes without any safety lines "free soloing " they call it in free soloing falling equals death perhaps this is the reason that the sport has never become terribly popular deep water soloing however lets ordinary climbers experience something of the same thrills at a fraction of the risk in tonsai wee changrua who runs a local climbing school organizes dws boat trips to some of the islets sprinkled around the bay one morning earlier this year i jumped into a longtail boat with a dozen other climbers we dropped anchor in front of what looked like a blank wall of rock but from the side you could scamper up about feet and then traverse onto the face gaining another feet of elevation if you were brave enough the first climber stopped at the corner before the traverse and simply jumped off waving his arms wildly as he plunged into the sea that reminded our boat driver to point out the importance of keeping your arms at your side and your legs straight when hitting the water next a woman skillfully scaled the wall and kept going higher and higher the boat driver urged her to jump she kept moving up "im scared " she yelled "can i climb down someplace else " eventually she had to jump so did i i tried to keep my hands by my side but forgot about my legs i slammed into the sea with my butt it felt like being spanked by god after lunch on a small beach we took the boat to a fantastically featured wall inclined like an inverted pyramid with huge stalactites dripping down toward the water swimming up to the rock i waited until the tidal swell lifted me high enough to grab big holds directly above my head swing my feet up hooking the heels of my shoes into pockets and then flip my body over the lip and onto a wide ledge from there i climbed stalactites up to a blank corner reaching around the corner i couldnt find any holds and jumped off bobbing in the surf i looked up and watched another climber pull past the corner and ascend a series of horizontal rails until he jumped onto a giant stalactite hanging dramatically over the water like an exclamation point with one hand he hung from the bottom of the tufa dangling about feet above the sea then he effortlessly switched hands finally he let go it was one of the coolest things ive ever seen i climbed back to my previous high point and managed to surmount the corner climbing the rails was easy enough but then what half of me wanted to keep going up to the stalactite the other half wanted my mommy i stopped climbing i looked down i told myself id leap at the count of three one two three on the horizon i noticed another interesting looking island i jumped the fall was disconcertingly long a fact i had time to reflect on as i plummeted toward the sea i plunged underwater for what felt like an almost equal distance and waited for my momentum to stop and my buoyancy to return me to the surface since i started climbing ive bashed my knuckles to pulp swinging ice tools into a glacier grated my arms and legs like cheese in sandstone cracks and busted an ankle sliding off a frozen waterfall upside down none of that hurt as much as falling into water back in tonsai i couldnt turn my head to the left my right elbow felt like it had been hit with a sledgehammer when i went to take a shower i looked in the mirror and noticed that there was a rainbow of black and blue bruises spanning my backside from buttock to buttock it looked like id spent a weekend at an s&amp m convention the next day i went back to the rope at home a few weeks later i read an interview in a magazine with hotshot climber sonnie trotter who said that he wants to do foot high deep water solos with a parachute now that sounds like fun mr ybarra is a writer in san francisco peggy noonan is on vacation
