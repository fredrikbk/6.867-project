pursuits books a tabloid tale the pioneering publisher of the pre murdoch new york post the lady upstairs by marilyn nissenson st martins pages &# when i was a liberal teenager in the s long before i became wiser and more conservative i looked forward every evening to my father bringing home the new york post the tabloids star columnists murray kempton max lerner james wechsler and more were my journalistic heroes the posts lively and literate writing the controversies it covered and the causes it championed were an oasis of independent albeit leftist journalism in a gray era when the new york times was blandly centrist and the rest of the new york press was scattered to its right marilyn nissensons "the lady upstairs" is the story of that newspaper and of its remarkable proprietor dorothy "dolly" schiff she was the princess of a powerful jewish banking family born in to wealth privilege and the presumption of an idle life instead she became a pioneering publisher long before women were welcome in boardrooms or newsrooms she was also a genuinely liberated woman who divorced or survived four husbands and carried on not so private affairs with a variety of very public men diplomat averell harriman playboy serge obolensky publisher max beaverbrook and probably franklin roosevelt among them yet as ms nissenson convincingly chronicles ms schiffs one true love would always be the new york post dolly schiff thus emerges from this exhaustive biography as a captivating public and private person though at times despite ms nissensons compulsion to bury her readers in voluminous detail on everything from bad investments to bad marriages this is an author who could have used a good tabloid editor ms schiff purchased the money losing post in essentially as a plaything for one of her husbands but before long he was gone and she was left holding the reins she never let go involving herself for some three decades in every aspect of publishing from news coverage to editorials advertising sales to circulation wars buying newsprint to saving paperclips she was experienced neither as a journalist nor as a businesswoman and the post lost money in more years than it turned profits she could be imperious and miserly or sensitive and generous depending on her moods but she had the courage of her liberal convictions a flair for recognizing and trusting journalistic talent and an intuitive understanding of the interests of her readers as a result her paper survived when many bigger and better funded ones did not ms schiffs post as she instinctively understood was really two newspapers with two audiences there were the liberal intellectuals drawn to the papers editorial pages and opinion columnists and to their passionate support of liberal democratic candidates civil rights labor unions and social welfare programs at the same time the larger part of the posts readership was attracted less by political and social commentary than by those mainstays of traditional tabloid journalism gossip scandal sports and crime this ms schiff understood better than many of her editors and so for every max lerner opining on politics there was an earl wilson generating juicy gossip a rose franzblau dispensing advice to the lovelorn and a team of sports reporters who matched any in new york linking the audiences were news investigations and exposes some of these were on national subjects like richard nixons "slush fund" and sen joe mccarthys red scare inquests others on corruption in the new york real estate market or the lives of new york call girls still others on hollywood scandals of the era scandals were bigger and better in those days if we compare the glamorous triangle of eddie fisher elizabeth taylor and debbie reynolds with the tawdry equivalent of anna nicole smith howard k stern and larry birkhead if one measure of a newspaper is the list of enemies it honorably makes ms schiffs post stood tall for its times sen mccarthy gossip king walter winchell new york mega builder robert moses fbi director j edgar hoover political boss carmine desapio even roman catholic cardinal francis spellman all felt the sting of the posts news coverage and commentary ms schiff rarely if ever flinched from the fights her journalists initiated or kowtowed to the advertisers they sometimes offended and so well into the s she continued to attract exceptional journalistic talent pete hamill nora ephron jimmy breslin and many others what she could not attract as the s unfolded were more readers american society was changing and new york with it the posts brand of heartfelt liberalism which had been so distinctive and even courageous in the conservative s seemed increasingly mushy and stale to the new leftists of late s the posts staunch support of civil rights was less appealing to white ethnic readers after race riots and racial polarization its news coverage of new york city was no longer relevant to middle class readers leaving for the suburbs and the declining circulation was no longer as appealing to department store advertisers ms schiff might have battled the trends with renewed energy and increased financial investment but she did not instead she controlled expenses ever more tightly and the decline predictably accelerated finally in at the age of almost years after she bought the post she sold it to rupert murdoch mr murdoch quickly flipped the editorial pages from liberal to conservative and steadily expanded the papers coverage of crime celebrities scandal gossip and sports this new ideological twist on the old formula seems to be working these days at least measured by growing post circulation numbers against for example the declining city circulation of todays relentlessly liberal new york times yet to find a contemporary new york newspaper that does what the old new york post did best provocative political commentary lively news coverage of new york city courageous investigative journalism exposes and scoops one turns to neither the post nor the times but rather to a relatively new entrant the revived new york sun thats the new york paper i suspect dolly schiff would be reading if she were still alive at least its the one i now bring home to my teenagers mr kann a pulitzer prize winning reporter is chairman of dow jones &amp co which publishes the wall street journal
