the buzz marketwatch weekend investor these days detective skills are key to gauging a stock when circuit city stores inc reported an unexpected fiscal fourth quarter loss this past week with its stock in the doldrums victor germack felt vindicated last summer when quite a few analysts were upgrading their ratings on the electronics retailers stock his research firm ratefinancials published a report blasting circuit city for "very poor quality of earnings" and "poor accounting policies footnotes and management discussion and analysis " the report was featured in a wall street journal article prompting at least one prominent brokerage analyst to minimize the concerns which included a preponderance of year end lease terminations and the disproportionate influence the sale of extended warranties had on earnings as it turns out both those issues reared up in the latest results with a large charge related in part to lease termination costs and the warranty issue narrowing the companys profit margin mr germack who once ran the worlds largest angus cattle breeding operation takes pride in going against the herd circuit citys stock which was hovering at multiyear highs at the time of his firms report now is bouncing around near the week low at &# like many private research outfits ratefinancials doesnt recommend that investors buy or sell a stock it just points out what it sees as any risks and rates a company on a scale of one to with being the best circuit city got a while those risks may not always lead to stock rattling events and in fact often are ignored by wall street until it is too late "investors in a company with poor earnings quality start off with one strike against them " mr germack says to be sure when it comes to earnings the bottom line is important but it is the quality of that number that really counts so rather than talk to management which can be prone to "tell you what they want you to hear " mr germack and his analysts stick to the facts or as the case may be numbers with stricter disclosure rules in part because of the hotly contested sarbanes oxley corporate accountability law "our feeling is a companys financial reports should speak for themselves " he says in the wake of the governments efforts to help clean up corporate america he says there is no shortage of red flags to be found the underlying problems havent changed but there is "more detail in footnotes" of securities and exchange commission filings and managements discussion of financial results still as anybody who spends time poking around the underbelly of financial statements knows just because something is disclosed doesnt mean it is right it simply means the company has dropped more bread crumbs which mr germack believes could come in handy for financial sleuths in any economic downturn if there were a downturn he says sarbanes oxley or no sarbanes oxley "companies will want to meet earnings forecasts someway somehow " back at circuit city spokesman bill cimino says there were other factors including a faster than expected decline in pricing for flat panel television sets that played havoc with its results and while he doesnt remember the details of mr germacks report rather than quibble with his analysis mr cimino says "thats the great thing about wall street a number of people can look at the data and parse it differently and believe they have insight into it thats what makes free markets work " finally someone who gets it anybody here speak english in an sec filing wednesday take two interactive software inc said "in response to a letter request made by counsel to the registrant dated march the registrant received from the u s securities and exchange commission a formal order of private investigation which allows the sec among other things to subpoena witnesses in connection with the secs investigation of the stock option practices of the registrant and or its directors officers and or employees " if you take that convoluted disclosure at face value it appears take twos general counsel seth krauss good guy that he is invited the sec to launch a formal probe into the company and subpoena everybody and anybody the sec good guys that they are granted his wish is that really what happened as i wrote in my blog on marketwatch not quite responding to my inquiry mr krauss says that on march take two was informed that sec staff had obtained a formal order of investigation and that the company then "quickly" requested a copy of the order which it received march so enough already with lawyers writing sec filings note to sec chairman chris cox in your quest to make filings easier to read is there any way to ban legalese entirely it would be your finest moment and a terrific legacy
