pursuits food &amp drink eating out fine food nation a trip to seattle shows how national restaurants are replacing local cuisine seattle in cooking as in the other arts high culture spreads from the center to the periphery the kind of modern food we used to find only in our biggest cities food that blends the french nouvelle cuisine with luxury ingredients from the whole world is now showing up at better tables in almost every american urban center the restaurants that serve this up to the minute cuisine are what id like to call national restaurants whether theyre located in houston or kansas city they match the standards and echo the cooking of rivals in the big four culinary centers new york chicago san francisco and los angeles the chefs at national restaurants typically have cooked in world famous kitchens and keep their own kitchens at a big league level adding local ingredients regional dishes and their own creations to the mix the rise of such places gradual and uncoordinated signals a knitting together of well traveled chefs and elite customers who now make up a viable market of feinschmeckers in what once were at best centers of regional cooking new orleans or gastronomic podunks while the "best" restaurants of cities like denver and kansas city got locally famous serving good raw materials plainly prepared grilled steaks and boiled lobsters national restaurants in those same towns now feature foie gras with housemade preserves or sushi grade tuna elaborately plated and garnished instead i was particularly struck by this phenomenon recently in seattle dining at rovers lampreia and canlis which have national standards of cooking service and wine will this trend depress business at excellent old line regional restaurants frankly i think the idea of a golden age of great local food is largely bogus i spent two years in the s crisscrossing america looking for such places and barely found a one which is why i called the book based on that research "fading feast " fine dining back then in the interior u s was most often no picnic back in i had to push aside a scrambled bearnaise sauce at nashvilles most highly touted french restaurant on my next trip there i intend to try the ambitious fusion menu at the nationally recognized and honored restaurant zola from time to time in coming months ill be searching out national restaurants wherever they may be seattle turned out to be an excellent place to begin the hunt in the not so long ago old days eating well in seattle meant tucking into generous portions of fat and happy dungeness crab or wild local salmon preferably planked on alderwood boards a technique derived from the campfire cuisine of indigenous indians rovers pioneered in bringing french culinary technique to this not so brave new world city thierry rautureau bought the old rovers named after a dog whose picture still hangs on a wall near the entrance in and turned it into a steadily evolving laboratory for the glorification of local products from white sturgeon caviar to locally farmed baby lettuce nowadays the young classically trained chef adam hoffman is celebrating rovers th anniversary with " years later menus " the adventuresome diner might start with a "martini" of dungeness crab with mango and blood orange argan dressing this is a witty turn on the pacific northwests old faithful crab cocktail served in a martini glass with a ketchup tinted dressing mixed from reddish citrus juice and a prized moroccan oil moving right along to a main course that might be sonoma quail with foie gras caramelized turnips and foie gras soup or a north african improvisation based on alaskan salmon with couscous moroccan olive tapenade and a thick creamy saffron sabayon theres a hibiscus blossom sorbet for dessert as well as a plate of washington and european cheeses and a brown butter cherry tartlet the wine list featured a featured a fine cabernet from the small special winery called andrew will all this and a sense of humor too the founder mr rautureau sets the breezy tone by wearing a fedora at all times proud of being the "chef in the hat " not a toque in the cozy dining room you feel as if you are in his house with some amusing guests for example a surgeon whos a regular at friday lunch his license plate reads dr tush at cutting edge lampreia in the hip belltown district of rehabbed commercial buildings near downtown however no one cracked a joke or even a smile they are making beautiful food here seriously beautiful and seriously tasty food their version of dungeness crab is a long chilled tube on a narrow plate with the letterbox proportions of a modern television the pure white crab is edged in red from an apple peel a subtle nod to local agriculture no alice waters boastful sermons about sustainable farming here albacore carpaccio very thin raw tuna also arrayed on a letterbox plate serves as a staging point for three decorative garnishes olympia oysters the size of a little finger nail citrus segments and a gelee hard acts to follow but lampreia offers a flavor bomb of new zealand snapper cooked sous vide at glacial speed with chorizo sausage the topflight veal chop in a classic veal reduction was estupendo as were the macerated oranges cured in sugar until they turned entirely edible peel and all by this point in our visit to seattle we began to yearn for an unreconstructed old fashioned seattle dinner we thought we might find such a thing at glamorous canlis on the citys internal lake union peter canlis founded this large showplace with its stunning view massive old growth cedar beams northwest textiles and copper fixtures in but time has not stood still viz world class dungeness crabcakes with carrot coriander butter scallions and beet greens wagyu steaks wild king salmon in a cherry red wine reduction and english pea risotto with white truffle edamame pur&amp eacute e pea vines and endive shallot salad this had to stop we had a reservation at another lakeside place called chandlers right around kickoff time for the super bowl would they have nachos no way chandlers has oysters from up and down the coast an encyclopedia of crab dishes all set about with goodies like romescu sauce fennel and orzo for plain seafood in seattle you need your own kitchen email me at eatingout wsj com
