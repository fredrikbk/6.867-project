pursuits books five best nobel winning scientist eric kandel chooses unforgettable works on memory  ficciones by jorge luis borges grove memory is the scaffold that holds our mental life together one of its most remarkable characteristics is that it has no restraints on time and place memory allows you to sit in your living room while your mind wanders back to childhood recalling a special event that pleased or pained you this time travel ability often sparked by a sensory experience that opens the floodgates of memory is central to much great fiction it is described in the most detail in marcel prousts million word classic "remembrance of things past " in which a madeleine dipped in tea famously prompts an onrush of images from the protagonists childhood but one of the most fascinating descriptions of memory in fiction can be found in jorge luis borgess seminal short story collection "ficciones " first published in in spanish borges who knew for much of his life that he was slowly going blind from a hereditary disease had a deep sense of the central and sometimes paradoxical role of memory in human existence this sense informs much of "ficciones" but particularly the story "funes the memorious " which concerns a man who suffers a modest head injury after falling off a horse and as a result cannot forget anything he has ever experienced waking or dreaming but his brain is filled only with detail crowding out universal principles he cant create because his head is filled with garbage we know that an excessively weak memory is a handicap but as borges shows having too good a memory can be a handicap as well the capacity to forget is a blessing  memories are made of this by rusiko bourtchouladze columbia there are several good introductions to the biology of memory storage for the general reader but i particularly like rusiko bourtchouladzes a gifted writer who is also a behaviorist she discusses both of the great themes of memory research the "systems problem" of memory storage the areas of the brain recruited for different forms of memory and the "molecular problem" the molecular mechanisms whereby memory is stored at each site in considering the system problems of memory bourtchouladze describes the now famous patient called h m who underwent brain surgery that left him with a devastating memory loss h m could not store any new information about people places and objects the great canadian psychologist brenda milner studied h m and in a classic analysis carried out over two decades succeeded in localizing this component of memory storage to the medial temporal lobe bourtchouladze brings these riveting discoveries to life  memory and brain by larry r squire oxford "memory and brain" is a classic in the biology of memory in it larry r squire a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the university of california at san diego provides a superb historical overview of the key experiments and insights that have given rise to our current understanding of the problem of memory storage squire himself has played a vital role in this history he pioneered our understanding that memory exists in two major forms declarative memory this is the kind of memory that h m lost and procedural memory for motor and perceptual skills such as riding a bike or hitting a backhand this is the memory that h m retained his later work includes such breakthroughs as identifying the hippocampus in the medial temporal lobe as critical for the storage of declarative information  the seven sins of memory by daniel l schacter houghton mifflin in "the seven sins of memory how the mind forgets and remembers " harvard professor daniel l schacter shows that declarative memory the kind involving people places and objects is highly fallible and susceptible to distortion and suggestion the seven "sins" refers to memorys various weaknesses its transience absentmindedness blocking misattribution suggestibility bias and persistence schacter another pioneer in the study of human memory employs his insights not only to reveal the fragility of memory and its extraordinary vulnerability to influence by authority figures but also to indicate effective ways of understanding how memory is normally encoded  memory from a to z by yadin dudai oxford any question that remains unanswered after reading the above works by bourtchouladze squire and schacter can be answered by yadin dudai a professor at the weizmann institute in israel this is an entertaining wide ranging and well written primer subtitle "keywords concepts and beyond" with more than entries that range from discussions of memory on the molecular level to examinations of the philosophical issues that confront researchers "memory a to z" begins with "a priori" and runs through subjects such as "false memory " "metamemory" and "synapse " before ending at "zeitgeist " the book is a handy reference accessible to the general reader dr kandel is university professor in the center for neurobiology and behavior at the columbia university college of physicians and surgeons he is the author of "in search of memory the emergence of a new science of mind" norton he won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in for his studies of memory
