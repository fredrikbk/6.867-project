executive warms to his new role the climate fixer in buying piece of jungle mr eliasch stirred debate problem of ersatz indians manicore brazil deep in the rain forest johan eliasch the swedish born executive who revived sports equipment maker head nv was inspecting his latest turnaround project peering under a wooden trellis he examined hundreds of tiny seedlings that will be planted on land he now owns trees act as a kind of sponge for carbon dioxide the most prevalent of the gasses contributing to global warming in mr eliasch bought titles to about acres here an area twice the size of new york city he shut down a timber cutting operation and plywood plant and planted trees motivated he says by what he considers slow progress in tackling climate change "things needed to be stirred up a bit " he says he certainly succeeded in doing that some local environmentalists say hes a dilettante dabbling in "green colonialism " many brazilians have charged that hes the latest in a long line of foreigners with designs on their natural resources mr eliaschs conservation project meanwhile has put some locals out of work sounding the alarm about a foreign plot to take over the rain forest a senator from the amazon arthur virgilio delivered a speech in brazils congress in which he called mr eliasch "audacious and unbalanced " after the stink caused by his first efforts mr eliasch has tried to bring brazilians into his corner with some success hes trying to get off the ground two more ambitious projects under the umbrella of a group dubbed "cool earth " one would enable regular citizens to invest in preserving chunks of the rain forest another would use financial derivatives to encourage companies to back environmentally friendly projects mr eliasch years old has a personal fortune estimated at &# million a yacht and an influential post as deputy treasurer of the u k s conservative party hes not many peoples idea of a tree hugger but his work in the amazon has plunged him deep into a debate over what role individuals especially wealthy ones should play in developing solutions to environmental problems while non governmental groups have long purchased land private citizens from the late "crocodile hunter" steve irwin in australia to mr eliasch in the amazon are increasingly stepping into the breach many brazilians have said mr eliasch should spend time helping fix problems at home such as vehicle emissions before embarking on adventures overseas mr eliasch says he treats the global ecology as though it were a distressed company "a big loss making carbon enterprise " as he puts it if rain forest destruction could be slowed mr eliasch argues that would buy time for wealthier countries to clean up their industrial and energy systems "its like any turnaround or restructuring situation " he said machete in hand as he strolled across land where hes planted trees "you look where you can have the biggest impact in the short term and stem the losses " he chalks up the cool reception from other environmentalists to turf battles many scientists and environmentalists view the rain forest as a neglected front in the battle against climate change trees absorb and store carbon dioxide yet each year a swath of forest the size of portugal is destroyed around the world according to the world bank the big danger comes if trees are burned which causes them to unleash that stored carbon according to the stern review on the economics of climate change a report commissioned by the british government deforestation accounts for nearly one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions more than transport pushing for change as an outsider isnt easy wary brazilians note that the amazon has long been a magnet for foreign tycoons with extravagant schemes in the s henry ford tried creating the worlds largest rubber plantation in an amazon village dubbed fordlandia the project was sunk by american managers who insisted on a a m to p m workday despite the heat beginning in the s billionaire u s shipping magnate daniel ludwig tried building a vast eucalyptus plantation in the amazon to gain a stranglehold on the global paper market it was scuttled by operating difficulties and a political backlash jeff langholz associate professor at the monterey institute of international studies says mr eliasch represents a new band of activists he approvingly calls "conservation cowboys " independent operators riding to the rescue of habitats and species the earliest proponents focused more on conservation than global warming in the s j a bruckner an engineering executive and farm owner in namibia convinced his neighbors to integrate their properties into a wildlife preserve thats now the size of greater london in queensland australia terri irwin the widow of the late tv personality mr irwin helps oversee wildlife sanctuaries on acres in patagonia by contrast theres been a backlash against foreign preservationists douglas tompkins who built apparel maker esprit de corp and his wife kristine mcdivitt former ceo of clothing chain patagonia inc have spent a chunk of their personal fortune buying acreage in southern argentina and chile in response latin american politicians have accused the pair of having cia links and plotting to seize fresh water reserves last year a left wing argentine congresswoman launched an unsuccessful bid to expropriate their argentine land holdings the tompkins decline to comment environmental activism represents a new direction for mr eliasch grandson of g a svensson a notable swedish real estate entrepreneur who barred his descendants from receiving their inheritance until they turned mr eliasch hasnt needed his grandfathers money after obtaining degrees in business and engineering in sweden he worked in london during the s at a firm that overhauled troubled shipping and energy companies mr eliasch started his own company and in acquired the financially ailing head from the austrian government for &# million plus the assumption of more than &# million in debt mr eliasch cut costs introduced new products such as titanium tennis rackets and exhibited a flair for promotion in he was the forerunner the skier who makes a first test run on the stomach churning course used for the hahnenkammrennen race in kitzbuhel austria one of the biggest events in skiing head is now one of the worlds largest manufacturers of skis and the second largest producer of rackets after wilson sporting goods co mr eliasch has become prominent in sporting and social circles golfing at british open qualifiers cutting business deals with athletes including u s olympic skier bode miller and partying with the u k s prince andrew his focus on the amazon started after he grew worried about the european ski season whose recent poor state mr eliasch chalks up to global warming the lack of snow has been bad for business at head which counts on winter sports for nearly half of its revenue in a february conference call with analysts mr eliasch attributed a decline in fourth quarter winter sports revenue to "probably the worst snow conditions we ever knew " while concern about the impact of global warming is growing scientists cant say for sure whether europes recent mild winters are caused by climate change or natural weather cycles mr eliasch visited brazil for the first time five years ago in mr eliasch bought a plywood plant owned by gethal amazonas a logging company in turn owned by gmo llc a boston investment fund he also acquired title to forest acreage in the area mr eliasch wont reveal the price "i think mr eliasch made the correct assessment that he can produce results faster " than the government alone says william cohen secretary of defense during the clinton administration and a member of heads supervisory board a european style board of directors mr eliasch owns title to several parcels not all contiguous clustered around the rugged river town of manicore the surrounding jungle boasts an unusually rich variety of tree species including acai palms with their dark purple berries and bellaco caspi whose bark can be used as a pain reliever mr eliasch says hes traveled there three or four times leaving daily oversight to managers who used to work for the timber company by his measure mr eliaschs land purchases have preserved around million tons of carbon thats the amount that would be released if all his lands were forested and burned equivalent to almost half the u k s annual carbon emissions estimates for how much carbon is stored in the rain forest can vary greatly depending upon the region and method used mr eliaschs figures reflect assumptions on the high end of the possible range the businessman has also discovered that the amazon can be an administrative nightmare in a kind of rain forest catch mr eliasch says about a quarter of his titles arent formally registered that means theyre open to dispute because theres no registrars office specified by law last year mr eliaschs managers found about loggers working on his land who claimed indigenous status mr eliasch says they were mostly "fake indians" who had painted themselves in an effort to avoid prosecution local police arent authorized to deal with indigenous affairs which are regulated on a federal level to get rid of the ersatz indians mr eliaschs manager let them keep some of the trees they felled and helped them find work elsewhere northeast of mr eliaschs land in the town of itacoatiara the plywood plant is now closed and ex workers are scrambling for a living "instead of thinking so much about the forest mr eliasch should be worried about people " says general store owner raimundo almeida he says his sales have fallen since the factory closed recently darcy perreira macedo a former plant worker was repairing holes in his fishing nets his source of income since getting laid off the catch hasnt been good lately hes run up a huge debt at the grocery store "other people are more desperate than me " mr macedo says mr eliasch says he gave the laid off employees severance packages that went beyond what was required under brazils worker friendly labor law after mr eliasch flew into manicores ramshackle airport in january for a get to know you session with local authorities manicore mayor emerson franca asked him to fund a public works program to upgrade housing and water "weve been forgotten by everyone and are absolutely counting on the swede " mayor franca says back in the u k mr eliasch was getting encouragement to expand his project in march last year frank field a labour member of parliament contacted mr eliasch to ask how he could sponsor a few acres of jungle himself mr field says the two men who hail from competing political parties at once decided to "leapfrog the clanking machinery of government " they formed an organization cool earth which would allow regular citizens to contribute to rain forest land purchases when word of the group came out last year more than citizens contacted mr field seeking to participate cool earth suffered a setback in october when britains environment secretary was quoted in the british press talking about the planned "privatization" of the rain forest a loaded word during a brazilian presidential election incumbent leftist luiz inacio lula da silva was running as the anti privatization candidate a u k environment department spokesman denied there was any such plan in the ensuing diplomatic dustup brazilian officials said citizens of wealthy nations should clean up plants at home rather than encroach on territory abroad "the amazon is not for sale " said an op ed in a sao paulo paper under the names of brazils foreign science and environment ministers mr eliasch launched a campaign of personal diplomacy with officials in amazonas the state where his property is located he won their blessing by promising to involve locals in preservation projects mr eliasch "is creative innovative and has access to new partners in the business community " says virgilio viana amazonass harvard trained environmental minister who was initially skeptical of the entrepreneur but the group is yet to launch its first venture "when it actually comes down to getting these projects off the ground its much harder than you ever imagined " says evan bowen jones americas program director for fauna and flora international a year old london based conservation group hes been discussing a possible partnership with cool earth to preserve land threatened by farmers and ranchers cool earth is also trying to draw capital from corporations and professional investors many companies in particular those in the european union have to comply with emissions caps they can meet their obligations in two ways either they can clean up their factories or they can buy or earn exemptions called carbon credits credits can be earned by funding projects in poorer countries they can also be bought like coffee or orange juice contracts on international exchanges where pollution has been turned into a commodity but the kyoto protocol the treaty under which most industrialized countries pledged to reduce emissions doesnt recognize preserving the existing rain forest as a way to earn a carbon credit kyotos framers feared that activity halted in one part of the rain forest might simply shift to a different part they also worried that rain forest credits might divert attention from cleaning up fuel and industry environmentalists and some governments have been growing more receptive to the idea of rain forest credits wagering that kyoto will eventually be amended cool earth is preparing to launch a derivative linked to "avoided deforestation" later this year on the chicago climate exchange richard sandor founder and chairman of the chicago exchange says the derivative is a promising idea on which mr eliasch is "on the forefront " others however have a wait and see attitude "it takes time to determine who is doing serious work and who is just an adventurer " says enrico bernard amazon project manager for conservation international a large environmental group
