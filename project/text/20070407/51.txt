pursuits sports golf journal inside the masters mystique say what you will about augusta our columnist on why sunday is christmas morning for fans masters weekend how sweet the sound true the tournament started thursday and many of us caught replay broadcasts the last two nights but live coverage of the third round begins saturday afternoon with a wide open leaderboard and tiger only barely in the hunt and for my money sunday is the best sporting afternoon of the year for a golfer masters weekend is christmas morning so long awaited you can hardly believe its finally here several things about the masters and its telecast never fail to rankle starting with that hokey bird twittering behind cbss sepia tinted opening montage and ending with the soporific champions interview in "historic butler cabin " whats the deal with butler cabin were never told why its so darn historic or even what it is exactly the producers at cbs turn the sentimentality meter up to out of and keep it there all week especially during the endless stream of tributes to past champions still beneath all the hushed reverential cliches nothing diminishes the mystical pull of the masters since a lot of the publicity surrounding the tournament concerns things like the off season personal lives of augusta caddies and how many layers of sand and gravel lie beneath the resurfaced th green its easy to forget why we love it in the first place so back to fundamentals heres my list its proof that spring is here forget the groundhog those of us in northern climes are just now grouchily emerging from our hibernative caves our yards are still mud pits but augustas blazing azaleas confirm that the clubs are coming out of the garage its the years first major officially this is week on the pga tour fedex cup schedule and tiger woods has already won twice but for the tours top players and the fans all until now is prologue the masters and the majors are what count and you can detect the new vibe in the step of every player this year its even more pronounced because the players championship a quasi major formerly held in march is now taking place in may the back nine on sunday at no other major and few tournaments can so much ground be made up or lost so quickly as in the lengthening shadows at augusta on sunday at least a couple of holes are set up each year so that decently struck balls collect near the pins on the two par fives the th and the th players make eagle or find disaster in the waters in approximately equal numbers the short par three th thanks to unpredictable wind gusts is a roll of the dice and the th is a lightning rod for drama this is where mr woods on his way to victory in chipped in from outer space for birdie and jack nicklaus riding the emotional high of the fans on a thrilling back nine charge in putted in for birdie from an equally far fetched distance the th lengthened and toughened is a great nervy finisher the courses style hilly gorgeous and requiring imagination to play well like many i hate that augusta national has felt compelled to add rough and trees in recent years to make the course more resistant to scoring these changes limit the options for players and stifle the creativity that used to be so much fun to watch but compared with the severe straitjacketed courses of the u s open and pga augusta still has a lot of spunk especially around the greens the familiarity of the course because the masters is the only major played at the same venue every year we the fans know every inch of the course even if weve never been there when the club adds trees down the right side of no were entitled to our opinion flyovers and a wealth of other graphics available on the internet make it our virtual home course the tradition nowhere in sports is the connection with the past both immediate and distant so palpable as at the masters the huge revolving casts at other majors filled by open qualification processes include freak low scorers obscure international players and at the pga everyday club pros the masters by contrast is an invitational its limited field includes the worlds hottest freshest talent but always also many familiar faces former champions have permanent invitations to compete and most do so into their s and s accompanied by the ghosts of all the ancients who have played in the event every fan player and tv announcer knows the stories as well as they do their own family histories this is the spot on no from which gene sarazen hit his four wood for the famous double eagle in this is how ben hogan always played no favoring the right side this is where freddie coupless ball came to rest on the brink of raes creek at no in arnold and jack jack nicklaus the greatest golfer ever until proven otherwise by mr woods and arnold palmer the most charismatic dominated the competition and spirit of the masters for a quarter century they are still around mr palmer this year re inaugurated the tradition of hitting a ceremonial first ball and hopefully in the years ahead will be joined by mr nicklaus note cbs will broadcast the restored and colorized original telecast of mr palmers masters win sunday afternoon it includes footage of mr nicklaus still an amateur playing in his second masters true fans should not miss it the augusta national golf club founded in by bobby jones not long after he quit competitive golf at the peak of his powers the club is stuffy rich enigmatic and as a result of its late admission of blacks and continuing barring of women from membership controversial clearly augusta national isnt for everyone but no club has more enduring mystique or a course that say what you will more golfers would more like to be invited to play the television coverage ok so i began by dissing the coverage and ill continue the club insists that announcers call fans "patrons " fairway humps "mounds " and rough "the first cut " gary mccord was banned for using the words "bikini waxed" in connection with the speed of the greens but even so in years of continuous coverage cbs has figured out how to milk the tournament for maximum drama no broadcast of any sort looks better in high definition and im happy to forgive augusta national everything for not allowing more than four minutes of advertising per hour the masters on tv round p m saturday cbs final round p m
