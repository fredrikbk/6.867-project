the week ahead our take on coming events finance with weakness expected in ges financial units investors will scour data for next growth leaders by kathryn kranhold general electric co s financial services businesses drove the conglomerates growth last year and for most of the past decade this year though ges industrial businesses may have to take the lead general electric reports first quarter financial results friday and investors are expecting weakness in two pieces of the companys consumer finance division its wmc mortgage unit one of the nations largest issuers of subprime loans and its japan operations where ge is pulling back in response to new government regulations slower growth and tighter margins in the financial units would crimp ges growth engine earnings from continuing operations at financial services also known as ge capital increased in earnings at ges industrial units grew the shift is more dramatic over time financial services contributed of ges net income in up from in ge capital includes the companys commercial and consumer lending aircraft leasing and its fast growing real estate business yet in spite of the financial woes ge says its growth machine will keep churning it out overall ge estimates that first quarter earnings will grow to to between cents and cents per share so where will the growth come from thats the big question j p morgan analyst stephen tusa argues ges financial problems arent as bad as those of other financial firms and he expects stronger growth from its industrial units ranging from gas turbines aircraft engines and healthcare to nbc universal that could be good for ge shares since investors put a higher value on those earnings "as an investor you want to see a bigger growing industrial business " mr tusa says ge spokesman russell wilkerson says ge expects growth to slow in its financial businesses this year "we are now in a period of more balanced growth where our industrial businesses can grow at the same rate or faster than our financial services businesses " he says analysts estimated that the wmc mortgage unit which has laid off more than of its work force and stopped making certain risky loans will depress ges earnings by about two cents a share or as much as &# million this year ge has also started shrinking its japanese unit which contributed about of the earnings in its consumer finance group in ge has laid off employees and shut offices after regulators cut the maximum interest rates lenders can charge the double whammy from wmc and japan will contribute to slower growth in earnings of ges consumer finance group of this year from last year mr tusa projects there are other issues that also will hurt ges financial services profit this year mr tusa writes among those are increased interest rates and rising reserve provisions for weaker credit which are hurting all financial institutions mr tusa expects ge to increase reserves by about in after several years of relative stability but as always ge boosters bank on the companys diverse portfolio of businesses to get it through tough times if it can deliver the results on friday it will have proved the point once again politics mccain seeks to regain footing after a bad week by jackie calmes in short order john mccain has gone from republican presidential front runner to political death watch on wednesday the arizona senator kicks off a month of high profile events seeking a resurrection of sorts he badly needs it mr mccain just reported raising &# million for the first quarter behind republican rivals mitt romney and rudy giuliani as well as democrats hillary clinton barack obama and john edwards most analysts wont go so far as to bury mr mccain citing his republican rivals own baggage both mr romney and mr giuliani are suspect among social conservatives for their records supporting abortion and gay rights and gun control but the one time gop front runner clearly had a very bad week it began with reports of the heavily guarded senator shopping at a baghdad market and declaring "things are better " and it ended with a new hampshire poll showing mr mccain the longtime leader in that first primary state now in a dead heat with mr romney sandwiched in between were the stories of his money woes all of that makes next week and the next month critical to the survival of his candidacy mr mccains campaign scheduled three policy speeches in consecutive weeks culminating april with his "official" announcement tour through early nominating states of new hampshire iowa and south carolina and finally to his home state of arizona wednesdays first speech at the virginia military institute will showcase mr mccains "commitment to winning the war in iraq " trouble is no one doubts mr mccains commitment but recent polls show the public is increasingly doubtful of the prospects of winning the war and that in turn may be undercutting mr mccains chances of winning the nomination the senators war stand is a popular one with republican voters but polls show they are not rewarding him given longstanding resentment of his maverick ways meanwhile the independents once attracted to him for just that reason no longer see him as the straight talker of the campaign for many independents that brand has gone to democratic sen barack obama of illinois and with mr mccains electability in question many conservative donors appear to have decided he is not a good investment as for mr romney enjoying a much needed second look the former massachusetts governor will speak on tuesday at the george h w bush presidential library in college station texas "on ways to confront the new generation of challenges we face " says a spokesman he was invited as part of the librarys lecture series republicans say the current president bush wouldnt want to signal any bush family favoritism toward mr romney this early especially with mr mccain the administrations most prominent war supporter on a personal level moreover several members of the bush inner circle have joined team mccain including former strategists mark mckinnon and steve schmidt olympics do host cities end up winners by emily steel next saturday boosters from los angeles and chicago will learn which city will be the u s candidate to host the olympic games and some could argue it should be the loser who pops the champagne for some cities the legacy of the games has been cost overruns heavy debt loads and white elephant stadiums aquatic centers and velodromes the costs of hosting the event keep spiralling upward beijing is investing almost &# billion in next years games significantly more than the &# billion previously budgeted london which is hosting the games now expects costs to reach &# billion montreal just recently finished paying off its debt for hosting the games where construction costs reached &# million a drastic increase from its &# million estimate "there is so much boosterism that the overwhelming tendency is to vastly overstate the benefits and vastly understate the costs " says allen sanderson a sports economist at the university of chicago cities such as beijing and atlanta which hosted the last u s summer games in dont care about the costs for them the potential benefits of showing the world they have arrived are too great for chicago and los angeles the equation is less obvious and in any event the odds are long and the final decision still two years away both los angeles and chicago are rallying public support behind their bids los angeles is touting its expertise and existing infrastructure from hosting the games in a successful event despite a soviet boycott it has estimated costs for upgrading venues and permanent construction to be just &# million all privately financed it expects that the games would bring an economic impact of about &# billion to the region construction costs in chicago are expected to reach &# billion including &# million for a temporary stadium the new thing to avoid the white elephant problem and &# billion for a privately developed olympic village that would turn into mixed income housing afterward also the chicago olympic bid committee has a &# million financial guarantee from the city to help if needed "ultimately these cities are involved in a bidding war and the question is if they should be putting this money somewhere else " says irving rein professor of communication studies at northwestern university the international olympic committee will make its decision in october so far the biggest overseas rivals are tokyo and rio de janeiro while not locked into any patterns the committee could well feel its time for the games to return to the western hemisphere particularly without the usual billions of dollars lined up from nbc with broadcast rights representing about half of the olympic movements budget and no sponsorship yet from a u s network the committee may seek a location that meshes best with u s viewing times but will it be worth it "those questions are being asked more now than ever before but ive never heard a city say they were sorry to host the olympics " says don schumacher executive director of the national association of sports commissions
