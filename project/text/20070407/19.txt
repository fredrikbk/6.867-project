hot topic the democrats first days house speaker nancy pelosi drew sharp criticism from president bush this past week for leading a delegation to syria which the u s considers a state sponsor of terrorism as her party neared the conclusion of its first days in control of congress the dustup displayed the white houses ongoing effort to counter an opposition congress while the democrats scored early points by challenging the president on iraq theyve found it easier to probe the white house than to pass bills and get them signed into law after taking control in january democratic house leaders quickly passed measures on the six poll tested issues that they had campaigned on last fall but none of those bills have been signed into law and only two measures to increase the minimum wage and to implement the full recommendations of the sept commission have passed the senate where the democrats hold a slim majority and where procedural rules give more power to the minority the republicans faced the same frustrations in when much of then speaker newt gingrichs contract with america didnt survive in the senate heres a recap of the democrats first days in charge of congress iraq the house and senate voted separately last month to set conditions on funding for the wars in iraq and afghanistan that would set a withdrawal date for soldiers in iraq the house proposal would remove all combat troops by september while the senate version orders some troops to leave immediately with the goal of ending combat by april the president has promised to veto any bill with a withdrawal timetable but the bill strengthened the standing of ms pelosi among democrats she passed a crucial test by winning support from both the member progressive caucus which favored an immediate pullout and the member blue dog democrats whose more conservative members had strong reservations about a timetable republicans accused the leadership of buying the votes of reluctant democrats by including &# billion in additional spending that wasnt requested by the president oversight while the senate and the white house have thwarted democrats ambitious legislative goals nothing has limited democrats from using oversight power to investigate the president so far this year the house has held more than oversight hearings compared to a handful held by republicans in a comparable period in the previous congress the majority of those hearings have focused on the conduct of the wars in iraq and afghanistan probes of the justice department spotlighted the fbis abuse of national security letters where agents secretly collected telephone and bank records of u s citizens and foreign nationals in violation of the law and raised questions about the firing of eight u s attorneys by the white house minimum wage a bill that would increase the federal minimum wage to &# from &# an hour passed by wide margins in the house and senate and was one of the "six for " issues that democrats campaigned on last fall in the house republicans sided with the democrats on the bill which also provided &# billion in tax cuts for small businesses and restaurants the senate approved by a vote its bill which included &# billion in tax cuts but the two chambers have yet to agree on a compromise bill to send to the president lobbying reform congresss first act prohibited lobbyists from treating lawmakers to free meals trips and stadium box seats in a bid to curb their influence and extended to two years from one the time that former members must wait before engaging in lobbying activities while the house changed the rules that apply to its members it hasnt yet passed its further reaching lobbying reform bill watchdogs have complained that the rules leave large loopholes and exceptions procedural rules republicans have objected to democrats reluctance to keep a campaign promise to restore "regular order" when congress is in session which would allow for open debate and an amendment process that allows the minority the right to offer alternatives to legislation republicans werent allowed to submit amendments for example when congress considered the "six for " agenda and voted on iraq in the last few years of the republican majority house leadership often shut democrats out of conference committees and refused amendments nick timiraos points of view nancy pelosi really has become an icon icons can continue to add luster or they can implode newt gingrich became an icon and he imploded " larry sabato director of the center for politics at the university of virginia facts house speaker pelosi shocked some when she backed rep john murtha a close ally for house majority leader over rep steny hoyer a political rival mr hoyer defeated mr murtha in a vote the use of the "first days" as a benchmark has its roots in president franklin d roosevelts aggressive series of programs launched at the outset of his presidency in ms pelosi is second in the line of presidential succession behind vice president dick cheney no woman has ever been closer in line to the presidency house democrats established a five day work week and have met times this year compared to times by

he made in all of last year
