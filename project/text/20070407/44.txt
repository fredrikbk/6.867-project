pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece mackintoshs sweet success the willow tea rooms of marked the zenith of his career anatomy of a classic walking through glasgow today it is impossible not to be struck by the many rich ironies of the citys architecture a century back glasgow was the tea room capital of the world awash with high class cafes where the genteel ladies could take tea but within a short space of time almost every one of those tea rooms had closed and yet today the tea room is right back in favor although now going under its modern guise as a starbucks coffee shop the greatest irony of all however about glasgows architecture is that for many years its most famous son charles rennie mackintosh was both shunned and forgotten after his death in much of his work was if not destroyed then generally ignored today however mackintosh is lauded as the father of modernism and the master of art nouveau and glasgow is packed with imitations of his instantly recognizable style glaswegians even have a name for these modern day copies which are affectionately known as "mockintosh " but more by good luck than good judgment there are still a few genuine mackintosh gems left in glasgow and one of the foremost is the willow tea rooms in sauchiehall street when the willow opened in the effect was every bit as dramatic as its owner kate cranston had hoped it would be it was huge for a tea room extending over five floors and there was not a single fitting or piece of furniture that had not been personally designed by cranstons pet architect charles rennie mackintosh mackintosh had been given carte blanche to do whatever he wanted with the willow tea rooms from its bow fronted exterior to the patterns on the back of the cutlery the stencils on the walls were a revelation harmonizing beautifully with mackintoshs black "ladder back" chairs his ironwork although ostensibly functioning as a screen was more like a piece of art nouveau sculpture on the willows top floor was a billiard room where the gentlemen could smoke it was altogether darker and more macho than the other rooms but still definitively mackintosh but the jewel in the willow crown was the salon de luxe with extraordinary silver back chairs walls that were paneled with purple silk and a chandelier that was packed with pink glass baubles even the salons waitresses were a cut above the rest and wore special mackintosh uniforms with bow ties and pink bead chokers the new tea rooms caused a sensation for at a stroke they had transformed the mundane business of taking tea into an artistic experience one reviewer wrote "it fairly outshines all others in the matters of arrangement and colour the furnishing besides is of the richest and most luxurious character " the willow was the zenith of not just kate cranstons tea room empire but also of mackintoshs career it was cranstons brother stuart a tea merchant who had set up the worlds first tea room in glasgow in and it had proved an instant hit the tea rooms were not just teetotal in a city infamous for its alcohol abuse but also eminently respectable in starchy victorian britain the tea room had become the only place where a middle class lady could dine without a chaperone but whereas stuart cranstons tea rooms were primarily about selling tea his sister kate was intent on revolutionizing ladies lives she first teamed up with mackintosh in commissioning him to decorate the walls of her first tea rooms cranston wanted her tea shop to leave customers open mouthed with wonder and in this mackintosh more than succeeded the celebrated english architect edwin lutyens wrote to his wife to be "the result is gorgeous and a wee bit vulgar it is all quite good all just a little outre a thing we must avoid and shall too " cranston was to repeat the pattern again and again her tea rooms becoming ever more opulent and culminating of course with the willow what a relief the willow must have been for mackintosh who for the first time was given free rein and unlimited money to pay for it in every way the willow must have been the polar opposite of his experience with the glasgow school of art mackintosh was just when in he won a prestigious competition to design glasgows new art school it was a job that was to make mackintoshs name but very nearly broke him every day was spent locked in battle with the soul destroying art school building committee cranston by contrast was "delighted with everything mackintosh suggested" for her new rooms at the willow mackintosh was to do more work for cranston but the willow was the high water mark of his career later dogged by depression and forgotten by the public mackintosh lived out his last years in penniless obscurity in france as for cranston she was left devastated by her husbands death in and sold her tea rooms soon afterward the willow was closed in and its fabulous stencils and ironwork were scrapped to make way for a department store the willow was reopened in the s on a wave of mackintosh nostalgia with both the salon de luxe and later the gallery being re created by anne mulhern it is regrettably a shadow of what it was a century ago most of the original fittings along with the glorious artwork have long gone but the willow still serves tea and light lunches and as you sit amid the bustle and the scuffed modern day stencils you can sometimes have a glimpse of what was once without a doubt the worlds grandest tea room mr coles is a journalist living in edinburgh his first novel "the well tempered clavier " is due to be
