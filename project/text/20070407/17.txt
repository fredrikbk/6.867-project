hot topic the democrats choice next week the democrats will mark their th day running congress and speaker nancy pelosi has declared herself "enormously proud" of their record we think its too soon to judge success or failure and in any case the more pertinent question concerns what the democrats are trying to accomplish do they want to get something done which will require the signature of a republican president who still has months in office or is their goal to delegitimize the bush presidency with a purely partisan goal of regaining the white house in if their plan is to govern democrats have several opportunities to work with president bush to achieve goals they claim to share trade deals on panama peru colombia and south korea await a congressional vote and their defeat would harm those nations and the u s national interest on immigration reform mr bush is closer to most democrats than to many in his own party the no child left behind act is up for reauthorization and the alternative minimum tax a k a mandatory maximum tax needs another patch to avoid hitting million more taxpayers this year we have nothing against partisanship and democrats have every right to reward their supporters and pursue their policy goals some of these are part of the "six for " bills that house democrats passed easily in their first days though they still have to run the gantlet of the senate but our guess is that democrats would help themselves more and have a better chance of gaining seats in if they show they are open to compromise and can point to priorities that became law the alternative is to frame a largely partisan agenda that may pass the house but will either die in the senate or be vetoed by the president these include the largely political payoff to unions of abolishing secret organizing ballots or cutting off funds for the iraq war these are crowd pleasers on the left which has overinterpreted last years victory as a mandate for their policies rather than a rejection of gop failure but this is a risky strategy that would give the lie to the claim that house democrats made last year that they could govern better than the tom delay republicans their freshmen from swing districts would have few accomplishments to tout and neither mr bush nor dick cheney will be on the ballot again a reality that democrats will sooner or later have to acknowledge hard as it will be to give up the anger if democrats are smart theyll realize that republicans in congress dont fear veto fights what gives them nightmares are signing ceremonies with mr bush and nancy pelosi see related letter "letters to the editor moral posturing" wsj april
