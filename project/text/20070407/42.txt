pursuits food &amp drink hows your drink the pear essentials is it sweet or not " the woman had been puzzling in front of the fruit brandies and liqueurs and was finally asking for help from the liquor store clerk hers was not a silly question open a bottle of raspberry eau de vie expecting a sweet cordial resembling a raspberry syrup and you will be shocked to get a mouthful of firewater yet the eau de vie and cordial may both say "framboise" on the label how do you know which is which old cocktail books can be particularly confusing when it comes to fruit brandies does a recipe calling for "cherry brandy" mean a brandy distilled from fermented cherries or a liqueur made by macerating cherries in an already distilled spirit and then adding sugar it will make a big difference in how the cocktail turns out the former is what is called an "eau de vie " and it is usually colorless though occasionally eaux de vie are aged and take on a slight honeyed hue the thick sweet stuff can be labeled with the word "liqueur" or "creme" which by the way does not mean that the liqueur has cream in it the american term "cordial" might also be found on the label but the simplest cue comes from a peek at whats inside liqueurs are generally jewel toned this is not however a rule though i cant think of any candy colored eaux de vie there are plenty of sweet liqueurs that abjure gaudy dyes cointreau triple sec and the clear varieties of such staples as creme de cacao and creme de menthe i suspect that the eau de vie that has most often surprised the unsuspecting palate is "poire william " in particular that version that comes with a pear trapped inside the bottle not all pear eaux de vie employ this eye catching shtick but those that do pull off the trick by sticking bottles right on the branches of pear trees when the fruit is just starting to bud the pear grows in the bottle and the two are harvested together one can be forgiven for expecting something sugary sweet with luscious ripe fruit sitting there pickled in the brandy but poire william is classic eau dry and hot with just a hint of elusive sweetness if you buy a bottle of pear in bottle brandy also be prepared to purchase one of fruit free poire to keep the fancy one topped up as long as the pear is fully submerged in the eau de vie it will be preserved a permanent lab specimen for your bar but should the brandy level fall to the point that the pear is even the least bit exposed the fruit will rot and ruin whats left of the spirit there are a number of excellent poire william brandies with or without fruit available in the states i tried two french versions massenez and trimbach along with two from artisanal distillers on the west coast californias st george spirits and oregons clear creek distillery when i tasted them blind i found that i preferred the american pair the massenez was so dry that hardly any of the fruit was left in the flavor there was more pear in the trimbach especially when i rolled the spirit forward in my mouth but it was even hotter with alcohol than the massenez st georges poire william had by far the headiest pear perfume but the taste in the glass elegant and smooth as it was didnt quite live up to the pronounced nose the clear creek poire william combined a welcoming pear scent with a lovely mellow and subtle taste of the fruit i also tasted several pear liqueurs all of which leaned toward the simple sweet unlike oranges which combine bitter peels with sweet fruit pears are just plain sweet which makes it hard to devise a complex pear liqueur my favorite of the bunch the trimbach liqueur compensated for the cloying sweetness of the pears by upping the alcohol heat most of the liqueurs are bottled at a mild alcohol proof level the trimbach uses more eau de vie and less fruit syrup making for a well balanced proof spirit in between the understated pear eaux de vie and the sybaritic liqueurs are a couple of anjou flavored vodkas from absolut and grey goose they have a far more pronounced pear flavor than the pear brandies but the fruit is unnaturally dry in the flavored vodka manner absolut pears had the more aggressive pear taste of the two but grey goose la poire was lighter and smoother but what to make with all these pear spirits they have long been neglected in cocktail construction there are hundreds of drinks that employ orange liqueurs and not only do plenty of drinks call for sweet cherry "brandies" such as cherry heering there are a number that use the cherry eau de vie kirsch but hardly anything for the poor pear a rare exception is the lennart a european highball made with pear brandy lime juice and lemon lime soda the moniker is swedish for "leonard " and though i dont know whom the drink was named for i like to imagine it is a tip of the hat to the modern realist artist lennart anderson whose still life of a pear and a jug is one of his better known paintings in a similar highball vein i found that pear brandy and pear liqueur together make for a refreshing "rickey" a category that combines just about any liquor with fresh lime juice and club soda on the rocks then again you cant go wrong drinking a good eau de vie de poire all by itself chilled to cellar temperature save it for the end of a meal and enjoy it slowly the only way youll get the elusive pears shy at first fully to reveal
