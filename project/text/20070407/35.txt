pursuits books eco frights for kids young readers in search of scary stories will soon have a whole new genre to enjoy childrens books about global warming a market niche that didnt exist as recently as last fall are blossoming on booksellers shelves faster than a red tide algae bloom off the coast of maine on tuesday al gores "an inconvenient truth" viking rodale will surface in yet another incarnation this time in softcover for "a new generation" of readers age and up for impressionable minds this is likely to be a persuasive book for it is filled with the same doomsday charts and graphs supposedly showing man made planetary warming that mr gore has used before more provoking still are the photographs of garbage dumps strip mines pacific islanders getting menaced by rising tides and even gratuitously the mushroom cloud from a nuclear test its the sort of book that children will flip through flip out about and cite in their schoolwork serving mr gores alarmist purposes well there is a bizarre chapter about the manufactured existence of sinister "skeptics " that attacks a single bush administration appointee by name in large red print this may strike bookstore browsers as passing strange but it wont bother those adults who will buy the book for children and who are presumably already gore devotees for younger readers "why are the ice caps melting " harpercollins introduces first to third graders to one of the adult worlds current obsessions through the use of gentle illustrations by paul meisel and text by anne rockwell on the cover cartoon penguins stand around looking perplexed while the ice cracks beneath them inside we find the now familiar argument that too many people are burning too much fuel and cutting down too many trees and thus overheating the earth one drawing shows two children at the seaside marveling at how high the water is compared with last summer this book is more generous to those whom al gore scornfully calls "skeptics " to the extent that it hints at alternative explanations of the warming trend "some people say we dont cause global warming they say that the earths climate has changed many times in the past it has grown warmer or colder and many great and drastic changes in temperature happened before there were any people on the earth " readers are urged nonetheless to reduce greenhouse gases the book ends predictably by urging sacrifice on children in this case reducing electricity use and avoiding food with multiple wrappings the author of "arctic thaw the people of the whale in a changing climate" boyds mills press goes one step further in his concluding passages by suggesting that he may forswear his "fossil fuel burning suv " in this volume for ages and up illustrated with recent photographs peter lourie writes about the inupiaq eskimos who have hunted seals caribou walrus and whales off the north slope of alaska since anyone can remember the ice there as the title implies is melting supposedly for the reasons that mr gore and others are constantly lecturing us about an ominous sense of environmental fragility it should be said is by no means confined to childrens books specifically about global warming the recent "little fur" random house books by isobelle carmody are "eco fantasies" in which humans actually stink of greed and cruelly despoil the earth with their gas guzzling road beasts "the day the stones walked" philomel by t a barron illustrated by william low concludes with an authors note about the long ago deforestation of easter island "will we who

alarming scenarios produced by adults for a great many years when i was small the surpassing terrors were pollution and the extinction of whales and the signature face of environmentalism was that of the weeping tv indian in the intervening years the love canals got cleaned up and we all started recycling bottles rather than flinging them out of our cars on to the roadside as apparently we once did now the signature face is that of an empurpled former vice president whether the sky really is falling this time or not more books are coming the publisher scholastic is leading its autumn lineup with a childrens version of "the down to earth guide to global warming" by cambria gordon and laurie david al gores producer on the film "an inconvenient truth" here too the young will be asked to
