what sarbox wrought the studies about what went wrong with u s capital markets are coming fast and furious in november a market oriented blue ribbon committee on capital regulation led by r glenn hubbard and john thornton observed that america was losing its dominance of world securities markets and urged modest deregulation next in early a study commissioned by new york sen charles schumer and new york city mayor michael bloomberg surprisingly urged more of the same the latest study from a panel commissioned by the u s chamber of commerce was released earlier this year and was the focus of a conference led by secretary of the treasury henry paulson the studies are all quite modest and reasonable unfortunately none of them appears fully to understand what is happening to global competition in corporate finance from the end of world war ii until the middle of the year america dominated the worlds capital markets surely and completely most securities traded here regardless of whether the issuers were u s or foreign companies markets here were thicker deeper more liquid and reputedly more honest than anywhere else nowhere was americas dominance more complete than in the market for ipos going public on a u s market particularly the vaunted new york stock exchange was a sign that a company had global reach among not only equity investors but among bankers customers and suppliers as well over the years two divergent hypotheses emerged to explain americas dominance in the capital markets on the one hand economists pointed to structural features to explain americas singular position after world war ii the u s was the worlds only source of capital europe and asia especially japan were emerging from vast physical and economic devastation in sharp contrast the u s was building not rebuilding the accumulation of u s savings and pension assets created the largest pool of investment capital in history professional bureaucrats at the securities and exchange commission and their allies in the corporate and securities bar had another theory america they said was dominant thanks to its superior government regulations and protections for investors according to this hypothesis if a company didnt want to go public in the u s it must have something to hide on this view the additional regulatory freight brought into play by the sarbanes oxley act should have been a godsend by restoring the confidence in u s corporate governance that had been shaken by the enron era corporate scandals america would assure its continued dominance of world capital markets well into the new millennium alas things have not quite turned out that way whatever good might be said of sarbanes oxley and there isnt much good to be said for its intrusive circulatory and duplicative grab bag of rules the statute has triggered a complete change in the way the world views the u s as a center for capital formation indeed the relative decline of u s capital markets since sarbox has or should put to bed the notion that more regulation is always part of the solution rather than part of the problem and in fact the economists hypothesis about this countrys pre eminent position was and is mostly right americas dominance immediately after world war ii was due to the fact that this country was for several decades the only game in the planetary town this early start gave the u s what is known as a "first mover advantage " which is the competitive edge enjoyed by the first occupant of a particular market there are a variety of reasons why first movers often have an edge in the case of u s capital markets that edge arose from two sources first issuers along with the underwriters and lawyers who advised them became comfortable operating on our shores for a business that abhors uncertainty this put new rivals at a distinct disadvantage second from a marketing perspective issuers selling securities outside of their home markets found themselves on the defensive underwriters and lawyers told these issuers that investors would worry that someone selling securities outside of the u s might be trying to hide something by avoiding the "transparency" required by u s capital market regulation in other words prior to sarbox issuers seen as trying to avoid the u s capital markets stuck out like a sore thumb this made their securities hard to sell and served to entrench the u s as the dominant venue among the worlds capital markets sarbox upset this comfortable post war competitive equilibrium it is now becoming not just acceptable but actually fashionable for issuers to avoid u s markets unfortunately for the u s this means that even if the sec granted relief to foreign issuers tomorrow or even if the entire statute were repealed the game has now changed lots of companies already have gone public in london and hong kong both of which have surpassed the u s in the market for ipos with great success there is no longer any need to make an excuse for doing so from a domestic policy perspective this may be the largest hidden cost and unforeseen consequence of sarbox the u s has lost its first mover advantage there is no longer any fear that investors will think a company desiring to go public necessarily has something to hide if it chooses to avoid the litigation burden and sec compliance issues in the u s sarbox has given issuers what they have been waiting for a reasonable basis for avoiding the u s capital markets all of a sudden it is no longer fashionable to be a u s public company its for suckers who cant access the piles of sophisticated "global" capital available elsewhere u s financial institutions bear stearns goldman sachs morgan stanley merrill lynch jpmorgan chase and citigroup are moving their traditional business offshore to follow their clients nicholas andrews the hong kong based head of asia equities at jpmorgan has gone so far as to tell the press "its irrelevant to us where companies list were able to help them in whichever market makes sense the most for their business " moreover as noted by the committee on capital regulation led by messrs hubbard and thornton u s companies are staying private rather than face the dreaded one two punch of the u s plaintiffs bar and the secs regulatory juggernaut even more startlingly some u s issuers are tapping foreign capital markets up from zero years ago last year more than a dozen u s companies went public in the u k the sec has recently proposed to give companies more flexibility in how their internal financial controls are tested under sarboxs infamous section it has also proposed to extend the compliance deadline for the smallest public companies those with a market capitalization of less than &# million neither proposal has made a ripple in the tide moving away from u s capital markets if the u s is to regain its former position in the world capital market much more will have to be done massive litigation risk remains and compliance costs in the u s dwarf those in other countries underwriting fees in the u s are an order of magnitude higher in the u s than elsewhere since it is the same firms which are now underwriting new issuers all over the world the cost differential reflects regulatory burdens and litigation risk we are in the midst of the greatest natural experiment in the history of finance the three great pools of liquidity hong kong london and new york all have modern trading systems under the thumb of the sec new york is competing along the vector of providing the "best " or at least the most regulation london lies in the middle and hong kong does little in the way of actual enforcement my guess is that the middle road will win mr macey is deputy dean of yale law school see related letter
