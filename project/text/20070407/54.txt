pursuits travel middle east a declaration of independence modern reworks of womens ubiquitous black robes show how saudi arabia is changing riyadh saudi arabia billowing black abayas that shroud the shape and protect the virtue of saudi women used to be as monotonous as a mao suit in china not anymore i landed in saudi arabia recently wearing my old abaya a large shapeless swath of silk purchased here in to cover me literally from head to foot only to discover that i was as out of style as someone strolling fifth avenue in an s power suit with giant shoulder pads "my mother used to wear one like that " said norah al yousef a prominent saudi economist pointing to my abaya which makes the wearer resemble a flying crow ms yousef wore a sleek fitted abaya that not only looked much more attractive but was also more practical for a working woman as it had sleeves and snapped up in front like a long coat while the abaya remains black and obligatory always including matching head and sometimes face covering women like ms yousef now exercise a measure of fashion independence by selecting the shape and decoration of their abayas so just as western women have different clothes for different occasions most saudi women own a variety of abayas to suit a variety of occasions from shopping to visiting to parties and increasingly to work the abaya is something of a barometer of the status of women in this conservative islamic society in the late s when i first came here as a reporter most saudi women bowed to the demands of the religious authorities and covered themselves but a growing number of young educated saudi women declined to wear abayas or even ankle length dresses things turned much more restrictive in the s the ruling royal family seeking to appease religious leaders angry at the presence of u s troops whom they branded as infidels polluting the heart of islam pretty much gave the so called "morals police" free rein to harass women who dared not shroud themselves in black soon even western women also were wearing abayas it is a subtle sign of the desire of saudi women recently supported by king abdullah for some small measure of independence and individuality that in recent years women have begun overwhelmingly to wear fitted abayas many lavishly decorated with colorful embroidery or beads or both this is despite complaints from the religious authorities that such decoration calls attention to women and undermines the very purpose of an abaya to make a woman largely invisible on a recent weekend a young saudi woman who works at the saudi french bank here was shopping for a new abaya with her husband "i buy a new one every few weeks " she says "i am in the workplace so this is my image i never take it off at work " because she is pregnant this woman favors a looser style with tight sleeves known as a farasha this hides her shape but leaves her hands and arms free for workplace activities the form fitting style of last year which resembles a long straight coat with long fitted sleeves is still popular but according to the salesman at lamsa a popular store specializing in abayas the latest style is the so called bisht the bisht resembles a perfect square when the arms are extended shoulder height but drapes gracefully over the body when arms are at ones sides lamsa which was started by a saudi woman in the mid s to sell traditional saudi dresses began to sell abayas in the mid s as their ubiquity grew thanks to the dominance of religious authority lamsa now features a catalog of designs from which customers can choose the store will add any decoration a client designs or one can buy an abaya off the rack like shanghai tang the business launched by a hong kong entrepreneur who turned chinese national dress into high fashion and high profits lamsa has transformed the national garb of saudi women into islamic chic not surprisingly all this style costs money while a plain black abaya can sell for as little as saudi riyal or roughly &# the more stylish handmade ones cost anywhere from &# to &# lamsas abayas are handmade in a factory near riyadh ironically most of the intricate embroidery and beading that adorn the garments are done by men because the poor saudi women who would be willing to do such work arent allowed to drive cant afford a driver or even a taxi and are stranded by almost nonexistent public transportation the liberating thing about an abaya is that women can wear anything they favor underneath as ones clothes are largely invisible young saudi women in urban centers like riyadh jidda and dammam often wear jeans and tight t shirts like their western counterparts one sees them without their abayas in all female locations like the luthan health spa or the student cafeteria at queen effat college in jidda or the nada philanthropic society here and in their offices when i visited the offices of kingdom co a corporation headed by prince alwaleed bin talal grandson of the kingdoms founder and one of the worlds richest men i was greeted by latifa al busseir the companys assistant executive director strategic studies in the privacy of her office this young saudi woman was wearing a scoop necked pink sweater stylish form fitting gray slacks and gray heels that accentuated her statuesque figure she looked every bit the french educated sophisticate she is but hanging on the coat rack in her office is the ubiquitous black abaya and scarf that will cover her when she exits into a world where women are not seen and rarely heard in less urbane towns like hail a city of near iraq women clad in shapeless inexpensive black abayas mix and banter unself consciously with men the population is much poorer in hail than urban centers like riyadh and customs are less restrictive as women must don their abayas and go to the citys open market to sell homemade food rugs straw mats and other trinkets to earn money one lady offers camel milk cheese from hands darkly decorated with henna a dye popular in arabia she offers to decorate my hands but observes through a male saudi translator that i will have to sleep overnight while the hands dry the translator jokingly suggests i can sleep at the womans home "no no " she says "i have sons " the irony of abayas is that their ubiquity is largely a modern invention soad dabbagh who founded lamsa and has researched the traditional dress of each of saudi arabias provinces says abayas were originally something to cover the head of a bride as she walked from her home to that of her husband at that time the poor women of arabia who did all the work while their men engaged in continual warfare were not covered they began to seek to emulate wealthy turkish women who protected their light skin by covering their faces "women here began to want to be like the upper class women " she says abayas are worn by some women in other islamic countries most predominantly iran and iraq but not with the uniformity that saudi arabia imposes in most other parts of the muslim world from egypt to jordan to the arab gulf states abayas are rare though a growing number of women prefer the demonstrated modesty of a long dress and a scarf to cover their hair by contrast in dubai one of the tiny arab emirates a short minute flight from here but a world away taxis are driven by women dressed in ankle length pink suits and matching pink pillbox hats one of riyadhs conservative religious sheiks acknowledges that covering ones face isnt a " requirement" of the quran "some women in the prophets time didnt cover their face " he says "the saudi woman wants to be covered this is her freedom of choice " not exactly when lubna olayan a wealthy saudi businesswoman and dr selwa hazzaa a prominent saudi eye specialist stood barefaced before men and women participating in one of the kingdoms national dialogues more than women wrote a letter of protest to king abdullah that the two were degrading all women peer pressure to retain the abaya and head scarf plus covering ones face remains strong one young woman who seeks a career in journalism says she feels guilty and doesnt want to uncover her face until others in society find it acceptable "she represents the majority of women " says samar al fatany a radio journalist in jidda who doesnt cover her face for the foreseeable future a stylish abaya is as daring as most saudi women are prepared or permitted to be a guide for women travelers to riyadh where to stay the al faisaliah is a new hotel connected to the al faisaliah center which includes a shopping mall and offices www alfaisaliahhotel com where to eat eating out isnt something a lone woman does because its not a pleasure in saudi arabia most restaurants segregate women behind partitions around their tables the closest to a drink one can get is "saudi champagne" apple juice and perrier i ate in my hotel room or went out to dinners with groups of saudi men at their homes desert tents palaces or small restaurants one casual relaxed restaurant is r lounge for women only in the new kingdom center riyadhs tallest building www kingdomcentre com sa kc or mondo adjacent to the intercontinental hotel which features international cuisine with an asian flair women sit in the rear but because its in an international hotel they arent hidden behind walls www intercontinental com what to do al faisaliah mall was my favorite place to shop three floors of glimmering stores including harvey nichols and prada a food court and shops with saudi merchandise such as lamsa which sells abayas dresses and old bedouin jewelry www lamsa arabia com the good news for women who are barred from hotel gyms is that there now are a range of health clubs the best is luthan health spa a private club owned by several princesses it has gorgeous gym facilities and endless high end treatments info luthanspa com karen elliott house
