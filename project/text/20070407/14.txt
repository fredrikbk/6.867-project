editorial board the mozambique miracle maputo mozambique in the hulene quarter of this former portuguese colonial capital private minibuses swerve around holes carved in seas of mud metal sheets provide shelter for thousands packed in without electricity or sanitation illiteracy and hiv rates are shockingly high the stench and deprivation take the breath away mozambique is one of the worlds poorest countries its also an african success story here such things are relative to the immediate west zimbabwes robert mugabe misrules his country toward calamity nigeria ivory coast and others are beset by civil conflict and corruption but mozambique scarred by years of civil war and soviet style economics turned itself in the right direction on its own optimism however guarded and africa do sometimes go together for all the debates over development strategies the secret to mozambiques recovery is simple "we opened our markets and dropped the centralized economy " says miquelina menezes who chairs the countrys association of economists and runs a fund devoted to bringing electricity to rural areas "if you want to join the world you have to change we needed to rebuild the country and to rebuild confidence " the elite never experienced an ideological conversion the main drags in maputo once dedicated to portuguese worthies are still named after mao lenin and kim il sung "its our history not our present " laughs ms menezes "they wont change them again " but hyperinflation and a stagnant economy forced leaders of the neo marxist liberation movement frelimo to shift their approach starting in the early s the ruling party cut subsidies opened to outside investment privatized firms nationalized after independence in and got a grip on borrowing and the budget an independent central bank brought inflation into single digits according to the world economic forums competitiveness index mozambique has reformed more than any sub saharan african country the payoff is the highest average growth rate at over the last decade among the continents non oil exporters gdp per capita is a still tiny &# but thats compared with &# in since poverty rates decreased more in rural areas from to than in urban to according to the world bank child mortality has declined to per live births from and primary school enrollment has risen to from once a leading recipient of food aid mozambique now exports maize with average yearly growth in farming in the last years banks telecom and tourist firms many from neighboring south africa have come in "economic and political stability has been the key factor" to reviving the country says thiago fonseca who runs the golo advertising agency here his challenges a lack of skilled workers and hiv aids which has claimed the lives of a couple of his employees the nations hiv prevalence rate is which will reduce life expectancy to age by from today appreciating the change for the better takes some imagination like many of its neighbors mozambique went from colonialism under portugal still a developing country itself to a cold war proxy conflict that claimed a million lives out of million and left a generation uneducated few of the paved roads have been worked on since the portuguese left years ago "a lot of the growth is catch up after war " says the world banks man in maputo michael baxter but neighbors in similar straits havent put in place mozambiques fixes inflation in zimbabwe is nearby malawi and zambia their economies distorted by subsidies on commodities are growing haphazardly "you need political will" to get it right says mr baxter "starting from a low base" or "being a former colony" oft heard excuses for africa has little impact on economic performance what matters as regional
