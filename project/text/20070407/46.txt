pursuits leisure &amp arts its fun to watch these opera dvds works mozart wrote when just a kid benefit from a fresh approach last summer over in austria the salzburg festival unleashed the stage equivalent of a gigantic boxed set performances of all the operas of them written by salzburgs most famous native son the immortal mozart and now these performances have come out on dvds from deutsche grammophon and decca which does raise a question twenty two operas you can go to the opera all your life and hear only six or seven of these pieces with only four guaranteed to show up regularly so where have all the others been the answer very simply is that mozart wrote a lot of them when he was just a kid he was a child prodigy as we know and wrote his first opera when he was just by the time he was hed written nine more and while i wouldnt call these pieces kid stuff even in his teens mozart could construct a piece of music as well as any adult child prodigies do have their limits when youre a kid youre a kid and you dont feel emotions like a grown up so these early mozart works accomplished as they are and often pretty can sometimes seem a little blank and yet i got addicted to these dvds in part i had a specialists reaction which i wouldnt expect everyone to share i loved hearing mozart learn his craft hed write one blank though pretty aria then another and then hed pounce like a teenage eagle on a key dramatic climax later when he had more to say he could make those moments jump right off the stage but i also loved the way the operas were produced that includes the most famous pieces apart from "the magic flute " which is beautifully designed but somehow dead "don giovanni" and "cosi fan tutte " though are wonderfully smart and also gripping and also when appropriate lots of fun the production style is modern we see contemporary people people we might know doing everything that mozart specified and its easy to connect with them but the early operas benefit the most from this because they need some help so theres a giant venus flytrap in a piece id never heard before "la finta giardiniera" "the phony gardener" when it ate the leading tenor he deserved that because in a plot twist unusual in comic opera hed almost killed his girlfriend later when he frees himself and limps around blurting out some th century platitude about unkind fate the flytrap opens hungrily both making fate real and giving it some attitude and yes the venus flytrap isnt something mozart specified but if we think that we can resurrect all his vanished teenage expectations well just remember that these would have included an audience that talked during the performance along with singers and instrumentalists who improvised we cant bring the th century back but what we can do especially in productions that visibly give the singers both energy and a lot of joy is remember that were watching th century opera in and that any meaning it might have for us has to come from the lives were living now for this id also recommend a more serious teenage work "lucio silla " about an evil roman dictator who sees the error of his ways this in mozarts time was an th century cliche but the salzburg production turned it into striking theater above all at the end where the cliche gets replaced by a chilling reinvention the dictator is killed in his place there rises someone wholl be just as bad and the music of rejoicing with which the opera ends with which it had to end because thats what the th century demanded now sounds like empty almost shocking propaganda which is to say that weve learned a lot since the th century among much else we dont trust happy endings or at least not routine ones in these productions mozarts operas show us not just who he was but who we are too mr sandow is a veteran critic composer and consultant whos writing a book on the future of classical music
