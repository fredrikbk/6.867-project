pursuits style accessories what your time is really worth its &# counteracts gravity and shows the phases of the moon it even tells time amid soaring prices and an influx of new collectors how to assess the value of a once basic accessory rome benedetto mauro realized the winds of the watch industry were no longer blowing his way during a sushi dinner last october the evening was hosted by swiss watch manufacturer patek philippe to celebrate the unveiling of its latest nautilus model mr mauro one of italys top dealers had hoped to order a dozen of the watches which retail for up to &# however as scores of dealers and collectors from around the world filed in mr mauro saw what he was up against "you cant even ask they tell you how many watches youll get " mr mauro recalls patek philippe held him to a six nautilus limit with high end watch prices reaching remarkable levels knowing what to buy and what to pay is increasingly complicated hedge fund managers wall street bankers and newly minted moguls are stoking demand a process furthered as watches become a collecting obsession alongside cars and contemporary art devotees spend anywhere from &# to upwards of &# on timepieces that in some cases only a watch buff would recognize as more than nice looking jewelry in response makers say theyre working to boost production theyre rolling out new models that try to justify their lavish price tags with jeweled faces and cases made from precious metals traditionalists eschew such external embellishments preferring esoteric mechanical details harry winstons opus v for example has rotating cubes in place of hour hands other watches have ultra miniature chimes that can sound off hours and minutes for serious collectors only mens watches qualify the dainty casings typical of womens models are too small to hold all of the intricate innards what makes shopping for watches at this level somewhat mystifying is partly that so much of the price tag is at best on the inside and in some cases intangible prices can vary dramatically for two watches that look remarkably similar the a lange &amp soehne lange and the nomos tangente date power reserve dont look drastically different but at &# the lange costs nearly times as much as the tangente one reason its considered one of the most mechanically impressive watches in addition some watches hold their value much better than others the wall street journal surveyed collectors dealers and appraisers poring over auction prices for more than watches the results underscored the challenge for shoppers trying to judge the value of elite timepieces for example while connoisseurs say the &# martin braun eos which debuted in has the potential to gain in value some watches that have already come up at auction

elsewhere in luxury goods watchmakers are walking a delicate line catering to demand while at the same time maintaining the scarcity that gives an aura of exclusivity audemars piguet rewards longtime clients with first dibs on limited edition watches sold at their own boutiques patek philippe sets aside a handful of the brands most highly coveted watches for top clients this pecking order is also sometimes used to drive sales of less popular models dealers like rome based hausmann &amp co commonly bundle their sales of blue chip watches with less popular models that practice can force buyers who lack clout to spend tens of thousands of dollars on watches with less complex designs before they can get their hands on a highly coveted watch manufacturers keep a tight grip on distribution watches are only sold through authorized dealers or through directly operated boutiques that vet customers to make sure they are not re selling the watches on the secondary or "gray" market to stay ahead of the curve seasoned collectors maintain networks of dealers around the world who can give them access to the hottest models and actively lobby manufacturers for preferential treatment or inside scoops on upcoming watches the influx of new money and new blood is also driving a subculture of hard core collectors melvyn teillol foo a year old pharmaceutical executive in singapore plunged into collecting in after receiving his first big bonus &# from pharmacia he says he set out to spend a large chunk of it on a gold watch which he had always viewed as a status symbol but while browsing at selfridges in london a salesman steered him to a model that was less flashy and more intricate on the inside a white gold limited edition omega deville featuring a co axial escapement a mechanism that regulates the speed of a watchs movement the first in omegas history mr teillol foo paid about &# for the omega while his wife snapped up a mens &# ulysse nardin london medal commemoration in rose gold a year later he returned to selfridges and bought not just the same model but one with a serial number consecutive to his wifes watch he says obsessing over such minute details was worth it because the watches are "a good conversation piece with fellow collectors " with time his interest in mechanical watches grew with dealers actively courting him the collector made what he calls "frenzied acquisitions " updating his collection at least once a month soon he had a different high end watch to wear every week of the year more recently mr teillol foo began to notice he wasnt the only budding collector with plenty of cash to spend dealers were no longer pursuing him he had to criss cross asia to keep tabs on them he also started planning his vacations to europe around trips to watch factories in germany and switzerland to see new models he says the biggest cost of collecting isnt measured in dollars but in the energy he spends on it "its about how much you have to sacrifice in terms of family life " entry level limited editions priced between &# and &# became especially difficult to procure so mr teillol foo decided to move up market at a singapore watch fair in he decided to rarify his collection unloading lower end watches ranging from rolexes to seikos that he judged lacking in "horological merit " the group sold for a total &# roughly of what mr teillol foo originally paid for them he now buys more selectively rationing his time and money so that he can move swiftly and decisively on large acquisitions he has also developed a passion for watches containing a complex mechanism known as a "tourbillon " which counters the effects of gravity on a watchs accuracy tourbillon watches he says confer a level of status on their owners superior to exotic cars and other collectible items because they cost just as much money and never have to be left behind "theres more to life than just ferraris and maseratis " he says to be of interest to serious collectors a watch must be handmade in switzerland or in some cases germany and have intricate movements inside battery powered watches need not apply they must be mechanical either winding or automatic which means they wind themselves using the stored energy from a wearers movements some collectors spend upwards of &# on cabinets that keep the watches wound when theyre

the industrys largest market "in every part of the world the demand for watches is increasing " says thierry stern chief executive of patek philippe when manufacturers gather in basel and geneva this month for the industrys top fairs therefore scores of collectors and dealers in search of investment grade watches will turn out to rub elbows seasoned collectors are discovering that nurturing contacts within the industry is key to beating the rush thomas mao a los angeles based management consultant and avid watch collector traveled to the geneva headquarters of audemars piguet in october to see a prototype of the royal oak offshore alinghi team the &# sports watch is forged from carbon fiber similar to material used to construct the boat which the alinghi team sailed to victory in the

party at the alinghi team headquarters in valencia spain the entire edition sold out by then however mr mao had already pounced "whos going to be the one left standing when the music stops obviously if youre not in the in circle youre going to be left out " mr mao says some collectors complain that the rush to snap up watches for their market value is undercutting the very purpose of watch collecting the enjoyment of wearing them mr mao recalls recently meeting with an up and coming collector who kept his watches in their original packaging hauling them around in a gym bag "there must
