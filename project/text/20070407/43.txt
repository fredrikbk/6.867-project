pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state saving wine for the baby i bought a couple of cases of and brunello di montalcino that id love to open when my girls turn those were the years they were born i do have them stored in a small wine cellar at degrees but as you can see i still have a few years to go however my friend told me that in general italian wines especially brunellos do not hold well through time regardless of whether they are properly stored or not is this correct should i be concerned that when the time comes and i open one of these they will be mediocre mario ruiz miami relax brunello ages well for a very long time and these were excellent years with proper care they will be wonderful more broadly we are asked so often about laying down wines for newborns that we devoted an entire chapter to this in our most recent book "wine for every day and every occasion " while there are many great possibilities top notch bordeaux and port are classic examples were particularly fond of laying down fine sauternes not only does it get better and better with age but it even gets prettier and prettier in the clear bottle which means your child can enjoy the wine long before he or she can actually drink it unfortunately the best sauternes estates dont make wine in every vintage so this might not always be possible however the best wines from all over the world often arent released for three years or so after harvest anyway so you have plenty of time to investigate this remember that if you are going to lay down a case for the kids proper storage is important getting the first taste here are a couple of responses to a recent item about sommeliers who taste your wine before you do i just returned from a trip to paris where i had the good fortune to dine at several two and three star restaurants at all of them the sommeliers always tasted the wine in a separate glass of course so no reason to be grossed out before offering it to us i think the american sommeliers are merely copying their european counterparts and given that many wines are corked it is not a bad thing ernie tiu new york if the real purpose of a "tasting sommelier" is to ensure the wine is "sound " which presumably means not corked it certainly isnt necessary to taste it a corked bottle will usually assault the nose with the foul pungency of moldy gym socks as soon as it is opened still i suppose i could allow a sommelier to give the glass a swirl and a pass under his nose with a quick flourish if he absolutely thought he must but the thought of him tasting it supposedly on my behalf is so revolting and insulting it would be difficult for me not to flee the restaurant immediately and never return thomas katheder lake buena vista fla
