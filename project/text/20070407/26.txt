a lottery watch out for schemes aimed to help you avoid taxes one surprisingly popular pitch set up a complex transaction in which you "sell" your rights to a stream of future payments say those annual lottery payments and then report the proceeds as a long term capital gain because capital gains are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income this maneuver should result in lower taxes right

lottery tickets most people can claim their gambling losses as long as they itemize deductions but only up to the amount of their winnings one easy way to attract irs attention is to deduct hefty losses each year from what you consider to be a business but what the irs considers a hobby the bar can be high you need to demonstrate that you are in business for the primary purpose of making a profit to do this you may need to hire a tax pro with experience in this area before firing off your return do a final check to see whether the income you reported matches what was reported on forms
