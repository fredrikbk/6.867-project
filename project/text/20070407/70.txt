u s options on iran strike now or keep our heads in the sand bravo to lt gen thomas g mcinerney for his crystal clear assessment of the u s options regarding a menacing and dangerous iranian regime "iran escalates " editorial page march his comments on the danger of the prevalent "head in the sand" inaction by our u s politicians arab countries and european allies should be required reading by all our dithering while more than american soldiers have been killed by iranian supplied efps explosively formed penetrators sends the wrong signal to the iranian leaders that america is weak gen mcinerney paints a picture of the u s capability to assemble a large scale force able to ratchet up the military pressure on the iranian regime in response to its culpability in the deaths of u s soldiers and citizens his can do suggestion of using precision airpower supporting covert and indigenous forces will address the one virtue that the mullahs do fear and respect overwhelming military superiority by a "coalition of the willing " craig d blattner longwood fla gen mcinerneys commentary has an eerily familiar tenor he flippantly asserts that iran is a "rich environment for unrest " and that american attacks "would probably unleash a new iranian revolution " this and his calls for bypassing the u n and the assemblage of a "coalition of the willing " might as well be cut and pasted from the pre iraq invasion rhetoric about cakewalks and u s forces being welcomed as liberators gen mcinerney also claims that "wed welcome an open fight on our terms" with hezbollah which could be carried out with the help of unspecified "indigenous forces " and much bombing in lieu of ground forces israel far better suited to such campaigns than the u s military had a much different experience last summer when air strikes leveling much of lebanons infrastructure only served to empower hezbollah gen mcinerney calls for more reckless funding of unworkable missile defense systems and states the u s "could target nuclear support facilities or iranian leadership or other targets calculated to put heat on the regime without endangering civilians " more likely the power struggle that would be engendered by assassinating the iranian regimes leaders would lead to a very ugly iraq style unrest never mind the "collateral damage" inevitably caused by air strikes gen mcinerney fails to take into account any of the recent facts on the ground in iraq and elsewhere all of which belie his claims he would ignore all of the lessons of the disastrous war we are currently losing in favor of yet another unwinnable conflict which would likely cost an untold number of american and iranian lives increase al qaedas influence in the region plunge our country into greater debt and exacerbate animosity toward the united states throughout the world rico cleffi brooklyn n y
