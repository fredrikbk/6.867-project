economists learn matchmaker role chicago in job hunting as in love finding a match can be a harrowing experience that all too often ends in unhappiness some economists think they know how to make it less painful and they are using their fellow dismal scientists as guinea pigs at this past weekends annual meeting of the american economic association which hosts a vast job market for aspiring professors academics tested a technique borrowed from online dating to more efficiently match job candidates and potential employers it is called "signaling " and it is designed to reduce the time and cost of hiring professors by weeding out those who arent serious prospects and homing in on those who are signaling depends on a centralized system through which each job seeker sends signals essentially electronic pings to two potential employers with a limited number of signals to send the logic goes candidates will send them only to schools where they really want to work job candidates were warned not to waste signals on schools that should already know they are interested or are out of their range but instead aim at schools that wouldnt otherwise be aware of their special interest schools also were told not to take the absence of a signal as a brush off "think of it like a dating site " says alvin roth a harvard professor who chairs the aeas ad hoc committee on the job market "were trying to figure out if we can help people make matches " the allusion to dating is apt the aea system shares an idea and an advisor stanford economist muriel niederle with cupid com on that online dating site women face a problem akin to that of employers men signal their interest in women by sending electronic messages but because it is easy to send hundreds of messages it is difficult and time consuming for women to separate spammers from good prospects in the summer of at the suggestion of prof niederle and mit economist dan ariely cupid began allotting each of its male members two electronic roses a month which they could send along with messages to women whom they wanted to impress the scarcity of roses motivates the suitors to be selective and serious "its been a wonderful thing " says eric straus ceo of cupid com who estimates the roses have increased a suitors chances of getting a reply "one of the problems in online dating is that men are ignored and women are inundated anything that allows a message to stand out is a great benefit " economists couldnt have found a better testing ground for their ideas than the grueling market for newly minted economics ph d s every year about soon to be doctoral graduates converge on the site of the aea meetings creating traffic jams at elevators and squeezing as many as job interviews into three or four days time and space constraints get so severe that candidates often find themselves sitting on hotel beds as they pitch themselves sometimes to five or six interviewers who typically are male and might include nobel prize winners and heads of economics departments "its quite unpleasant especially for women " says david colander a professor of economics at middlebury college in vermont he estimates that because of the arduous nature of the selection process the hiring of one young professor can cost a school from &# to &# this year new jobs were listed at the aea amid the noise and rush potential employers make a lot of mistakes in allotting their attention some lower tier schools for fear of being spurned avoid interviewing graduates of top tier programs thus missing some who might have had a special reason to choose them due to location family or hobby considerations others set their sights too high inviting candidates who would never accept their advances leaving better matches feeling unappreciated and unwanted as a result many qualified candidates fall through the cracks profs roth and niederle belong to a growing field of economics known as market design which is rooted in the idea that markets if left to develop on their own often get into trouble and need to be fixed market designs most notable achievements include federal auctions for radio spectrum which have earned the government billions of dollars in revenue and the national resident matching program an automated clearinghouse that successfully matches hospitals to new doctors based on preferences each side feeds into the system if the signaling experiment works for economists it could lead the way to meaningful improvements in a broad range of markets from college admissions to placement of freshly minted business graduates and lawyers "we want to make markets work more efficiently " prof roth says "that would result in more people being happy with their jobs in more firms being happy with their employees and presumably society being more productive " it is still early to say whether the endeavor will succeed in all prof roth says job seekers sent signals suggesting that most at least gave it a try participants offered mixed impressions ethan kaplan a professor at stockholm university who is interviewing candidates this year said the signaling led him to focus on one prospect who otherwise might not have stood out whatever the outcome some have doubts that economists would ever willingly submit to a fully efficient market such as the one that assigns doctors to hospitals "the academic job market is a thing that could be enormously rationalized " says prof colander who has proposed an automated clearinghouse for economists "but that doesnt mean that economists want to have their lives structured by a market "
