p&amp g boosts social networking efforts latest sites shift tack from brand promotion to market research procter &amp gamble in its biggest foray into the hot web phenomenon of social networking is launching two web sites aimed at creating online communities where the consumer products titan can learn more about its customers and market to them one site will be celebrity and fan club driven tied to p&amp gs decades old peoples choice awards and the other is capessa a women oriented site produced by procter &amp gamble for the health section of yahoo capessa designed to be a forum for women to discuss subjects such as parenting pregnancy and weight loss had been tested for several months and went up dec the peoples choice community site formally kicks off wednesday a day after cbs broadcasts this years award ceremony the awards are given to tv stars based on votes from viewers the social network scene so far has been dominated by the likes of news corp s myspace com and facebook inc s facebook com which draw millions of visitors although a long list of niche sites are increasingly proving a draw marketers also are starting to build their own sites using them as gathering places for consumers to spread buzz about certain products or brands this move by p&amp g the worlds biggest advertiser with an annual ad budget of &# billion is likely to draw even more marketers into the arena p&amp g of cincinnati makes a vast array of consumer goods including pampers diapers folgers coffee and tide detergent the two new web sites follow smaller steps by several p&amp g brands into social networking recently p&amp gs crest toothpaste brand for example launched a myspace page last year that featured a fictional character called miss irresistible encouraging friends to take a quiz separately p&amp gs herbal essences shampoo brand created a myspace page that allowed people to show off pictures of their hairstyles unlike those efforts p&amp gs new sites will be less about promoting specific brands and more about market research both new sites will act as continuing focus group type environments where p&amp g by monitoring consumer discussions on the sites can learn more about its target audiences likes and dislikes and what consumers in different stages of life care about p&amp g is already an expert in studying consumer behavior using such methods as visiting consumers at home but its new sites offer the chance to do research quicker and on a bigger scale p&amp g will use the information to design marketing plans that resonate better with its audience "its going to be one giant living dynamic learning experience about consumers " says jim stengel p&amp gs global marketing officer the sites will do some marketing for p&amp g the peoples choice site which will feature queen latifah as a host will carry regular banner ads for p&amp g and non p&amp g products p&amp g also hopes the site will bolster the awards shows sagging ratings which have fallen since according to nielsen media research marketing on capessa will be more subtle p&amp g wont run ads for its products on capessa pages indeed the only mention of p&amp g on the capessa site is a line at the bottom of web pages that identifies capessa as being produced by a p&amp g company yahoo which is promoting the site as a big feature of its health section says it doesnt want to over commercialize the site given the serious nature of subjects being discussed capessa will occasionally offer some links to p&amp g experts offering tips about specific issues such as parenting or offer up a p&amp g newsletter on a particular subject "much like when a consumer is searching for something today with google yahoo or msn brands serve up a message while they are searching to help that consumer but they do it in a way that is engaging and not disruptive " mr stengel says "if we cross that line we kill the experience " success for p&amp gs new sites is no slam dunk retail giant wal mart stores pulled the plug on a teen targeted social networking site "the hub " last year after it failed to gain steam capessas focus on women pits it against numerous other rivals including nbc universals women focused web site ivillage p&amp g believes it has an advantage because both of its sites will be produced by p&amp g productions a unit formed in that is best known for producing popular soap operas such as "as the world turns" and "guiding light " indeed both sites will have a slicker look than well established social networking sites reflecting the older audience of to year olds that p&amp g is aiming for compared with the teenagers and twentysomethings that crowd sites like myspace as a result on capessa instead of encouraging women to post homemade videos p&amp g will offer them the chance to be interviewed by p&amp gs production firm "the to core of the demo is not going to want to sift through some of the garbage on youtube to find some inspirational videos " says scott moore head of news and information for yahoo media group the site is currently offering video stories such as "how i lost my baby weight julies story " "running for her life a cancer comeback" and "mommy meltdown leiahs story " yahoos venture with p&amp g on capessa comes as the web portal is trying to gain ground in social networking by joining with consumer brands in the creation of specific sites p&amp gs content development partnership with yahoo is the biggest social networking deal yahoo has done with a marketer to date says mr moore who declined to discuss terms of the p&amp g deal other web giants have taken a similar tack last year google teamed with nike to create joga com a social networking site dedicated to avid soccer fans
