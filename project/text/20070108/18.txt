buyers remorse speculators helped fuel floridas housing boom slump in chic naples shows market perils ms dresners auction naples fla in this once sleepy retirement haven on floridas west coast was arguably the hottest housing market in the country builders held lotteries to determine who could purchase homes in new gated communities in the older neighborhoods buyers were snapping up modest ranch houses and cottages soon after they were listed for sale the median home price more than doubled between and to about &# the frenzied run up prompted economists at banking concern national city corp and the economic consulting firm global insight inc to label naples "the most overvalued" housing market in the u s in the second quarter of a dubious honor it retains today prices are dropping the number of unsold homes on the market has swelled to more than twice the national average and investors are scrambling to unload their properties such a crescendo of activity might have prompted some to pull back but plenty of investors who purchased homes to rent or flip continued to buy and sell through the height of the boom one of them was marjorie dresner the canadian native believed that naples with its laid back balmy atmosphere would long be an attractive market a prolific investor she purchased dozens of houses in recent years many of them with a partner one of them cost her &# million the early run up in real estate prices in naples was based on strong economic fundamentals low interest rates the creation of new mortgage products and a strong economy triggered a wave of home buying by making ownership affordable for the masses and naples was especially desirable with its chic restaurants impeccably landscaped streets stretches of pristine beaches and influx of baby boomers but its increasingly evident that investors and speculators here and elsewhere played a greater role than previously thought in pumping up the real estate bubble especially near the end of the run in late october ms dresner tried auctioning off of her properties but some bids were as much as lower than what she paid one three bedroom ranch house she purchased in july in the middle class lake park neighborhood fetched a high bid of &# ms dresner and a partner paid &# for the house according to county records ms dresner wont talk much about her investment experience but prefers to focus on the positive "i did very well in the beginning " she says "i look at the overall picture you dont just look at one year " economists cite individual investors for pushing prices up excessively and lenders for lowering their credit standards borrowers were able to purchase homes with little or no money down and often without having to verify their income and financial assets in many areas builders made things worse by putting up too many houses for the market to absorb "if you look at the last two contractions you can see what caused it high mortgage rates and a slumping economy " says david lereah chief economist at the national association of realtors "today we dont have that the economy is still good the thing that sent us into a contraction was that house prices were getting high and affordability was aggravated by investor speculation " many economists and housing industry executives had previously estimated that as few as of the buyers in hot markets were investors a survey by the national association of realtors found that of buyers in were investors at the peak of the naples market in and as many as of buyers may have been investors local real estate agents say the naples boom and bust also illustrates how some savvy investors can help rebalance markets by coming back in and picking up the pieces left by previous investors indeed some of the buyers who placed bids on ms dresners houses at the auction in october were other investors one of them was jerry krecicki jr "its all about timing " says mr krecicki a local real estate investor and real estate agent who believes the market will rebound mr krecicki a former car salesman with salt and pepper hair decided to enter the fray and got his license to sell real estate in september his brokerage remax elite realty encouraged him to focus on selling homes in the areas he knew best so mr krecicki chose the lake park neighborhood where he lives near the heart of quaint downtown naples and just across a highway from the ritzier neighborhoods closer to the beach mr krecicki also decided to buy investment homes to build a retirement nest egg his strategy was to rent out some homes and sell others to use the profits to buy more properties in october mr krecicki and a partner bought their first investment property a three bedroom one story house on th avenue in lake park they paid &# using a mortgage loan secured by the equity in their primary residences and spent &# on renovations in hopes of selling it for a profit mr krecicki says his first full year as a real estate agent was relatively slow as he built his reputation around the neighborhood but by early business had picked up that year home prices across naples rose and the city was gaining a reputation across the country mostly through word of mouth as a hot market its waterfront was crowding with massive mansions baby boomers were buying second homes young people were moving to naples to work as money managers lawyers and real estate agents the international airport in nearby fort myers made it easy to reach investors smelled opportunity "people wanted a piece of naples so badly they were willing to buy whatever came on the market " says michael tomany a real estate agent who owns properties in naples by investors were scouring every corner of naples including lake park although many of the homes were small and drab they were built on spacious lots facing quiet streets adorned with palm trees and shrubbery that caught the attention of home buyers willing to tear down the old homes and rebuild new bigger homes or undertake substantial renovations ms dresner also saw the potential in lake park the toronto native had been buying investment properties in and around naples since collier county records show part of her strategy was to renovate the older houses or team up with builders to tear down and construct new homes "our objective was to renovate and transform neighborhoods " she says mr krecicki says he met ms dresner a few months after he sold her his home on th avenue in lake park in september for &# more than double what he paid for it after that deal mr krecicki served as her real estate agent on multiple sales in lake park soon after homes went on the market "marjorie was on the top of my list" to call he says ms dresner bought several homes in and around lake park in and records show she also bought houses in the pricier section of naples known as the moorings mr krecickis business as a sales agent was booming he says he closed &# million in sales in up from &# million in he also got more interested in properties for investment he says he bought two more homes in lake park including a duplex for &# in april seven months after he bought the duplex in october mr krecicki sold it to ms dresner and a partner for &# county records show meanwhile longtime lake park residents were emboldened by the escalating prices which had skyrocketed in and in across naples they tried to cash in "a lot of people had false hopes for what they could get for their properties so everybody put their houses on the market with unrealistic expectations " says john turner a real estate agent who also lives and sells homes in lake park "they see a sale for &# and they say wow i can get that too " dona steele an artist lives next to a three bedroom ranch house that ms dresner bought for &# in july the house which sits on a lake sold for &# in february "we were just laughing at these prices " ms steele says "i grew up here and its out of control this used to be a working class neighborhood " ms dresner says she never bought a home for more than its appraised value "the sellers can ask whatever but its up to the banks in how they appraise it " she says "i never overpaid for anything " several factors converged in late and early that turned naples investors into mass home sellers the active hurricane season caused a spike in insurance rates throughout florida coupled with a rise in short term interest rates and property taxes investors now were facing higher carrying costs ms dresner says she was growing tired of the burdens of being a landlord many of her properties were listed for sale in early but some were slow to move in late october she tried a new tactic and auctioned off the houses mr krecicki says he went to the auction out of curiosity and jumped into the bidding when he saw the low prices "after about two hours a house came up for bid that i knew very well " mr krecicki recounted in a monthly newsletter he distributes called the lake park journal "i looked at my friend next to me with a bidding card and check in his hand and asked him arent you going to bid on this one cmon man split bid on this one " they put up the highest bid which was &# it was the same house mr krecicki and a partner sold to ms dresner for &# given the huge price drop "it would have been stupidity" not to bid mr krecicki says many of the sales from the auction havent closed yet in many cases the top bids on ms dresners homes werent high enough to pay off her lenders in full says auctioneer paul drake ms dresners lawyer says she has received additional offers on several houses since the auction but that no sales have closed in the past month both countrywide home loans inc and the bank of new york filed court papers in collier county circuit court in florida saying they are seeking to force a foreclosure sale on two properties owned by ms dresner ms dresner says she isnt in financial difficulty mr krecicki and a partner still own about a dozen homes that they are renting out he says they have cash reserves to cover homes where expenses exceed the rental income he says he feels badly that ms dresner has had trouble selling her properties "this market downturn came out of nowhere like a snowstorm " he says "it surprised everybody especially the people making mortgage payments "
