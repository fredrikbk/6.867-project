americas coca democracy evo morales is an anti american extremist who wants to turn bolivia into another venezuela that naturally alarms washington but not enough to halt its war on drugs which is aiding the president and leader of bolivias coca growing peasant movement in his bid to become a dictator in a recent interview with the bolivian catholic radio station fides mr morales explained that in when he was at a conference in havana fidel castro told him "not to stage an armed uprising" but to "make transformations democratic revolutions what venezuelan president hugo chavez is doing " the process fidel advised requires the slow dismantling of institutions that act as checks on the executive while maintaining the guise of democracy this calls for healthy poll numbers even while the rule of law is being trampled mr chavez had oil revenues to keep the masses happy while he put a noose around democracy but evo isnt so fortunate and he cant push through a constitutional coup without popular backing so to generate support he has relied heavily on his defense of coca growers against a u s policy that presses countries in latin america to destroy their crops since his inauguration last january mr morales has been dutifully complying with the cuban dictators instructions he has purged the military leadership broken contracts with energy investors to signal his control over the sector and pushed through an election for a constituent assembly that is charged with rewriting the highest law of the land so far so good but the assembly election didnt turn out the way he had hoped in the event mr moraless movement toward socialism mas party won only of the seats since the law requires a two thirds majority to approve the new document the presidents party is looking at compromise with his political opponents in the drafting process apparently this is the sort of thing fidel did not counsel so now the morales government is insisting that ratification of the new constitution should require only a simple majority vote in the assembly or a simple majority in a national referendum to win on this point mr morales will have to run roughshod over the law and he has already begun over the christmas holiday he unilaterally named four new justices to the supreme courts seat bench the president says these are legal recess appointments but the opposition is crying foul because the mas controlled congress never initiated the nomination process that would have safeguarded the independence of the court bolivian democrats are worried that mr morales will also try to alter the makeup of the constitutional court and the electoral council to favor his own objectives things looks grim for democrats who believe that mr morales is trying to remake the constitution in the image and likeness of mr chavezs venezuela but theyre not going down without a fight the center of the opposition movement is based in the energy rich agricultural lowlands of the eastern part of the country where there is a long history of agitation in favor of more decentralized government the morales presidency with its promise to expropriate and redistribute land its heavy handed intervention in the natural gas sector and now its attempt at a constitutional coup has heightened that sentiment and provoked a strong backlash against la paz in july when bolivians voted on the constitutional assembly they also answered another ballot question regarding departmental state autonomy in santa cruz pando beni and tarija autonomy won hands down more recently the east took to the streets on dec the opposition organized a "townhall meeting" in bolivias largest city santa cruz to rally against mr moraless power grab pro morales supporters blockaded a highway outside of the city so that buses carrying protestors could not get through as many as people were injured and most of the buses had to turn back but the rally was a success an estimated people congregated under the citys christ the redeemer statue to demand that a new constitution be ratified only with a two thirds vote in the assembly and that the call for autonomy be respected mr morales who badly needs to maintain the appearance of public support so that the international community tolerates his takeover had to be embarrassed by this outpouring of democratic opposition he is trying to spin the constitutional crisis as a confrontation between races and economic classes but he has to worry about places like the poor and largely indigenous city of el alto just above la paz where there is evidence to suggest that many who voted for him are unhappy with his unlawful intervention in the constitutional process and growing impatient with his failure to deliver on economic promises this is where u s drug policy comes in railing against the yankees who want to destroy peasant income has proven extremely effective in keeping the morales base the countrys indigenous coca growers who brought him to power energized and his numbers afloat he reaffirmed this last month as his opposition swelled he suddenly announced that he would authorize a near doubling of the number of hectares that may legally produce coca then last week he inaugurated a coca industrialization plant in the province of cochabamba financed by his government along with cuba and venezuela according to press reports mr morales told the cochabamba crowd that coca "never killed anyone" and that the u s "should have a law to do away with drug addicts " mr morales shouldnt wish too hard for that if washington policy makers ever decide to tackle the demand for cocaine and stop blaming supply mr moraless political career would be in jeopardy write to ogrady wsj com see related letter "letters to the editor
