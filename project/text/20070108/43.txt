new deals aim to put the tv into internet tv in a spate of deals that could undercut the role of cable and satellite companies several tv networks including nickelodeon showtime and starz have reached agreements with microsoft corp to let people watch their web programming on tv sets starz a cable movie service owned by liberty media corp has struck a deal giving viewers tv access to its movie download services on the web showtime a premium movie channel owned by cbs corp has agreed to a similar arrangement for its showtime interactive web site as with those two deals viacoms nickelodeon cable channel has made arrangements with microsoft to let people watch its web based tv programming on their tv sets via microsofts xbox or any computer equipped with its new windows vista operating system among the programming available under these deals are major hollywood films sporting highlights from showtime interactive and full episodes of certain nickelodeon series such as "spongebob squarepants " in the past year most of the major tv networks have begun offering at least part of their programming lineups including some of their most popular shows on their web sites now viewers have to watch these shows on computers but a growing number of devices are appearing that make it easier for people to link their tv sets to the web this is pushing networks to consider teaming up with companies launching these devices such as microsoft one reason is that some of the new gadgets will allow people to watch the web content on tv whether the media companies sign on or not and the networks would much rather have some control over how their content is distributed also they dont want to be cut out of new revenue streams that might pop up with this type of distribution and by agreeing early on to work with a company such as microsoft the networks get a big promotional push for their online content in the background is the murky area of copyright some media companies see technology companies that are aiming to distribute their content in new ways as infringing on their rights teaming up with a technology company provides some clarity these latest agreements herald a growing shift by tv networks to use the internet as a way to distribute their programming to tv potentially bypassing cable and satellite operators if more arrangements are struck people will find it easier to watch their favorite tv shows without paying a cable bill that could fray one of the tv industrys business models "nobody expects deals such as this to have an impact overnight " says josh bernoff a media analyst with forrester research "but if youre a cable operator this is very disturbing " in the long term these deals could prompt some viewers to drop their cable or satellite subscriptions as theyll be able to get the content via the internet however because cable and satellite firms now pay for the right to carry their programming that could eventually hurt the tv networks as well for now both sides are playing down these possibilities most cable operators note that the internet would become overloaded if millions of households began depending on it for tv while the internet can send millions of computer quality videos at once it couldnt deliver the bits necessary to provide continuous tv quality video especially with so many households buying high definition sets whats more as cable operators are one of the main providers of high speed internet they wouldnt lose out completely if people switched to web based video yet cable industry executives acknowledge that the internet already poses a threat to their video on demand businesses most cable companies offer hundreds of movies for a fee if web download services such as starzs vongo offer more desirable titles consumers may use them instead especially if they can easily watch the movies on their tv sets cable operators also note that the media companies that have most aggressively put prime content on the web are those who dont get cash licensing fees from cable or satellite companies for instance aside from showtime cbs corp owns only a small college sports cable network cbs chief executive leslie moonves has pursued a "cable bypass" strategy in which cbs launches new programming channels on the web the network has put most of its prime time lineup on the web cbs could easily be the first major broadcast network to team up with a web giant to move programming from the internet to tv sets says mr bernoff network executives say such deals will simply widen the number of people who can see their programming "we look at this as additive " says bob greene executive vice president of advanced services for starz which operates movie channels under the star and encore brands he says of subscribers to vongo dont subscribe to any of starzs cable channels a spokesman for nickelodeon says the agreement with microsoft is an extension of its strategy to distribute content in as many ways as possible to reach new consumers technology companies have been working on ways to route web based videos to tv sets for years but most of the efforts have been too clunky and complicated to attract many users one thing thats changing is that technology companies such as intel corp and microsoft are coming out with new chips and software that ease the transfer of videos from computers to tv sets at the consumer electronics show in las vegas time warner inc s aol today plans to announce a partnership with sony corp to allow people to watch aol video including a library of classic tv shows music videos and sporting events on a tv set proponents of internet delivered tv acknowledge that it still faces formidable technological and business challenges among them a thicket of rights issues in aols most recent partnership with sony for instance some of aols video library wont be available because of licensing constraints emily steel and adam thompson
