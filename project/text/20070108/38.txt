how nyse nasdaq listings confer value for many investors in escala group the only thing that stands between the collectibles company and its life as a forgotten penny stock its listing on the nasdaq stock market listings on the nasdaq and nyse groups new york stock exchange carry an imprimatur that some investors dont feel certain companies deserve the continued listings of firms that chronically miss securities filing deadlines and lose scores of executives amid fraud and accounting investigations confound some investors and analysts who say the exchanges go light on certain companies for businesss sake "the exchanges are definitely easy on companies and dont boot them off when they really should " says mark grothe an analyst at independent research firm glass lewis &amp co in boulder colo "the listings are a source of income for them and they dont want to miss out on those listing fees " as a result investors are left to trade on potentially specious financial information and analysts cant value the stocks because of the lack of reliable earnings data that leads to irregular trading volumes and erratic price swings that can whipsaw investors critics of the exchanges say both the nasdaq and the big board say that the people who decide whether to delist companies are independent from the business side and that they regularly screen companies for red flags such as restatements federal investigations and board changes "as long as theres good financial information out there about a company the stock ought to be allowed to trade " says james angel associate professor of finance at georgetown university "but in the case of some companies with lots of accounting issues you have to wonder how good are those financials " in recent weeks eyebrows have been
