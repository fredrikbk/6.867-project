the daily fix tales of two field goal attempts seattle escapes but giants do not the nfc playoff picture depended on a pair of late field goal attempts one successful one not the dallas cowboys just needed a yard field goal to take a lead over the seattle seahawks with a bit over a minute to play saturday night quarterback tony romo took the snap as kicker martin grammaticas holder but bobbled the ball and was forced to scoop it up and run with it he made it to the not enough for a first down let alone a touchdown and the cowboys season was over "the cowboys last playoff victory was a decade ago dec " intones randy galloway in the ft worth star telegram "the next one never apparently never this latest venture into the nfls postseason ended in more than just a loss this one also had all the dna of a curse a curse on the football house of jones " his colleague gil lebreton meanwhile is worried about young mr romo who was in tears after the game "romo screwed up " he writes "and that large thud you heard saturday night was the undertaker slamming the crypt door shut on the cowboys but for once in this franchises history lets keep things in perspective romos dropped placement didnt come in a super bowl or even in a game that would have sent the cowboys to a super bowl it came in an nfl wild card game after the cowboys and seahawks had just spent three hours more or less validating their supporters fears that both teams were destined to have a short postseason shelf life " as for seahawks headed for a rematch with the confounding chicago bears the seattle post intelligencers art thiel advises fans to take a zen attitude "for those who believe in the fated order of the universe we offer for your consideration seahawks cowboys " he writes "any observer of the nfl playoff game between the teams on saturday who still concludes that randomness is not the driving force in the cosmos isnt paying attention " the new york giants saw their showdown with the philadelphia eagles come down to with just seconds remaining and eagles kicker david akers trying to hit a yard field goal in the rain but the giants didnt get a miracle snapper jon dorenbos holder koy detmer and mr akers played their roles to perfection sending the giants home the giants already werent exactly the happiest football team in the land and now itll get really ugly starting with the coach "tom coughlin was going to make a sagging slumping team sit up straight " ian oconnor recalls in the bergen record "he was going to scare all the injured players right out of their hot tubs and he was going to hide behind potted plants in hotel lobbies to make sure his men were wearing appropriately colored socks in his first news conference as giants coach coughlin was going to do a lot of things " in the philadelphia inquirer bob ford praises mr akers for being cool under water and the eagles for surviving to write another chapter in an improbable season "discarded by most as possible contenders after a season ending injury to quarterback donovan mcnabb the eagles were before beginning their improbable comeback " he recalls "they have now won six straight games but need to win two more in order to get another shot at the super bowl " mr ford warns that the eagles didnt play particularly well and will need to improve to beat the saints but "those worries will be addressed during the eagles short week of preparation last night this was a win to savor particularly for a team that so recently seemed destined to see the playoffs through a television screen and not a face mask " the philadelphia daily news rich hofmann offers kudos to brian westbrook who endured illness and injury to put up yards running "this was such a watershed moment for westbrook and for coach andy reid and for an entire franchise " he writes "that really is not stating it too strongly for so many years this eagles team has had trouble in just this kind of a spot moving the ball eating the clock making like a machine when the game was on the line to be able to do it here against an ancient and persistent rival in a one and done situation can only portend good things for the future for a coach who can now trust in the blueprint and for a running back who has now demonstrated his worthiness in the moment " things werent as exciting in the afc but then how could they be on saturday the indianapolis colts didnt look particularly tested in steamrolling the kansas city chiefs as their oft maligned defense held pro bowl back larry johnson to just yards and covered for a mediocre performance by peyton manning for and yards but three interceptions listening to the colts defenders yapping in a victorious locker room the indianapolis stars bob kravitz was amused to a point "it hardly seemed polite to remind them that two weeks after they dominated the philadelphia eagles they got trashed by jacksonville " he writes "or the fact that after they lit up cincinnati on a monday night they went to houston and turned ron dayne into a first ballot hall of famer or the fact that theyre still two victories away from the super bowl ah but were not here to lend perspective or suggest that maybe just maybe a team that put up such comically bad numbers during the regular season shouldnt be quite so happy with itself after one playoff game " next up for the colts the baltimore ravens and in kansas city dont ask "well that was humiliating " sighs joe posnanski in the kansas city star "there is no good way to lose a playoff game of course but you have to believe there are better ways to lose than going the first minutes of the game without getting a first down " the new england patriots meanwhile pulled away from the new york jets late for a win and a showdown with the san diego chargers next week in the boston globe jackie macmullan writes that "it was like trying to play football in the middle of a freeway at rush hour the action simply whirled around both teams at warp speed this was a necessary game plan for the patriots who had been manhandled by the jets back on nov quarterback tom brady spent most of that dismal afternoon at gillette stadium under siege from new yorks relentless blitz packages he was sacked harassed flushed from the pocket and ultimately negated from operating with his most lethal weapon his poise new england identified the need to offset new yorks pressure defense by assaulting the visitors with hurry up counts a no huddle offense and quick strikes to a bevy of receivers in other words the patriots resorted to some frenetic football of their own " in the new york daily news lisa olson praises chad pennington for taking the jets further than most fans hoped in what was supposed to be a rebuilding year "penningtons eyes shone like ornaments afterward perhaps because his battered body could finally sense it could now take a deserved rest but more likely because he is as genuine a teammate as you will ever find " she writes "even in the numb haze of this wild card loss it was easy to understand how the jets hadnt an ounce of quit in them pennington might not be blessed with tom bradys talent but there is no question he radiates leadership which happens to be the largest clue in how the jets ever came this far " found a good column from the world of sports dont keep it to yourself write to
