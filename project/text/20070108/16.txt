and the citys tax take most other german states are following berlins lead and have either scrapped their store hour rules or plan to do so at the popular dussmann bookstore on friedrichstrasse

peter dussmann who owns the modern multistory store and hired new workers to cover the extra hours while its too soon to tell if retail sales across germany will get a similar lift from expanded store

in las vegas sunday lg took the wraps off the first machine to play discs in both blu ray and hd dvd formats the player is priced at &# about twice the price of an hd dvd player and slightly more than the average price of a blu ray player warner brothers meanwhile later this week is expected to announce a design for a disc that can store a movie or other content in the hd dvd format on one side and the blu ray format on the other but while such attempts to skirt the format battle will likely encourage a slew of rivals to also start making such dual format equipment freeing consumers from worrying about which format will eventually win out and thus boosting sales of next generation dvds which are designed to take advantage of the better picture quality offered by high definition tv sets these compromises will likely cause the format war to drag on as the dual format solutions will allow the weaker side to cling on for months or years longer than it otherwise could that could continue to discourage many consumers from embracing next generation equipment especially as dual format discs and players will likely cost more it also means studios must decide whether to release titles on dual format discs instead of or in addition to the two existing formats read the report from evan ramstad in seoul and sarah mcbride in las vegas http online wsj com article sb html read

government bonds are higher than those on short term ones because investors demand a bigger return for the risk that comes with holding an investment that takes longer to repay but the relationship has been upside down in the u s since july with yields on short term treasury bills exceeding those on long term treasury notes easily dismissed a year ago the so called inverted yield curve which has persisted longer than many economists expected has some who see yield inversions as harbingers of hard times wondering whether the bond market is signaling that the economy itself could turn upside down when bond investors see a recession coming they tend to buy long term treasury securities betting that the federal reserve which dictates short term rates will have to cut them to boost the economy and they push down long term rates in anticipation inverted curves often come toward the end of fed rate increase cycles others economists doubt the yield curves effectiveness as a recession forecasting tool and think long term rates are exceptionally low right now for other reasons including lower long term expectations about inflation and growing demand for u s government bonds from foreign investors needing somewhere to park their money however those who think highly of the yield curves predictive power have history on their side seven times between and yields on the year note

managing carbon credits critics worry that some projects beijing is encouraging are siphoning western carbon market investment away from the kind of emission reduction projects the burgeoning global "carbon market" was designed to encourage those that generate energy more cleanly such as natural gas fired power plants and wind turbines china the worlds no emitter of greenhouse gases behind the u s has also become the biggest source of developing world carbon credits bought by western investors benefiting both chinese corporations and chinese government tax receipts especially since china has mandated that only companies with a majority chinese ownership can own projects generating carbon credits and beijing is effectively imposing minimum prices for its carbon credits the world bank a major player in the global carbon credits market estimates the market was worth &# billion in the first three quarters of about double its value in all of but investors are showing a preference for deals to destroy a greenhouse gas called hfc that scientists say is thousands of times more potent than co and that is a byproduct of the manufacture of a common refrigerant hcfc investors prefer them because the gass potency compared with co and the relatively low cost of installing the machinery that destroys it mean the projects spin off massive numbers of carbon credits at rock bottom prices in fact selling the credits from hfc destruction projects typically generates more profit than selling the actual refrigerant as a result regulators worry that the carbon market is encouraging companies in the developing world to make more of the underlying refrigerant than they otherwise would so they can produce more of the global warming gas destroy it and sell the credits read the report by

to treat it as such so argue bing west a former u s assistant secretary of defense and eliot cohen professor of strategic studies at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies in a commentary on our opinion pages as former u s secretary of state colin powell a few weeks ago said "we should not use our troops as policemen " but thats exactly how they are being used today in baghdad and are in fact used in most counterinsurgencies the writers argue americas weakest links are leaving the mahdi army off limits not selecting iraqi security leaders and refusing to arrest and incarcerate the insurgents death squads and thugs if mr bushs new strategy doesnt aggressively rectify these three defects then surging more american troops will buy time but not alter a war the u s is losing because it is not winning to change the dynamic in iraq they write mr bush has to insist on arrests and incarceration rates equivalent or greater than those for violent crime in new york city this would set benchmarks and shift u s forces from defense to offense new york city averages over arrests a year for violent crimes if a similar number of arrests were made in baghdad which is
