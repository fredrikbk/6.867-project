at gm curbing inventories calls for juggling act car makers dilemma is how to sustain output without discounting detroit after a tumultuous year general motors corp heads into the industrys big auto show here this week determined to prove it can regain its long lost status as a technology and design leader making vehicles consumers will be eager to buy without waiting for gm to cough up huge discounts even as chief executive rick wagoner talks up future gm models including an electric prototype called the chevrolet volt some of the vehicles gm touted as hot prospects at last years north american international auto show are piling up unsold on dealer lots the loss plagued auto maker also has had limited success with the new pricing strategy it announced at the show at the end of december gm had more than one million vehicles in stock in the u s thats equivalent to about vehicles for every point of its u s market share by contrast toyota motor corp of japan one of the worlds most profitable auto makers carried about vehicles of inventory per point of its market share gm says it is comfortable with its inventories but their size illustrates a dilemma mr wagoner faces as he struggles to turn the company around to return to profit in the u s gm after years of selling cars mainly with the help of heavy discounts needs to build more appealing vehicles and persuade consumers to pay full price for them to do that it has to stop making more vehicles than the market demands or risk triggering a new cycle of discounting getting consumers excited about its new vehicles may be one of gms thorniest tests as it seeks to rebound from two years of huge losses already mr wagoner has proved he can cut costs last year he presided over an unprecedented deal to buy out more than u s factory workers about a third of gms american work force and a separate agreement under which the united auto workers for the first time accepted cuts to retiree health care benefits gm whose stock is up nearly since the end of has also moved faster than rival ford motor co to streamline its global vehicle engineering operations and could reap potentially big cost savings over the next several years along the way mr wagoner defeated an effort by las vegas investor kirk kerkorian to use a stake in gm to push the company into a partial merger with rivals nissan motor corp and renault sa mr kerkorian sold his gm holdings late last year gm has also won high marks from analysts for some of the snazzy vehicle designs it has started to produce and it has several more in the pipeline in detroit gm is showing a convertible version of a new camaro that has won raves and is due in even so gm still needs to generate huge sums each year to cover the more than a million people mostly retirees and their dependents who depend on the company for health benefits that means that gm cant simply shrink its u s operations to meet reduced demand without risking making gm north america too small to finance its debts and obligations to workers "its a very delicate balance " says frederick "fritz" henderson gms chief financial officer slowing production would stop the inventory buildup and prop up prices but it would sacrifice revenue at a time when gm needs every dollar in sales it can bring in if gm continues to run north american plants at the current pace it may have to resort to rebates and discounts to spur sales which would hurt profit margins and undermine prices the models stacking up unsold include the chevrolet tahoe a big suv launched in early in the fall gm dealers had days worth of tahoes on hand about twice what is considered optimal thats now down to days but gm is nevertheless curbing production talking to reporters at the detroit auto show mr wagoner shrugged off the tahoe production cut noting that the models average sales price &# according to market researcher power information network is "way higher" than that of competing vehicles and tahoe has about market share in its segment the buick lucerne touted last year as a harbinger of classier designs for that brand has cooled off and dealers have days supply on hand the saturn aura a sporty midsize sedan named "car of the year" at this years detroit show is selling slowly and backing up on dealer lots gm had a day supply of auras at the end of november though that had shrunk to days by the end of last month a gm spokesman said it is natural for auto makers to build inventories of new models particularly surprising is the sudden sales slowdown for the chevrolet hhr a retro styled miniwagon that gms executives lauded as proof that eye catching styling could reinvigorate sales but after gm tried to raise prices on the hhr last year in response to what appeared to be strong demand sales slumped now gm has a day supply of the hhr on hand even as toyota honda motor co and nissan have little trouble selling their miniwagons cost cutting alone isnt enough to put gm back on solid footing says mr henderson the cfo the company also has to improve what he and other gm insiders call "contribution margin " basically the profits left over after the costs of building the car are deducted from the revenue realized after discounts the main way for gm to do that he says is to keep prices firm and avoid incentives and low margin sales to rental fleets that artificially boost sales damage the image of gms brands and undermine resale values "this is the area where we have a lot of work to do in the future " he says at the auto show mr henderson said gm as has been the case since mid doesnt plan to issue any formal earnings guidance for this year this year gm will be under heavy pressure to show it can do a better job of managing the pricing and production balance as it moves into the peak of its cycle of renewing major vehicle lines and launching new models mr wagoner the ceo says of gms north american sales volume in will come from new or redesigned vehicles compared with in at the show mr wagoner said gm did "pretty good" in pushing prices higher last year in december gms average price was &# above the industry average but he conceded the companys continuing losses mean it still needs to do better among the critical new designs the just launched chevy silverado pickup truck gms largest selling single model and traditionally a big money maker gm executives also have high hopes for three new "crossovers " vehicles that look like suvs but are built from car components and get better gasoline mileage others will be unveiled at the detroit auto show including a redesigned chevy malibu and cadillac cts sedans until recently the chevy hhr was the car that gm executives pointed to when they argued that fresh designs and smarter marketing could lead gm back to profitability in north america gm also used the hhr to road test its new approach to pricing designed in part to rectify a problem exacerbated by the rise of online car shopping gm typically set sticker prices high and then marked them down using rebates but at online shopping sites like edmunds com consumers comparing prices often saw only gms sticker prices and concluded that gm cars were more expensive than competing models from toyota and honda so gm set the hhrs price much closer to what it thought customers would actually pay about &# for a well equipped model at first the hhr looked like a hit a bright spot in a year at a time when gms overall sales were slumping in july as part of gms summer clearance sale the hhr was available in some regions with loans and sales spiked to but in october gm cut off low interest rate loan deals for the vehicle sales plunged a gm spokesman said the company plans to increase incentives on the hhr this year but declined to elaborate
