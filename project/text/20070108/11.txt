yesterday at the north american international auto show in detroit a redesign of the no selling dodge caravan and a new chrysler town &amp country available this fall among the features chrysler highlighted second row seats that swivel to face the third row a table that can be placed between the two back rows of seat and cup or bottle holders but chrysler which is looking for answers after posting a billion euro &# billion third quarter operating loss wont have as easy a time wowing the market with its minivans as it did in the early s chryslers main competition today comes not from general motors corp or ford motor co but from asian models including toyota motor corp s sienna honda motor co s odyssey and new entrants like kia motors corp s sedona and hyundai motor co s entourage and the competition is stiff the dodge caravan was the no minivan seller last year with in u s sales according to autodata corp reflecting a decline from but more than of caravans were sold to fleet operators like rental car companies sales that are less profitable than sales to individual consumers the honda odyssey came in second with in sales followed by the toyota sienna and the chrysler town &amp country which are mainly sold to retail customers competition from the honda and toyota vans is strong enough that gm and ford last year decided to abandon the segment declaring that demand for minivans was waning in favor of sport utility vehicles and crossover wagons which are smaller suvs built on car platforms to give them better agility and fuel economy the minivan segment which carries fatter profit margins than cars though not as great as with trucks or suvs now looks like it could be the latest auto category in which asian manufacturers take over from traditional detroit brands as they did with midsize cars "some of our competitors are withdrawing because they say its dead " says daimlerchrysler chairman and chief executive officer dieter zetsche "this is surrender " minivan sales reached about million vehicles in according to autodata but sales fell last year to about chryslers move with minivans is part of an overall effort to boost its appeal with u s auto buyers and get its high inventories under control chrysler was stuck with bloated inventories last year after building cars and trucks that hadnt been ordered by dealers chrysler trimmed its stock of such unassigned vehicles to fewer than chryslers mr lasorda said in an interview yesterday in september it has about such unassigned vehicles at the detroit auto show chrysler executives said the company has its inventory situation under control mr lasorda said chryslers main inventory which doesnt include unassigned vehicles is now cars and trucks down from at the end of mr lasorda is supposed to unveil a restructuring plan by the end of february to cut costs and put the division back into the black mr lasorda said he has the "full support" of mr zetsche to give the restructuring plan a chance to work chrysler executives said they will fight hard to sustain the two factories the company has dedicated to minivan production chryslers ann fandozzi director of global product marketing acknowledged that toyota and honda are tough competitors but she said chrysler has been the leader in the segment since it created the vehicle category and its not going to give up its position "these minivans are critically important to our business " ms fandozzi said "we invented this segment and were committed to being the minivan leader " although chrysler has been known for its innovation in the minivan segment the asian auto makers have intensified the competition for making roomier more powerful vehicles executives at south koreas hyundai boast that its entourage minivan has more power and interior room than toyotas sienna or hondas odyssey when nissan motor co launched a redesigned quest executives said that it considers toyota and honda to be its main competitors "there was a time when the japanese were just good enough compared to the domestics " said james bell publisher of intellichoice com an automotive web site that studies consumer preferences "now they are moving the needle even further and you have the koreans coming on strong too " the chrysler group also needs to overcome the antipathy many of the minivans target customers young mothers feel for the vehicles given the appeal of sportier looking suvs and crossovers nissan tried to counter that opinion by introducing a quest in that featured an unusual design but that turned off buyers for the quest nissan returned to a more traditional looking minivan gm vice chairman bob lutz said gm pulled a minivan option as one of its global platforms because the market was trending away from them "a stigma has attached itself to the minivan and wont let go " mr lutz wrote on gms fastlane web log "and beyond that stigma the minivan is hurt by the many other choices available to customers " chryslers ms fandozzi acknowledged that suvs and more recently crossovers have become increasingly popular but she said current car buyers who are out to look at minivans arent likely to have their heads turned by other vehicles and noted that minivan buyers are very loyal to the segment she said the company expects the minivan segment to remain stable at million in sales with a possibility for slight growth the target customer will be families and empty nesters meaning baby boomers whose children have left the home in the future she says gen y presents further opportunity for growth because that generation is more traditional and will likely have children at a younger age than gen xers chrysler whose popular stow n go seats can be folded to increase storage space said it has come up with new treats in its redesigned minivans the spinning second row seats will be called swivel n go the new vans also offer an integrated child booster seat and power folding seats in the third row entertainment will also be key with a new dual dvd entertainment system that allows different media to be played at the same time for example one child could watch a movie while the other plays a videogame chrysler is aiming the town &amp country for older families in which kids have grown out of car seats the vehicle also will have more luxury amenities the dodge caravan will be a sportier minivan aimed at younger families neal e boudette contributed to this article
