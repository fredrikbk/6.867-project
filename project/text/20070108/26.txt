happily ever aafta this year president bush and the democratic led congress should launch a new association of american free trade agreements aafta the aafta could shape the future of the western hemisphere while offering a new foreign and economic policy design that combines trade open societies development and democracy in concert with successful immigration reform the aafta would signal to the americas that despite the trials of war and asias rising economic influence u s global strategy must have a hemispheric foundation successful and sustainable international strategies must be constructed across administrations ronald reagan called for free trade throughout the americas opened u s markets to our caribbean neighbors and completed an fta with canada george h w bush completed negotiations for a north american fta offered trade preferences to the andean countries negotiated peace in central america and freed panama bill clinton secured the passage of nafta launched work on a free trade area of the americas and backed plan colombia george w bush enacted ftas with chile the five states of central america and the dominican republic he also completed ftas with colombia peru and panama if congress passes these agreements the u s will finally have an unbroken line of free trade partners stretching from alaska to the tip of south america not counting the u s this free trade assembly would comprise two thirds of both the population and gdp of the americas the aafta would draw together these partners to build on the gains of free trade it could also include the island states of the caribbean basin trade partnership act starting with a small secretariat perhaps in miami the aafta should advance hemispheric economic integration link development and democracy with trade and aid improve working and environmental conditions and continue to pursue the goal of free trade throughout the hemisphere it might even foster cooperation in the wtos global trade negotiations the aafta might be connected to an academic center which could combine research and practice through an association among universities in the americas the aafta could promote the business of trade by helping the private sector learn how to use ftas while encouraging business feedback that identifies impediments such as customs complications regulatory red tape the lack of financial energy or other services and infrastructure problems it might use technology to create a virtual network of business opportunities especially for small business moreover the aafta should concretely demonstrate how aid and trade can be mutually supportive u s millennium challenge corporation grants are already enabling central american countries to invest in physical and legal infrastructure matched to trade expansion the u s overseas private investment corporation ex im bank and trade and development agency programs could be integrated too aid projects for labor and the environment could promote core standards best practices benchmarking and corporate social responsibility projects the inter american development bank a leader in connecting aid and trade might help with grants and loans to strengthen small business the economic empowerment of indigenous communities and education all connected to open societies in a global economy finally over time the aafta partners might examine how the various ftas could be knitted together although these steps would likely require new congressional action the u s cannot afford to lose interest in its own neighborhood the pied pipers of populism in latin america are taking advantage of the genuine frustrations especially in indigenous communities of people who have not been able to climb the ladder of opportunity we should not let these populists dictate the debate we already have seen that electorates in mexico colombia peru central america and the dominican republic have recognized that trade with the u s offers jobs and hope we need to build on that foundation with results that link trade aid good governance property rights and better working and environmental conditions even where populists prevailed substantial constituencies who view the u s as an economic partner have constrained backward policies to launch the aafta the president and the congressional leadership must stand up to americas populist protectionists too the new chairmen of the house ways and means and senate finance committees charles rangel and max baucus have signaled that trade may offer the best economic policy opportunity to work with the president as finance committee chair in sen baucus worked closely with sen grassley to authorize the negotiations for these ftas rangel helped push preferential trade for africa and the caribbean in response to urgings from new democrats and blue dogs the u s is the only country that includes mutual labor and environmental commitments in its ftas backed by enforcement the administration worked with the international labor organization ilo and its developing country partners to check their laws with core ilo standards in cooperation with sen baucus the administration developed special environmental review and comment procedures for cafta strengthening the role of local ngos the aafta offers more an opportunity to design labor and environmental partnerships that would complement the rules in the ftas the alternative ignoring latin america or defeating ftas to court economic isolationists would leave the causes of workers and the environment to unlikely friends poverty and populism the president and congress are understandably absorbed by the dangers of war but the united states cannot afford to ignore the rest of the world the u s trade agenda has turned out to be our strongest lifeline to developing democracies in the americas it is not enough with the passage of the ftas with colombia peru and panama the president and the congress could use the free trade framework to spur an ongoing dynamic for development and democracy just as alexander hamilton created a self reinforcing financial system that vitalized america to deal with future challenges the aafta would create a working adaptable mechanism that would strengthen the americas in the st century mr zoellick was u s trade representative and deputy secretary of state he is now vice chairman international at goldman sachs
