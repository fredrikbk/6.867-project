ugly in the air boeings new plane gets gawks stares a bulbous converted is a warehouse with wings solving a logistics problem seattle boeing co engineers love to marvel over the elegant lines of their flying machines but everybody agrees the companys newest creation is one ugly duckling the plane is officially called the large cargo freighter the craft is a standard that received an extreme makeover in taipei taiwan last summer a process that involved removing the jets passenger cabin and signature hump then replacing them with a cavernous cargo hold the tail section now swings open on giant hinges that protrude from one side of the fuselage like elbows even the people who might defend it are quick to point out its lack of curb appeal "it has to be one of the ugliest planes ive ever seen " says boeing vice president mike bair who sometimes refers to the plane as a "beast " boeing has no plans to market the plane commercially and yet this machine may be one of the most significant jets the company has built in recent years the cargo plane plays a vital role in boeings manufacturing plans for its new "dreamliner " which is scheduled to enter service in mid to help cut costs boeing farmed out a majority of dreamliners production to far flung partners in japan italy south carolina and kansas the sprawling nature of the s supply chain makes it a challenge to move parts around in a timely fashion the large cargo freighter was built to solve this problem the dreamliners foot long nose section for example to be built in wichita kan is too tall to travel by rail to boeings final assembly plant in everett wash boeing could truck it miles to tulsa okla for a barge ride down the arkansas river but locks lie between there and new orleans and the open sea after that the trip through the panama canal and up the entire west coast would require up to days of transit time aboard the flying cargo freighter however the same nose section could make it from wichita to everett in just under four hours the unusual craft measures feet long and stands almost feet tall at the tail its vaulted cargo hold has a capacity of cubic feet or about three times that of a typical freighter used by big shippers such as united parcel service inc "some people may say this plane is ugly but i call it an elegant logistics solution " says mike bunney the boeing executive in charge of managing the dreamliners transportation system boeing has contracted with evergreen international airlines of mcminnville ore to operate three of these flying hippos crisscrossing the world between boeing and its major suppliers the company plans to make the first of these milk runs this month as it begins assembling the first of dreamliners on order production plans for the dreamliner call for major fuselage sections to be shipped from nagoya japan to charleston s c where they will be mated with sections airlifted from grottaglie italy by the time the ballet is completed boeing hopes to snap the sections together like a giant model airplane in everett in just three days compared with up to a month that it now takes to complete similar size jetliners boeing got its first retrofitted this summer and was in such a hurry to begin flight safety tests that it opted not to paint the numerous aluminum patches and panels until later only adding to its monster in the making appearance reviews began pouring in just hours after the freighter made its debut in seattle a photograph depicting it with an oscar mayer wienermobile paint scheme started landing in boeing emails the jab offended some engineers but mostly entertained others in september boeing commercial airplanes chief executive scott carson was speaking to a group of airline and aerospace executives at a luncheon at seattles museum of flight when the plane lumbered past mr carson was quick to note that joe sutter who designed the original in the s was in the room "joe " he said "im sorry for what we did to your plane " over the years engineers have hatched dozens of gawky birds so many that some aviation web sites have chat rooms dedicated to arguments over which was most hideous for the most part the ugly title has been associated with flying warehouses such as the giant russian antonov cargo planes and the lockheed c galaxy the most famous of these billionaire howard hughess hk wooden "spruce goose " flew only once in today that airplane is on display at evergreen aviation museum in mcminnville in seattle cars pull over on interstate to watch when the large cargo freighter takes off or lands jim goodall a seattle aviation author and shutterbug described the plane as "so alarmingly ugly that you immediately want to grab your camera and take a picture of it to show to all of your friends " the plane has generated some notoriety in recent weeks as it has racked up more than hours of aerial testing in november a student pilot and an instructor in a single engine cessna inadvertently flew through the freighters wake turbulence while preparing to land the cessna flipped upside down and dived almost feet before the quick thinking instructor was able to regain control according to a national transportation safety board report the cessna came within feet of hitting the water in a ship loading canal at the port of seattle at a december celebration for the dreamliner program mr bair announced that boeing had finally decided to put a little lipstick on its new pig once the large cargo freighter has completed flight testing it will be painted white with a dark blue tail on its side in large letters will be its new name dreamlifter
