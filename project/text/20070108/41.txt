my history with the rope i have now watched both the official and the infamous unofficial cell phone video of saddams husseins execution both were on the web soon after the event i had the choice of watching them or not i watched with the same horrid fascination that i felt seeing ultimate fighting on television disbelieving that gladiators are legal when cockfighting is outlawed in just about every state save for new mexico where i saw my first and last cockfight when pollsters knock on my door they will find that as a physician i am against capital punishment ultimate fighting and cockfighting because they run counter to our sense of being a civilized society but the disconnect between what i will watch and what i claim i am for is more common than most of us care to admit i blame the camera the lens now peers into every nook and cranny of human existence and it is now in the hands of every man a digital image of interest spreads on the internet like a drop of india ink in water police brutality a bully on a school bus an abusive nanny we see them all it isnt surprising that there is a cell phone video of saddams hanging it is surprising there is only one while on rounds in my hospital where i work as an infectious disease specialist i caught sequential bits of the television show "dr " in the course of going from one patient to the next i had no idea we my patients their visitors and i saw an actual breast augmentation even more edifying was the opportunity to peek into the personal lives and the marital struggles of the brave practitioners of this craft who eke out an existence in that zip code my vicarious presence in beverly hills and baghdad in the same week was not because of prurient tastes it was because these ubiquitous images are all but unavoidable if you have eyes and any curiosity about your fellow human beings the uproar over the saddam video both its existence and its content is particularly hypocritical given all the ways and all the weaponry that could be used to execute someone hanging is a most inhumane choice the condemned person will be terrified and anxious not about death as much as the manner of death hanging of the short drop version practiced in iran is really a slow choking to death in the standard or long drop method that was used in iraq unconsciousness is supposedly instant when the spinal cord is severed but a misplaced knot could rip skin and muscle and cause an agonizing death instant or not lets not kid ourselves hanging is a vengeful brutalizing psychologically terrifying act with which we humans have a long history in the past it was carried out publicly and still is in countries like iran with the aim of serving as a deterrent if we condone hanging a mass murderer is it not hypocritical to want it to be conducted with "decency" when hanging is by its very nature indecent saddams hanging disturbs us because it was perverse vengeful furtive hasty carried out under cover of darkness and in front of a hoarse excitable male audience who acted as if they were at a carnival or to be more precise as if they were at a lynching part of the discomfort the video generates here may lie in these echoes of our own short history with the rope as an expatriate child growing up in ethiopia i saw my first hanging when the military leaders of an abortive coup were put to death in a public square we happened to be driving by or perhaps in those pre internet days my parents wanted to witness the spectacle i dont remember i do remember the chanting ululating crowd dancing under the swaying corpse the choked congested faces and the oddly angulated heads but most of all i remember how the dead mens shoes were filched the bare feet seemed inconsistent with the rest of the image that element of violation of savagery stayed with me i saw a few more hangings in that country as i grew up and the fresh bodies of people who met violent deaths in the aftermath of emperor haile selassies fall and the advent of mengistu the stalin of africa the saddam video recalled these memories of witnessing violence and savagery with the video i felt just as i did as a child witnessing an actual hanging that the condemned man gets perverse revenge because there is a shame that accompanies such a spectacle it spreads and stains all who are there all who drive by all who watch it on television or who like me download it with a click of the mouse the killer being executed has suddenly become noble and turned us into killers this cell phone video will be the most viewed hanging video in history we as a nation should watch it before washing our hands of it and certainly before pontificating about our brand of justice versus other brands only by watching can the debate about capital punishment move from an abstract discussion to what is real to what is palpable to what is shameful to what is actually happening whether you watch it or not dr verghese is the joaquin
