how a bull can turn into a bear this year many investment pros are starting the year with high hopes looking for a repeat of last years double digit stock gains these same optimists also cite a litany of potential problems that could stand in the markets way u s stock gains surpassed almost everyones expectations in the past six months because the economic backdrop has been almost perfect with cooling inflation falling gasoline prices a benign federal reserve and surprisingly strong corporate profits "i am optimistic for the overall market quite optimistic " says susan malley president of malley associates capital management in new york "what could go wrong if we had rising interest rates if we had oil prices back to the kinds of levels we saw over the summer when they were above &# a barrel and of course if we had an international political disturbance " here is a look at the drivers the stock market depends on and the stumbling blocks it must avoid this year inflation one of the main reasons for investor optimism is that inflation has appeared to be slowly coming under control last years stock market surge coincided with a plunge in oil futures which fell to &# a barrel last week from &# in july gasoline futures have dropped since may to &# from &# inflation in the rest of the economy excluding volatile energy and food costs has edged down more slowly toward the rate fed officials have said they consider the upper limit of what is tolerable low inflation is good for stocks because it encourages consumers to spend and helps the fed keep interest rates down low interest rates are another of the markets main underpinnings the worry among economists and money managers is that any sudden uptick in oil prices or other inflation measures would upset this balance "my no concern is that we get complacent now with energy prices down because of the mild winter " says robert morris chief investment officer at jersey city n j fund management group lord abbett although he too counts himself among the optimists for stocks interest rates the fed stopped raising its target short term interest rate this summer and hopes are widespread it will begin cutting rates this year the feds campaign of rate increases aimed at forestalling inflation ran for two years starting at the end of june often when the fed raised rates in the past it left the economy in recession this time many money managers think it can prevent inflation without causing recession and that was among the main reasons for wall street optimism in autumn the expectation of fed rate cuts this year amid continuing economic growth has helped push bond yields mortgage rates and other market interest rates lower that helped send stocks on their prolonged rally because lower rates support most consumers and businesses and make bonds and money market funds less attractive than stocks the fragility of the rate hopes was evident friday when stocks slumped following a labor department report that showed december hiring and wage increases were stronger than many expected economists think the fed will hesitate to cut rates until it sees signs of a cooler labor market fed chairman ben bernanke has warned he is more likely to raise rates than to lower them at this point and any serious risk the fed might not cut rates at all this year or that it might actually raise them again would be an unpleasant pill for the stock market profits a third big driver for stocks last year was corporate profits which again left expectations in the dust profits for companies in the standard &amp poors stock index rose almost in the third quarter when last year began many money managers expected profit growth to be sagging toward the single digits by now many expect to see a pullback to single digit profit gains this year as economic growth slows and the question is how stocks will react stocks often do well when profits are rising at a cooler more sustainable pace because that often is a time when the fed is lowering interest rates or holding them steady problems crop up when profit increases turn more anemic than investors expect in part because they were chastised for their excess optimism at the end of the last bull market stock analysts have become more conservative that has made it easier for companies to surpass analysts forecasts if companies continue to surpass forecasts even if their profit growth slows stocks could extend gains but at some point in any business cycle expectations among investors and analysts tend to get overly bullish and companies begin to miss profit forecasts "if you had a couple big companies come in with results that are below the forecast that could be a shock " says ms malley of malley associates economic political stability threats to world stability remain in the backs of many investors minds so does the risk of a housing crisis investors seem to have adjusted to the violence and bombast they know terrorist threats saber rattling in iran and north korea fighting in the middle east what they fear privately is something more severe actual use of a nuclear weapon for example or another terrorist attack in the u s the ability of countries in developing asia eastern europe and latin america to record strong economic growth despite the uncertain world has helped allay some fears so have falling mortgage rates which have spurred hopes the worst of the housing slump could be over "where could things go wrong if there was some kind of major event whether it be in the middle east or some other area of international politics or a blowup in one of the high octane market areas such as housing or hedge funds " says jeff schappe chief investment officer at bb&amp t asset management in raleigh n c mr schappe like mr morris and ms malley counts himself a market optimist and he isnt predicting a problem but many investment pros recognize that the markets strength has been built on a series of very positive developments the stock market today is a bit like a juggler whose success depends on keeping all those shiny balls successfully in the air
