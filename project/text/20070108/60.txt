politics &amp economics unions policy test justices will hear case challenging spending of dues organized labor won big last year when washington states highest court struck down a law making it harder for unions to spend mandatory fees collected from nonmembers on political campaigns the ruling seemed likely to end a long running dispute between the state teachers union and the evergreen freedom foundation an advocacy group in olympia wash that is critical of unions and is determined to reduce their role in politics and education more broadly the decision stood to influence courts in other states confronted with similar battles over labors use of dues and fees in the political arena the union victory could be short lived wednesday the u s supreme court will hear evergreen freedoms challenge to the washington state decision the foundation hopes the court its conservative wing bolstered by the bush appointments of chief justice john roberts and justice samuel alito will bar unions from spending any fees from nonmembers on political campaigns an array of antiunion groups the institute for justice the national right to work legal defense foundation and the pacific legal foundation among them have filed briefs at the high court hoping to strike a blow against labors power the bush administration and six states with laws unfriendly to unions likewise are urging the justices to reverse the washington state decision even some scholars sympathetic to labor have criticized the reasoning behind the washington state decision and doubt it will stand the justices likely took the case "for error correction reasons rather than to make a major statement " says prof richard hasen a specialist in election law at loyola law school in los angeles he adds however that "any time a campaign finance issue gets before this new roberts court theres a potential for big change " washington state isnt known as hostile to organized labor it isnt among the so called right to work states which prohibit contract provisions that require union members to pay dues and nonunion workers to pay fees as a condition of employment the state teachers union the washington education association obtained just such a provision as a result teachers unwilling to join the union must pay an "agency fee" equal to dues the aim the union says is to ensure that all teachers share the cost of collective bargaining since all benefit from the union negotiated contract about of the states teachers declined membership the union says prior court rulings have held that people required to pay fees to certain organizations for professional or other reasons such as attorneys who must join a state bar in order to practice law or undergraduates who are assessed student government fees cant be compelled to contribute to political causes they oppose those rulings often have led to "opt out" policies in which individuals can request a refund of the portion of their fees that would be used for political speech since most people tend to do nothing when confronted with such choices the full fee often remains available to the organization for political or other purposes in washington state voters switched the balance they approved a campaign finance measure that among other provisions barred unions from spending nonmembers fees "to influence an election or to operate a political committee unless affirmatively authorized by the individual " the union in the wake of a u s supreme court decision already was notifying nonmembers each year that they could obtain a refund for the or so of the fee that wasnt used for collective bargaining to comply with the provision the union concluded it could use the "opt out" method its system involves more than checking a box on a simple return card in a six page letter of dense text the union urges nonmembers to join the union then details a variety of union programs and fees before on page four giving directions for a refund the letter gives objectors days to write to the associations legal department stating their challenge in court papers the union said about to of its general fund into which nonmembers paid their fees was spent annually for political purposes and only on ballot measures involving issues such as taxes or teachers pay the union operates a separate political action committee funded by voluntary donations by members to support candidates for office for evergreen freedom that wasnt good enough the group argued that the union had done the opposite of what the law required by compelling nonmembers to "affirmatively" seek a refund rather than automatically getting one unless they took steps to give the money to the union it sought disgruntled teachers for a test case and found one in gary davenport who says he worked for two years as a history teacher and football coach at his alma mater kentwood high school in kent wash a trial judge largely agreed with evergreen freedom but the state supreme court didnt in a decision it found that the unions opt out procedure didnt amount to affirmative authorization but ruled that the requirement itself violated the first amendment in her majority opinion justice faith ireland wrote that both parties had free speech rights at stake the union to take part in politics the objectors to avoid compulsory participation and then weighed their relative burdens she found that while it was easy for objectors to get their refunds which ranged from &# to &# the costs of the opt in system unfairly burdened union members and nonmembers who dont object to their fees put to political use no state has a law precisely like washingtons colorado and five other states alabama idaho ohio utah and virginia told the u s supreme court that their own approaches to regulation of labor unions could be imperiled if the washington decision stands the labor movement contends the law is unconstitutional for other reasons in a friend of the court brief the afl cio and change to win a coalition of major unions say the law singles out unions political speech since the opt in procedure isnt required for other expenditures that are refundable they also complain that it doesnt target other organizations such as corporations and trade associations that are funded by people who dont "necessarily support their recipients political expenditures " had the teachers union won better tenure protections it might have managed to keep mr davenport in the classroom he says he left kentwood high because he had only a year to year contract and needed a job with more security mr davenport says he now works for a local law enforcement agency and belongs to its police union "i dont have a problem being represented for contract disputes or individual job protection " he says "what i disagree with is when they become so political " see related letter "letters to the editor the right to dissent from union policies" wje jan
