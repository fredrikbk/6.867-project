the afternoon report stem winding study science and politics never make for comfortable bedfellows and while a new breakthrough in stem cell research could help lessen the political drama surrounding the issue it appears to be far from a cure all over the weekend researchers from harvard university and wake forest said that they had found stem cells in amniotic fluid in a development that may let scientists duck the controversial use of embryonic stem cells the stem cell issue with its resonances in the abortion debate has proven highly divisive in washington and around the country many voters support the use of stem cell research to find new therapies for ailments ranging from parkinsons disease to lymphoma to spinal cord injuries but opponents say the use of embryonic stem cells for such research should be forbidden arguing that the use of the cells is tantamount to the destruction of a potential human life the scientists said they were able to extract stem cells from amniotic fluid which provides a cradle for babies in the womb without doing harm to either the mother or the fetus the extracted tissue was then grown into several different kinds of cells including brain liver and bone tissue scientists cautioned that the research was still in very early stages dr anthony atala the senior researcher on the project said his team doesnt know exactly how many different cell types can be fashioned from the stem cells discovered in amniotic fluid and even preliminary tests in human subjects are years away and other scientists said that embryonic cells are still the most promising venue for research dr george daley of harvard said the discovery shouldnt forestall embryonic studies he said the amniotic cells "are not a substitute for human embryonic stem cells which allow scientists to address a host of other interesting questions in early human development " dr robert lanza chief scientist at advanced cell technology said the amniotic cells may not be able to perform as many "tricks" as embryonic cells but added that he thinks "this work represents a giant step forward for stem cell research " researchers and patients would like to surmount the political obstacles standing in the way of stem cell research but even with democrats now in control of the congress stem cell advocates may face a tough ride last year president bush took up the veto pen for the first time in his presidency to quash a bill that would have expanded federal spending on research derived from embryos that were slated for destruction after being created for fertility treatments current federal rules prohibit funding for research from all but a small number of stem cell lines that existed in that bill enjoyed broad bipartisan backing with democrats commanding only a slim majority in the senate and the house its uncertain whether they would have the muscle to overturn a veto even with the help of moderate republicans and with a fierce battle over troop levels in iraq looming democrats may be looking to keep their powder dry for other fights blue chips float lower amid declining crude oil futures and a fresh bundle of merger news the dow jones industrial

separation is expected to be complete in six to nine months caremark rebuffs express scripts caremarks board rejected the unsolicited merger bid made by rival express scripts last month and affirmed its support for a stock swap that would join the pharmacy benefits manager with drug retailer cvs express scripts which said it is committed to reaching a deal said its cash and stock offer for caremark is valued at roughly &# billion based on fridays stock prices a premium to the cvs deal caremark shareholders have expressed their preference for an express scripts deal citing the sweeter premium and the comparative ease of combining with a similar business but such deal would also face steep antitrust challenges justices reject echostar appeal the supreme court rejected an appeal from
