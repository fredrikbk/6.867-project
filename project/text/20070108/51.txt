northrop might forgo tanker bid boeing would be left as lone air force option a dispute over process in a move that could complicate one of the u s air forces most important and politically sensitive weapons programs northrop grumman corp is threatening to shun a competition against boeing co for aerial refueling planes because of concerns over the bidding rules northrop officials have hinted for months about quitting the race for the decades long program valued at &# billion or more if they dont think the los angeles company has a fair shot of winning late last week northrop officially warned the air force in writing that it may not bid according to people familiar with the matter these people said northrop officials believe draft bidding guidelines effectively favor boeings less expensive refueling plane because they dont lay out detailed criteria for how the air force will evaluate extra capabilities such as cargo and passenger capacity that northrops proposed airplane offers regardless of whether northrops threat is a bargaining ploy or part of an exit strategy from a contest in which it has been the dark horse it significantly raises the stakes for the air force over the weekend the air force held lengthy and tense consultations with industry officials over finalizing the bidding requirements people familiar with the discussions said officials are expected to brief politicians on capitol hill this week about efforts to keep the competition the air forces acquisition priority on track the program which is critical to restoring the air forces credibility likely would be delayed if northrop withdrew it also would increase already intense political scrutiny over any air force attempt to award a contract to a single bidder particularly boeing which had a tanker deal in but lost it amid scandal two boeing executives including one who was a former air force procurement official went to prison over conflicts arising in part from the botched tanker program which went to boeing without competitive bids tanker planes are vital because they refuel combat aircraft in midair the current fleet consists of more than boeing planes mostly bought in the s northrop isnt expected to make a decision about withdrawing until after the air force issues the final bidding document which could be as early as next week for northrop the problem is how the air force will define the role of the new tanker planes will they be merely flying gas stations or will they need extra capabilities for missions such as carrying cargo and troops northrops offering based on the airbus a aircraft is bigger than boeings likely entry a modified and can carry more cargo the air force has said that in addition to the tankers primary fuel carrying mission it will consider cargo capacity and a range of other functions northrop is concerned that the bidding rules dont lay out exactly how these extra capabilities will be evaluated relative to the planes cost one person familiar with northrops tanker proposal summarized the teams concern this way if one plane is more capable than the other at greater cost shouldnt that plane win under unprecedented scrutiny from the u s congress led by arizona republican sen john mccain air force officials have labored to ensure the new tanker contest will be fair and open the air force also has faced intense lobbying by northrop and boeing to keep two bidders in the race the air force cleared some political minefields raised by northrops decision to team with european aeronautic defence &amp space co parent of airbus boeing and northrop are offering modified versions of commercial airliners but the air force has said a continuing u s european union trade dispute over commercial aircraft subsidies will have no bearing on the tanker competition the air force has been reluctant to prescribe specific targets for secondary requirements such as cargo because it wants to retain flexibility in assessing two slightly different planes u s pentagon officials say northrop spokesman randy belote declined to comment on the companys latest correspondence with the air force he said northrop has "been consistent in its call for a capabilities based acquisition strategy for the recapitalization of the aging tanker fleet " he added that the new tanker program "represents the air forces best opportunity to acquire a truly modern multirole and multimission refueling aircraft " northrop executives repeatedly have indicated they dont want the team to be a stalking horse simply for the air force to get a better price for boeing tankers boeings likely entry the modified is the same model the air force badly wanted in boeing believes its model is more flexible than northrops and a boeing spokesman said yesterday the company plans to bid for the tanker program regardless of what rules the air force sets a northrop withdrawal could disappoint northrops capitol hill allies alabama senators and congressmen have lobbied hard because the northrop eads tanker would be assembled in that state and anchor a future aerospace hub fleet renewal inventory planes based on the boeing airliner first deployed in planes based on the former mcdonnell douglas now boeing dc airliner first deployed in modernization plan in the first phase the air force plans to buy new tanker planes over years two tranches are to follow with details to be determined later cost the first phase is expected to cost more than &# billion over the decades long life of the program the cost is estimated to be between &# billion and &# billion making it one of the pentagon s biggest weapons programs sources air force industry estimates
