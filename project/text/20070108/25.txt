grading bonds on inverted curve if investors are betting on lower rates does a recession loom the bond market is having relationship issues that are getting harder to ignore normally yields on long term government bonds are higher than yields on short term ones investors demand a bigger return for the risk that comes with holding an investment that takes longer to repay the relationship has been upside down since july however with yields on short term u s treasury bills exceeding those on long term treasury notes late friday the yield on the three month treasury bill stood at well above the yield on the year note this unusual state of affairs known as an inverted yield curve has gone on longer than many economists expected and has some wondering whether the bond market is signaling that the economy itself could turn upside down even non wall street types are starting to notice charlotte observer sports columnist rick bonnell likens an inverted yield curve to a basketball player whose shooting percentage is lower at the free throw line than from the field its uncommon and nerve wracking just as hoops star shaquille oneals ineptitude at the free throw line gives his opponents strategic information foul the big man to prey on his weakness a yield curve inversion may offer insights about the economys own achilles heel yield inversions many analysts say are harbingers of hard times when bond investors see a recession coming they tend to buy long term treasury securities for two reasons first they are safer than stocks second they are appealing when inflation is low and recessions tend to beat down inflation the buying that comes with recession fears drives down a long term bonds yield sometimes below the prevailing yield on short term treasury securities the market in effect is betting that the federal reserve which dictates short term rates will have to cut its overnight fund rate to boost the economy and investors are pushing long term rates down in anticipation inverted curves often come toward the end of fed rate increase cycles fed chairman ben bernanke halted the central banks latest rate increase campaign in august the feds overnight funds rate now stands at "the market is pricing in that the fed funds rate is not going to stay at over the next years its pricing in that its going to be considerably lower " said bill irving who runs a long term treasury bond index fund for fidelity investments some economists doubt the yield curves effectiveness as a recession forecasting tool they think long term rates are exceptionally low right now for other reasons including lower long term expectations about inflation and growing demand for u s government bonds from foreign investors needing somewhere to park their money but those who think highly of the yield curves predictive power have history on their side seven times between and yields on the year note have dropped below those on the three month treasury bill for an extended span in six of those instances the u s economy went into recession soon after for example the recession was predated by a yield curve inversion that lasted from july to january in the one time when a recession didnt follow in the mid s there was still a sharp slowdown in growth "the yield curve gives you information that you should pay attention to " said david roberts chief economist at dominion bond rating service when the yield curve inverted for two weeks last february and march the inversion between long term and short term rates was so narrow and lasted so briefly that many economists dismissed it the current inversion is harder to ignore the disparity has grown deeper and has endured for months the three month year inversion is entering its th week "the longer it persists the more of a puzzle it becomes " mr roberts said one economic forecasting tool using treasury yield curve data pegs the chances of a recession at nearly one in two the model which was developed by fed economist jonathan wright takes into account yields on year and three month treasury securities as well as the feds overnight funds rate another forecasting model developed by federal reserve bank of new york economists using only the year three month spread puts the chances of a recession in months at just under those predictions are at odds with the consensus among economic forecasters a recent survey of economists by the wall street journal pegged the chances of a recession within the next months at two researchers who focus on recession forecasting lakshman achuthan and anirvan banerji of the economic cycle research institute argue that the yield curve is overrated as a recession harbinger they note that the yield curve failed to invert before recessions in the s and early s they also point to the misleading signal sent in when a lengthy inversion didnt precede a recession messrs achuthan and banerji argue that the economy and financial markets have changed greatly in recent years they note that pension funds oil producing nations and other cash laden institutional investors around the world have been pouring money into long term treasurys which they say creates "artificial" pressure that pushes long term bond prices higher and their yields lower "once the dust settles and we look back a year or two from now were going to see the inverted yield curve as a false alarm with respect to a recession " mr achuthan said dominion bond ratings mr roberts also isnt predicting a recession but he said the yield curves long inversion does sound a cautionary note for him and should do the same for anyone who is trying to figure out where the economy is going "i think that a prudent businessperson would say maybe i should look more carefully at some other sources of information maybe i should be more skeptical " he said
