hollywood tests a dynamic duo top two at universal pictures contend with flops fickle audiences but persevere last winter universal studios president ron meyer tried to convince two executives from different units marc shmuger and david linde that they should run the companys movie studio together despite coming from separate corners of its landscape "its a shotgun marriage " mr meyer told mr linde "but youre going to like each other " liking each other has proved the least of their worries since mr shmuger years old and mr linde assumed the top jobs at universal pictures last march as chairman and co chairman they have faced a long list of challenges that would test even the sturdiest corporate marriage halfway through the year the studio went cold at the box office with disappointments like "miami vice" that hurt theatrical revenue sweeping budget cuts were mandated in the fall by corporate parent general electric co facing a dearth of films to release for the coming quarters they were under pressure to whip up a compelling future slate and the studios international film distribution operation was being rebuilt after the dissolving of a longstanding joint venture with another company their problems reflect a truth about todays hollywood there has rarely been a tougher time to run a big movie studio across the board major studios are grappling with the bitter cocktail of issues including a slowdown in the critical dvd market an uncertain transition to digital distribution of films and an audience with volatile tastes messrs shmuger and linde were tossed together to attack these issues last spring after former universal head stacey snider defected to viacom inc s dreamworks pictures unit mr shmuger who had been vice chairman previously oversaw marketing and distribution for universal pictures while mr linde was co president of universals art house division focus features the men say they are hopeful about universals prospects despite the long list of challenges "we believe in the perennial attraction of the motion picture business to a sustainable audience " says mr linde "but the reality is the technology by which you reach that audience is going to change dramatically " he and mr shmuger are bullish about hd dvd their pick in a raging industry battle over the best format for the next generation of high definition dvd content and about the potential of their new international distribution arm which has been renamed universal pictures international to increase revenue theyre mindful of the advances in digital downloading but leery of cannibalizing the profitable theatrical and dvd businesses by embracing simultaneous movie releases on multiple platforms too soon when it comes to the near term however they have not divulged much about the type of film they want to make instead theyre hewing closely to a strategy that has historically worked well for universal cobbling together an annual slate of or so movies few of which will be "tentpoles " or big budget films geared toward a wide audience with the predominance being less expensive pictures with say art house or comedic appeal so rather than quickly stake out bets on big "franchise" movies in the "harry potter" or "lord of the rings" vein which frequently cost &# million or more the men have so far green lit a number of films with far more modest budgets that they hope will boost universals momentum the first movie to be approved and released by the new executive team was the violent &# million thriller "the kingdom " which stars jamie foxx and jennifer garner as federal agents it comes out april also in the works is "wanted " a &# million spy movie from russian director timur bekmambetov one of the studios biggest current hopes for an international hit after a quick hour auction universal also bought the rights to "borat" star sacha baron cohens mock documentary called "bruno" for &# million "in the state of hollywood today successful decision makers have to be nimble in order to get competitive advantage and the best talents " says mr shmuger one big risk is a film the studio might wish had been smaller "evan almighty " the "bruce almighty" sequel starring steve carell due out june the visual effects laden films initial budget of &# million has soared to more than &# million messrs shmuger and linde say theyre confident about the movie but theyve tightened up elsewhere for the &# million s era crime story "american gangster " theyve asked director ridley scott and producer brian grazer co chairman of imagine entertainment to be partly responsible for overruns and last fall universal halted a screen adaptation of the videogame "halo" after producers microsoft corp and peter jackson wouldnt renegotiate profit sharing deals the financial pressure comes from parent entity nbc universal which late last year mandated &# million in operating expense cuts while the move was prompted mainly by setbacks in the companys tv business universal pictures was also in a tough spot weathering a string of flops that led to its worst box office in recent years operating profit which came to about &# million in was also endangered say people who have reviewed the figures but a late year windfall in the sales of dvds and tv rights left profits relatively flat over the summer mr linde and his family had relocated from new york to los angeles accustomed to hobnobbing with independent filmmakers at film festivals mr linde was suddenly dealing with the big budgets and bigger egos of established hollywood during the cannes film festival in may for instance he drove to the ritzy hotel du cap eden roc early one morning for a scheduled breakfast with mr grazer whom he had not yet met but mr grazer sleeping in after the premiere of his blockbuster "the da vinci code " says he didnt hear mr lindes knocks at the door "i felt horrible " mr grazer says winning over mr grazer is important imagines deal with universal runs out late in and renewing that deal could be essential to universals long term stability another priority is renewing the contracts of tim bevan and eric fellner who together run the london based production company working title films which has contributed properties like "united " the inexpensively made sept drama that is now generating oscar buzz those contracts which mr bevan and universal say are likely to be renewed soon run out this year messrs shmuger and linde "come at it from a business point of view slightly more so than stacey which has its pros and cons " adds mr bevan they understand the importance of a globally minded company like working title to moviegoers overseas but he misses ms sinders production experience that creative sensibility had the occasional downside in universal put &# million into a movie based on the comic book series "the incredible hulk " but director ang lees carefully constructed "the hulk" didnt turn into the popcorn hit executives hoped for regardless universal is mulling distributing a sequel for which insiders considered a tongue in cheek marketing slogan "this time its actually incredible "
