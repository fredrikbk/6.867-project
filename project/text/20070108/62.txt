real time revisiting the early net a slate of predictions made for reveal what has and hasnt changed twelve years ago some of internet worlds regular contributors got together to look back at and make predictions for a list that made the digital rounds last week predictions are a dangerous business particularly online where they wait around to haunt you later so how did the magazines class of net gurus do very well provided you dont get sidetracked by technological red herrings the contributors prognostications are thick with references to protocols and file systems that now seem hopelessly arcane to mainstream users ftp and gopher for instance and many of their worries focus on newsgroups now a web backwater albeit one thats still going strong but look deeper and youll see how many predictions are dead on though some came to pass in slightly different forms or with a twist and you may be struck by how little some fundamental issues have changed in some cases simply swap nouns most typically "web" for "newsgroups" and youll have an accurate portrait of the opportunities and challenges facing the net today one thing is starkly different search the web was just beginning to take off netscapes browser was only a couple of months old with its epochal ipo yet to come the internet world contributors understood what was on the way "the coming year will be a great one for world wide web browsers " wrote joel snyder while dave taylor noted how "graphical user interfaces are enabling new groups of users to get on line " they also knew it had to be easier to find things mr taylor bemoaned " million people trying to find their ideal home page by wandering around " with the first wave of search engines in its infancy this was the era of interesting web sites on any topic being passed around by email and word of mouth or found through the likes of "cool site of the day" and hand built web guides such as yahoo then nearing its first birthday the long saga of search engines turning into portals and then in the case of google and yahoo web empires had barely begun a battle royal engulfing newsgroups at the time concerned spam in april the law firm canter &amp siegel sent the first commercial spam to some newsgroups you can see the original offering the firms services in getting a green card here in the aftermath the internet world participants worried about tit for tat "cancelbot" wars emerging from efforts to kill such spam messages as well as more marketers following canter &amp siegels lead and mr taylor wondered about the use of personal signatures at the bottom of newsgroup messages for commercial purposes "the last months have seen a definite transition from cute quotes to advertising hype " he wrote "what happens when graphics can be included and viewed by the majority " now we all know the answer though the tide of such messages wound up not just in newsgroups but in our inboxes and on web sites e commerce too was just getting started "flowers pizza condoms lobsters books music and more are available with other products sure to follow " noted andrew kantor who then nailed what that would mean "small companies can now have the same presence as larger ones who cares what neighborhood that bookstore is in " not mentioned is another consequence that the neighborhood bookstore might close though perhaps its owner is now happily running a book business out of his or her house he also predicted that "with more and more commerce being conducted through the net encryption will become necessary and common" and that "a standard also will emerge for secure monetary transactions that will make people comfortable sending credit card information over the wire " both of those things have come to pass with paypal allowing people to accept online payments without taking credit cards the beginnings of a commercial web left the contributors ambivalent kenny greenberg called "home shopping channel joins the internet" the worst net omen mr taylor invited his fellow prognosticators to decide whether the internet mall hed founded as a clearinghouse for commercial sites online was a good thing or a bad thing the internet mall itself never took hold as a business but the concept sure did thats a good description of ebay then yet to exist while amazon has endured to become the cyber equivalent of an all in one department store more familiar terrain mike godwin decried the clipper chip and "media hysteria about e mail stalking and the threat to children on the internet " and predicted that congress would try to regulate content on the internet congress did and periodically continues to do so while "hysteria" may be a loaded term you can still find worried and worrisome stories about kids safety online every day and nbcs dateline has made a cottage industry out of its "catch a predator" segments what wasnt so clear was how much worry would focus on the kids themselves making poor choices on myspace and facebook sites as for the clipper chip its no more but worries about the federal government digging into everything from email to web searches are very much alive as proven by the battle between google and the feds over the child online protection act and finally theres the question of the internets furious growth and how it could possibly accommodate all the "newbies" arriving with little more than their curiosity as a guide in the fall of america online had opened newsgroups to its users including your columnist then all of years old usenets veterans were still reeling at how to deal with the influx and grasped that newsgroups recent past was the webs prelude with graphical user interfaces making internet use relatively easy for all mr taylor welcomed the new wave of users from aol and delphi noting graciously that "each wave of new users brings new resources for everyone " he noted the nets ability to group people according to common interests rather than such cant help its as race class or gender while predicting that "too much noise from too many people" would drive more people to moderated lists and newsgroups something he called the "return of the editors " thats certainly proved true on the web think of blogs which are just the latest technology to help create these communities of interest which can both empower people and leave them less exposed to other points of view and fulfill mr taylors predictions blogs tame the daunting size of the net offering people sources of news and discussion about a specific topic important to them tailored lists of sites and the conversational back and forth that made newsgroups so vibrant its the latter thats the real advice the rest isnt particularly new whats justin halls "links from the underground" praised at the time by mr greenberg as the "best hotlist" but a proto blog todays blogs are easier to produce but not substantially different thats worth bearing in mind when pondering the online world of or some other future date it may not look like what we see on our monitors today but heres betting the same issues of community and commerce of privacy and boundaries will be the subject of fierce debate and that the internet world groups take on them will still be a good guide are there fundamental changes coming in the digital world or just new advances and variations on the same themes got any predictions for write to me at realtime wsj com if youve got something to say but dont want your comments considered for publication please make that clear
