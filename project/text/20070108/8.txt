activism grows in asia minority holders gain stature at koreas gravity when a pair of new york hedge funds tried to oust executives of a small online games company in south korea late last year the funds armed themselves with allegations of mismanagement and conflicts of interest and pressed for a shareholder vote they knew they couldnt succeed gravity co s chief executive il young ryu owns a stake through a holding company the funds ramius capital group and moon capital management which together own about of gravity wanted to send a message of dissatisfaction with management says mark mitchell an executive managing director of ramius they also wanted to pressure the companys independent directors to act on their own mr mitchell says what is striking about the december vote was that of gravitys minority investors threw their support behind the activist funds voting to rid the company of its ceo and one board member the response suggests that investors who agitate for change at companies in which they own stock may be gaining traction with rank and file shareholders in markets such as south korea minority shareholders typically tend to vote with management partly because satisfaction with how executives run a company often is what prompted them to invest in the first place two years ago dubai fund sovereign global investment struggled and ultimately failed to gather enough support to remove the chairman of korean oil refiner sk corp who had been convicted of accounting fraud even u s fund giant capital group sided with management since then korea has become a battleground for activist investors in asia hedge funds say they view korean companies as good buys with solid businesses and lower share prices relative to earnings than companies in other markets at
