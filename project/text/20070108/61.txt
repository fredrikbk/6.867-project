readers throw brickbats and roses at the new journal format while there is much about the new journal i appreciate most notably coverage of culture and the arts from a business perspective im dismayed that youve taken letters to the editor off the op ed page moving letters from section a to section b and to a chat room concept called journal exchange is a slap in the face to your readers and contributors the caliber of these letters has always been of such high quality that they were in effect mini editorials i enjoyed reading them and the added insight they contained not only noted experts but highly educated and experienced people from all fields were encouraged to write because they knew publication on the editorial page meant exposure to the same millions of journal readers who turn to that page every day you have put letters on a par with internet blather and who will bother to read them now that they are on a page people have to hunt for in a separate section candace crandall bowen lorton va i love the new print format size type column width etc it is much easier to read and fold thank you lynn bailey health economist columbia s c with your redesign you seem to have cracked the code on the issue that baffles most professional communicators how to retain loyalty and credibility among core audience members while reaching out to new disparate audiences without pandering or compromising core values as noted in your publishers letter in announcing the change there has been a shift in expectations of the media similarly expectations of public relations professionals have shifted as well now more than ever we depend on reliable media for accurate timely news well informed reporting and other information essential to the clients we serve with that in mind while your stylish look and slim size may entice new generations of readers it is the content that remains king by embracing both change and tradition while staying true to basic tenets of good journalism the journal continues to build on its greatest asset the confidence readers have placed in the newspaper since rhoda weiss chair and ceo public relations society of america new york allow me to register my displeasure at certain aspects of the new format your abbreviated stock tables are not an improvement theyre a regression to a small town format i used to be able to comb through the listings looking at highs lows dividend rates etc now i have to go from the breakfast table to the computer which is a real pain why did you decide to limit listings to the top richard schapker goleta calif congratulations to you and the entire management team for the strategic thinking and planning to produce the new look and enhanced quality and excellence of the journal i am truly ecstatic about the changes and will enjoy my journal even more including it now being easier to handle and read glenn ebersole lancaster pa you say "our greatest source of pride is the confidence our readers place in us " with the new format the journal appears to have abandoned its duty of reciprocal confidence by wedging the letters to the editor into a corner of the b section letters to the journal are a source of independent expertise and a check on reporters excess zeal or occasional sloppiness yes even in this paper louise christy sunnyvale calif thank you for the new look its slick sleek pleasant to handle and easy to navigate many thanks for the great new enhancements barry s mascarenhas tacoma wash while i knew in advance that i would miss the daily article in the first column on the front page i did not know that the type font was going to be decreased throughout the paper your youthful editors need to have a little sympathy for your older readers who really have trouble reading seven or eight point type fonts robert g vaughan sc d towson md congratulations on the new childrens version of the wall street journal complete with less text larger print and more pictures however i would prefer to maintain my subscription to the adult version which didnt read like the readers digest version of the great paper ive been reading for years josh gonze santa fe i love the new print version whereas the previous larger size of the paper would occasionally prompt me to throw it in the trash because it wouldnt fit in the side of my soft briefcase without folding it the new version fits perfectly without folding and i can already tell i am going to read it more frequently and more thoroughly david w morgan bloomfield hills mich nice to see pepper &amp salt back where it belongs terry hendrickson park ridge ill your decision to reduce the stock price tables to the largest market caps is a terrible disservice where else but on the internet or by calling a broker are we supposed to get daily information on the stocks no longer covered by you the new york times has already dropped coverage of all stock prices except for one day a week the journal is the national business journal of record what were you thinking so you save the cost of a couple of pages of newsprint and a little ink big deal this is a travesty dean s woodman sausalito calif
