our only hope president bush has appointed a new iraq team including one of our best counterinsurgency generals david petraeus to take command in iraq he is also about to unveil a new iraq strategy the apparent problem is uncontrolled sectarian violence in baghdad and the apparent solution is to send more american soldiers to restore order the actual problem is a dysfunctional sectarian iraqi political system here at home the imminent debate between the congress and the administration about the number of american forces is a diversion we may need more resources but first we need a strategy president bush faces a difficult strategic choice first he can continue to play defense and send in more troops to undertake tasks approved by prime minister nouri al maliki the intent is to buy another year during which a nonsectarian iraqi government will pull itself together it is difficult to see how it will alternatively he can adopt an offensive strategy with clear benchmarks strengthening iraqi security forces while imprisoning sunni insurgents and shiite death squads the risk is that mr maliki may refuse to cooperate forcing us to walk away in sum what lies before the administration is a final strategic choice after a series of large and consequential failures the campaign began brilliantly with the swift rush to baghdad in may stripped of their dominance but otherwise untouched by the war the sunnis supported an insurgency led by saddam loyalists and fueled by xenophobic religiosity the american military stubbornly responded for months with conventional sweeps and raids that fueled resentment and raised recruits for the insurgents it was not until late that our military seriously began training a new iraqi army that same year the white house endorsed a counterinsurgency strategy of "clear hold and build" inside sunni cities despite secretary of defense donald rumsfelds reservations that this thrust american soldiers into an occupying role without addressing how they would get out for a brief period it appeared that "clear and hold" was working then in february the sunni extremists destroyed the shiite mosque at samara this ignited the civil war they had sought to provoke for three years as with the initial sunni insurgency our military was caught a second time without a counterstrategy since the summer of we have fought a full fledged two front war waging one against the sunni insurgents north and particularly west of baghdad and the other in baghdad where both sunni and shiite killers murdered the innocents the sunni tool was the massive car bomb the shiite militias were more systematic employing death squads in a slow methodical ethnic cleansing of neighborhoods the war seesaws back and forth unlike in vietnam these enemies do not dare to fight even small american military units our casualties come from roadside bombs and sniper attacks in anbar province where the fighting is heaviest our marines are having unappreciated success in splitting local tribes from al qaeda in iraq the under strength iraqi army has performed well despite grossly inadequate support from mr malikis government the iraqi police in baghdad though remain penetrated by political militias the spectacle of saddam husseins guards chanting the name of moqtada al sadr as the despot swung from the gallows was revealing and disturbing so where do we go from here the much debated "surge" would only modify our current strategy if americans continue to focus chiefly on destroying the insurgents in sunni neighborhoods fewer sunni car bombs will supposedly result in less retaliation by death squads and end the ethnic cleansing the shiite population would turn away from militias because they wouldnt need them given more security by more americans because mr maliki values mr sadrs political support sadr city will remain what it is today a sanctuary for the mahdi army militia this is a problematic approach the sunnis initiated the violence no doubt about it but now the shiite militias are doing the majority of the killing in baghdad yet less than of those in prison are shiites there are murders a day in baghdad and most killers walk free the militias are gradually succeeding in the ethnic cleansing of much of baghdad to persist in this strategy is equivalent to a mayor telling his police chief that the mafia who live on the east side of town cannot be touched it dooms the chance however frail of creating a nonsectarian iraqi government coupled with defensive patrolling is a proposed program of job creation removing trash for example but handouts in a culture accustomed to handouts gain little the return for this effort is hard to predict in anbar province the only successful projects have been repayable loans to those iraqis resolute enough to step forward and accept responsibility for building their own businesses providing our advisers and battalion commanders with discretionary funds is a sound investment but is ancillary to establishing security its unproven how many year old foot soldiers will be diverted by low paying jobs if you went to a member of the mafia and offered a low paying job in return for renouncing crime he would laugh at you most of the thugs wont be bought off extortion and robbery are more lucrative and enjoyable president bush recently agreed with the assessment of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen peter pace that "were not winning in iraq but were not losing " but in counterinsurgency if you do not win you lose what then is another option the president can choose instead of a defensive surge strategy satisfying to mr maliki the president can opt for an offensive nonsectarian strategy its core operational concepts must be neutralizing criminals which include the sunni insurgents the shiite death squads and the criminal gangs by imprisonment deterrence or death and constructing iraqi security institutions as free as possible of sectarian taint iraq is now a police war and we need to treat it as such former secretary of state colin powell a few weeks ago said "we should not use our troops as policemen " but thats exactly how they are being used today in baghdad and are in fact used in most counterinsurgencies our weakest links are leaving the mahdi army off limits not selecting iraqi security leaders and refusing to arrest and incarcerate the criminals insurgents death squads and thugs if the presidents new strategy does not aggressively rectify these three defects then surging more american troops will buy time but not alter a war we are losing because we are not winning sadr city cannot remain off limits when the death squads know they are hunted many will flee the city others will fight back intense violence however cannot sustain itself american forces fought mr sadrs militia in april and august of in both cases all out war by the mahdi army petered out due to lack of logistics in both cases the shiite population stood to one side we created a monster by letting mr sadr go free twice we cannot make that mistake a third time to change the dynamic in iraq the president has to insist on arrests and incarceration rates equivalent or greater than those for violent crime in new york city this would set benchmarks and shift our forces from defense to offense new york city averages over arrests a year for violent crimes if a similar number of arrests were made in baghdad which is roughly the same population size as new york city the jail population in iraq would double in a year one in american males is in jail compared to one in iraqi males iraq is not six times safer than the u s instead iraq has a judicial system abetted by american military legalisms that works in favor of the killers the president has to change that our troops in iraq complain with justice that they often capture insurgents only to find them on the street a few months later as a result of the abuses of abu ghraib the u s military instituted four layers of review for each iraqi detained the result is that most detainees are released as for the iraqi system it is simply absurd insisting on habeas corpus rules of evidence in a corrupt and overwhelmed judicial system that incarcerates a few dozen each week compared to over a thousand a week in new york city alone eight of detainees are set free releasing killers undercuts troop morale while the residents lose trust texas has in jail iraq with a larger population and times the violence rate has in jail this "catch and release system " as the troops call it is the single weakest link in the u s strategy technology can help we could for example equip iraqi and american forces with mobile devices to fingerprint the military age males in baghdad and the sunni triangle anyone stopped can be checked in two minutes just as the border police and the chicago police do today this would deprive the killers of mobility and is the key to radically increasing arrests in this as in many other respects the american failure in iraq reflects not our preference for high technology as facile critics claim but our inability to bring appropriate technologies to bear this is an iraqi war and success depends on the creation of a larger iraqi army perhaps twice its current size of under and a neutral police force so we must increase our advisers from to or more this is a small unit police war with the insurgents hiding and dodging we do not need or conventional american battalions trained and equipped for full scale conventional war if the iraqi security forces are strengthened by bulked up american advisory teams but iraqi security forces will fall apart if political parties use appointments and promotions for sectarian purposes we must therefore insist on a joint u s iraqi board to appoint all iraqi battalion commanders and police chiefs and above american control over senior personnel is the single most important aspect of our effort to develop iraqi institutions without it additional resources to include more advisers will be wasted quite possibly prime minister maliki will refuse on the grounds of sovereignty and national pride to allow americans equal control over iraqi personnel policy we should respond that when iraq is truly sovereign and standing on its own we withdraw our advisers and the joint board ceases to operate in the meantime were not potted plants it is our advisers that force the ministries in baghdad to pay the iraqi soldiers it is our advisers on patrol risking their lives and dying to reassure the iraqi forces that they can prevail as long as we run equal risk we deserve equal say in the selection of competent leaders there is some chance that a strategy dependent on mr malikis sectarian instincts may succeed he may despite his poor track record pull himself and his government together prudence however suggests that the president design a strategy that is independent of mr malikis fortunes and strengthens the only institution capable of holding the country together the iraqi army we prefer an offensive strategy based on three ironclad principles take the offense immediately against the death squads in sadr city who are now unsettled arrest and imprison on a scale equal to the horrific situation or at least equal to new york city and insist on a joint say in the appointment of army and police leaders if the iraqi government refuses we should be willing to disengage completely and soon the paradox of american strategy in iraq is this president bush can achieve success only by threatening to do something he is morally opposed to doing leaving swiftly and risking chaotic civil strife if the president showed the same iron will toward mr maliki that he does toward congress and public opinion mr maliki would blink first the only course that will work entails not only the risks of greater casualties but the risks of walking away from promises unmet and hopes unfulfilled more money and troops are inputs not outputs a new strategy needs benchmarks for success arrests imprisonment and the adviser ratings of leaders our only hope lies not in american troops but in the development of an iraqi security force free of militia influence working for a government that understands the penalty for failure mr west a former assistant secretary of defense and a former marine
