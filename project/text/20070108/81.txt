why u s should root for dollar to weaken more last year the u s dollar did what economists had long predicted it would have to do it fell in value against other currencies and many believe that if americans know what is good for them they should be hoping for more of the same this year a weaker dollar creates plenty of hardships not only do european vacations get more expensive for americans so do chinese made television sets and other imported goods for foreigners a weaker dollar means their investments in the u s lose value but in the eyes of economists the more the dollar weakens the more it helps alleviate one of the great worries of our time the gaping u s current account deficit the current account which includes trade flows and other international payments measures exactly how much americans spending is outpacing their income and how much they are borrowing from abroad to fill the gap the u s is estimated to have rung up a deficit of about &# billion in its current account last year that is equivalent to nearly of the u s economy a level that if sustained would cause the nations foreign debts to pile up to dangerous levels a weaker dollar would help narrow the deficit by making u s exports more attractive to foreign buyers while making it costlier for americans to buy products from abroad the fate of the dollar and the current account which has worried economists for years was a hot topic at this past weekends annual meeting of the american economic association a panel of prominent economists including nobel prize winner robert mundell of columbia university harvards martin feldstein and kenneth rogoff michael mussa of the peterson institute for international economics and ronald mckinnon of stanford held forth on the subject to a packed ballroom in chicago "we clearly need a more competitive dollar " said mr feldstein who also heads the national bureau of economic research "the dollar is still very high too high to be sustained " a tougher question is how far and how fast the dollar needs to fall some economists fear a sudden plunge will roil international markets and trigger a u s recession others believe a slower and more manageable adjustment is under way they guess it could take a decline of to over as many as years to get the u s current account deficit down to a more sustainable level of of gross domestic product in the past several years the dollars movements have played into the hands of those who believe the dollars adjustment will be slow and not too painful after gradually weakening from its peak the dollar strengthened in even as the u s current account deficit set records in the u s currency weakened again as evidence of improving economic growth in europe prompted investors to put more money into euros friday the dollars value against a basket of u s trading partners currencies was down from a year earlier and from its february high jim oneill chief economist at goldman sachs in london applauded the currencys renewed slide "i think its good " he said "its all part of the growing evidence that the likelihood for international imbalances improving themselves has risen quite significantly " a weaker dollar by itself wont be enough to resolve global imbalances many economists agree that americans also will need to save more either by spending less or by cutting the federal budget deficit as of november u s consumers spending exceeded their disposable income by the nations budget deficit is running at about of gdp stronger growth abroad could play a role in shrinking the current account deficit by increasing u s exports though some believe the benefits would be limited in recent history increases or declines in foreign consumption have had only about half the effect on u s exports as changes in u s consumption have had on u s imports says catherine mann an economics professor at brandeis university in massachusetts beyond that much depends on exactly which currencies the dollar weakens against economists view asian currencies as most crucial because trade deficits with asian countries account for more than half of the u s current account gap so far the dollars biggest retreat has been against the euro friday a euro bought &# up from a year earlier in the same period the dollar weakened against the tightly controlled chinese yuan and has strengthened about against the yen "youd need the asian currencies to do more of the adjusting " says mr mussa senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington with all the caveats taken into account economists estimates vary widely on how much the dollar would have to weaken to bring the current account deficit into line mr oneill is among the most optimistic he thinks a drop in the dollars trade weighted value from its february peak combined with consumer spending slowing in the u s and accelerating abroad would be enough to do the trick with the dollar down from its peak that leaves only eight percentage points to go mr oneills view depends in part on the idea that the u s has yet to fully benefit from the dollars previous weakening because changes in exchange rates tend to affect trade flows with a lag of as much as two years indeed in inflation adjusted terms the u s current account deficit has been stable as a percentage of gdp since late mr rogoff a specialist in international economics at harvard sees a darker picture he believes the dollar must fall at least another from now and worries that the longer it takes the greater the chances that some unforeseen shock such as a terrorist act or a housing industry collapse will trigger a crash "so far weve just seen a small ripple in the dollar and not the big tsunami that could hit someday " he says "thats still a significant risk " as a result many economists view any move toward a weaker dollar as a step in the right direction says john huizinga a professor of economics at the university of chicago graduate school of business "any depreciation thats in a normal observable range is good because it leaves less depreciation to happen and lessens the likelihood of one of these crises "
