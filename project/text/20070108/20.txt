fitzgeralds wild source chase patrick fitzgeralds trial of scooter libby is set to begin this month assuming anyone can still remember what this case is all about oh yes mr fitzgerald is prosecuting mr libby for lying in order to well were still waiting to hear a motive for this alleged perjury to cover up a leak that wasnt a crime but perhaps the prosecutor will come up with something meantime mr fitzgerald has some other unfinished legal business that the public has a right to know about namely the affidavits he filed with the d c circuit court of appeals to justify his motion to compel two reporters to testify about their conversations with mr libby and his willingness to throw one of them in jail for days until she did so those documents remain under seal which is why dow jones and the associated press filed a motion with the d c circuit late last month requesting their release dow jones which owns this newspaper and the ap are also requesting that the court now release all of the redacted parts of judge david tatels concurring opinion in the d c circuit ruling that compelled the reporters to testify responding to an earlier dj ap motion the court released part of the redacted eight pages in early but it held back the rest as well as mr fitzgeralds affidavits in the case because the prosecutor insisted his investigation was continuing that was a stretch even then but its certainly no longer true mr fitzgerald months ago told the lawyer for karl rove that the senior white house aide will not be indicted and more to the point of mr fitzgeralds wild newspaper source chase we learned last summer that neither mr libby nor mr rove was the original source of the leak of cia analyst valerie plames name to columnist robert novak as the dow jones ap motion points out "the public now knows that the special counsel mr fitzgerald knew the identity of that leaker richard armitage the former deputy secretary of state from the very beginning of his investigation " finding the leaker was mr fitzgeralds main charge from the justice department so why did he keep pursuing reporters with such hyper zeal for another two years his pursuit led to a constitutional showdown over the medias right to protect sources going all the way to the supreme court and the precedent a bad one for the press may well encourage a wave of attempts by prosecutors across the country to force journalists to betray their sources the press and public both have a right to know what evidence was so compelling that judge tatel and mr fitzgerald thought it warranted such a legal collision all the more so now that congress is also debating a "shield" law to protect media sources a wiser prosecutor than mr fitzgerald would have ended his probe the minute he discovered that mr armitage was the leaker instead he told mr armitage to keep quiet and let the public believe for two years that someone high up in the white house might have leaked for nefarious political purposes in the end mr fitzgeralds case has been distilled to a perjury charge that while serious as a matter of law appears to come down to different memories about conversations mr libby had with three journalists and as we all know journalists never get anything wrong whether or not mr fitzgerald ever discloses a motive for a seasoned lawyer like mr libby to have lied the unsealing of the affidavits and judge tatels redacted pages will help us better understand the prosecutors motives for his troubling zeal
