journal exchange the informed reader insights and items of interest from other sources mens health male menopause is a medical condition but its tough to spot tougher to treat more than a metaphor for a middle aged mans need to buy a fast car and wear a leather jacket male menopause is also a medical condition it is however hard to spot and serious research into treatment has only begun explain harvard medical schools daniel d federman and geoffrey a walford in the latest issue of newsweek unlike the steep fall in estrogen levels that gives female menopause its dramatic symptoms a mans loss of the hormone testosterone is very slow and can start as early as eventually by middle age that cumulative decline may cause "a loss of muscle mass and bone strength increased body fat decreased energy less interest in sex erectile dysfunction irritability and depression " these symptoms are serious but a host of other conditions including alcoholism depression or thyroid disorders can cause them making it hard to identify male menopause as the cause furthermore a mans testosterone level can be an unreliable indicator because testosterone levels vary greatly between men of the same age and even in the same man at different hours of the day the authors say that perhaps as many as million men in the u s are going through menopause testosterone delivered via patches and gels can help those with a markedly low level of testosterone men with borderline levels should avoid taking the hormone however since it is connected to prostate cancer and sleep apnea in which breathing during sleep becomes irregular for the future the most promising line of research is into a new hormone that resembles testosterone but which doesnt affect the prostate theres a lot that isnt known about how to treat male menopause but "with the growing interest in this problem " the authors conclude the "knowledge gap is likely to shrink " newsweek jan politics how foreign policy defines democrats stances foreign policy will define the presidential election so how do the democrats likely contenders define their foreign policy the new yorkers jeffrey goldberg finds in interviews that they share a belief that the u s should engage with the world and use force when necessary the candidates whom mr goldberg has nicknamed differ in some subtle and not so subtle ways barack obama aka "the pleaser" not like the others because he didnt vote in favor of the iraq war he has a hawkish rhetoric but recommends soft instruments of power such as an international peace keeping force in the darfur region of sudan key quote "we absolutely have an obligation to the iraqi people thats why ive resisted calls for an immediate withdrawal " john edwards aka "the withdrawal candidate" not like the others because he aligns himself with a withdrawal hungry democratic base key quote "weve devoted enormous resources human and otherwise to iraq and now weve reached the place i think where the iraqis are going to have to take responsibility " hillary clinton aka the "connoisseur of statecraft " not like the others because while she has criticized president bushs execution of the war she hasnt repudiated her vote in favor of it as mr edwards has key quote "we can criticize the idealists who have an almost faith based idealism without adequate understanding or evidence based decision making and we can critique the realists for rejecting the importance of aspiration and values in foreign policy " the new yorker jan pharmaceuticals vaccines sit idle as costs outprice needs of the poor in the developing world no matter how great the need for a drug or a vaccine the eventual demand hasnt always matched it scientific american reports in an article on its web site for instance although million people across the world are affected by malaria novartis ag and sanofi aventis sa have on separate occasions been left with millions of unused doses of vaccine by overestimating african countries demand for them there is no easy way to bridge the information gap poor countries need to know a vaccines price before they decide how much to order while manufacturers need to know the order size before they can set the price all the while without a price aid groups dont know how much to budget as a result market forecasting the only way out of this bind has become the hot thing in development health circles a lot of groups are asking health officials about their demand for a drug how much price would influence the demand and their governments political will to pay up for it given the treatments efficacy one finding from those surveys even if they eventually work the demand for hiv vaccines that are under development now would not be high health groups like the global alliance for vaccines and immunization hope that the surveys data will help them find ways to boost demand for hiv vaccines if and when they become available "you can start doing things today to increase the rate of use of the vaccine" when it comes out says wendy woods who has advised health groups of the boston consulting group scientific american jan crime why surge in homicides could be seen as anomaly violent crime is returning both to cities and the national political agenda but there are some good reasons not to panic quite yet official nationwide statistics wont be available

a long plateau in murder rates philadelphias homicides in were the most it has had since theories for the rise include the impact of volatile fuel prices on the poor a wave of prisoner releases and a larger number of young people with guns there are also some reasons the rise might be an anomaly the increase isnt evenly spread across the country and some cities such as san francisco and dallas saw scarcely any jump at all by contrast the crack epidemic caused a uniform rise in violent crime across the country despite a sharp rise in new york homicide totals are still far off the highs of the early s and were inflated by an unusually high number of "reclassified deaths" deaths last year caused by crimes in previous years smaller cities actually saw a decline in murders in the fbis nationwide tally for the first six months of last year "any blip in homicide statistics is unnerving because we dont know why weve had this epidemic of good news " says franklin zimring a crime
