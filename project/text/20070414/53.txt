pursuits leisure &amp arts declarations the incredible shrinking candidates on wednesday john mccain distinguished himself with a closely argued and eloquent address in which he spoke seriously and at length of his position on iraq he said america faces "an historic choice" with "ramifications for americans not yet even born " "many democrats " he said view the war as "a political opportunity " while republicans view it as "a political burden " but it is neither he said it is not a political question to be poll tested but a challenge that bears on our continuance as a great nation we must stay and fight and win "it may be standard setting " the hotline said of the remarks the next day "perhaps the most powerful plea a war supporter has sent to the american people since the troop surge began has any other presidential candidate written a speech to persuade importune an audience to change their minds " you can agree or disagree with mr mccain but where he stands is clear and clarity these days from our candidates feels like a gift as does certitude he isnt running from the war but owning it a political rival might say "he has no choice " but theres always a choice my larger point however is that he sounded like a serious man addressing a serious issue in a serious way this makes him at the moment stand out there is a sort of stature gap in the presidential campaign so far isnt there a lack of personal height among the candidates a lack of the bearing that befits the office they seek here was rudy giuliani this week in a speech in california no one much noted it he was lucky it was subsumed by the imus wave but this is how mr giuliani opened a speech to citizens considering his candidacy for the american presidency "thank youse all very much for invitin me here tuh day to this meeting of the families from different partsa california " he was imitating marlon brando in "the godfather " the rendering comes from a newsday report actually the character of don corleone as drawn by mario puzo was possessed of a certain verbal elegance but never mind mr giulianis imitation was clear enough to inspire in the audience a smattering of applause and apparently laughter earlier in the week in reaction to a spate of critical stories about his wife judith he asked reporters to leave her alone "i am a candidate shes a civilian to use the old mafia distinction " ah cant have enough candidates for president who whimsically employ the language of mobsters rudy is no in the gop polls but he has been displaying the worst stature gap on the trail he cant see why his wife sets peoples teeth on edge he cant see why it would disturb us to have her at cabinet meetings he assures us she actually wont be at cabinet meetings this was followed by his statement that of course he continues to be pro choice on abortion and yeah actually hes probably also for taxpayer funding of abortion but maybe not there is an embarrassing ad hoc ness a bush leagueness to this its as if he hasnt thought it through as if hes just deciding everything each day but by the time youre running for president you should have decided at the very least a major candidate should by now have absorbed and internalized that he is running for what is actually the presidency of the united states and not say the las vegas city council from mike huckabee this week a similar contribution to the august nature of the endeavor he said if republicans dont start judging the private lives of the republican candidates for president they should just "apologize to bill clinton " thatll class things up mitt romney at the same time was talking about shooting varmints with all the rifles he does or does not own none of these are as bad as what may be the worst moment in the entire campaign so far that being hillary clintons adopting of a deep southern drawl when she spoke at a church last month in selma ala "ah dont feel no ways tarred ah come too far and the chair of all the mares in the country mare palmer from trenton new jersey " oh my goodness it was so embarrassing so lead footed and cynical so patronizing you know she was shocked that it didnt go over because shed seen her husband hop up his own accent and go with the sing song cadences a hundred times in his career a thousand times and no one ever knocked him for it but he was good at it and he was actually a southerner he wasnt adopting an entire new regional accent and calling it his own so whats going on here "cant nobody here play this game " the presidency is an august office why are these candidates acting so small when the job they think they deserve is so big maybe its just that people have less dignity these days and so candidates do too a few decades ago personal dignity became equated with stiffness and pretension there was nothing in it for politicians anymore it all might have started in when richard nixon went on "laugh in" and said "sock it to me " but that worked because he had actual personal dignity to spoof maybe weve reached the point where anyone whod run for president is almost definitionally strange maybe its that the candidates so far are just the kind of people whod make it to the top of the greasy pole scramblers by nature whose main talent is energy not judgment but i have a different theory i think its that all our candidates for president have met or know well too many former and sitting presidents theyve seen them up close they know them they have seen their flaws and mess and inadequacy knowing a lot of former presidents and a lot of incumbents will give you a too mortal sense of what the presidency is the problem with former presidents is that knowing them keeps you from being awed by the presidency when you havent met them you have a more austere and august sense of who they are and what a president is candidates on the trail today would be better off keeping as their template for the office washington jefferson and lincoln the unattainable greats its no good to just be thinking at least im better than clinton at least im better than bush something to reach for even if you know it will exceed your grasp but its good to be reaching upward not stooping
