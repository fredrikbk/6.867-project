hot topic congresss taxing hurdle the amt as many americans race to finish their taxes congress returns from recess next week facing twin challenges fixing the alternative minimum tax and raising

inflation the tax increasingly ensnares upper middle class taxpayers who never were intended to be its targets repealing the tax is supported by members of congress but is costly the government could lose &# trillion in revenue over the next decade if it were eliminated that has congress looking at a partial repeal and also at ways to ramp up tax collections by among other things trying to close the estimated &# billion "tax gap" the difference between what taxpayers should have paid and what they actually pay while the alternative minimum tax means a significant boost in the tax bills of many americans proposals to close the tax gap by increasing resources for the tax collector could be costly for many too heres whats at stake what is the alternative minimum tax the amt is a separate system from the regular income tax and it operates under many different rules there are two rates and some popular deductions that many people claim under the regular system such as state and local
