pursuits leisure &amp arts masterpiece who was madame george a van morrison cult classic and a possible key to its mystery anatomy of a classic if i ventured in the slipstream between the viaducts of your dream one of the most revered and iconic popular music albums of the past years entered the marketplace in november at the time few american record buyers took note "astral weeks " by the irish born singer songwriter van morrison was easy to overlook upon its release and when noticed difficult for some to comprehend a collection of eight songs it lasted a modest three quarters of an hour yet the average tracks length was a formidable six minutes the album yielded no hit singles no singles at all in fact the pop currency standard of the day the lewis merenstein produced albums feel and sound an idiosyncratic blend of jazz tinged rhythms unorthodox time signatures unusual instrumentation flute violin soprano sax acoustic bass and guitar trombone vibraphone was quite different from that of "brown eyed girl " the hook laden pop hit that had vaulted mr morrison into the top a year earlier and it was still further removed from the hard edged irish rhythm and blues that first brought the artist fame in the mid s as lead singer of the british invasion group them on "astral weeks " mr morrison sang in a commanding and emotional voice that swooped and soared cruised and stuttered through a mesmeric fusion of euphoria and pain that voice served lyrics that spiraled from the specific to the ethereal in hypnotically evocative stanzas that spoke both of specific irish streets and of some rain drenched edenic garden of romantic yearning fulfilled and betrayed peak experience recollected in heartbroken tranquility and the fleeting past recaptured in the flickering windows and rhythms of a moving train the albums centerpiece was a melancholy minute slow march requiem to a certain "madame george" an eponymous character whose nature and identity are never quite clear through the layered smoke of the songs nostalgic recollection "astral weeks " in short did not soar up the charts a work of unique beauty it took a while to find its unique audience fortunately for mr morrison he was signed to a label warner bros records that realized it needed to treat his lp not like a typical one month release but as a steady selling catalog item in time the lp acquired a loyal if not fanatical if not cultish following over the years its been included on many magazines"best rock albums of all time" lists in it was given a grammy hall of fame award more important perhaps it proved to be for its composer performer a breakthrough into his mature style a poetic mystical realism he has explored with artistic profit for nearly years and "astral weeks" continues to sell well today through it all one question persisted who and what was "madame george" the songwriter refused to be specific about this character glimpsed "playing dominoes in drag" a dublin transvestite a female or male impersonator a changeling on the astral plane in as in my guess is as good as yours so i may as well state my inspired or obvious notion that "the one and only madame george" in van morrisons lyric is madame george yeats wife from to of the irish poet william butler yeats the mystic yet specific poet whose topics and imagery are evoked and echo throughout the body of mr morrisons work a few examples w b yeats wrote famously of a rough beast gone slouching van morrison penned the song "rough god goes riding " yeats allowed john mccormack an earlier irish tenor to record a song version of his "down by the sally gardens " "but ah " the poet complained of the results "the damnable clarity of the words " mr morrison adapted a yeats poem into a song titled "before the world was made" and also recorded a yeats like song of his own called "in the garden" for those who look there is no end of connections between van morrison and w b yeats a poet whose life and oeuvre were assertively revived by a woman named george a self declared medium and a proactive muse who spurred her husbands creativity through automatic writing and the inducement of trance states as mr morrison wrote and sang thats when you fall into a trance sitting on a sofa playing games of chance with your folded arms in history books you glance into the eyes of madame george mr morrison who began performing as a teen and whose first poetic touchstone was the u s folksinger huddie "leadbelly" ledbetter made a splash with them doing american influenced blues then after going solo he fell into aesthetic limbo signed to an american label that tried in vain to get him to replicate his "brown eyed girl" sound of success only after extricating himself from contractual entanglements was he able in "astral weeks " to stake out his own musical terrain an inventive pop music transformation of the irish bard tradition to paraphrase a morrison lyric hed found the key to his soul in the dust of a celtic crossroads in the mutual presence of leadbelly and yeats how fitting if like yeats himself he made his way to that twilit junction at least in part through the symbolic guidance of that same entrancing eyed queen of the astral slipstream the one and only madame george mr nolan is the author of "ross macdonald a biography" and editor of "the couple next door collected short mysteries by margaret millar "
