pursuits books social registrar the novelist who captured the beau monde and lived it edith wharton by hermione lee knopf pages &# hermione lee has done a back breaking amount of research and delivered a page biography "edith wharton " this thorough scholarly work with pages of exhaustive notes gets all of wharton writer serious gardener cutting edge interior designer war correspondent and intrepid traveler between covers in spite of ediths lifelong determination that no one ever would thus whartons irritating habit of retrieving her letters and barbecuing them she should have known that theres no defense against a determined biographer ms lee becomes as embroiled in whartons many passions as her subject readers will find themselves pondering the arguments behind such statements as "stucco is not intrinsically immoral" and up to their shoulders in the philosophical reasons for preferring the box parterre over the flower garden as a novice to gardening and architecture i found ms lees discussion of this material enthralling but digesting the entire book is not a light matter whartons life began against the backdrop of americas second industrial revolution and ended on the eve of world war ii a period rich in the social upheavals that her novels dissect born into old new york money she married appropriately and channeled her young energies into the marital home and hearth travel and her friendship with architect ogden codman led to their collaboration on "the decoration of houses" in but it was two years later that her real writing life began with the publication of a short story collection "the greater inclination " not unpredictably for one so clearly destined to become a literary figure from that point on wharton never stopped writing and was at work on her novel "the buccaneers" at her death she had spent much of her childhood in europe which gave her an aesthetic sensibility that america could not replicate when she and her husband moved to france after the turn of the century wharton forged a pleasantly upper class bohemian circle of friends while retaining the comfortable standards of fifth avenue life her passionate affair with an impeccably dressed cad and bounder the american journalist morton fullerton she was and he had as henry james warned her disaster written into it it was a coup de foudre "the moment my eye fell on him i was content " edith said borrowing the line from emerson she embraced love and sexuality with a fearsome intensity that inspired some of her best and very worst writing during world war i wharton became a relentless propagandist for american entry into the war set up workshops and homes for refugees and used her high connections to write dispatches from the frontlines becoming the christiane amanpour of her day albeit in a mercedes with a legion dhonneur for her efforts after the war she quickly wrote "the age of innocence " which made her the first female to win a pulitzer prize in she continued to churn out short stories novellas and novels survived changing literary tastes and in her top three years earned the equivalent in todays currency of several million dollars multi tasking was not a word edith would have known but it was the only lifestyle she had henry james called her the "devastating angel the firebird" and claimed to be a "limp field flower" after her visits no detail was too small to escape her beady eye in december the bloody battles of world war i raging only miles from her french home and feeling all she loved in civilization menaced edith wharton dictated a letter "mrs wharton begs to inform mr brigg that about a month ago she took to his workshop to be repaired an umbrella which she had bought from him and of which the spring was broken after waiting eight days the woman in the shop said it had come back from the workroom but that she had mislaid it after another delay it was returned to mrs wharton but on opening in the rain she found that the repair had not been made as mrs wharton was on foot she went at once to mr briggs shop asked for the loan of an umbrella for an hour " mr brigg and his sad little umbrella never stood a chance heaven knows how many white hairs it cost hermione lee but the extraordinary accomplishment of her biography enables readers to feel that they have known mrs w all their lives and for better or worse with the same sort of intimacy that her closest friends enjoyed my own response to wharton a writer whose work and acidulous wit i devour is to thank heaven i never existed in her wake she did enjoy close friendships with henry james and bernard berenson but the life that ms lee chronicles wharton in a circle of clever sexually ambivalent young men who keenly discuss literature and art while dissecting with malicious brilliance everyone and each other sounds like living hell to me none of them including edith cared much about ideas which is why they appear all but indifferent to the geopolitical evils emerging around them over the first third of the th century they cared greatly about "civilization" and language but lacked any sense for politics and history reading ms lee one can hear edith organizing her world to her american literary editor coming to visit "mrs wharton advises you to take provisions with you and not try to get to the dining car on the train as you would certainly lose your place " to a dearest friend who has procured the quilt edith requested "dont think i am a monster of ingratitude for returning the bed quilt unopened i know from your description that it is just what i wanted but alas blue is about the only colour that wont do " to the unfortunate mayor of hyeres where she has purchased a home she sends a sketch of the various civic improvements she wants roads repaired dustbins tidied away flowers planted a series of articles called "french ways and their meaning" was inspired by her desire to help american soldiers understand the french the collection shows acute insight into the french character but it is a muddle when it comes to any understanding of european history the swift repayment of german indemnities after the franco prussian war for example had nothing to do with the exalted status of women in the small businesses of france as wharton lyrically claimed ms lees book reads best with a copy of whartons autobiography "a backward glance " at hand a writer must "deal only with what is within his reach " wharton explains in her reach was "shallow fashionable new york with its power of debasing people and ideals " this enticing amorality is captured to perfection in "the house of mirth " which appeared in and was an instant best seller whartons lily bart dies impoverished but her dues to the vanities paid eight years later in "the custom of the country " lily barts successor the ambitious undine spragg from apex city has more success in social mountaineering undine marries up sequentially in europe as well as america only to realize in her paris ballroom at the books end that as a divorcee "she could never be an ambassadors wife and that was the one part she was really made for " the test of whartons riveting prose lies in the universality and modernity of her insights the descendants of undine spragg lily bart and judy trenor the fickle social queen bee of "the house of mirth" enact eerily identical agendas on park and fifth avenues today all the same whartons work was not simply that of an ironic observer of her own set arguably her finest book "ethan frome " a tragedy set in a bleak new england village was "the book to the making of which i brought the greatest joy " and for that joy wharton had to look to the pain in her own soul in her fiction and her life edith wharton put a premium on privacy and dignity one wonders what she would make of our world today where people voluntarily make little videos of themselves behaving with dreary coarseness to be posted on youtube in a quest for a millisecond of fame such rich material so few whartons such a need ms amiel is a british and canadian columnist currently working on a book on manners and mores
