stem cell compromise scientists say that new lines of embryonic stem cells need to be approved for federal funding to keep the u s on the cutting edge of stem cell research the bush administration and those concerned with the sanctity of life advocate a policy ensuring viable embryos are used only for new life and not research the senate recently passed two bills on this issue one would open many viable but unused embryos for research and federal funding but will draw a bush veto the other would allow funding for research on stem cells from "naturally dead" embryos but scientists question if this will supply the needed stem cells as congress debates this issue one has to ask "could there be a middle ground that would give the scientists the stem cells they need and at the same time not violate the sanctity of life " we think there is stem cell researchers widely agree that embryonic cells offer the greatest potential for discovery of treatment for human disease they also agree that hundreds if not thousands of new lines are needed to advance this learning in vitro fertilization is the primary source of these stem cells when a couple presents for ivf the process begins with extensive counseling and education the female is treated with medicines known as gonadotropins to stimulate the formation of mature eggs the number produced is variable and dependent upon age but on average about eggs are produced which can be harvested via a simple minimally invasive procedure the eggs are then fertilized with the male sperm with about a fertilization rate from our eggs we now have about nine or one cell zygotes or embryos at their earliest stage in most ivf labs the embryos will be allowed to grow in culture for five days by day two there will be two to four cells five to eight cells by day three day four cells or "morula stage " and by day five cells or "blastocyst stage " ultimately only of these embryos will grow to this blastocyst stage the best will be chosen for implantation and others frozen for potential implantation at a later date some embryos however are not suitable for implantation or freezing they may offer the middle ground currently these nonviable embryos are terminated and discarded even though the stem cells inside could be considered healthy though not prime the embryo has essentially no chance of surviving no viability and thus will not become a living human being estimates are that of all embryos created are discarded on day five or six because they are nonviable and therefore considered unsuitable for freezing or transfer the annual number of such embryos is estimated to be in the thousands could the stem cells in these nonviable embryos be donated for research consider a practice that is socially morally and ethically acceptable to most parties organ donation in the course of human events natural causes as well as traumatic injury can reduce a living human being to a vegetative nonviable state this could be a ruptured cerebral aneurysm or a high velocity head injury the individual by some qualitative or quantitative measure is determined to be brain dead or nonviable the organs inside are still functioning but the individual can never be a cognitive living human being at this point family members or the individual themselves if they chose so beforehand can donate healthy organs in like fashion the "organs" of these defective nonviable embryos could be donated whether one asserts that life begins at the union of egg and sperm or not the belief is not violated by this proposal this once viable living one celled zygote embryo has through the course of natural events become nonviable just like the organ donor could then the "parents" of these nonviable embryos which can neither be implanted nor frozen and thus never become a living human being elect to donate the "organs " or cells of these embryos if you believe in organ donation as an ethical practice you would have to say "yes " ethical safeguards would need to be in place the cells could not be sold and the embryos must come from couples who are actually going through the ivf process in order to bring forth a child there would also have to be general agreement and specific guidelines on the grading process used to determine the ultimate viability of these in vitro fertilized embryos finally there would need to be a mechanism for the ethical and safe transfer of these cells after reviewing this concept with several prominent conservative biblical scholars there was no rejection and in fact much interest in exploring the idea further this subgroup of embryos may very well become the "middle ground" we are seeking supplying researchers with the stem cells they need to realize medical discoveries while still recognizing and preserving the sanctity of life making the nonviable cell lines available today via "organ donation" would provide an ethical life focused answer to the medical research need we believe that this approach with appropriate safeguards could satisfy the demands of all concerned parties and therefore merits further discussion dr gill is chairman of the texas healthcare task force
