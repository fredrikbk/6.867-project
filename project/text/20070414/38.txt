in obesity wars a new backlash a western town pushed schoolkids to eat right and exercise more did it go too far mr coca do you think im fat gillette wyo brittany burns years old has always been on the heavy side last year in fifth grade neighborhood kids started picking on her at the bus stop calling her "fatty" and "chubby wubby " then someone else piled on brittanys school in a letter dated oct the campbell county school district no invited "select students" to take part in a fitness and nutrition program set up for some of the districts most overweight kids at feet inches tall and pounds brittany qualified receiving the letter was "embarrassing " brittany says her mother mindi story a clerk at an albertsons supermarket says she seethed "pure anger" because she argues her daughters weight shouldnt be the schools concern "i send her to school to learn math and reading " spurred by a local doctor and an enthusiastic school board gillette has banned soda and second helpings on hot meals this year it included students body mass index a number that measures weight adjusted for height on report cards and started recommending students like brittany for after school fitness programs it even offers teachers the chance to earn bonuses based on their fitness while the extent of gillettes weight campaign makes it an outlier the school district is just one of many communities stepping up efforts to tackle childhood obesity at the buckeye central local school district in new washington ohio officials have replaced large cookies with smaller ones stewart middle school in norristown pa has limited the number of snacks students can buy to one a day burning tree elementary school in bethesda md now asks parents to bring fruit and juice for class parties instead of chips and soda arkansas pennsylvania and a few other states require that students body mass index be recorded and sent home to parents periodically starting this school year a new federal rule requires that all school districts receiving meal subsidies create a "wellness policy" outlining goals for nutrition and fitness many health experts approve given how much time children spend at school schools create "social norms " says marlene schwartz director of research and school programs at yale universitys rudd center for food policy and obesity "the school is the perfect place to both teach things intellectually but also create an environment where those lessons are reinforced " but across the country the new rules are also sparking a backlash among parents children and even some teachers and school officials the efforts often draw derision for being too extreme and demonizing children arkansas the first state to pass legislation requiring schools measure students body mass index backtracked last month and now allows parents to refuse the assessment the question of weight in arkansas has been a sensitive one since former gov mike huckabee shed more than pounds a few years ago and encouraged locals to follow his example rosey barbour was a member of the gillette "task force" that devised the health initiative her year old son taylor who attends rawhide elementary was bullied for being overweight then in december the family received a letter inviting him to take part in a fitness and nutrition program seth barbour taylors father "was a little past mad " he recalls given taylors sensitivity about his weight the barbours never told their son about the invitation while on the task force mrs barbour fought some of its initiatives in particular the move to put bmi scores on report cards "everything the healthy schools task force has done has been controversial " she says gillette is a dusty bustling coal mining center in northeastern wyoming bisected by a railroad operated by burlington northern santa fe corp which delivers coal to such cities as chicago and centralia wash against empty sky a water tower proclaims the city the "energy capital of the nation " fueled by that thriving industry the towns population is booming in the past five years its population has risen steadily by about to tax revenue from local mines helps fund recreational activities for young sports minded families including an olympic size swimming pool and a nine hole golf course wyoming redistributes local property tax revenue statewide to ensure that poorer districts arent left out campbell county is so wealthy however that its school district in recent years has received a "recapture rebate" after remitting funds to the state the school district tapped that money to fund some of the health programs to the tune of &# a year the rest &# comes from the campbell county community public recreation district which levies property taxes on energy companies about three years ago for the first time in his nearly years as a doctor in the area school board chairman and local pediatrician david fall started seeing cases of overweight children with diabetes an informal survey of patients suggested that about were overweight close to the national average those who were overweight he noticed were "way overweight " at the school board he says "we decided this was an issue we should look into " across the u s about of children and adolescents age two to are overweight more than triple the percentage of years ago according to the federal centers for disease control and prevention the cdc defines overweight children as those with a body mass index in the th percentile and above which puts them at increased risk for chronic health problems such as hypertension certain types of diabetes and heart disease in dr fall organized the healthy schools task force and recruited about two dozen parents and teachers first item on the list removing soda machines from schools in the district "the biggest grief we got was from the teachers " dr fall recalls because schools also took machines out of teachers lounges "some of them are still mad at me they called me the pop nazi " the task force decided students would no longer receive second helpings of lunch entrees they could have unlimited helpings of fresh fruits vegetables and salad it told lunch servers to give smaller portions to younger students concession stand vendors received a list of recommended alternatives such as fresh fruit and string cheese school principals were pushed to dump bake sales in favor of car washes talent shows and walkathons the task force also deployed financial incentives elementary schools that added physical activity received extra funding for instructors and after school health programs based on the assumption that children emulate adults around them the district in february began awarding bonuses to faculty who opted to receive a fitness assessment which measured metrics such as blood pressure and bicep strength the better the fitness score the higher the bonus as much as &# if they take the test twice a year and get high marks toward the end of parents started complaining at task force meetings that their children were coming home hungry one parent criticized the group for making unilateral decisions without involving the community "my kids are in every sport there is " says parent mary lou gladson who attended one of the meetings "but they arent big fruit and vegetable eaters my kids were getting the short end of the stick because of the obese kids " even determining who is overweight has proven nettlesome nine year old jeremy holwell who attends lakeview elementary swims in a local league several nights a week and plays baseball in the summer gesturing to his spiderman theme room littered with dozens of swimming ribbons and pentathlon trophies his mother stephanie says "i mean this kids active " in january mrs holwell noticed a fitness assessment at the bottom of his nearly straight a report card jeremy placed in the th national percentile "overweight " according to the report she asked the principal to stop including the information on jeremys report card which he agreed to do sue harter the districts director of food service says the strictures are becoming overly specific snacks sold during the school day can contain no more than seven grams of fat no more than two grams of saturated fat and no more than grams of sugar with a few exceptions that means no french fries tater tots or twinkies ms harter was fine with that but has balked at a proposal to take away other offerings including beef jerky and baked chips "i feel that kids junior high and up should be able to make choices " she says talking about the districts campaign is hard for ms harter "i was a chunky kid ive always struggled with my weight " she says tears welling up "here i am the director of food service and im overweight " because the new focus on faculty health "it gives you a feeling of insecurity " she says dr fall says that beyond a few negative comments he doesnt think there has been much public opposition in any case the importance of the program "outweighs any temporary hurt feelings " he says "the kids know theyre overweight they dont want to be overweight they dont want to be unhappy " this school year dr fall intensified his efforts by december parents of children in grades three through six had received a letter offering a childrens health evaluation and a related fitness program mike miller a physical education teacher hired to run the healthy schools initiatives asked pe teachers to recommend students who might benefit from the program which would be held after school jim coca a physical education instructor at wagonwheel elementary says he reluctantly gave about names to mr miller based on the kids with the lowest fitness scores "i would have rather seen all the kids get a letter " he says "make it available to everyone and youve hurt nobody " a fifth grade girl approached mr coca after noticing the letter addressed to her parents on the kitchen table "mr coca do you think im fat " he recalls her asking "i knew it hurt our relationship a little bit she had never thought that she was heavy " next year mr coca says he wont give names hell send the fitness data to mr miller and ask him to pick mr miller says the pe teachers "would be the better ones to assess kids " but he says hell use the raw data if necessary "it will be obvious to us from the bmi and fitness scores if the kids at risk " of nearly letters that went out to families only parents made an appointment they were invited to a "strong kids club" exercise group that meets after school at a local recreation center three times a week erin wiley the assessment programs coordinator is an enthusiastic ponytailed year old who leads third to sixth graders in an hour of exercises on a recent tuesday after teaching eight kids a leg exercise using resistance cords she wound down the session with a series of yoga poses named after animals cobra swan downward dog cat and cow "how much more of these are we going to do " whined seven year old ryan quintana a second grader from pronghorn elementary school who suffers from asthma "its a whole series " said ms wiley "want to see volcano " many of the families say the assessments and classes which are free have helped their kids ryan for example was always bigger than his peers in his class but seemed unaware of it until recently "i noticed him saying this shirt makes my belly look big while getting dressed " says his mother jaime "we realized he needs to lose weight " he has been attending classes three times a week since the fall he used to dread gym now says his father robert "he talks about how fast he was i dont think hes flash gordon by any means but hes come a long way " by the time of his follow up assessment ryan had grown an inch to feet inches and had lost two pounds to he went from a high "body composition " a measure of body fat to average his fitness level rose from "fair" to "average " before pe class was "too hard for me " ryan says "i had to take my inhaler " now he says it is "not so scary " faith rudland is a year old fifth grader at conestoga elementary who also attends the fitness classes when her mother heather received the invitation letter she was relieved to be getting some help "its not like im blind " mrs rudland says the family had sought the advice of doctors and dieticians to bring down faiths weight but nothing worked one said to watch sodium intake another said she would grow into her weight when faith started the strong kids club she weighed pounds now she weighs "its a learning process for me too " says mrs rudland who has cut back on hamburger helper and now stocks the fridge with fruit and vegetables faith says the classes "make my life a lot better " she now doesnt get as winded when she runs and earns higher marks in pe for other families the program is an unwelcome intrusion brittany burns "has been a big kid since she was little " says mrs story her mother "were a big boned family as is a lot of wyoming its a meat and potatoes state " she says later she prepares a dinner of exactly that when her husband and brother in law come home from the mines their faces and hands black with grime mrs story says that when the letter came she decided to give the program a chance she took her daughter who attends lakeview elementary to an assessment brittany started writing down what she ate by the end of the week her enthusiasm flagged she never went back for a follow up "i didnt push the issue " says mrs story "i didnt want her to think i saw her the same way these people saw her "
