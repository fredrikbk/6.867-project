abn attracts another suitor europe bank trio seeks talks that might lead to higher bid breakup a trio of europes biggest banks barged into what would be the largest banking deal ever asking to enter talks with dutch bank abn amro holding nv a move that would break up its negotiations on an estimated &# billion deal with barclays plc the move by the three the united kingdoms royal bank of scotland group plc spains banco santander central hispano sa and dutch belgian concern fortis nv could open the door to a &# billion deal under which abn would be chopped into pieces according to people familiar with the situation and a statement late friday by abn the trio said they had delivered a letter to abns board and management requesting exploratory talks it is expected that a joint bid would easily top the potential bid from barclays which has been in its own negotiations to buy abn since last month abn which has employees and operates in the u s europe latin america and asia has struggled mightily in recent years to tie together its far flung operations which extend to countries chief executive rijkman groenink has fought a breakup of the bank one of europes aristocratic firms with roots dating to the three banks are asking for an opportunity to see abns books said people familiar with the letter under the plan being considered by the consortium rbs would take over abns u s retail bank lasalle and abns wholesale bank in london abns assets in brazil and likely italy would go to santander while fortis would acquire abns retail operations in the netherlands abn shares have risen in amsterdam trading since march the last trading day before the talks with barclays became public in amsterdam friday abn shares rose to euros &# apiece that price is considered toward the top end of what barclays might offer abn said in a statement that its two tiered corporate structure its supervisory board which acts as a board of directors and its managing board which handles day to day operations "will consider the letter carefully in line with their responsibilities " recently the supervisory board whose chairman is u s businessman arthur martinez hired goldman sachs group inc as an adviser in their own statement fortis rbs and santander said they hope to move discussions forward although there was no certainty that they would lead to a transaction "the banks have requested access to the same due diligence information given to barclays " the statement said the consortium is being advised by merrill lynch &amp co a barclays spokesman declined to comment the potential for bids from all of the banks pits europes brightest banking minds against each other barclayss john varley a lawyerly upper crust englishman and abns mr groenink had over a series of meetings worked toward structuring a combined bank now interlopers including tough rbs chief executive officer fred goodwin santander chairman emilio botin and fortis ceo jean paul votron a former citigroup inc executive are looking to block that mr goodwin has expertise in bidding battles having won the fight for the u k s national westminster bank in in the biggest merger in british banking history messrs goodwin and botin and their banks have shared cross shareholding pacts in the past to be sure consortium bids in banking are largely unheard of and would depend on meeting a number of difficult regulatory and financing hurdles it isnt clear for example how abn investors would be paid for their shares and whether they might end up with a basket of stocks from the three banks one idea is that abn shareholders would be paid with a large cash outlay and shares from one of the three banks abn investors might opt for a simpler offer from barclays barclays which is expected to offer stock with some cash is likely to counter that it has a road map that will be easy for abn investors to understand there remains the likelihood though slight that an american bidder could emerge according to people familiar with the situation the trio plans to present their potential offer as a friendly one that would benefit abns shareholders the most while putting its far flung assets to their best use the three for example are expected to show that by fortis buying abns dutch operations the netherlands will retain a dutch bank champion the idea of a joint bid was supported in a march report by financial investment firm keefe bruyette &amp woods which argued that a bid by rbs and santander would lead to better overlap and a higher offer than one from barclays barclays has itself been working toward a number of concessions to appease dutch regulators and investors including putting the combined banks head office in amsterdam and allowing dutch bank regulators to oversee the combined entity pressure on mr groenink to make wholesale changes at abn increased in february when a london hedge fund sent a letter to messrs martinez and groenink saying abn shareholders would benefit most if abn would pursue moves that included selling or breaking up abn that hedge fund the childrens investment fund management llp said friday it welcomed the exploratory talks and said it viewed them as a friendly approach barclays and abn said on march that they had been working toward a deal but structuring how the bank would be regulated and taxed has been a challenge according to people familiar with the situation
