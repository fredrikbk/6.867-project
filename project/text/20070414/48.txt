pursuits entertainment &amp culture morgenstern on movies the gift of thieves finally on dvd thieves like us is a window into altmans art with no more fanfare than a couple of paragraphs in an accompanying press release a dvd of "thieves like us" arrived by messenger the other day you wait long enough and everything happens this half forgotten treasure from the s was the last holdout among robert altmans most important films the only one that hadnt made it to dvd now its scheduled to hit the stores on tuesday less than five months after altmans death what this startling apparition evokes for me is an alternate version of the scene when the hand thrusts up from the grave at the end of "carrie " instead of grabbing scarily the hand is giving a lovely gift altman made "thieves like us" in in mississippi on a minuscule budget with a small crew the first half of that decade was his golden age in the space of five years he turned out five matchless features "m a s h " "mccabe &amp mrs miller " "the long goodbye " "thieves like us" and "nashville " during those same five years he also managed to make "brewster mccloud " "images" and the flawed but remarkable "california split " which was another late arrival to dvd it came out in and why did "thieves like us" take so long id always assumed the obstacle was music rights which was the problem with "california split " but no the reason is once you strip away the corporate speak that the relevant studios and entities simply hadnt gotten around to it maybe the delicate nature of the film invited neglect unlike "bonnie and clyde " which had electrified the movie world seven years before with a similar story of depression era bank robbers on the run "thieves like us" is often tender wry or elegiac and for the most part leisurely its larcenous trio newly escaped from prison starts out on the meander "bonnie and clyde" was revolutionary in its lyrical portrayal of violence and its characters enchantment with their own celebrity "thieves like us" seems more conventional at first altman and his marvelously subtle cameraman jean boffety evoke the lonely simplicity of the american south in the s with soft images that are sometimes diffused into gauziness by screen doors or dirty flivver windshields the quality of the dvd transfer is excellent and with radio shows that like train whistles pierce the haunting silence a doomed romance between keechie a wrenchingly plain and winsome girl played by shelley duvall and the youngest of the three robbers keith carradines bowie is narrated in part by a reedy radio version of "romeo and juliet" from the american school of the air bowies confederates chicamaw and t dub are played by altman regulars john schuck and bert remsen still altman had more on his mind than poetic nostalgia much of "thieves like us" is very funny these criminals are childish goofily naive and not terrifically smart but one of them is a violent brute another is a heedless fool and the most benign of the three bowie is sweetly endearing keith carradine gives a beautiful performance that looks casually tossed off but also a young man of gauzy morality bowies soul is the movies soul hes a child of the great depression a dreamy drifter in a dirt poor world that doesnt make sharp distinctions between right and wrong when altman died i wrote an appreciation of his work as did many others whod been changed taught and nourished by it the release of "thieves like us" gives me a chance to mention the very special appreciation that one of robert altmans peers martin scorsese delivered last month at a memorial for the late filmmaker in los angeles mr scorsese honored the great robert altman films to be sure but he spoke of other things too of how altman had "his own unique brush stroke " so that voices faces gestures even the weather "were like colors on his palette " of how well he used long lenses "i loved his use of long lenses " scorsese said "i cant use a long lens i dont know how i dont know why i just dont but the way he used them is extraordinary i marvel at his use of the zoom lens when everybody was using it as a toy in bobs films as in akira kurosawas films the long lens is powerful expressive and magical " "thieves like us" is a perfect case in point perhaps most movingly scorsese praised altmans persistence in getting films made whether the movie industry welcomed him or not "he plowed ahead he shot in super he shot adaptations of plays he did television he did wonderful work in europe with vincent &amp theo " and that "journeyman period " as scorsese called it "gave him more drive to get back somehow into the system to steal his way into the system really which is what he did in with that wonderful film the player breaking in like a guerrilla fighter or a bandit " in the turbulent present a time of thwarted ambitions and truncated careers for many talented filmmakers persistence is the stuff of heroes morgensterns picks altmans heirs robert altman was a filmmakers filmmaker in various ways by encouraging inspiring or producing other peoples movies as well as his own he advanced the cause of independent film here are three of his direct or indirect descendants one alas is available only on vhs choose me insufficiently appreciated if not entirely unsung this intricate romantic comedy is one of the quirkiest most enjoyable films of its decade and a provocative primer on sexual politics genevieve bujold is dr nancy love a radio talk show host who cant deal with people in the flesh lesley ann warren is an uninhibited bar owner and keith carradines seductive mickey sounds like a pathological liar alan rudolph one of altmans proteges directed from his own extremely original script the noirish mood is set and sustained by teddy pendergrasss songs the late show robert benton wrote and directed this one of a kind noir comedy which robert altman produced in art carney gives a memorable performance and a touching one as an aging private eye ira wells ira who is not in the bloom of health gets himself into all sorts of trouble after meeting lily tomlins screwball hippie margo and agreeing to help her find her cat the superb cast includes howard duff bill macy not to be confused with william h macy joanna cassidy and eugene roche charles rosher jr did the stylish cinematography old boyfriends this
