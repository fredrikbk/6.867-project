citis new math can pandit deal add to profit old land purchase is raising eyebrows as it presents risky bet is vikram pandit worth it financial services giant citigroup inc yesterday unveiled its acquisition of old lane partners lp a hedge fund with &# billion in assets under management and headed by mr pandit a former top executive at morgan stanley citi didnt reveal terms but people familiar with the matter say it could end up paying close to &# million the hefty price tag immediately raised eyebrows since old lane is relatively small and untested opening its doors in late citi moved quickly to deflect criticism by having a parade of top officials to explain the move chairman and chief executive charles prince referred to the deal as "an investment as much as it is an acquisition " referring to "world class talent" of mr pandit and his colleagues robert rubin the former treasury secretary who serves as chairman of citis executive committee said the entire old lane team could move "what is already a robust business forward " and vice chairman stephen volk said mr pandit like other citi business chiefs would "help chuck think about the business as a whole " and would "interact very closely" with other divisions such as "markets and banking and wealth management " mr pandit himself said joining citi with its resources infrastructure and network is like "coming into a candy store " and will help him "create returns" for his investors mr pandit will head citigroups alternative investments division putting him in the running to become chief executive of the worlds biggest bank there is a long tradition of companies engineering acquisitions as a way to win top talent but it is a risky bet in the case of old lane it is a newcomer to the hedge fund game and has so far turned in a mediocre performance in addition by luring mr pandit and his team mr prince is risking the ire of his current cadre of capital markets executives as more executives compete for top spots wall street history doesnt offer much encouragement either in the spring of chase manhattan corp acquired beacon group llc an investment banking boutique for about &# million chases goal at the time was to bolster its own banking ranks with a roster led by beacon founder geoffrey boisi the former investment banking chief at goldman sachs &amp co two years later mr boisi left after clashing with other top bankers after chase merged with j p morgan &amp co mr boisi couldnt be reached for comment the chase purchase of beacon wound up being "a lot of money for not that many people " says mike mayo an analyst at deutsche bank ag who covers banks and brokerage firms an even more expensive swan dive was the &# billion acquisition of wasserstein perella &amp co in by dresdner bank ag an effort to boost the german firms investment banking prowess after dresdner was in turn acquired by a larger bank with less interest in a deal making build up the top wasserstein bankers all left within a few years at the moment citigroup faces a dearth of top executives with extensive wall street backgrounds and experience running traditional banking businesses mr prince is a former general counsel who worked at the elbow of sanford weill citis former chief engineering numerous acquisitions and citigroup chief operating officer robert druskin is a longtime computer systems expert with short stints running businesses charged with generating big profits with mr prince under pressure to boost earnings importing the old lane team may give him more choices "when it comes to moving management around " mr mayo said old lane also includes john havens former head of morgan stanleys stock division and guru ramakrishnan the same firms former top stock trader and several other top traders however mr mayo said the old lane executives backgrounds dont fit neatly within the banks top priorities outlined by mr prince earlier this week bolstering u s consumer business growth boosting the international share of top businesses as well as expense and credit management investors want reassurance "that they wont spend too much on it " mr mayo said the possibility of the kind of transplant rejection that occurred with mr boisi at j p morgan chase arises because the old lane stars come from the same type of business as the two prince deputies with the strongest credentials in the securities business those two executives michael klein and thomas maheras are co heads of citis global markets and banking division and themselves earned their stripes at former wall street powerhouse salomon brothers which was sold in to mr weills company the combination of the salomon bond franchise with citis big lending platform has helped make citigroup the top securities underwriter since the old lane teams experience in stocks could actually complement the salomon executives if they eventually assume wider roles at citigroup "vikram is a brilliant guy and hes got a real sense for markets and risk and an ability to lead people to the right place " says philip purcell the former morgan stanley chief executive "hed be a net plus for citi " mr pandit grew up in mumbai india and came to the u s in his mid teens after earning undergraduate and doctoral degrees from columbia university where he now serves as a trustee he was a junior finance professor at indiana university in the mid s before joining morgan stanley at the blue chip securities firm he became known for a soft spoken cerebral management style while most wall street executives are known for schmoozing mr pandit rarely appears at high profile social events though he joined a golf club in purchase n y a decade ago to support john mack the current morgan stanley ceo was a top executive at the firm then who was recruiting members he rarely plays there according to one of his colleagues in the s he oversaw the firms buildup of prime brokerage services catering to hedge funds where it remains a leading player he also pushed into electronic trading keeping pressure on the major stock exchanges to keep a lid on trading fees at the peak of the dot com bubble morgan stanley had a commanding share of online stock issues based partly on its internet analyst mary meeker but just as those results propelled mr pandit up the management ranks the bursting of the bubble strengthened the fortunes of the firms bond division mr pandit left the firm on the eve of a bruising battle waged by morgan stanley alumni who ousted mr purcell in mid he left when mr purcell promoted fixed income chief zoe cruz to be co president above him a promotion which occurred shortly after mr pandit declined to pledge his allegiance to mr purcell in the impending battle his longtime colleague mr havens soon followed mr pandit out the door along with a parade of other traders and bankers though mr pandit left quietly mr havens received a standing ovation from admiring colleagues as he walked off the trading floor another uncertainty for citigroup is the performance of old lane itself the hedge fund has the backing of the singapore investment corp and the harvard endowment but it got off to a sputtering start last year when stock markets fell in may and finished with a return of just so far this year it is up about citis current alternative investment unit has just &# billion under management with &# billion of that from citi itself it includes a &# billion private equity fund launched in january and a &# billion multi strategy hedge fund corrections &amp amplifications
