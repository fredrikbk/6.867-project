pursuits sports golf journal taking up golf at midlife how a dedicated beginner starting now can get decent by fall this is the time of year post masters cries of "fore " ringing through the suburbs when i field the most inquiries from friends and acquaintances about taking up golf typically they have played a few times over the decades a company outing here a bachelor party there and once upon a time might even have taken a lesson but for all practical purposes they are beginners determined to make this the year they finally get into the game normally i advise against it you dont have enough time i tell them and its a hard game for grown ups to learn but if they insist if i can see a certain spark in their eyes ill let them in on a secret "if youre truly serious " i say "and if youll agree to be putty in the hands of a good instructor i guarantee that by next september youll have a fine golf game one that will last you the rest of your life " conversations with a half dozen of the countrys best pga instructors confirmed my conviction "almost anyone can learn to break in five or six months even someone who has never played before " says ron stepanek head of player development for the pga of america "someone with decent hand eye coordination and any kind of athletic experience could probably be breaking " even "the worlds worst athlete" could come close to breaking in that time says marc minier the southern california pga teacher of the year out of glen annie golf club in santa barbara "but even shooting he or she would be a real golfer someone who plays fast and understands and respects the game " someone who could enjoy and make a good impression playing client golf for the rest of his career absolutely mr minier says the catch of course is what one would have to do between now and next september to reach that point it would require something like the one time total immersion required to learn a foreign language although not nearly so long and a lot more fun the criteria i proposed were a willingness to practice or play golf at least two or three times a week even minute range sessions count and a commitment from the outset to five full months of focused effort with a teacher certain techniques in golf sometimes counterintuitive are almost impossible to learn without guidance "the downfall for most students is that they come in asking for lessons that are just fixes " says jonathan gibbs the rocky mountain pga teacher of the year out of banbury golf club in eagle idaho "we can do that but they arent going to get much better in the long run because they wont fundamentally understand what they are trying to do and their minds lock up " with the guarantee of a long term relationship the teacher and student can spend the time necessary to master each fundamental in the right order before progressing if someone other than your instructor offers a tip put your thumbs in your ears waggle your fingers jump up and down and repeat "im not listening " this is particularly crucial for women whose husbands or boyfriends play golf at banbury mr gibbs offers a yearlong personal mentoring program for &# that includes a private one hour lesson each week he uses the first four lessons primarily for assessment of the students full swing short game and on course understanding of the game after that sessions are highly individualized with a specific focus for each and recommendations for between lesson practice like most of the instructors i spoke with mr gibbs says committed beginners make the fastest progress because they have the least to unlearn "the earlier in your golf journey you can get the look and feel of correct impact the better off youll be " says bob baldassari who directs a program at cannon ridge golf club in fredericksburg va called which works to get students shooting in the s within six months designed by former pga tour commissioner deane beman the program costs only &# for eight weekly lessons in groups of no more than four including the use of clubs beginners start with putting and chipping and once they understand what well hit shots feel like at that level build up to full swing shots working from the short game out was the approach recommended by three of the six instructors i consulted now in its fourth year the program emphasizes on course manners and customs as much as mechanics and has seen good results after weeks a handful of beginners are usually able to break after six months nearly everyone can or is close and more importantly feel very comfortable on the golf course women do as well as men rely on word of mouth to find an instructor its usually not hard to identify the four or five best ones in your area schedule a trial lesson talk about your goals and if you hit it off rapport in a long term relationship is vital dive in long haul programs like arent common but most pros will be delighted to design one for you and usually will offer a discount on their regular lesson rates in exchange for the long term commitment mr minier suggests signing up with a friend as a way both to save some money and to stay motivated after six months unless you plan to go on tour youll probably be done with lessons except for the occasional brush up "a lot of golfers are overlessoned they want someone to tell them what to do " says hank gardner the director of instruction at whisper rock golf club in scottsdale ariz and the southwest pga teacher of the year "but a curious student who asks lots of questions can learn to self analyze his flaws and make corrections once you really get to know your own game youre set for life " email me at golfjournal wsj com
