cox defends pre approved sec fines as speeding cases lifting penalties washington chairman christopher cox defended the securities and exchange commissions new approach to settling enforcement cases that involve corporate fines saying it should help speed negotiations with companies and might produce higher penalties mr cox said that under the new process in place since jan the five member commission preapproves penalties to be paid by public companies previously sec enforcement lawyers negotiated penalties and other settlement terms and then sought commissioners approval critics of the new policy say it will slow settlement talks by introducing more red tape addressing the mutual fund directors forum mr cox said that wasnt the case "commission review of enforcement actions shouldnt slow down the process " he said he said cases subject to the new process will be put on a fast track allowing commissioners to sign off on them individually rather than meeting as a group to approve them he also said that pre approval of penalties will affect "a very small number of cases " and that the process was discussed "for many months" before being put in place this year and will be tested "indefinitely " mr cox who confirmed accounts published friday by the washington post and bloomberg news said preapproval isnt intended to influence penalties and predicted that if anything fines on companies "will be stiffer" as a result of the change because the secs staff will be in "the strongest negotiating position" going into settlement discussions more fairness and consistency in fining public companies should be another benefit from the new approach he added
