white house probes more lost emails washington the white house already under pressure to explain missing emails from officials using a republican party system says it is investigating reports that many more emails might have been deleted from its own system a white house spokeswoman said it is possible that several million emails could have been erased "i wouldnt rule out that there were a potential five million emails lost " said deputy press secretary dana perino she added however that "there was no intent to have lost them " the allegation was first raised thursday by citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington a watchdog group that said it received information from sources including a former administration official crew wouldnt identify them but its executive director melanie sloan said that in the white house realized that emails for hundreds of days over years were missing the problem apparently related to the conversion from one software system to another in the early years of president bushs tenure the presidential records act requires each administration to maintain an adequate record of its actions and deliberations and preserve them for history relevant emails are supposed to be archived but white house officials raised particular concerns about the lost emails according to crew because the loss meant that some emails relevant to the cia leak investigation might not have been provided to special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald a january letter from mr fitzgerald suggests there were problems with the white house email archiving system "we have learned that not all email of the office of the vice president and the executive office of the president for certain time periods in was preserved through the normal archiving process on the white house computer system " mr fitzgerald wrote in the letter to lawyers for i lewis "scooter" libby the former vice presidential aide who ultimately was indicted and convicted for lying to the grand jury mr libbys lawyers were trying to obtain possible evidence in the case the white house has conceded that many emails from on a separate republican national committee system that likely related to official administration business were deleted by the rnc those emails were being sent and received by white house political officials through accounts maintained by the rnc the white house has said the rnc emails relating to official business should have been archived just as white house emails should be democrats are investigating the use of the unofficial accounts and have raised particular concerns about political aide karl roves use of his account even after the rnc made changes in to preserve his emails they continued to be deleted for a time while mr fitzgerald and others were investigating the cia leak case the activities of jailed republican lobbyist jack abramoff and other matters meanwhile the white house explanation that some officials simply didnt understand the administrations policy appeared to be undermined people familiar with the matter said the manual in effect in recent years states that email relating to official business received on a white house employees personal account should be printed out and preserved or forwarded to the persons white house account
