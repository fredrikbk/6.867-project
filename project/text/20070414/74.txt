the week ahead our take on coming events law gonzales senate testimony could be his last chance by evan perez defendants questioned by the justice department have the presumption of innocence attorney general alberto gonzales doesnt benefit from such presumption as he makes what may be one last effort to save his job in testifying about the firings of eight u s attorneys before the senate judiciary committee on tuesday isolated from the rest of his department as he tries to fix a political mess that has buffeted morale among prosecutors mr gonzales is further handicapped by the fact he has been abandoned by the white houses political muscle bush administration officials and republicans on capitol hill have telegraphed the message that mr gonzales alone can save himself after fumbling explanations of the firings to congress the year old lawyer has been cornered into the position where his best argument to try to remain in office is to claim the firings were a result of his mismanagement of the justice department and not the result of a political plot to target prosecutors who werent following partisan orders democrats and republicans in congress expect mr gonzales to begin his testimony with an apology and by more fully taking the blame for mishandling the firings his televised news conference in march fell flat in part because he compared himself to a corporate chief executive in taking responsibility for the handling of the firings but he then he offloaded much of the blame to kyle sampson who resigned as chief of staff when the department turned up emails showing him orchestrating the dismissals for more than a year and contradicting earlier congressional testimony from top justice officials on friday a new batch of emails released by justice included one dated january from mr sampson mentioning names of possible replacements for u s attorneys targeted for dismissal democrats cited it as contradicting mr sampsons march senate hearing testimony mr sampson stood by his testimony said one of his attorneys adding "in december when the seven u s attorneys were asked to step down no specific candidate had been selected to replace any of them and kyle had none in mind " an administration official says mr gonzaless aides have walled him off from other senior justice and administration officials in an effort to make sure the department isnt accused of coaching answers and perhaps worsening the political uproar but some justice officials believe the tactic could end up hurting mr gonzaless preparations denying him the skills of some of the administrations most politically expert officials sen charles schumer d n y who has led the aggressive questioning of mr gonzales and other justice officials has already decided that mr gonzales must go amid suspicions that partisan designs were at work in the firings sen jon kyl r ariz told abcs "this week" that mr gonzales bears the burden "to be able to i guess try to prove a negative although it ought to be the burden of those congressmen who disagree with the president to prove that there was nothing in the firings involving political corruption cases " the depth of skepticism facing mr gonzales is summed up by sen arlen specter r pa his partys highest ranking member on the judiciary panel investigating the firings "im not prepared to make a judgment on whether the attorney general should stay or go i want to see him eyeball to eyeball at that witness stand and have a chance to ask him questions " technology investors gauge yahoos ad system revamp by kevin j delaney yahoo inc named a major overhaul of its online advertising systems after the panama canal investors hope for some insight tuesday into whether the upgrade is leading the internet company to smoother waters chief among their preoccupations is whether the online ad system improvements made partly in hopes of bridging the gap with rival google inc are leading advertisers to spend more money with yahoo yahoo sunnyvale calif said in january that it didnt anticipate any revenue impact from the improvements until the second quarter a comment that some expect the company to reiterate when it

advertisers like panama despite some frustration particularly among small businesses with the hassle of shifting over to a new system yahoo in early february altered the way its web search ads are sold changing from a straight auction system to one like googles that weighs other factors besides advertiser bids in choosing which ads to display and what to charge among other things such a modified auction system displays more prominently ads that users click on often an arrangement that can increase yahoos revenue because advertisers pay only when a user clicks analysts say that for some big brand name advertisers the panama search ad upgrade is improving the financial return on what they spend with yahoo the search ads are "more effective getting more people clicking on them and therefore im spending more money " says paula drum vice president of marketing at h&amp r block inc the kansas city financial and tax services company based on similar feedback goldman sachs analysts recently raised their yahoo revenue estimates to reflect a benefit from panama beginning in the first quarter of research firm emarketer inc estimates that yahoos search advertising will rise about this year to &# billion when certain payments to partners are factored out that would be a big improvement from a increase last year "its doing a turnaround " says emarketer senior analyst david hallerman some analysts caution that the panama tweaking of yahoos search ad auction will go only so far to boost revenue particularly if yahoo doesnt greatly expand the volume of search queries that it handles and can use to place ads yahoos share of the u s search market was in the first quarter essentially flat from the fourth quarter of according to majestic research corp and comscore networks inc that compares with googles share in the first quarter there are signs that yahoo is making progress in this area the company is finalizing a major deal that would have newspaper partners use its
