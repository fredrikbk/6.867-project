the buzz marketwatch weekend investor even the seemingly well off caught easy borrowing virus you may have seen that lendingtree commercial with a happy go lucky guy named stanley johnson who brags about his big house his new car and how "i even belong to the local golf club how do i do it " he continues with a big dumb smile "im in debt up to my eyeballs " lowering his voice but still smiling he adds "i can barely pay my finance charges " the smile doesnt leave his face as he drives a riding lawn mower saying "somebody help me " thanks to easy credit many americans have been living well beyond their means but that credit picture is beginning to change and when you think about where the u s economy might be a quarter or two from now you have to wonder how many stanley johnsons are out there this isnt the stereotypical subprime borrower with a spotty credit history and low credit score but instead people perceived by friends and neighbors to be living the good life some even sporting good credit scores with the mortgage markets tightening especially as certain types of adjustable rate mortgages face a wave of forced refinancings we will know soon enough for a preview all you really need to do is check with someone like r douglas ley a certified public accountant and certified financial planner in macungie pa many of his clients live in a wealthy part of new jersey few get a closer peek into what is really going on than people like mr ley who do taxes as i recently quoted him in a marketwatch column as saying "i am shocked by the bad and deteriorating financial condition of many of my clients " he wasnt referring simply to the "careless tapping" of home equity loans as though they were atms with a bottomless pit or the extensive use of credit cards while paying only the minimum payment more disturbing he says is how some clients have perilously little in taxes withheld by their employers but then wind up with a sharply higher tax hit at year end because they have resorted to tapping their k s or individual retirement accounts for living expenses such moves trigger a tax penalty for early withdrawal "two of my clients had to sell their homes last spring to cover their liabilities some big numbers these clients had adjusted gross incomes in excess of &# at least they were lucky because the housing market was firmer a year ago " he says of course these are merely anecdotes still such stories suggest there are more stanley johnsons among us than we may think there are plenty of people who are doing just fine in fact it appears based on reports from some cpas that many who created wealth in recent years through wise investments or high paying jobs still are genuinely wealthy but it is the tales of trouble that resonate for anybody trying to figure out whether the equity in overinflated homes really was a large driver of the economy in the past few years based on conversations with cpas mortgage brokers financial planners and others from all parts of this country there is little doubt it played an important role no region is better represented with ready to tell stories than orange county calif that is where until donald parker owned a large insurance agency he recalls how low mortgage rates spurred business in late with refinancings and home equity lines of credit that required proof of insurance "it really became excessive by the summer of " he says "thats when i started noticing that many of my clients had either refinanced or added a second mortgage or home equity line of credit multiple times within the prior three years often doubling or in some cases tripling their mortgage balances " he adds that it wasnt the expansion of mortgage balances that was so alarming "it was all the new expensive cars being purchased and added on to their auto insurance " he says "often people were calling to replace a honda accord with a new bmw or mercedes we were also receiving a lot of phone calls from our customers asking coverage questions for instance is my new rolex watch covered if i lose it on vacation in hawaii " if cpas and insurance agents are among the first to spot the problems while they are occurring divorce attorneys like bruce hughes also of orange county are among the first to see the actual fallout "we see it as it happens " he says "from industry to industry over the years they come in groups when various industries go through turmoil now its real estates turn i cant tell you how many mortgage brokers builders developers and others associated with the building industry have come in for a divorce in the past six months and its increasing " those not associated with real estate but hurt by the false sense of financial security because of it are no doubt next calling stanley
