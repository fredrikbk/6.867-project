europes hostage lesson in separate incidents italy and britain bent in recent days to secure the freedom of hostages held by islamic extremists both governments are now paying the political price the story of italian journalist daniele mastrogiacomo a reporter for la repubblica kidnapped last month by the taliban is a textbook example of what happens when you cave in to terrorism rome pressured the afghans to release five taliban prisoners to spring mr mastrogiacomo in turn his afghan driver was beheaded and his translator had his throat cut by the taliban when kabul didnt bow to additional demands heartened by italys willingness to play along the taliban will doubtless try again putting more lives at risk italys center right opposition which while in office itself paid richly to ransom italian hostages in iraq this week criticized the government of prime minister romano prodi for its handling of the mastrogiacomo case foreign minister massimo dalema was grilled in parliament thursday about his governments policies on abductions abroad second thoughts are welcome even when they come too late britain didnt pay any ransom much less officially negotiate in its standoff with iran over the royal navy sailors and marines captured in the persian gulf but tony blairs "measured approach firm but calm" first cheered by the media now seen by many as overly accommodating left behind a bad taste thats the proper background to the "cash for stories" scandal that broke out when the released captives were allowed to sell their accounts to british media defense minister des browne reversed himself fast on that decision after two seamen gave paid interviews and mr blair yesterday said no one would be canned for giving the original green light but public frustration at the apparent disgrace of the royal navy in letting iran capture then parade its seamen has found a scapegoat soldiers personally profiting from their ordeal with the governments initial approval mr brownes job remains in jeopardy the real culprit here is a rogue regime in tehran that flagrantly violated international law also to blame were the soft bellies of britains european allies and a media horde calling for compromise with tehran at all costs mr blair normally an antiterror stalwart didnt help this time by emphasizing that the "first priority" was bringing the sailors home safely politicians are paid to take tough decisions and their "first priority" is supposed to be to safeguard national security and interests soldiers particularly in a volunteer army understand that italian and british leaders fell short by not standing up firmly to terrorist blackmail and are suffering the political consequences
