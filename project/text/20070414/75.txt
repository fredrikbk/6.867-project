the weekend interview with mark hurd the un carly in a company haunted by ghosts hewlett packard may have found its savior in a man who doesnt have much fear of them its a friday afternoon in silicon valley and the hallways of the companys corporate headquarters in palo alto calif are nearly deserted if the long week of shareholder and board meetings hasnt sent h pers home early the spectacular warm weather blue skies and fruit tree blossoms have i wait under a mural of bill hewlett and dave packard for a secretary to take me up to the executive offices after she arrives we walk down the long main hallway and i point out accent lights illuminating a bare wall for more than a decade that was where a rotating art exhibition was hung what happened to it the secretary shrugs at the questions and answers "carly " with no elaboration accurate or not it is the standard employee shorthand for h ps recent and unhappy past those are the ghosts that hover around mark hurd on the one side there are bill and dave the patron saints of silicon valley two of the greatest and most enlightened business executives in history and among the most successful on the other is carly fiorina mr hurds immediate predecessor the superstar ceo who latched onto the h p legacy while trying to escape the legendary "h p way" and went down in flames after company employees alumni and ultimately h p directors turned on her when mr hurd was hired two years after a successful tenure as chief executive at ncr corporation where he tripled the value of that companys stock his arrival was met both with relief at last a return to normalcy at h p and dismay whats an outsider doing taking over the most "family" of tech companies in the most insular of business communities but almost from the first day mr hurd proved sure footed in large part because of his pragmatic unsentimental personality he also immediately hit the road to hear from thousands of h pers he abandoned many of ms fiorinas radical organizational schemes and went back to a simple reporting structure based on product families he returned h p to what he calls the basic "blocking and tackling" of getting products out on time improving quality and service and increasing profit margins but perhaps the most important thing mark hurd did was to just shut up and work like a family that had just suffered through a painful crisis h p needed peace and quiet time to heal its wounds and focus on business it was the right decision though the companys stock took a long time to reflect the change h p in the months that followed seemed to find itself again the famous company culture though still a shrunken version of its former self proved resilient enough to weather one more big lay off six months after mr hurds arrival and then last summer the spying scandal that included accusations of snooping on a reporter for this newspaper that engulfed h ps board of directors in particular chairman patricia dunn meanwhile as the world slowly began to notice hewlett packards business was on fire thanks to new government regulations such as sarbanes oxley and the resulting shortage of new company ipos this has been one of those rare tech booms driven by large corporations not entrepreneurs and h p has so far proven to be the big winner even as once invincible competitors such as dell and partners such as microsoft and intel stumbled hewlett packard under mr hurd seemed to pick up speed only in the last few months has the magnitude of this turnaround become apparent h p is once again a media darling but mark hurd remains characteristically tight lipped we met in h ps board room where dave and bill presided in their final years with the company but if there were ghosts in the room they quickly faded as mr hurd strode in on the balls of his feet shook my hand "hey how are you " flung open the outside doors to let in the warm breeze and plopped down into a chair "boy its been a long week" fortune ceos seem to come in two forms patricians and tough guys mark hurd is the latter he speaks with a flat midwestern voice with little artifice or embroidery his sentences littered with business buzzwords infrastructure and leverage are two of his favorites and technical terms his words are measured especially with a journalist and he often stops halfway through a sentence and starts a new one that better serves his message yet despite this self control mark hurd also bristles with nervous energy and often straightens his tie or unbuttons and rebuttons his suit jacket a dozen times in as many minutes like someone whod rather be doing anything but sitting in a chair and talking if hes tired on this day mr hurd is also happy hes coming off one of the best few weeks of his professional career at the end of february h p announced that not only were its quarterly profits up from the year before but that company revenues were on track to perhaps touch &# billion a pinnacle never before reached by a technology company equally impressive h ps solid growth came from strong sales nearly across the board from pcs notebook sales were up to enterprise computing to printers h p products have been hot and with this strong performance came other good news h p shareholders recently defeated efforts to impose a new system for nominating members of the board of directors the board has also voted to buy back &# billion of company shares which would not only offset employee stock options but also reward shareholders and the day before we met a superior court judge in san jose dismissed all charges against ex chairman dunn i ask mr hurd if h p feels vindicated over the dunn ruling or just relieved his voice drops almost to a whisper "i think that regardless of what the legal decisions are no one felt good about this we had leaks coming from our board those were clearly unacceptable and they needed to be dealt with at the same time it doesnt excuse the fact that we had a sloppy investigation whether legal or not we have a higher standard than legal so regardless what happened this week were going to get this right " then he adds "were going to be a company people can be proud of in the future " this last aside captures a change in mark hurd regarding hewlett packard and its culture two years ago when asked about the h p way he was polite but also seemed skeptical thats changed these days when mr hurd talks about h p its now "we " and he has become very decisive about what is best for the company and his fellow employees for example when asked why after the great quarterly revenues announcement h p didnt also trumpet the fact that it has passed ibm as the largest information company in the world perhaps in history mr hurd replies "i dont think its h p style to go out and talk about that our history is to talk about technology what we do for customers the revenues are just the result so we consciously decided that wasnt something that needed to be brought up " shades of hewlett packard circa mr hurds remark is so characteristic of the two founders that one can only assume that he has lost some of his early doubts about the h p way does he think he understands it now he answers with a visible awe "ive been here for two years and gotten the chance to talk to tens of thousands of employees and ex hpers and i think im beginning to ive read packards book the hp way a number of times and ive come to realize that a fallacy developed that when we have issues at h p they somehow shouldnt be confronted but thats just ridiculous its a misreading of the past when things were an issue at the old h p they got fixed the crucial difference from most other companies was the way they got fixed and thats what were trying to do again today "its the little things that matter for example we recently redid our pension plan and we got a big financial gain out of it a lot of money well we turned right around and gave it back to the employees in an early retirement program im not saying another company wouldnt do that but it is certainly something that h p would do "but its hard to explain it much more than that ive come to think of the h p way as you would any family and how it works together how it behaves its not always the easiest thing to describe but if youre part of that family you just know " and when he doesnt know mr hurd at least knows where to look in that giant repository of corporate institutional memory called the hp alumni association now more than strong unlike his predecessor mr hurd has assiduously courted the hp alumni "i think theyre our biggest fan club and we want them to be our biggest fan club theyll do almost anything to help us so we work with them to make sure theyre up to date on our products and we open employee purchase activities to them " earlier the week we met mr hurd had addressed the local alumni chapter and returned to his office to find emails full of suggestions h p now has a web portal for alums enabling them to see company broadcasts "this group is a huge asset for us they have become our brand ambassadors and we want to bring them even closer to the company " if all of this talk about the h p family suggests soft heartedness one needs only to bring up financial matters and the tough guy ceo reappears bring up wall streets concern about h ps slipping profit margins and mr hurd reiterates his recent public pronouncement that h ps cost structure is too high and proceeds to explain how he intends to reduce it "my view is that revenues minus operating profit equals cost and by that definition we have a lot of cost the level of integration of the company thanks to acquisitions needs work our processes need work things as simple as our information technology infrastructure need work sometimes that even means we have to invest more money now to save more later " as for the suggestion that h p has been living too much on mature products and industries instead of its traditional strategy of competing on innovation mr hurd argues that this is a misreading of the companys efforts he notes that h p is one of the last big companies actually doing basic research "the r not just the d in r&amp d" and that hp labs important contributions in everything from web applications to green technology are either largely hidden or just now coming to the surface mr hurd points to h ps new mediasmart hdtv which can receive entertainment directly from a pc as a glimpse of where the company is headed "to integrate content across the home whether its emanating from the web from satellites from cable or the pc and bring that to the consumers touch " he catches himself "ive probably just told you more than i should have " and rephrases "we are a technology company at our core and we will stay that way " all of this hard work turning around a beloved but troubled corporate giant mr hurd admits hasnt given him much time to socialize in silicon valley does he ever feel like a stranger in a strange company and an even stranger town no insists mr hurd "i can remember the afternoon i left dayton ohio like it was yesterday i landed here at p m and from the minute i got here i felt great i cant really explain it to you and it sounds kind of corny but while h p is a silicon valley company it has lots of midwestern roots and values and its such a friendly place i felt at home the minute i got here "as for silicon valley what has been difficult to get used to is the fact that your partners and competitors are right next door and the same time theres this interesting collegiality even among competitors that supports the whole system of the valley and thats really been different for me but pretty cool to be part of " mr hurd chuckles "also this is a great place to be if youre a tennis player i played in college and this place is loaded with old washed up tennis players just like me " and the ghosts mark hurd may not be afraid of them but that doesnt mean he ignores them "dave packard once said that talking with successful people is a great way to learn about what it takes to be successful but not to bank on them helping you be successful in the future he was right we cant live in the past at hewlett packard we want to be on the news channel not the history channel " mr malone is author of "bill &amp dave how hewlett and packard built the worlds greatest company " published this month by portfolio
