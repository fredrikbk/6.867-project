pursuits books the evolving idea of beauty only a promise of happiness by alexander nehamas princeton pages &# in my experience students are troubled by beauty not so much the concept but the word itself they will scrupulously avoid calling anything "beautiful" unless there is no way around it in which case they take refuge behind that unloveliest of euphemisms "aesthetically pleasing " the diffidence is understandable to call something beautiful is not to report a fact but supposedly to divulge a feeling it is to make a value judgment of the sort that students have been conditioned to view as arbitrary and personal "aesthetically pleasing " by contrast sounds neatly objective almost scientific it is an oddity of our cultural moment that beauty once universally understood to be an absolute quality like truth and moral good should make us profoundly uneasy this unease is the subject of "only a promise of happiness " a handsomely illustrated essay by alexander nehamas a professor of philosophy at princeton university for mr nehamas beauty once occupied a central position in our imagination and public life the ancient philosophers he notes assigned it the highest of places the point where the conflicting interests of body and soul converged platos "phaedrus" describes how the sight of a beautiful boy could arouse a state of emotional exaltation and rapture causing the viewer to forsake all else over time plato argued the desire to possess a particular beautiful individual could lead to a "love of all the beauty of the world" and ultimately to a "longing for goodness and truth " platos association of beauty with both carnal experience and moral enlightenment is alien to modern sensibilities these days we can imagine beauty leading to ungovernable rapture but not moral goodness the modern aesthetic encounter as mr nehamas describes it is a morally neutral affair divested of ethical content and the relationship of beauty to physical desire and love plays little part in modern aesthetic debate what is left is only the "kind of beauty to which desire seemed inappropriate the beauty in great art and the wonders of nature " in part our limited idea of beauty is the work of educators and philosophers like mr nehamas himself who have professionalized the discussion of the aesthetic and confined it to the classroom but it is also the work of freud and darwin thanks in part to their theories and the work of their scientific heirs the modern mind prefers to find materialist explanations for human behavior today aesthetic pleasure is less likely to be seen as a privileged glimpse into the veiled order of the universe than as a physiological response driven by unconscious mental forces or the imperatives of natural selection mr nehamas sets about reclaiming something of beautys lost meaning by showing how it is connected to our happiness his account is appealingly unsystematic he meanders from topic to topic treating in turn the universality of standards of beauty the relevance of criticism and even the superiority of marcel proust to herman hesse and of the television comedy "frasier" to "ally mcbeal" for that matter mr nehamas is not picky about where he finds his examples among other things he asks why manets "olympia" has come to exert such a hold on him that he would find intense pleasure in devoting several years of his life to its study "olympia " the first great art scandal of modern times looms large here when the painting was displayed in it was not the unsentimental depiction of the naked prostitute that alarmed viewers but the brazen way she made eye contact all indolence and challenge that such a work could infuriate one age and become an icon to the next fascinates mr nehamas who is drawn to works where our aesthetic and moral imaginations come into conflict he speculates about the morality for example of making beautiful photographs of refugee camps his constant reliance on art and his book is well illustrated with examples from botticelli and raphael to picasso and mapplethorpe permits mr nehamas to conduct his thought experiments with objects familiar to the reader objects that have no properties other than their appearances this is not the case with friends and lovers whose appearances seem to change as we learn more about their personalities mr nehamas spends a lot of time on this topic showing the fugitive nature of beauty when it is bound too tightly to human imagination unlike the philosophers he cites mr nehamas does not seek to provide a complete system of thought his approach is that of the seminar in which he asks pointed questions and examines possible answers would it be desirable if everyone liked the same work of art is it possible for criticism to make us fall in love with an object why has so much art of the th century expressed an impulse to "destroy beauty" when dada artists made this demand early in the century it was a ceremonial battle cry against the stultifying quasi official art of the academy but by the end of the century the demand was taken literally one thinks of the exhibition of abject art at new yorks whitney museum with its embrace of deformity and putrefaction as with seminars some of these discussions are more fruitful than others but through it all mr nehamas displays an admirable clarity of thought and language he is not always it is true a master of compression he spends several pages on the limits of critical language saying that it is necessary to read many reviews by a critic "because it is only gradually that you will come to see what he tends to like and what to expect on the basis of his judgment " mark twain put the matter more succinctly when he said that he did not trust a reviewer until he knew his "coefficient of exaggeration " in the end mr nehamas offers no great revelation by way of a payoff that it is the pursuit of happiness that constitutes happiness and that beauty offers but a "promise" of this happiness is something of a platitude still we can enjoy this book as we might the conversation of a spirited and quirky friend whose most irritating pronouncements are the ones we find ourselves mulling over with some surprise a week or two later mr lewiss latest book is "american art and architecture "
