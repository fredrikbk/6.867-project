green thumb how to sell your art tips on appraising pieces dealing with taxes my experience of peddling an andy warhol chances are at least one of the things hanging on your walls is boring you and you have no idea what to do about it trying to sell a piece of art or even simply figuring out whether it is worth anything can be intimidating if you approach galleries or fancy auction houses will they be helpful or laugh you and your art right out the door in the past few years the process of figuring all of this out has gotten significantly easier you can partly thank your digital camera a host of online appraisers with names like telepraisal inc and artbusiness com now accept photos of your work by email and zap back their opinion for &# or less per piece at the same time auction houses are increasingly willing to use photos like these to evaluate salability even charities and religious institutions use email to tell you whether donated art will work on their walls its sort of like going on the tv program "antiques roadshow" without leaving your desk in recent months my in laws downsized to a smaller and more manageable home and in the process sorted out what belongings they wanted to shed including five prints and paintings i took this as an opportunity to figure out the best way to quickly determine what a work might be worth and how to decide when it makes sense to sell swap or give away artwork turns out that plenty of historical sales data are available if you know where to look in addition gallery owners are often standing by to help so what did we have on our hands some of it my in laws remembered well their only andy warhol piece and a print by israeli artist yaacov agam others came with no paperwork no titles even the signatures and memories of the original purchase were fuzzy enough that we couldnt quite tell what it actually was i started by seeking appraisers members of industry groups like the international fine art appraisers can do thorough studies for hundreds of dollars per work given our desire for simpler estimates i got two referrals from the association of online appraisers both firms telepraisal and artbusiness com worked the same way i sent them pictures and they sent me a report back within a day or two they as with everyone else i spoke to knew up front that i was a reporter working on a story we paid for all services rendered telepraisal charges &# each less if you have a lot of art to evaluate for a report while artbusiness com levied &# apiece it too has flexible rates both dived into databases of auction prices and used other sources to come up with an estimate of fair market value the price the work would sell for at auction or retail alas of the five only the warhol seemed to have increased in value we had a pretty strong hunch that some of this stuff might not be worth much but we were surprised when telepraisal president m barden prisant unearthed a web site for a company based in longyan china that apparently reproduces the art of j roybal the painter of one of our five works among other things the web site of boya arts &amp crafts corp specifies that you can order a roybal with or without a signature you "can also propose signatures or signing methods of your desire " the site says this apparent easy availability of brand new hand painted made in china offerings made us wonder how easy it would be to sell our own work in the end our roybal was rescued by family members who agreed to hang it in their basement armed with a rough sense of the worth of the remaining pieces i then took the next step that you should always try when selling art go back to the galleries where the works were first purchased after all galleries have an interest in maintaining a market for works that they deal in each gallery we were able to locate seemed glad to hear from us "i wish more people would call when they want to sell " says fred dorfman of dorfman projects in new york who sold the warhol print back in the late s "its nice to be able to buy back inventory or resell something where everyone makes money " unfortunately the gallery that sold the agam print was no longer open and its former owner alex rosenberg wouldnt have taken the print back even if it was agams prints "are totally out of vogue at the moment " he says if a gallery that first sold you a piece is still open and dealing in your artists work try one of three approaches ask it to buy back the work for cash request that they sell it on consignment or offer to trade your work for something else a gallery may offer cash upfront but the owner will generally try to get the lowest price possible and then resell it at a big profit with consignment a gallery might take a percentage of the sales price or use other formulas to divide the take theres no guarantee that it will succeed in selling your work either harrison galleries in vancouver british columbia which sold my in laws one of their paintings agreed to take it back on consignment the original purchase price for the work of francine gravel a canadian painter was about &# in the late s the gallery aims to sell it now for about &# and take a commission if it sells my in laws would net just over &# which seemed like a fine deal to them mr dorfman meanwhile offered &# cash for the warhol print which is about what my in laws paid for it in the late s if he were to take it on consignment hed hand over &# once it sold no matter what he sold it for with those offers in mind we approached some auction houses about selling the warhol we skipped sothebys since its recently been trying to move upscale and away from handling so many four figure items christies was discouraging too while it does sell some items lower than &# theyre usually pieces that have come in as part of much larger collection so we turned to doyle new york a smaller privatelyowned auction house that works with clients around the world the resident print expert cynthia klein had her picture and phone number on the companys web site so we called her up and then emailed a picture of the print later that day she called back turns out a print from the same series had sold for &# at auction about a year ago if ours sold at doyles fall auction for &# wed have to pay of that in commission plus at least a few hundred dollars more in other fees we would be welcome to attend the auction which seemed like fun but faced with a relatively small potential gain my in laws are now considering trying to trade the print for a different warhol they like better given the limited resale options for the agam print and a few others we decided to look into donating the works one painting was a particularly kid friendly work so i checked the web site of the new york foundling hospital found the e mail address of the person who handles donations and offered it up turns out theyd be happy to take any of our works it seemed likely that a jewish organization might want an agam and my first call to one was successful the union for reform judaism the umbrella organization for reform congregations in north america was happy to take it off our hands now we just needed to figure out what to tell the internal revenue service the irs doesnt require you to submit an appraisal with a tax return that records donations of art as long as your total combined deduction for all works you give away that year is &# or less our donations wont come near that number meanwhile art law expert ralph e lerner of sidley austin says that our email appraisals are a fine source for establishing the value of the deduction my in laws should take meanwhile if we had sold the warhol for a profit it would have come with a nasty surprise a capital gains tax almost twice what it would be for an appreciated stock "that " mr lerner notes "is really a bummer " tell ron lieber wsj com about your art adventures
