cross country marylands do nothing left baltimore democrats now enjoy a monopoly on power in this state after martin omalley swept popular republican gov robert ehrlich from office last year but despite lots of bluster the result of the new governors first legislative session is that the more radical ideas on the agenda simply didnt get done could this be a new model for democrats lots of talk aimed at the partys base only to be followed by very little substantive action once handed the responsibilities of governing mr omalley the mayor of this city for seven years is well known as a flashy glib personality and a good campaigner it was expected hed also nurse along national ambitions by pursuing an ambitious agenda during the day session in annapolis that ended this week much as house speaker nancy pelosi was to immediately put her stamp on congress the most distressing result of mr omalleys first days at least to the business community was the enactment of a "living wage" bill which will force government contractors to pay employees &# an hour in the urban baltimore washington corridor and &# in rural areas maryland is the first state to pass such a stipulation similar laws do exist in municipalities across the country and it was seen as a promise fulfilled by mr omalley to the organized labor groups that supported his campaign this measure has led conservatives to fear the worst from an omalley administration one small business owner in baltimore county told me he expects the "living wage" bill to trigger further government intervention into the private sector major environmental legislation "to make progressives feel good" and higher taxes to help fund inefficient public schools mr ehrlich for his part now hosts a talk show on a local radio station and during his first broadcast on march said the new general assembly is "far left its harsh left the democratic party has changed in very fundamental ways " but its a little hard to find the stamp mr omalley is putting on maryland the restoration of one party rule in the state in mr ehrlich became the first republican to win the governors mansion in more than three decades is so far failing to tilt the state sharply left led by an oddly detached governor democrats did not enact the juggernaut of tax hikes and anti business regulations that most fiscal conservatives feared the general assembly passed a number of laws that mr ehrlich likely would have vetoed such as a statewide smoking ban some restaurant and bar owners protested but maryland is hardly in the forefront of such policy imposing californias emissions standards on cars sold to state residents issuing an apology for the states long ago participation in the slave trade and a bill that would require the states presidential electors to vote for the winner of the nationwide popular vote besides serving al gores ego however the latter for now is mere political theater it wont actually take effect until states with at least a total of electoral votes enough to win the presidency enact the same law the emission standards also wont kick in for a few years and the living wage mandates apply only to government contracts the living wage is not a statewide increase in the minimum wage meanwhile left on the cutting room floor were proposals to repeal the death penalty a pet cause of mr omalleys raise the cigarette tax by &# a pack provide health benefits for uninsured marylanders and establish a "green fund" to spend on environmental causes in the chesapeake bay and despite mild criticism from the baltimore suns liberal editorial page the media are largely letting the governor get away with doing nothing that suggests he isnt likely to think more boldly in the near future another indication of his timidity is that hes bragging about restoring an order of "civility" to annapolis "we are not going to repair the divisions of the last four years in the first days of his administration but i think weve made a lot of progress " mr omalley told a sun reporter this week if divided government over the past four years was an issue however it wasnt a problem for the state mr ehrlich often clashed publicly with daunting democratic majorities in both houses of the state legislature but he overcame large budget deficits to preside over a period of tremendous prosperity punctuated by unemployment consistently below its no secret that mr omalley harbors higher electoral ambitions what he appears to be counting on is that hell gain a larger office say that of vice president by thinking small now hes looking to get a sense of the national mood before committing himself to policy and wants to be able to lineup behind whoever wins his partys presidential nomination however mr omalley still faces an obstacle in the form of state senate president mike miller a year old veteran legislator mr miller is a vocal proponent as was mr ehrlich of expanded legalized gambling mostly in the form of racetrack slot machines which could bring in &# million annually in taxes he also supports increasing gasoline tobacco income and sales taxes as well as cutting spending mr miller who plans to retire in has no desire to engage in national politics if he chooses to clash with mr omalley the confrontation will come just as the democratic presidential nominee is paring names from his or her vice presidential list how inconvenient governing can be and mr miller has no shortage of ego he told the suns jennifer skalka in an april article that "im a student of lyndon johnson im a student of winston churchill also im a student of napoleon im a student of alexander the great im a student of julius caesar im a student of douglas macarthur " mr omalley on the other hand is a student of former president bill clinton a politician who will pursue the most expedient and fashionable platform to further his own personal goals the upcoming battle over slot machines which house speaker michael busch adamantly opposes could land mr omalley in political quicksand one job of a vice president is to move tough legislation if mr omalley cant do that in a legislature controlled by his own party why would anyone add him to a national ticket sometimes even doing nothing has its risks mr smith writes weekly columns for baltimores city paper and the new york press
