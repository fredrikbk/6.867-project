girlfriends promotions and raises while on the banks payroll is giving new ammunition to critics who seek his ouster and threatening to weaken him if he stays on at the bank those prospects may suit those who oppose him on controversial issues ranging from an expansion of the banks presence in iraq to its recent withholding of loans from governments who dont do enough to cure corruption either outcome could strengthen the role of the banks member board of directors especially those representing european governments and the poor countries that borrow from the bank on a host of issues already the public release of the memo and dozens of other related documents reflects the changing dynamic as mr wolfowitz tries with a mix of apologies and persistence to hold onto his &# a year post as head of the worlds biggest anti poverty institution with representatives of the u s and european governments at odds thursday night over how many documents to disclose mr wolfowitz cut through the debate by asking that they all be released in an apparent effort to bolster his bid to keep his job in the august memo which wasnt reviewed by the banks directors ethics committee or general counsel mr wolfowitz told xavier coll vice president for human resources "i now direct you to agree to a proposal which includes the following terms and conditions " the memo went on to detail the salary that shaha riza then a communications officer would earn when she was assigned a job outside the bank at the banks expense it also set out her future raises and her status when she returned to the bank after mr wolfowitzs term as president she now earns a tax free &# about &# more than before she was reassigned its not clear who besides messrs wolfowitz and coll knew all the terms the memo followed a long back and forth with the banks board of directors over how to handle the potential conflict posed by mr wolfowitz becoming ms rizas boss he made clear in the memo he wasnt pleased with the results he asserted that the banks ethics committee had rejected his plan in which he would have recused himself from any personnel matters involving ms riza but allowed her to "continue on her professional career course at the bank " the memo ended with a bitter paragraph "i wish to reiterate deep unhappiness with the whole way of dealing with a situation that i still believe should have been resolved by my recusal " the bush administrations choice of mr wolfowitz an architect of president bushs iraq war to run the bank was instantly controversial his tenure has been marked by tension and criticism both from inside and outside the bank but the past two weeks have been extraordinary the march disclosure of the details of ms rizas salary led to chants of "resign resign " from some staffers gathered in the atrium of the banks headquarters and then to the emailed release of the previously highly confidential documents by the banks board early yesterday morning a weakened wolfowitz presidency bank insiders and outside analysts say could complicate a planned campaign to secure more than &# billion over the next few years from governments around the world to replenish the banks discount rate loan program known as the international development association if mr wolfowitz who is remains "its hard to see a scenario in which other countries step forward and say were going to pony up &# billion " said geoffrey lamb a former world bank vice president who until recently was helping to raise money for the program and is now a senior fellow at the bill &amp melinda gates foundation "its terribly damaging " and it would leave the bank with diminished credibility to pursue the high profile campaign to curb official government corruption among mr wolfowitzs top priorities governments accused of corruption would say "who is he to be telling us about governance and corruption when he doesnt have his own house in order " says debayani kar of jubilee usa a debt relief advocacy group even if mr wolfowitz stays in the post the harsh public spotlight that has been focused on him is widely seen as a victory for the world banks member professional staff many of them have chafed at mr wolfowitzs style and reliance on a couple of highly paid aides robin cleveland who was an influential budget analyst in the bush white house and kevin kellems a former pentagon and white house public relations specialist the fracas already has made a minor celebrity out of a previously little known urban planner alison cave an year veteran of the banks staff who chairs its staff association standing at the top of a flight of stairs in the banks atrium before a crowd of world bank staffers on thursday ms cave called for mr wolfowitzs resignation "it seems impossible for the institution to move forward with any sense of purpose under the present leadership especially in our endeavor to assist governments and their people in improving their own governance " she said reading from a prepared statement when mr wolfowitz who is divorced was named to head the institution he and the board of directors quickly grappled with the issue of his supervising his companion ms riza then a specialist in issues related to women in the banks middle east department she is an oxford educated british citizen who grew up in the middle east as described in a six page report released early yesterday by an ad hoc committee of world bank directors formed to defuse the controversy last week mr wolfowitz and the banks board and its ethics committee spent much of the summer of searching for an acceptable solution to the potential conflict of interest eventually ms riza ended up leaving the world bank and working at the banks expense first at the u s state department and now at an embryonic non government organization created by the state department to make grants "to help civil society" in the middle east called the foundation for the future her current salary of &# tax free because she is a foreign national working for an international institution was obtained by a whistleblower group the government accountability project in her own memo to the ad hoc committee ms riza said she had been treated unfairly both by having to leave her world bank post and by having her salary details come out in the controversy "i have now been victimized" for agreeing she wrote "to an arrangement that i have objected to and that i did not believe from the outset was in my best interest " the memo was included in the documents released by the bank her relationship with mr wolfowitz was discussed during his initial contract negotiations with the bank and was the subject of meetings emails and memos from june through september mr wolfowitz suggested that he recuse himself from "any influence over personnel decisions" involving ms riza the boards ethics committee suggested instead that she be "relocated to a position beyond potential supervising influence by the president " it said that because the move would take her out of the running for a promotion she should be given an "in situ promotion " a raise within her present post the committee told mr wolfowitz on aug to have mr coll work out the details with ms riza three days later mr wolfowitz wrote mr coll the now public two page memo that went further by detailing how her raises and promotions would work he then told the banks ethics committee that ms riza would be detailed outside the bank which he indicated was per the committees direction he withdrew his plan to recuse himself the ethics committee in an august memo challenged mr wolfowitzs summary of their conversations the committee emphasized that it had "indicated that the staff member could continue to work at the bank provided that the position she holds is outside the direct or indirect supervision" of mr wolfowitz "and there is no routine professional contact between them " but it said it the outcome sending ms riza to the state department was acceptable mr wolfowitz arguing that the banks general counsel couldnt provide legal advice to both the ethics committee and the president hired the law firm gibson dunn &amp crutcher to review the contract after it had been accepted by all sides an anonymous employee complaint in january about ms rizas salary said she had received a &# raise to &# without the approval of the board the complaint was considered by the ethics committee and dismissed mr wolfowitzs critics turned to other issues until recently on march the washington post detailed ms rizas salary mr kellems the wolfowitz spokesman responded in the story "all arrangements concerning shaha riza were made at the direction of the banks board of directors " that assertion raised eyebrows within the bank including among directors a few days later the banks staff association akin to a union questioned ms rizas salary and urged the bank board to inquire the board formed the ad hoc committee a few days later on april mr wolfowitz posted a "dear colleagues" note on an internal web site saying he had "acted on the advice" of the boards ethics committee but added that he accepted "full responsibility for the actions taken in this case " over the course of the next few days the ad hoc committee interviewed the banks former general counsel robert danino a former prime minister of peru and the former head of the banks ethics board ad melkert a dutch politician with finance ministers and central bankers from around the world representatives of the banks shareholder countries preparing to descend on washington for the spring meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund mr wolfowitz took the offensive on thursday he used a previously planned news conference to apologize "i made a mistake for which i am sorry " he said adding he would accept "any remedies" the board deems appropriate later that day he found himself standing before angry staffers who had been summoned to the atrium of the banks headquarters by the staff associations leader some of whom began chanting "resign resign " when mr wolfowitz appeared meanwhile the banks board was meeting in private almost around the clock to consider the findings of the ad hoc committee european nations led by the united kingdom began pushing for full disclosure a move they knew would push mr wolfowitz to consider resigning the u s backed by a handful of allies resisted full disclosure bank officials said mr wolfowitz ended that debate late thursday asking that "all documents related" to the matter be released "in the interest of transparency " by email at a m friday the board released more than pages of documents and a statement pledging to "move expeditiously to reach a conclusion on possible actions to take " it offered no specifics except to say they would "focus on all relevant governance implications for the bank " mr wolfowitzs chair was empty at yesterday afternoons meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the group of seven industrialization nations officials said but the white house continued to stand behind him "hes apologized for the matter and his board is undergoing an internal review and we expect him to remain as world bank president he has the presidents support " said deputy white house press secretary dana perino the unfolding conflict moved the bank into what many officials suggested is unknown territory disputes between the board and the president are not uncommon but typically have been over policy matters such as the clash over mr wolfowitzs anti corruption initiative in this case the dispute is about mr wolfowitzs own conduct in the wolfowitz camp there has been growing frustration with the board which one top bank official complained was trying to act as "judge and jury" in the current brouhaha the notion holding a vote of no confidence has been discussed within the board though bank officials cautioned there is no consensus on that issue and divisions among members have complicated efforts to move forward by releasing the accumulated material and the board committees findings and avoiding a vote on whether to dismiss mr wolfowitz the board may have put the impetus on mr wolfowitz to decide whether to resign or try to weather the storm john mccary contributed to this article compounding interest selected
