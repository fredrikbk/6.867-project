former chairman of computer associates international inc of directing and participating in fraudulent accounting during the s and s the committees report filed late friday afternoon in chancery court in delaware is the first investigation that publicly ties mr wang to what the government has described as a &# billion accounting fraud the committee recommended that the islandia n y software company which has changed its name to ca inc file suit to recover at least &# million from mr wang in costs related to his conduct including a &# million payment ca made to a government ordered restitution fund the committees findings are the latest twist in one of the major scandals to erupt amid the crackdown on accounting fraud after the technology bubble burst the surprise october ouster of cas longtime finance chief led to a frantic year in which chief executive sanjay kumar defended his leadership of the company fought to save his job was demoted and then forced out before ultimately being indicted for fraud eight former ca officials have pleaded guilty to justice department charges related to cas accounting mr wang a year old shanghai native and hard driving entrepreneur who built the company into a wall street darling hasnt been indicted in a strongly worded statement mr wang said he is "appalled" by the "fallacious" committee report saying it is based on the statements of "those who perpetrated the crimes at issue and then lied about them " mr wang said he felt "personally wronged" by mr kumar his successor and onetime protege and called his own decision in to recommend him for the position that would eventually take him to the corner office a "major mistake " mr wang said he "fully cooperated" with the companys outside law firm though he didnt mention the committees lawyers and the u s government he added that he intends to "vigorously defend my good name and fight any and all efforts to place the crimes of kumar and his management team at my feet " mr kumar who was sentenced to years in prison last year on friday agreed to pay to the restitution fund &# million this year and next plus of his income after he is released from prison mr kumar cooperated with the special committee according to the report a lawyer for mr kumar didnt return a message seeking comment for this article it appears unlikely that information uncovered by the committees investigators will lead to criminal action against mr wang who lives in oyster bay n y and is well known as owner of the new york islanders professional hockey team mr wang stepped down as chief executive of computer associates in and resigned as chairman in the statute of limitations for fraud expires after five years moreover mr wang rarely used email or written documents to communicate leaving a sparse paper trail ca formed the directors committee in to investigate claims made in various shareholder derivative suits a type of litigation designed to recover funds for a company that named as defendants many directors and several executives who served in the later years of mr wangs tenure the committee aided by four investigators said it interviewed current and former employees and examined millions of pages of documents in compiling its roughly page report it said mr wang refused to cooperate with its probe the report also built on information revealed by justice department investigations but was conducted separately the committee concluded that directors other than messrs wang and kumar werent to blame for the fraud and that audit firms shouldnt be pursued either and it said it will seek to have shareholder suits against those firms dismissed according to the committees report on mr wang it "uncovered credible evidence he directed and participated in" backdating contracts several days after each quarter ended in what were known internally as " day months " in one of the few specific examples cited in alleging mr wangs direct involvement the committee says that in july after the end of cas fiscal first quarter mr kumar "at the direction of mr wang flew to france to close" a &# million deal that was then improperly included in the first quarter results the committee said that during that fiscal year the company improperly recognized revenue from contracts worth &# billion or of full year revenue the committee said mr wang had actively negotiated "deals he knew to be backdated " it said mr wang created a "climate of fear" at the company that discouraged employees from giving him bad news and drove them to meet wall street earnings estimates at all costs the committee said mr kumar who pleaded guilty to eight charges of accounting fraud and obstructing the governments investigation into the backdating stopped the backdating practices by switching to a new accounting method in after he became chief executive suspicious investors and former ca employees have long asserted that mr wang was deeply involved in the fraudulent accounting that plagued ca mr wang emigrated with his family to the u s when he was eight years old and grew up poor in he founded computer associates international the company had one product a piece of software for mainframe computers pumped up with acquisitions it grew rapidly and in became the first software company to surpass &# billion in annual sales in the s ca became a stock market favorite thanks to steadily rising earnings and a seemingly magical ability to make its predicted earnings numbers quarter after quarter mr wang fostered an aggressive culture antagonizing many software industry insiders by drastically cutting costs and firing workers after buying their companies a fiercely competitive basketball player and sports fan mr wang pushed long working hours at cas headquarters early on establishing a tradition of free breakfasts to get employees in the building and working quickly under mr wang ca even tussled with its customers leaning on strict interpretations of contract terms backed by occasional lawsuits to keep customers renewing their expensive contracts to run ca software mr wang suffered wide criticism for a stock grant worth &# billion that went to him mr kumar and co founder russell artzt the grant which made the trio poster boys for excessive compensation was derided by some investors the executives gave back a sizeable portion of the award after losing a civil lawsuit filed by unhappy shareholders in its report the committee said the company is entitled to return of the shares mr wang received as part of the billion dollar award in at the time one of the largest payouts ever to corporate officers the grant was "neither deserved nor earned " the committee said since it was achieved because cas stock price was "materially and fraudulently inflated" by the accounting misdeeds without the fraud the committee said the shares "would not actually have vested " mr wang received million shares after subtracting those he returned to settle a shareholder suit in mr wang who in made the forbes magazine list of the richest americans with a fortune estimated at &# million has substantial assets besides owning the islanders he is a major real estate developer and investor on long island and once bid to buy the new jersey nets basketball team but it isnt clear how much ca could hope to recover even if it is successful in suing him one sticking point may be a release the company granted him in from claims against some shares he received the independent directors committee was composed of william e mccracken a management consultant and renato zambonini chairman of software company cognos inc it was charged with evaluating claims in the shareholder derivative suits and making recommendations those proposals will be subject to approval by the court the committee negotiated settlements with messrs kumar and artzt mr kumar agreed to pay &# million to reimburse ca for legal fees it paid for his legal defense in november ca sued to recover those fees and attached as security mr kumars &# million house in upper brookville n y two ferrari maranello sports cars and a foot italian azimut yacht as well as a land rover and a volvo mr artzt agreed to pay the company &# million although the committee report said he wasnt aware of the backdating practices the committee report also cited three former ca officers who havent been prosecuted but who it said were involved in or responsible for some of the accounting problems mr kumar will start serving his sentence in august after arranging payment of the restitution in a stipulation and order of settlement filed in the u s district court in brooklyn mr kumar agreed that the full amount of the damages to victims of the stock fraud was &# billion the court entered an order that mr kumar pay &# million representing the estimate of losses by investors minus the amount ca itself paid into the restitution fund ca has already paid &# million into a fund administered by the feinberg group under a deferred prosecution agreement at a hearing friday kenneth c feinberg the special master for the fund said eligible persons have made claims to the fund which now has about &# million in assets mr feinberg said distributions will begin in july after the fund receives about &# million from mr kumar however victims will each
