pursuits leisure &amp arts sightings glenn gould dead and in concert the mixed blessings of recorded music new york i saw a piano play itself the other day it was a baby grand in the lobby of a medium posh hotel and it was equipped with a digital playback device called a disklavier that was hooked up to the keyboard as i watched it rattle off a no hands version of count basies "jive at five " i reflected on the endless inventiveness of the human mind and the inexorable working of the law of unintended consequences which ensures that no good deed goes unpunished the first player piano was built in and since then these ingenious devices have fascinated all who see them in operation even to the most blase of soi disant sophisticates there is something irresistibly seductive about a piano whose keys push themselves down most of the major pianists of the s cut player piano rolls and the best of the instruments that played these long strips of punched paper could reproduce with uncanny exactitude the playing of anyone from sergei rachmaninoff to fats waller todays disklaviers use cd roms instead of paper rolls but their purpose remains the same to create the illusion that a piano is playing itself the newest wrinkle in self playing pianos comes from zenph studios a company based in raleigh n c the wizards of zenph have come up with a way to extract the sonic information embedded in a conventional piano recording and convert it into a digitized sound file that can be played on any disklavier equipped instrument sony classical is about to release a cd of zenphs "reperformance" of glenn goulds celebrated recording of bachs "goldberg variations " played back in a toronto studio on a foot yamaha grand and rerecorded in glistening digital sound the original album was recorded on hissy two track mono tape it sounds as though the year old gould had climbed into a time machine set the controls for and catapulted himself into the present whats the point of buying the cd not much unless youre so allergic to low fi sound that you cant bring yourself to listen to anything recorded prior to but a zenph reperformance can also be played back in a concert hall for a live audience and thats where things start to get dicey no sooner was the phonograph invented a century ago than prominent artists warned that it would kill off amateur music making in john philip sousa went so far as to tell a congressional committee that "talking machines are going to ruin the artistic development of music in this country music develops from the people the folk songs and if you do not make the people executants you make them depend on the machines " the march king was right once you could buy a of the "moonlight" sonata instead of learning how to play it yourself on the parlor piano the art of making music became professionalized and people who had made their own music now began to consume it passively my mothers father played the banjo but neither of my parents played any instrument at all i am the sole member of my extended family who not only learned an instrument as a child but continued to play it as an adult and that was because i wanted to become a professional musician nowadays alas the only "instrument" i play is my ipod and the only people i know who make their own music get paid to do so do i regret the invention of the phonograph not at all i know of no antiques more treasurable than the now obsolete slabs of shellac and vinyl that make it possible for me to hear great musicians who died before i was born at the same time though i believe that a musical culture built exclusively on a foundation of canned music a phrase coined by sousa is doomed to consume itself which is a big part of what makes live performances so important when you buy a ticket to a piano recital by a promising youngster instead of spending the same money on a record made by vladimir horowitz in youre investing in the future of music the same way you are when you encourage your own young child to take piano lessons a listener who cares only for the glories of the past by contrast is like a farmer who eats his seed corn instead of planting it thats why im of two minds about what zenph studios has wrought yes its "reperformance" of glenn goulds "goldberg variations" is a technological miracle yes goulds original performance was and is irreplaceably special i wouldnt want to be without either one but to become fixated on such things is to put yourself at risk of overlooking the heart of the matter which is the music itself last month a group of new york journalists were invited to a public "performance" of zenphs digitized re creation of goulds goldbergs by all accounts they found the spectacle bewitching just as another new york audience was bewitched in when it saw a duo art player piano "perform" harold bauers piano roll of saint saens g minor piano concerto with walter damrosch and the new york symphony orchestra both audiences marveled to see a piano playing itself in much the same way that another kind of audience might gasp when a magician pulls a white rabbit out of his top hat forgetting that the real miracle is the rabbit not the hat mr teachout the journals drama critic writes "sightings" every other saturday and blogs about the arts at www terryteachout com write to him at tteachout wsj com
