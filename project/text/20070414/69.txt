remembrances james j needham nyse chiefs fight to keep fee rates highlighted a tumultuous tenure james j needham came to the new york stock exchange as its first full time chairman in with a reputation as an outspoken investor advocate but by the time he left four years later he had lost a battle to protect an entrenched big board practice criticized for keeping broker fees artificially high mr needhams feisty but futile defense of fixed minimum commissions was one of several thorny issues he faced during a tumultuous tenure when the venerable nyse was under siege in washington congress and the securities and exchange commission were clamoring to change the exchanges clubby ways including dismantling a fixed fee structure that dated back to its founding in mr needham also had the misfortune of presiding during a stock market swoon that decimated wall street profits and battered the big board members that he relied upon for support "he was in a tough position " says william donaldson who later served terms as chairman of both the nyse and sec yet mr needham who died april at age in southampton n y also is credited with pushing for stronger protection of investors funds when brokerages flounder and with extending trading hours to p m from p m his proposal for a unified national exchange although rejected at the time by regional exchanges and over the counter trading firms that feared the nyse would have been the biggest beneficiary ultimately came to pass in a different form when the sec tied exchanges together with a consolidated stock quote system in the s before joining the nyse mr needham was a member of the body most actively pressing the big board for change the sec he was a surprise candidate when president nixon chose him to fill an sec vacancy in because he was an accountant whose political experience was limited to being treasurer of the plainview n y republican club at the sec mr needham put to rest critics who thought that securities regulation was too complicated for a nonlawyer his was a brash voice predicting hour computerized markets and the elimination of stock certificates during sec hearings on the stock market a year later he expressed skepticism at some brokers assertions that a switch to negotiated from fixed commissions would drive them out of business when he told a roomful of wall street executives in march that "you have lost the battle on fixed minimum commissions " this newspaper described his audience as "stunned " within months he was hired as nyse chairman after the exchange ended its long status as a membership association and created a person board of directors with members outside the securities industry mr needham first banged the gong as chairman on aug and soon began stepping on toes with his impatience and quick temper prompting one broker to label him "king james i" in a wall street journal article "he still doesnt realize hes working for us " groused an executive at a large member firm as drumbeats in washington continued to demand negotiated broker rates mr needhams views began to reflect those of his new employer in a speech in october he opposed a phased elimination of fixed commissions until the securities industry recovered from its earnings slump then in early mr needham proposed a tradeoff the big board would repeal fixed rates in exchange for congress abolishing the "third market " as nonexchange trading of listed securities was called big board members favored the latter idea because they lost potential commissions on trades executed outside the nyse his proposal went nowhere and the sec announced in september that fixed rates on all stock markets would be abolished as of may after the change commission rates for large or institutional trades fell almost immediately according to a historical account published by the nyse in fees for smaller investors dropped from &# or more to &# or less at full service brokerages and less than &# at discount brokers according to a biography of discount broker charles schwab but at the time mr needham predicted doomsday warning in a interview with the chicago tribune that big board would disappear if rates were left to negotiation allowing "the financial markets of europe" to take over that in turn would leave the nation without a stock exchange for corporations to raise capital needed to grow he argued the next year he threatened to meet the sec "on the courthouse steps" to stop the elimination of fixed rates the big boards eventual decision not to sue rankled exchange members a drop in the dow jones industrial average between january and december also wore down the nyses resolve to fight regulatory changes leaving mr needham exposed already unpopular with some floor traders he was "deserted by the commission brokerage firms " according to "nyse " a book by robert sobel "many of the men needham had claimed would lead their organizations out of the nyse denied they would do so" as the change to negotiated commissions grew closer in april he announced he would resign almost two years before the end of his &# annual contract in interviews over the years he returned to his earlier advocacy of protection for investors in as investors poured money into technology and other stocks he said the sec needed to step up regulation "theres too much of this let the free enterprise system work that is a lot of nonsense " he told the new york times he reiterated has plea for tougher regulation after the enron and other corporate scandals and in joined the calls for the resignation of nyse chairman richard grasso and board members after disclosure of mr grassos &# million pay package by the time of his death many of the investor friendly changes that mr needham variously championed and opposed had transformed the nyse including negotiated commissions that contributed to a surge of participation in the stock market "he was on the wrong side of history " says john coffee a columbia law school professor "it was one of the rare times when the insiders were wrong about what was in their own long term interest " rubin caslow smoked fish purveyor
