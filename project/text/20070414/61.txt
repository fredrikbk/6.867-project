pursuits style menswear a real savile row as designers muscle into the customized suit market we sort out confusing labels high end fashion designers are edging into the booming market for specially made mens suits prompting a backlash from savile row tailors about the way these makers are labeling their offerings big retailers including brooks brothers have already succeeded in getting customers to pay more for so called made to measure suits now luxury labels including tom ford versace and jil sander are rolling out their own options that start at to higher than their off the rack lines the entrance of designers in the market is creating a greater range of options for men who dont want an off the rack suit but the different terminologies for these suits custom bespoke and made to measure are making it confusing for consumers and rankling the traditional purveyors of custom suits at dege &amp skinner a tailor for years on savile row in london managing director william skinner worries that customers will think that made to measure which typically involves using a stock pattern that is then adjusted to fit the clients measurements and taste is the same thing as bespoke or custom which means starting from scratch "its like false trading or false advertising " says mr skinner who recently joined fellow tailors to trademark the phrase "savile row bespoke" and develop a code describing what it means for made to measure a customer selects a style of suit the fabric and finishes like lining pockets and buttons at least six measurements are taken the suit is cut from a preproduced pattern adjusted according to those measurements the process can be done by hand machine or both clients usually return for at least one fitting while some made to measure and custom suits are made in the u s the designer brands take measurements in the u s and other countries that they send to tailors often in italy custom suits are made entirely from scratch mostly by hand in a process that can take at least two or three fittings and at least eight weeks more than measurements are taken for a bespoke garment with sales of off the rack suits down nearly last year designers

bespoke and later trademarked it as a phrase in the move was a response in part to an increase in tailors claims to be making custom suits the savile row group intensified its efforts to promote their tailoring last summer as italian designer giorgio armani launched his custom line at the time mr armani created a stir with a quote in the sunday times of london dismissing savile row as "an outdated institution that has failed to keep up with modern tastes lifestyle and technology " mr armani later said in a letter to the editor that he meant his "hand made to measure" suits blend the traditional and the modern "there is plenty of room for both of us " he concluded but for savile row tailors the episode underscored how much the world had changed "our attitude was the quality of the products speaks for itself " says anda rowland co chairman of savile row bespoke house anderson &amp sheppard and one of the groups five directors "we let other people eat out of our market " the tailors decided they had to strike back the savile row bespoke group based its code on rules set by frances couture federation under the code most of which is posted on a web site the group launched in january only suits that are handmade taking at least hours and done on or within yards of savile row can call themselves savile row bespoke the group is still mulling how to enforce the trademark the designers meanwhile say they want to appeal to both existing customers and men who already have their clothes made to order "its not only for the fashion people " says roberto lorenzini president and chief operating officer of versaces u s retail division "its also for people working in finance the customer who comes to us can have something more classical " but the designers may have a hard sell
