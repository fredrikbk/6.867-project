case closed tax cuts mean growth its that time again and i was thinking of the old joke about paying your taxes with a smile the punch line is that the irs doesnt accept smiles they want your money so its not that funny but there is reason to smile this tax season the results of the experiment that began when congress passed a series of tax rate cuts in and are in supporters of those cuts said they would stimulate the economy opponents predicted ever increasing budget deficits and national bankruptcy unless tax rates were increased especially on the wealthy in fact treasury statistics show that tax revenues have soared and the budget deficit has been shrinking faster than even the optimists projected since the first tax cuts were passed when i was in the senate the budget deficit has been cut in half remarkably this has happened despite the financial trauma of and the cost of the war on terror the deficit compared to the entire economy is well below the average for the last years and at this rate the budget will be in surplus by perhaps the most fascinating thing about this success story is where the increased revenues are coming from critics claimed that across the board tax cuts were some sort of gift to the rich but on the contrary the wealthy are paying a greater percentage of the national bill than ever before the richest of americans now pays of all income taxes the top pay more taxes than the bottom the reason for this outcome is that because of lower rates money is being invested in our economy instead of being sheltered from the taxman greater investment has created overall economic strength job growth is robust overcoming trouble in the housing sector and the personal incomes of americans at every income level are higher than theyve ever been president john f kennedy was an astute proponent of tax cuts and the proposition that lower tax rates produce economic growth calvin coolidge and ronald reagan also understood the power of lower tax rates and managed to put through cuts that grew the u s economy like kansas corn sadly we just dont seem able to keep that lesson learned now as before politicians are itching to fund their pet projects with the short term revenue increases that come from tax hikes ignoring the long term pain they always cause unfortunately the tax cuts that have produced our record breaking government revenues and personal incomes will expire soon because congress has failed to make them permanent we are facing the worst tax hike in our history already worried investors are trying to figure out what the financial landscape will look like in and beyond this issue is particularly important now because massive unfunded entitlements are coming due as the baby boom generation retires we simply cannot afford higher taxes if we want an economy able to bear up under the strain of those obligations and beyond the issue of our annual federal budget is the nearly &# trillion national debt that we have not even begun to pay off to face these challenges and any others that we might encounter in a hazardous world we need to maintain economic growth and healthy tax revenues that is why we need to reject taxes that punish rather than reward success those who say they want a "more progressive" tax system should be asked one question are you really interested in tax rates that benefit the economy and raise revenue or are you interested in redistributing income for political reasons mr thompson is a former republican senator from tennessee whose commentaries "the fred thompson report " can be heard on the abc radio network see related letter "letters to the editor tax cut multiplier effect" wsj april
