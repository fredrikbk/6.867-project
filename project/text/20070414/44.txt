pursuits books five best these scientific works are also literature of a high order says british science writer john gribbin  on the loadstone and magnetic bodies by william gilbert william gilbert of colchester was the first person to set out clearly in print the essence of the scientific method of testing hypotheses by experiment he also made discoveries in the field of magnetism that were not improved on for two centuries a little more than years ago when shakespeare was the toast of london gilbert wrote this book on magnetism which is hugely entertaining even if you care nothing about science "in the discovery of hidden things " he says in a translation of the original latin "stronger reasons are obtained from sure experiments and demonstrated arguments than from probable conjectures and the opinions of philosophical speculators " and he rails against the "lettered clowns grammatists sophists spouters and the wrong headed rabble" who attempted to unravel the mysteries of the universe solely by thinking about them without doing experiments  micrographia by robert hooke "micrographia" is the first great scientific book written in english handsomely illustrated many of the drawings were by robert hookes friend christopher wren and easily accessible to the layman samuel pepys got an early copy and sat up reading it until a m noting in his diary that it was "the most ingenious book that ever i read in my life " hooke described not only the microscopic world but also astronomy geology and the nature of light setting out ideas that isaac newton later lifted and passed off as his own for centuries in newtons shadow hooke is now rightly regarded as newtons equal in everything except mathematical prowess he was the rock on which the early success of the royal society of london was built and he wrote much more entertainingly than newton  on the origin of species by charles darwin quite apart from its scientific importance this is a beautifully written book that raises the question why scientists today are so much less literate by and large than their th century predecessors darwin was an avid reader of his contemporaries such as george eliot and charles dickens and it shows just look at the famous opening lines "when on board hms beagle as naturalist i was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of south america these facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species " who can fail to be sucked in and want to read on the fact that natural selection is probably the most important scientific discovery of all time is simply a bonus  fragments of science by john tyndall the irish scientist and writer john tyndall is almost forgotten today but in the th century he was in effect the first science popularizer and his lectures in america drew crowds as large as those for charles dickens the fortune he made from the lectures was used to set up a fund for the advancement of american science a contemporary biographer wrote "prof tyndall occupies the foremost place among his contemporaries his only rival being his friend prof huxley" that is thomas huxley the great victorian defender of darwins theories tyndall was a prolific author but "fragments of science" the original full title added "for unscientific people" is probably his best book its wide ranging topics include the nature of heat and light spectroscopy a voyage to algeria to observe an eclipse glaciology and the composition of the sun  six easy pieces by richard p feynman addison wesley something of a self indulgence to conclude with one of the biggest influences on my scientific career and later my career as a popularizer of science was the multivolume "feynman lectures on physics " which appeared in the early s "six easy pieces " the epitome of that masterwork really does offer an easy guide to the essence of physics and science in general feynman explores the most fundamental scientific theories the structure and behavior of atoms quantum mechanics and gravity these fundamentals ought to be as well known to intelligent people as shakespeare mozart and picasso the material in the book is essentially a transcript of feynman lecturing you can even get the lectures themselves on a cd to accompany the book and comes across like a wise friend giving you the inside story on a subject he loves more than years after william gilbert feynman never missed an opportunity to hammer home what remains the most essential feature of science no matter how much you may love your pet idea no matter how beautiful it is mathematically "if it disagrees with experiment then it is wrong " dr gribbin a visiting fellow in astronomy at the university of sussex is the author most recently of "the fellowship" overlook which deals with the th century scientific revolution
