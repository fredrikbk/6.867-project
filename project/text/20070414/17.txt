do palestinians really want a permanent peace with israel richard haass a highly regarded member of our foreign policy establishment demonstrates naivete about the arab israeli conflict "the gippers mideast playbook " editorial page april for example he writes that under his plan "muslims would gain authority over their holy places " yet they have had such authority since when israel miraculously granted the muslim waqf authority over muslim holy places in jerusalem despite the arabs desecration of jewish holy places during the period of israel received zero credit from palestinians arabs muslims and europeans for such a generous decision just as israel receives zero credit for all its efforts to compromise with its arab neighbors thus mr haasss belief that if the u s solved the "palestinian problem " it would bolster u s standing in europe and the arab muslim world is fantasy the arab muslim world ignores all our efforts to help muslims in bosnia kosovo somalia kuwait iraq lebanon and the palestinian territories no one in the arab muslim world cares about president clintons herculean efforts to turn yasser arafat into a statesman mr clinton did everything he could to empower arafat and establish a palestinian state short of having arafats head carved into mount rushmore the way to end the arab israeli conflict and to move the arab muslim world away from their semi barbaric state is to stop enabling arabs and muslims by blaming the u s for the arab muslim failure to modernize arabs and muslims need to first see that a problem exists in their societies then they need to realize that the problem is largely a result of their own actions finally once palestinians arabs and muslims take responsibility for improving their lot and dealing peacefully with each other and non muslims a real peace can be established with israel the u s europe and the rest of the world josh baker bangkok thailand mr haass who supported both the ill fated oslo "peace" process and the discredited "disengagement" plan now identifies the problem in obtaining a resolution of the palestinian conflict with israel as the lack of leadership on both sides "able and willing to compromise for peace " yet despite his dogged insistence on evenhandedness he has stated elsewhere that then prime minister ehud barak made "a generous israeli offer" at camp david the withdrawal of the idf and the forcible removal of all jews from their homes and businesses in the gaza strip is yet another example of israels willingness to take great risks and bold some would say reckless steps in the pursuit of peace mr haasss entire argument is based upon the very questionable assumption that the palestinian leadership and mahmoud abbas in particular seek a permanent peace with israel after years of continued virulent palestinian incitement in school texts summer camps and p a controlled media one would expect mr haass to re examine the evidence for his basic assumption roger a gerber scarsdale n y the palestinian refugees figure large on this stage i would like to remind mr haass and the journal readership that the palestinians were not the only refugees to come out of the arab israeli wars they were the only ones not settled by their own people now going on four generations a crime to be sure there was another refugee population crossing the palestinians in the desert jews from arab lands and no justice is possible without recognition remembrance and compensation due them from through jews were forced from their homes in algeria from afghanistan from syria from tunisia from libya from turkey from iran from yemen from egypt from morocco and from iraq sheree roth palo alto calif mr haasss restating of the tired council of foreign relations evenhanded approach to the israeli palestinian problem calls on president bush to "spell out" his vision as though the absence of clarity from washington underpins the dispute in june courageously departing from the moral equivalence approach of both president clinton and the elder president bush the incumbent white house occupant made his position very clear president bush ascribed the dispute at bottom to the terrorism initiated by arafat who he argued had fundamentally betrayed the hopes of his people clearly as long as terrorism a mindset abetted in palestinian schools and mosques marks the approach of the palestinians president bush could give speeches appoint special envoys call for summit conferences and fantasize about "political horizons " all to no avail the most disturbing feature of mr haasss piece given his role as a centerpiece of the liberal foreign policy establishment is his disingenuous reference to arafats alleged lack of "leadership" at camp david according to mr haass arafats failure to "compromise" stemmed from the absence of a "political environment" that would enable him to win the endorsement of other arab states for his alleged peace making intentions arafat was the terrorist par excellence and recognition of the rightful existence of a jewish state was a notion he fought to the death the record of oslo showed that while arafat was soft talking "engagement" oriented diplomats the likes of mr haass he was unremittingly engineering and paying for terrorist operations on the same day that arafat shook hands with clinton and rabin on the white house lawn he in fact gave a speech in arabic for the folks back home claiming that the oslo enterprise was only a holding operation ron rubin bronx n y the author is professor of political science at
