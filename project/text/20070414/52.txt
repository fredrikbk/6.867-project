pursuits food &amp drink wine notes in the years we have been writing our tastings column which appears on fridays we have received thousands of questions about wine from readers in this column we answer some questions that touch on common themes we have edited the questions for space if you have a question drop us a note at wine wsj com be sure to include your full name city and state aging white wines a few weeks ago in response to a question about starting a collection you mentioned some whites that are delicious when well aged i was surprised i didnt know that whites aged in any event you dont age champagne right barbara thomke jericho vt it depends on the white while the vast majority of wines both red and white are meant to be drunk young many fine whites benefit from some age fine german riesling and good sauternes age beautifully and top white burgundy is much better with at least a few years of age we recently tried a alsatian gewurztraminer that was simply stunning golden and rich with smells of lychee and roses tastes of peaches honey almonds and earth and a finish of white pepper and very very luscious fruit it had the kind of depth and complexity that only age can bring in a white or a red yes most whites we drink every day sauvignon blanc pinot grigio and the like should be consumed young but if you havent experimented a bit with age on a fine white wine do yourself a favor and try one we also believe that fine champagne improves with age but this is controversial for our column about aging champagne drop us a note at wine wsj com pronouncing meritage in your recent article about annoying things at restaurants you left out my favorite being laughed at by condescending waiters when i say "meritage" as in heritage instead of "meritahj " their favorite incorrect francofied version of what is actually an american word i have had them laugh out loud at my pronunciation charles t happel west des moines iowa were glad you brought that up meritage is a concept and a name created by american vintners for fine blends as part of an effort to persuade consumers that a wine doesnt have to have a varietal designation cabernet sauvignon chardonnay and such to be an excellent wine as the official meritage association explains on its web site meritagewine org "meritage pronounced like heritage was selected from more than entries in an international contest to name the new wine category meritage is an invented word that combines merit and heritage " unfortunately as far as we can tell its mispronounced just about all the time and while were not sticklers for pronunciation it really is amazing how often we too have been "corrected" when we have pronounced it correctly getting the wrong year reading your recent articles on wine service issues brought to mind an issue some friends and i have encountered a couple of times being presented with a different year than the wine selected in each case when we caught the "error " we were informed that the menu was simply out of date i am curious as to your advice on how to handle this situation sean robertson dallas it depends on whether you really care most wines are meant to drink right away so if we get a younger vintage than the one listed on the wine list thats generally fine with us but sometimes the vintage does matter for instance we might order a or sauvignon blanc because it will be young and fresh and wed be disappointed to see that its a and we might be excited to see a california cabernet sauvignon on a list because it was a fine year and wed be unpleasantly surprised if we were presented with a but after all the waiter shows you the bottle before opening it so that you can make sure you got the bottle you ordered if the vintage is different and its important to us we simply say "oh gee we really were counting on the is it possible you have it if not could we see the list again " if you say this nicely there shouldnt be a problem
