democrats and the amt its almost tax day but cheer up things could get worse and probably will this year more than three million taxpayers will be hit by the alternative minimum tax on their income but next year that number could rise to million unless democrats in congress come up with a way to halt the juggernaut that is the amt the fixes that have been put in place the past few years have expired and if nothing is done nearly one in five filers will be caught short by a tax that was created in to target yes millionaires who had managed to avoid paying any taxes at all who are those million if you live in one of the high tax states listed in the nearby chart have a family with children and make even &# a year you would probably be one of them see accompanying graphic wsj april the democrats say they dont want this soak the rich tax to hit the middle class but the amts relentless growth is largely of their making liberals created the amt to punish those millionaires but failed to index it for inflation and democrats raised the amt tax rate in to and from a single rate of as part of bill clintons tax increase of according to the joint committee on taxation the amt would have hit "only" million americans next year if not for that tax hike so nearly of this problem was created the last time democrats ran the government and those who voted for it included speaker nancy pelosi ways and means chairman charlie rangel as well as senators barbara boxer dianne feinstein chuck schumer then in the house joe lieberman and chris dodd to be fair all but five democratic senators and democratic house members voted for the bill and of the five senate dissenters only new jerseys frank lautenberg is still there we single out the democratic delegations from california new york and connecticut because they are the high tax states likely to have the largest numbers of amt victims if the tax isnt fixed or repealed taxpayers can deduct state and local taxes under the normal irs code but not under the amt so in another liberal irony democratic governors are now demanding that congress pass amt relief so they can keep their high state tax rates now democrats like to blame the ever encroaching amt on the bush tax cuts the orwellian logic of this argument is that the and tax cuts lowered the bill for almost everyone who pays taxes but it didnt lower their bill as figured by the amt except temporarily so by lowering taxpayers"normal" taxes president bush is said to have made the amt a bigger problem however you only pay the amt because of the bush tax cuts if those tax cuts lowered your bill in the first place youre still paying less than you would have democrats have compounded their amt dilemma this year by adopting "pay as you go" budget rules that say any tax cut such as amt relief must be offset either by other tax increases or entitlement spending cuts democrats arent about to cut any spending so now theyre confronted with the problem of how to pay for amt relief even a one or two year fix could "cost" tens of billions under democratic revenue estimates and full repeal would cost &# trillion over a decade so what to do of course raise taxes on "the rich" word around washington is that democrats may try to combine amt relief with a measure to repeal some of the bush tax cuts but no one should be fooled by this class war fakery the amt was itself supposed to be a soak the rich scheme like most such schemes its now hitting millions of the non rich with millions more on deck for a soaking the same would go eventually for whatever new taxes democrats claim would also only apply to the rich the easiest exit from this box canyon would be for democrats to cut the amt rate back to its pre clinton levels and then cut some spending if they want to stick with their crazy "pay go" rules better yet they could start thinking about larger tax reform that would eliminate the amt lower rates for everyone and close loopholes and needless deductions we can dream cant we
