tennessee this summer recently hit an unexpected snag "i made the mistake of telling my mom about it " she says her year old mother laura graham thought it sounded like a great idea "katie announced they were going in our car and i said not without me youre not " says ms graham at first her daughter balked "she was afraid she wouldnt be able to party down quite as much " says ms graham "but im pretty liberal and her friends think im pretty cool " the most successful summer festivals have built their reputations as platforms for up and coming bands hosting indie rock groups like the shins

if kyles dad ended up joining us " he says "hes a fanatic for that kind of music " festival organizers say a roster of more familiar bands helps draw audiences with more spending power "bonnaroo has been accepted by a more mainstream world and when you get that you attract people with more money " says rick farman co founder of superfly productions which produces bonnaroo with ac entertainment " now going to tennessee is not so much of a leap of faith " the strategy takes a page from the concert tour business which has already embraced vip perks and has recently leaned heavily on the

touring festival coincided with the rise of alternative rock it was followed by other successful touring events from the all female lilith fair to the punk driven vans warped tour but by the end of the decade the business had started to sour lollapalooza folded for several years in lilith fair shut down after its tour a disastrous woodstock revival event in was marred by violence fires and reported sexual assaults since then the festival model has largely been recreated with a surge of carefully programmed events in single locations among the most successful of these is coachella which began in as a platform for indie rock bands and in part because of its proximity to los angeles has become a ritual for hollywood and music industry insiders bonnaroo started in with a foundation in the "jam band" scene featuring former members of phish and the grateful dead as headliners lollapalooza relaunched in as a nontouring festival in chicago now these festivals are offering more options

suburbanites " says mr carpenter he adds that if he "was years old " he might buy a regular ticket "but im more mature and better off now so i said no thanks to that " organizers say theyre mindful of the risk of alienating their core audiences in the process of appealing to a more well heeled crowd "we dont want anything to come off as elitist " says mr farman "we certainly dont want to do anything for the vips that would degrade the experience for the rest of the patrons but were always thinking about what services we could provide for those people who have the extra dollars in their
