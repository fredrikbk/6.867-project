real time the era of bottom up brands googles dominance is changing the rules by which brands win consumer loyalty online edition one of my favorite stories in the history of web business a chronicle by turns heroic and tragic ambitious and doomed shrewd and really really dumb is that of pathfinder time warners attempt to dominate the web by building a common home for its various print titles pathfinder began in late when the internet was still largely the domain of scientists and academics and as such was a bold effort but by the time it was shuttered in it cost time warner some &# million on paper and immeasurably more in opportunities lost while charging in the wrong direction it lives on here as a rather sheepish billboard for time warner properties i probably would have guessed that coastal living is "the web site for people who love the coast " for a look at what used to be check out the pathfinder museum "the pathfinder way" should be shorthand for a particular flavor of brand confusion namely that people know what corporation has the rights to a particular magazine book song tv show or movie imagining that they do or thinking they can be taught to do so still trips up record labels publishers and other content companies who only listen to voices inside their own building but not to the extent it did during pathfinders heyday when time warner media properties fought with the parent company for the right to establish web sites branded with their own names the idea is obviously crazy now but dont give time warner a break based on hindsight it was crazy then too you never needed a web futurist to see that time warners individual brands were better off on their own than subsumed under a corporate umbrella site with its own newly created brand if youd like to continue down bad idea memory lane heres what remains of walt disneys go site a halfhearted pathfinder whose other legacy is extraneous characters added to web addresses for disney properties such as espn and abc its fun to mock pathfinder and companies forget its lesson at their peril but its also easy to forget how different the web was before google arrived in the early days any good web site about anything was of at least passing interest hence cool site of the day now a somewhat random portal by giving people a reliable way to actually find what they were looking for google changed everything and those changes havent stopped coming a decade after registering its domain name googles name has become a verb for the service it offers seven years after it started to sell ads based on those searches its on track to top &# billion in revenue for riding on those big coattails is the industry of search engine optimization which has gone from an oddball curiosity for small businesses to something no organization with a web presence can afford to ignore on todays web everything begins with google and thats driving a sea change in how brands are built and succeed while brands remain vital online the old top down model of building them think of a new magazine launch is increasingly irrelevant to the web instead googles dominance allows and even encourages brands to be built from the bottom up with their overall identity far less important than the little slices of themselves returned by web searches and their position in search rankings these bottom up brands already exist and heres an easy way to identify them youre more familiar with individual slices of their content than you are with their home pages some of which you may never have visited theres about com a compilation of how to guides youve undoubtedly used or at least encountered theres youtube now part of the google empire and theres wikipedia if youve ever entered a given term and "wikipedia" in google to bring the wikipedia page to the top of your search results youve summarized bottom up branding rather succinctly odds are you became aware of these sites not because of some big marketing campaign but by repeatedly encountering bits and pieces of them through search engines until you began to think of them as entities in their own right and more such brands are arriving every day at first acquaintance hulu the online video venture between nbc universal and fox whose parent company has agreed to acquire the online journals publisher feels like a whizzier version of the pathfinder way it assumes consumers know what network a show is on and dresses that inside the building conceit up with a new brand name ten years ago that approach would probably have been fatal and it still might be but today its far less important than how high hulus videos will appear in search rankings hulus distribution deals also help though in that case bits of content are being pushed to consumers through various outlets rather then pulled by them through search this raises the possibility that the pathfinder way may live on for years as a full employment act for old style brand marketers who will soldier on without ever having to confront their own irrelevance a different example is presented by associated content which recruits people to write about a huge number of specific subjects in hopes of attracting web users performing searchers and by doing so creating an inventory of interest to advertisers and content companies looking to supplement their offerings for a good portrait of the company including the debate over its model and the presence of googles tim armstrong on the board see this july portrait by news coms elinor mills from its model to its no frills name associated content can sound utilitarian particularly to veteran writers like me but the company contends that many people performing a specific search will value specific information more than fancy wordplay if youre going to venice in august with kids joe fridays workaday account of visiting venice in august with kids may prove a lot more useful than a john berendt travelogue not to mention that its snobbish to assume joe fridays account is workaday as youd expect search is a significant part of associated contents strategy but right now brand isnt and thats because of how search has evolved as with about wikipedia and youtube visitors to associated content are likely to arrive through search results instead of by calling up the home page entering through the side door instead of the front if you will asked why associated content even has a home page its here ceo geoff reiss a veteran of spy and espn confesses that "for a while i was toying with a home page that would just be a search box " he says the company does need a front door for everything from recruiting writers to giving potential partners a place to visit but acknowledges that at this point "i dont think its fundamental to our success " and that may not be a bad thing considering how many home pages have to serve as the point of entry for every part of their web sites a single entry strategy that mr reiss sees as increasingly out of sync with how consumers want to use those sites "if you look at the home pages on web sites you can hear them groan under the pressure theyre under " he says but wait about and wikipedia and youtube are strong brands google paid &# billion for youtube after all but rather than building on big top down marketing pushes those sites evolved into strong brands by being repeatedly found through search and gradually creating customer awareness and loyalty thats the new way of the online world and the lead associated content hopes to follow "we have achieved critical mass without having to predicate the business on building a brand " mr reiss says adding "were of the mind that hundreds of thousands of positive experiences can define a brand better than just sticking a flag on top of a hill and saying this is the brand " has googles dominance changed how you use the web how do you think branding is changing in a search first online world join me and other
