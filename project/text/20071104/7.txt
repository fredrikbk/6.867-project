love &amp money a gift to you from dad and mom last week i wrote about opening a brokerage account for my son so that i can teach him about investing what i didnt mention is that while my wife amy is all for our year old son learning the basics of wall street she was annoyed that i opened the account without including her in the process it wasnt the first time ive done this every once in a while i unilaterally present some gift to our son amy i subsequently discover had wanted to be part of the event but i went and popped the cork before she arrived heres the problem with that no matter how much you tell your child that some gift is from both mom and dad its always the parent giving the gift who receives the credit both at the moment the gift is given and later when your child is retelling the story to friends and family the absent parent is invariably forgotten often to great consternation i dont do this maliciously or intentionally but whatever my intent one thing is clear when it comes to parents giving presents to children its often not the thought that counts its who gave it part of the pleasure of giving a gift to your child is seeing that brief moment of joy amid the disdain that kids so often express for us once they hit about years old indeed when i told laura a friend in baltimore what i had done she understood amys pain this isnt just about one parent stealing anothers thunder she says but about that parent stealing those rare moments when you actually do something right and your child smiles "i want the fun of seeing the happiness on my kids face " she says "would you really want to come down christmas morning and find all the presents you gave had already been opened " in my defense i felt like this was something amy and i had talked about and so was no big deal she knew that i was planning to open a brokerage account for our son i was just waiting for the time i thought he was ready when he was i opened the account as i saw it it was just a back office task and i made sure to include amy in my discussion with our son as i noted in that original column i told him that "mom and i have &# to put into an account for you " notice that i specifically said "mom and i " it didnt matter when amy called from work that afternoon our son told her "dad opened a stock account for me today " that whole mom and dad thing was apparently lost on him amy reminded me that i had done something similar a few months earlier when one day after school i presented our son with his new soccer cleats these were expensive cleats a treat amy and i told him wed buy because he had made good grades on his final report card last year and because he made the roster on a traveling soccer team we said hed get them when the soccer season started so i gave them to him on the day of his first practice again i figured our son knew that both mom and dad were responsible for the purchase so that was moot i was just giving him what he already knew he had amy thought i missed the point "i wanted to be there for his excitement " amy told me later "but this was another opdyke episode where you didnt hear the whole conversation we were supposed to give them to him together at dinner and you gave them to him after school when i got home the box was on the floor and he said look what dad gave me it totally sounded like it was just from you " its hard not to concede amy is right especially with my son pointing out that dad did this and that when in reality amy was part of everything it isnt that amy wants credit although im sure theres some of that she wants unity she wants us to present a unified front when both disciplining our kids and rewarding them she doesnt want to create a family where one parent is viewed as fun and the other isnt "hes at an age " amy says "where hes starting to do more with just you and thats normal but it also makes me a little jealous because i was once a big deal too and when you do these things without me it makes me feel it even more in my heart that you both are pushing me out of the way that moms just here when you need her " amy makes another valid point "i want our son to know that women make decisions too in a family and that we are financially astute as well i want him to include his wife one day when hes a parent and he needs to see that in us " i cant argue with that like many parents i get excited about giving something to my son so i do it and just writing that makes it clear what the problem is if im excited giving it to him then of course amy would be too the best i can do at this point is apologize to amy which ive done "and tell me youre going to try harder next time " amy says "there is no i in we mr unilateral " jeff opdyke covers personal finance for the wall street journal email lovemoney wsj com
