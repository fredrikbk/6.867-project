getting going make it to the end with money to spare the questions dont get more fundamental than this how do retirees avoid running out of money retirement presents all kinds of pitfalls including rotten markets rapid inflation and living longer than expected to cope with these risks you have three key tools interest paying investments stocks and products that generate guaranteed lifetime income whats the best way to use these tools here are four strategies  cushioning with cash suppose your goal is a annual portfolio withdrawal rate to cover your next five years of spending you might stash of your nest egg in short term bonds high yield savings accounts and money market mutual funds tap this cash reserve to cover your monthly expenses meanwhile invest the other of your savings for long term growth putting maybe in u s and foreign stock funds and in a mix of high quality intermediate term bonds inflation indexed treasury bonds high yield junk bonds and foreign bonds direct the dividends and interest from these investments into your cash reserve thus partially replenishing it to keep your cash reserve equal to five years of living expenses you will also need to sell occasionally what if your stock and bond funds are underwater sit tight until the markets recover edina minn financial planner ross levin uses this strategy with retired clients except hes more aggressive and sets aside just three years of spending money in conservative investments "we try to replenish the cash reserve on strength " he says "if we get good markets well sell regularly if we get a bad market we might not sell stocks for three years "  covering the basics even with the cash cushion you would be vulnerable to large market declines want more certainty you might arrange enough guaranteed lifetime income to cover your basic living expenses like food utilities insurance and taxes to that end you will have social security and maybe a pension if you want more guaranteed lifetime income you might delay social security to get a larger monthly check and until then dip more heavily into savings you could also buy an annuity that pays lifetime income and dont forget about mutual funds fidelity investments recently introduced special funds that help retirees generate income and vanguard group has plans for its own income funds though neither will give you an annuitys guaranteed lifetime income once youve locked up enough income to cover basic living expenses you will be free to invest the rest of your savings more aggressively if these savings clock stellar returns over the next year you could cash in some gains and take that trip to europe if your results are more pedestrian you might vacation closer to home  segmenting the problem many seniors loathe the idea of delaying social security and they dont like income annuities as an alternative think of your retirement in five year segments lets say you quit the work force at age and you cant imagine living beyond you might divide your portfolio into five buckets to cover your spending from age to to to to and and beyond vary the amount invested in each bucket depending on how much you expect to spend and what after inflation investment return you think you will earn in the meantime this strategy will provide some predictability after all as you cash in each bucket you will know how much money you have at your disposal for the next five years to make things even more predictable you could invest each bucket in a bond that matures at the start of the buckets five year spending period but i would favor owning some stocks one strategy buy a laddered portfolio of target date retirement funds such as the t rowe price retirement funds or the vanguard target retirement funds if you reach age and your health is good you might opt to buy an income annuity instead of spending down your final bucket thanks to your advanced age the annuitys payout should be handsome  protecting your rear the fourth strategy is a variation on the third take or of your nest egg and spend it down between when you retire and age for instance if you quit the work force at you might spend th of these savings the first year th the second year and so on before you cash in that first th carve out a chunk of savings as a financial backstop in case you live to a ripe old age your financial backstop might be or of your savings which you would annuitize or spend down starting at age alternatively you could designate your home as your financial backstop and plan on taking out a reverse mortgage at age you could even purchase "longevity insurance" from an insurer such as hartford financial or metlife with longevity insurance you hand over a lump sum at say age in return for guaranteed lifetime income starting at age assuming you live that long "nobody knows how long they will live " notes victor friedmann author of "the loafers guide to successful retirement and slow cooking " "im looking at longevity insurance for myself i see it as pure income insurance " a separate "getting going" appears each wednesday in the wall street journal email jonathan clements wsj com
