marketwatch deal or no deal for a home buyer flashy incentives like a new car parked in the driveway or a flat panel television hanging in the den might sound like a good way for home sellers to woo buyers in a dismal real estate market but when it comes to actually enticing someone to buy a home its the more practical perks that count real estate professionals say "serious buyers are looking for a place to buy a home not a trip to tahiti " says dave ledebuhr owner of musselman realty in east lansing mich moreover lenders are leery of gimmicky incentives fearing that theyre built into the price of the home and that loan dollars are being used to pay for that tropical trip he adds instead effective incentives address whats on the minds of potential buyers the overall cost of the home and the monthly payments theyll have to manage he says help in bringing down the interest rate of the mortgage by paying points for example can give one home an advantage over another says dave dalzell owner of dalzell realtors in abilene texas and contributions to the down payment and closing costs could especially be of help to a first time home buyer says greg zadel owner of zadel realty in firestone colo incentives can be considered when the home is first listed as a way to distinguish it from the start mr dalzell says they can also be added when the home hasnt sold in two or three months as a way of enticing a buyer without lowering the price or the incentives could arise in negotiations when a buyer needs that one extra little nudge to commit make no mistake the location and condition of a home are going to be its main selling points but if sellers "put on their buyers cap" and really consider what issues the buyer might have it could make all the difference mr dalzell adds "i tell my seller to look at his bottom line " says susan ramsey a realtor with re max integrity realtors in the phoenix area a seller should figure how low he or she is willing to go factoring in both the selling price and other incentives used to get a buyer to commit but also be aware that most seller concessions need to be disclosed "everything should be in writing and attached to the contract " mr dalzell adds when someone says "lets not tell anybody" about an incentive it could signal imprudence he says in addition buyers and sellers need to make sure that they dont exceed the lenders allowable seller paid assistance mr ledebuhr says below are six of the most common incentives being used in markets today reducing the price a price reduction is often the incentive that is looked at first says delores conway director of the casden forecast at the university of southern californias lusk center for real estate "the price is something that is a common currency it appeals to everybody " she says gene rivers who owns four keller williams real estate offices in florida agrees if a buyer has in her mind that shell pay &# for a home and the seller wont budge from &# "&# in closing costs and a plasma tv aint going to get it done " he says paying points sellers can offer to pay mortgage points for a buyer an incentive that mr dalzell tends to use in environments like todays when rising interest rates are at the front of a buyers mind one point is of the loan amount charged as prepaid interest "when a buyer sees a lower interest rate or monthly payment thats something they can relate to " he says the setup makes sense for a buyer who has to buy furnishings for the new place it also can make for an easier monthly payment transition for families that are upsizing buyers should understand however that the lower rate often lasts only from one to three years before accepting understand and plan for the point in time when the mortgage bill will increase down payment aid for some buyers the hardest part of entering the ranks of homeownership is the down payment also an area where a seller can help its mostly first time home buyers interested in this kind of assistance because theyre often the ones lacking in funds to complete a deal mr zadel says "it gets people into homeownership " he says "the disadvantage is that the buyer is financing that additional amount " he adds because a seller would likely come down in the price of the home if a chunk werent dedicated to down payment assistance closing costs help closing costs include items ranging from legal fees to title insurance and can add up ranging between and of the loan value according to freddie mac so many buyers especially those stretching to make a down payment will be interested in having a seller help out in phoenix buyers in every price range have been asking that these costs be covered according to re maxs ms ramsey "they ask for it because they know that theyll get it " she says adding a warranty a residential service contract is sometimes thrown in as an incentive because it acts as insurance for a homes systems often including plumbing heating and cooling at a cost of a few hundred dollars some real estate agents consider it an inexpensive add on that affords a buyer a little extra peace of mind mr dalzell says that peace of mind can be especially welcome during the first year in a house the little things other perks will appeal to buyers too ranging from the common to the unique payment of homeowner association fees typically associated with condo developments are sometimes offered ms ramsey says that a seller with a swimming pool might also offer a years worth of upkeep for it a welcome help for those worried about the maintenance of the backyard attraction or maybe if a corner of the home was designed for a grand piano leaving that instrument behind entices a buyer to go through with the deal uscs ms conway says
