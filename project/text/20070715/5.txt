getting going when the self in self interest isnt you financial experts say the darndest things wall street is a nonstop talkfest with pundits proffering predictions brokers pitching products and everybody carping about everybody else all this of course is driven by barely disguised self interest that brings me to the three contentions below i am not arguing that these claims are totally absurd but maybe thats because im too polite  "lifecycle funds are a lousy investment " these funds which offer one stop shopping by combining a slew of investments in a single portfolio are among the fastest growing mutual fund categories yet lately i have received a bunch of emails from financial advisers including advisers i respect attacking these funds their beef when investors buy lifecycle funds they get a cookie cutter portfolio that may not be appropriate for them advisers also complain that some lifecycle funds are too risky or too conservative or they dont like the individual investments held within the funds there may be something to these quibbles but they are indeed quibbles and they are more than offset by the advantages these funds offer lifecycle funds were developed primarily to help k plan investors who often struggle to build sensible portfolios as best i can tell the funds are a great choice for these investors so why the whining from financial advisers could it be that these folks feel a little threatened a talented adviser may be able to build you a better portfolio but it may not be a whole lot better and maybe not enough to justify the advisers fee  "dont fund your k " if your finances look anything like mine your two biggest assets are your house and the money in your employers k plan this is bad news for stockbrokers and financial planners after all advisers cant earn fees and commissions on your home equity and until you retire or change jobs your k balance is usually out of reach this however hasnt deterred unscrupulous advisers lets start with k plans i have yet to hear anybody suggest that investors avoid k plans entirely but some advisers have taken to arguing that employees should contribute only enough to get the full company match their claim when you fund a k you are setting yourself up for huge tax bills later and thus it isnt worth maxing out on these plans instead these advisers argue that this money should be invested in some other way such as through the adviser getting suspicious you should be the reality is k plans are a great deal even if you arent getting a company match and i wouldnt skip contributions except maybe to fund a roth or tax deductible individual retirement account suppose you have &# in pretax income to invest you are in the federal income tax bracket and you figure your investments will double in value over the next decade if you stick the &# in your k your money will grow to &# after years if you then cashed out the account and paid in taxes you would be left with &# in fact even if your tax bracket climbed to you would have &# now instead imagine you skipped the k and invested through a regular taxable account right off the bat you would lose to income taxes leaving you with &# lets assume that &# also doubles over the next years to &# somehow you avoid paying any tax along the way by say investing in a tax managed stock fund you then sell paying tax at the preferential long term capital gains rate after that tax bill you would be left with &# thats less than you would have with your k even if your tax bracket rose to in retirement  "your mortgage is too small " when unethical advisers arent attacking k plans they are making a play for the other big pot of money which is home equity their contention you should always have the largest mortgage possible at first blush this seems reasonable a mortgage is usually the cheapest way for ordinary folks to borrow thanks to the low interest rates and the mortgage interest tax deduction imagine you have a mortgage and you are once again in the income tax bracket your after tax borrowing cost would be a mere this is the return you effectively earn by paying down your mortgage there are lots of things that should earn you more than including funding a k investing through an ira and buying stocks in a regular taxable account indeed you should take advantage of all these opportunities before you make extra principal payments on your mortgage but some advisers go even further arguing that you should remortgage your house every so often freeing up home equity that can be invested through the adviser the adviser would then collect hefty commissions by sticking you in say stock mutual funds or cash value life insurance this could be a profitable strategy provided the investments bought deliver an after cost after tax return thats higher than your mortgages after tax interest rate but there are alas no guarantees in the national association of securities dealers became sufficiently concerned that it issued an investor alert "unlike investing with savings when you invest with mortgage money you stand to lose more than your principal if the investment goes sour " the nasd warned "you can lose the collateral supporting the loan namely your house even if you dont lose your house you could lose the equity in your home that may have built up over a considerable period of time " remember buying stocks and purchasing some types of cash value life insurance can be mighty risky especially if you are doing it with borrowed money but in fact as you age you should be looking to take less overall financial risk and gradually paying down a mortgage achieves just that got an adviser who is disparaging lifecycle funds telling you to throttle back on your k contributions and suggesting you remortgage your house maybe its time to find a new adviser
