ask dow jones q i bought a duplex for &# and its now worth about &# i was planning to leave it to my daughter what amount of federal estate tax would there be a j san diego calif a the answer depends on the size of your total estate including the duplex even though the federal estate tax or as critics have dubbed it the "death tax" has attracted large amounts of news coverage most people dont have to worry about it at all since it applies to a relatively small group of wealthy americans for this year the basic exemption is &# million and the top estate tax rate is thats also the exemption level and the top tax rate for in the exemption is set to rise to &# million which will greatly reduce the number of estates subject to the tax note transfers to a spouse typically are free from the tax in the federal estate tax is scheduled to disappear entirely only to reappear in but dont count on the tax to vanish entirely in or any other year with congress concerned about big budget deficits and looking for additional revenue lawmakers probably wont eliminate this tax completely congress may compromise by raising the exemption level to somewhere around &# million and reducing the top rate but nobody knows for sure if you leave the duplex to your daughter in your will theres another provision you should be aware of known as "step up in basis " suppose your daughter eventually sells the duplex under current law her tax basis typically would be the duplexs value on the date of your death not the &# you originally paid for it most lawyers ive spoken with think the basic step up in basis rules that are in place today will be retained even if congress agrees to overhaul the federal estate tax
