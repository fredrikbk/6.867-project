love &amp money so many interests so little time ive always wanted to play the guitar or maybe the clarinet in recent years ive also toyed with the idea of taking chinese language lessons and signing up for a culinary school here in town but theres a hitch in my plans my kids i spend so much time and energy and money catering to their extracurricular activities that its near impossible to devote any time or energy to the activities id like to pursue my wife amy feels the same way she has been wanting to take a painting class for years but finding the minutes let alone an hour in the day is pretty much impossible whats more if either of us does make plans we often end up having to cancel or postpone them in order to attend one of our childrens events so here we sit amy and i still unable to paint still not conversant in chinese still clueless about the clarinet at the same time our son has become quite the soccer player and has dabbled in baseball cub scouts and band among other endeavors while our young daughter has just recently joined a dance class i recognize that part of being a parent is giving up some of your wants in favor of giving your child more opportunities but does parenthood by definition mean that parents must abandon who we are as people in other words when do mom and dad get to reclaim a piece of their own lives part of this problem is most definitely our fault as parents we cater too much to our kids these days a character flaw i am as guilty of as anyone if our child expresses a fleeting interest in tennis we immediately sign him up for lessons if a child says it would be fun to join a local acting group we dont think twice about it the result is that we throw an ever increasing amount of time and money at our kids activities pushing our own adult desires to the sidelines amy and i have done that for years when we lived in new jersey a language school stood just outside the doors of my train station and each evening for more than a year i told myself as i walked past that i was going to enroll in mandarin classes i figured i could pop in once a week on my way to my car from the train i wouldnt have to go out of my way or make special arrangements it was perfect alas the only chinese i picked up came off the back of the fortunes at chinese restaurants given my extended work schedule and my commute taking away from the family more of my time in the evening seemed unworkable similarly signing up for saturday classes meant id have to skip my sons baseball and soccer games unfair to a year old who really wanted dad in attendance and while the cost of the chinese lessons was within our budget i couldnt quite justify to myself the added expense i found its even hard to make time for lessons at home a few years ago i picked up a computer based language program rationalizing that if i couldnt attend a language class i could at least teach myself chinese in the evenings on my laptop today i can proudly say dog cat and horse in mandarin and thats it my longtime friend tara actually got me thinking about this issue because she has signed up for golf lessons "for me its really been that i havent wanted to spend the money " she says "its kind of ridiculous considering i will spend &# a year on piano gymnastics dance and tennis for my daughter but four golf lessons will cost me &# why is it so hard for me to spend this on myself " grown ups she says should "get to learn and try new things too " i only need look at our annual spending plan to know how amy and i approach this were currently budgeting nearly &# a month that over the next year will go to pay for our kids lessons and camps weve budgeted precisely zilch for ourselves is this just a function of having two relatively young kids ages and whose needs come first or are amy and i shortchanging ourselves when i asked amy about why she doesnt take a painting class the response i got was part annoyed part dismissive "why are you even asking me this " she said "i dont pursue anything i want to do because i dont know where id fit it into my day why do i even need to consider this i can barely work in a minute workout a few times a week " i know how she feels ive forced myself to carve minutes a week from my schedule to play soccer because as a stay at home worker who only sees the walls of my house i had to find something to do outside the home still playing a sport ive played since sixth grade is not actually learning something new my friends in new orleans drew and colleen give me some hope that this might just be an age related phase that once our kids are old enough to chaperone themselves amy and i will have time to pursue some of the wants weve continually put off "it hasnt been until recently that i have endeavored to do stuff for me " colleen says she has started taking piano lessons and has begun training for a mile charity bike ride its possible colleen says "because our two children are now at the age of caring for themselves and this has been very freeing to us " still her training must be geared around the kids schedule colleen rides on a river levee behind her office during lunch and wakes up early on the weekends she says "to get a ride in before all the fun starts " drew adds that he tries to make time for the activities he enjoys such as sports photography and running "though i am not entirely successful " but by drews calculation "your kids will move out on their own one day and you need to have your own pursuits to keep you active and happy " meaning you need to find time for yourself now before those days arrive i agree though time remains the impossible commodity i am however trying to persuade amy to take a painting class i think shed benefit from that more than id benefit from chinese lessons at the moment and someone has to stick around to watch over the kids but she doesnt know if she has the time just yet
