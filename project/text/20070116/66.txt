politics &amp economics u k auditions litigation regulators urge u s style suits against cartels u s lawyers are establishing a beachhead in london for a potentially lucrative european expansion of private suits against cartels prominent u s law firms are stepping up hiring in the english capital as british regulators encourage more u s style lawsuits against companies that engage in illegal price fixing "theres a lot that can be learned from the american system " said philip collins chairman of the office of fair trading the united kingdoms antitrust watchdog but he warned "we must take a measured approach " in a groundbreaking move the first american plaintiffs firm is planting its flag in europe cohen milstein hausfeld &amp toll announced the opening of a london office this month "theres a backlog of situations where european victims of cartels have had little to no redress while victims in the u s canada and australia have recovered significant sums " said michael hausfeld a partner at cohen milstein a group of vitamin producing companies in recent years has paid out more than &# billion to food producers and others harmed by a massive international vitamin cartel mr hausfeld said based on his own estimates of private settlements yet only plaintiffs with operations in the u s received a share of the settlement because u s courts dont have jurisdiction to hear suits by foreign plaintiffs and european litigation wasnt considered feasible he added even so business advocates in the u s are worried "were watching very closely what we see as an attempt to export the u s tort system to europe " said linda kelly a vice president of the nonprofit institute for legal reform an affiliate of the u s chamber of commerce that promotes tort reform in the past dozen years congress has passed tort reform laws that have tried to rein in the ability of plaintiffs lawyers to file lawsuits to limited effect accounting and stock scandals in recent years have proved a bonanza for trial lawyers with settlements in securities class action cases reaching a record level of &# billion in according to cornerstone research a consultancy in washington the chamber of commerce and other advocates of tort reform have long pointed to europe as a model for the u s europe has long resisted american style tort law believing it encourages expensive frivolous lawsuits laws in europe mandating that the loser in a suit must pay all legal costs have discouraged plaintiffs who may end up with big debts to shoulder if they lose a case against a corporations team of lawyers whats new in europe is the growing movement among regulators to stress what they call the public benefits of lawsuits in the antitrust area private lawsuits in effect deputize victims of price fixing schemes to help overworked regulators punish and deter corporate fraud mr collins and others argue london is attractive as a base because the british share a language and legal culture with americans unlike many other jurisdictions in europe plaintiffs in the u k can demand documents from defendants to prove their case a process called discovery in the u s and a u k court precedent allows victims of cartels to sue for lost profits throughout europe not just losses incurred in the u k as a result lawyers say london is becoming a kind of laboratory for a larger push to encourage more such lawsuits throughout the nation bloc an effort that has been publicly championed by european union antitrust commissioner neelie kroes "i think what we are going to see is the u k will be the first out of the box in europe " said alan wiseman the managing partner for antitrust litigation at washington law firm howrey llp which is hiring partners in london to handle an expected increase in cartel work on both the defense and plaintiffs side mr collins the british antitrust regulator said his agency may lobby judges to waive loser pays rules more often to encourage more suits "the u k does in fact grant judges considerable flexibility " he said also caps on attorneys fees have discouraged litigation in europe in the u s plaintiffs lawyers often fund victims cases typically taking to of any settlement or award in exchange for having assumed the financial risk if they lose they get nothing for their work but when a settlement is hundreds of millions of dollars u s trial lawyers can hit the jackpot european lawyers however generally cant level such contingency fees in britain the best they can do is ask a judge to approve doubling their hourly rate a new lawsuit financing industry in the u k is emerging that gets around some of these problems hedge funds insurers and private investors have begun putting up money for lawsuits in exchange for a share of any awards while this is a good development for cartel victims who want to sue without assuming financial risk such financing still doesnt allow trial lawyers to cash in mr hausfeld said there are strategic advantages beyond money to opening an office in london "many cartels today are international and the defendants want global settlements " he said being in a position to put cases to rest on both sides of the atlantic will give plaintiffs more leverage and bring cases to a quicker close he added but ms kelly of the legal reform institute says american trial lawyers are pursuing a "market expansion strategy" in europe "the plaintiffs bar is extremely innovative and creative when you have reform in one arena you find a different way to bring claims and pursue lines of litigation " she said fertile ground the u k is ripe for a boom in u s style lawsuits against cartels which may portend a rise in such suits across europe here are four reasons why plaintiffs in the u k get a limited form of pretrial "discovery to obtain evidence from defendants of corporate fraud private investors are funding lawsuits in exchange for a percentage of any award neutralizing "loser pays rules that discourage suits victims of price fixing schemes can sue in the u k for profits lost throughout europe the common english language is attracting american lawyers with cartel experience
