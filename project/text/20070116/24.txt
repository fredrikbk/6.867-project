earnings stretch run if corporate growth slows stocks could look too pricey even as the stock market has zoomed to records since autumn investors have been paying relatively little for each dollar in corporate profits that is because earnings have enjoyed an even longer more frenzied boom of their own up more than every quarter for more than three years running now as fourth quarter results are beginning to roll in stocks could start to look more expensive relative to companies earnings many wall street pros have been predicting that heady profit growth will slow in coming months while share prices continue to rise if those expectations hold true investors who jump into the market now might be rewarded but finding bargains in the market could gradually get more difficult as the year plays out "the earnings numbers were expecting arent bad in historic terms its just that weve been spoiled the last couple of years " says ashwani kaul of reuters estimates which tracks wall streets earnings expectations both reuters and thomson financial which also tracks earnings estimates say analysts expect that fourth quarter earnings at companies in the standard &amp poors stock index rose more than although they acknowledge the final tallies could come in a bit higher fourth quarter earnings growth will come almost entirely from financial basic materials and telecommunications companies mr kaul says many of those companies will be helped by a decline in crude oil prices in the last quarter of that same trend however along with difficult to match comparisons with s booming fourth quarter will likely hobble big name energy producers like exxon mobil "its a more top heavy earnings season which probably tells you this run weve been on will come to an end in the next quarter or two " mr kaul says mike thompson director of research at thomson financial adds that the consumer discretionary sector may offer hidden opportunities for investors looking for profit growth according to thomson data wall street analysts expectation is that the sectors earnings fell in the fourth quarter if home builders and auto maker ford motor are removed from the calculation analysts surveyed by thomson expect the remaining companies profit growth to be more than mr thompson says "when you look at that sector its really the sort of number that people should be careful not to react to in a knee jerk way " he says "i think a lot of people will be surprised at the strength at most of those companies " the fourth quarter earnings season got off to a solid start last week when aluminum maker alcoa a component of the blue chip dow jones industrial average announced a rise in its net that set an upbeat mood for the market complemented by another drop in crude oil prices which plunged for the week off &# to &# a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange for the week the industrials rose points or to the broad s&amp p climbed or to the technology heavy nasdaq composite index rallied or to according to both thomson and reuters the s&amp p is trading at less than times this years expected earnings which is cheap compared with long term averages of about times earnings both reuters and thomson financial say that once all the earnings reports are in hand growth could come in at more than extending companies record streak of double digit increases consensus profit expectations tend to be too low early in every earnings season as many corporate executives in their regular comments to analysts tend to lowball their projections so that the actual numbers will look more impressive many wall street pros argue against a market decline or a contraction in earnings pointing to the u s economy which is still expanding albeit at a more modest pace lately jittery investors who turned to treasury bonds as a haven may come back to the stock market in the months ahead bidding shares higher and pushing the s&amp p s price earnings ratio perhaps to by the end of the year says duncan richardson chief investment officer at mutual fund firm eaton vance corp he reasons that year treasurys are yielding less than while he expects the dow industrials and s&amp p to rise more than this year on the heels of even bigger increases in "investors are seeing that every dollar they put in stocks is treated twice as well " he says "yes stocks are a riskier asset but thats also what can lead to greater rewards " binky chadha chief u s equity strategist at deutsche bank has more modest expectations including a rise in the s&amp p which he estimates would boost that indexs p e ratio to about but not much further he says many investors have been disappointed recently by signs that the federal reserve may not cut its key interest rate targets until later in the year than previously expected lower interest rates tend to help stocks because they lower borrowing costs and encourage spending by businesses and consumers and make stocks more attractive compared with bonds with foreign central banks raising their rates lately and effectively reducing the supply of their local currencies the dollar could weaken this year on foreign exchange markets mr chadha says that should help keep s&amp p earnings high as big name companies in the index are increasingly dependent on profits from overseas operations about of s&amp p profits now come from overseas which is roughly double the proportion from years ago he says if the dollar weakens earnings generated in strengthening foreign currencies would look more impressive when translated onto a quarterly report in dollar terms
