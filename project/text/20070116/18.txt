cash back as card fees climb merchants push pins they battle banks over debit checkouts paying for a signature stewart munson is quietly hurting the nations banks from the checkout counter of his st louis bike shop every time a maplewood bicycle customer pays with a debit card for a purchase of more than &# instead of asking for a signature mr munson hands over a small device and asks the shopper to enter a four digit personal identification number or pin the customer might not see a distinction but it matters to mr munson of all the fees merchants pay to process plastic those for purchases made with a pin are among the lowest "its the no thing that we can do on our end to save quite a bit of money " says the year old cycling enthusiast who estimates that using pins could cut his card processing costs by a fourth last year he paid about &# in fees to banks and middlemen that handle card processing his shop rings up annual sales of nearly &# million fed up with the rising cost of accepting plastic a growing number of merchants are taking matters into their own hands in the industry the practice is known as "steering" encouraging customers to pay using methods that carry low transaction fees in particular pin based debit cards steering may be a boon to merchants but theres a potential downside for consumers banks rarely offer debit card rewards if customers use a pin thats because banks want to encourage customers to sign which earns them a higher fee in some stores it can be hard to figure out how to sign when payment devices are set to ask for a pin some of the nations biggest retailers such as wal mart stores inc and cvs corp have been steering customers to pin debit machines for years now say industry consultants analysts and some retailers the practice is gaining steam especially among mom and pop retailers that arent easily counted "lots of merchants we are talking to are installing pin pads to cut costs " says mallory duncan general counsel for the washington d c national retail federation a trade group that represents million stores the rationale for pin fees dates back more than a decade when financial institutions cut fees to encourage merchants to accept plastic for small purchases since then pin fees have stayed below the price charged for signature transactions for example according to visa usa inc the countrys largest card network a typical supermarket pays cents in fees when a customer buys &# of groceries with a debit card and a pin the fee rises to cents for a signature debit transaction and can be more than cents when a customer uses a plain vanilla credit card the fees go mostly to the banks issuing cards and to other companies that process the transactions the banks in turn pay fees to visa and mastercard inc the costs borne by the merchant depend on myriad factors including size business and the type of card some fees are flat while others are a percentage of the transaction amount the issue has come to the forefront because americans are pulling out plastic more than ever electronic payments surpassed the use of cash and checks for the first time in consumers now use cards to pay for daily purchases at the grocery store and fast food restaurants debit cards account for the majority of transactions processed by visa which dominates the debit card business in the three months ended sept nearly two thirds of visas billion transactions came from debit cards as the use of plastic has grown banks and credit card companies have been pitching new credit cards loaded with juicy perks and rewards merchants typically pay higher fees on these cards than on other credit cards the cost of accepting and processing electronic transactions is a source of growing tension small merchants and big chains like safeway inc and walgreen co have filed lawsuits accusing payment companies of price fixing collusion and conspiracy in the setting of fees the lawsuits which have been consolidated are pending in federal court in brooklyn n y meanwhile retailers are targeting fees where they can at the checkout "for years merchants didnt feel like they could do anything about it and now they have latched onto pin steering to lower their transaction fee costs " says bruce cundiff a senior analyst at javelin strategy &amp research a consulting firm in pleasanton calif j c penney co plans to soon replace its year old computer payment system by installing new devices that allow the department store chain to accept pin debit payments for the first time the system now being tested in of its more than stores has a prominent pin pad for debit card transactions "were not attempting to influence the decision but were allowing the customer to make the choice " says tom clerkin j c penneys senior vice president for finance the lower costs associated with pin debit were one factor the company considered he says mr clerkin wouldnt say how much j c penney was likely to save in fees sears holdings corp is also installing a new payment system at stores that automatically prompts debit card users for a pin "certainly there are efficiencies that we achieve through the new updated system " says sears spokesman chris brathwaite "first and foremost we see this as an opportunity to give customers greater choice on how they pay for their purchases " the prospect of lower costs was a factor for drive in restaurant sonic corp which is installing pin pads at its locations "there is a break point in the transaction amount at which it becomes a saving for us " says stephen vaughn chief financial officer of the oklahoma city based chain he wouldnt provide details of the anticipated savings but said the pin pads are currently in place at about locations currently about two million merchant locations have the technology in place to accept pin debit transactions compared with about six million for credit cards and debit cards requiring a signature according to a recent study by mercator advisory group inc an industry consulting firm ken paterson a senior analyst at the waltham mass firm says he expects the number to grow as merchants calculate whether the savings from pin debit transactions will cover the cost of installing the devices mr paterson estimates that large retailers can convert to of their debit purchases to pin transactions assuming that merchants can save cents on each transaction a retailer with million annual electronic purchases can save &# million by steering he says the mechanics of steering have become easier and cheaper with advancements in technology merchants who physically take debit cards from customers can enter the payment as a pin transaction and hand over a device on which customers enter their code the process is even simpler when the customer does the swiping the retailer programs the checkout device to automatically prompt for a pin rather than a signature when the debit card is used pin based debit "is always the first option that we present to customers " says mike dangelis a spokesman for cvs which operates about drugstores in states and has been steering customers for about six years customers who want to sign for a debit transaction can find it unwieldy to do so at terminals being tested by j c penney for example customers who want to sign must hit a "credit" button to the right of the pin pad mr clerkin says customers havent expressed confusion about the system at walgreen the nations largest drugstore chain by revenue when shoppers swipe their card and hit the "debit" key the machine asks them to punch in a pin or hit the "credit" button to sign for a debit transaction a customer has to hit "cancel " then "credit " the purchase amount is then displayed finally the customer can sign for the transaction a spokeswoman for the deerfield ill based company declined to comment on the chains payment system although it is permitted under their rules credit card companies are critical of steering in part because it annoys their customers the banks visa and mastercard cant easily raise fees on pin debit transactions without provoking the ire of merchants "unfortunately consumers are put in the middle when merchants steer " says stacey pinkerd senior vice president for consumer debit products at visa "some terminals are programmed in such a way that its difficult for consumers to choose their payment option " banks are trying to make signature debit payments more attractive for customers in one of the most popular strategies banks are developing debit rewards programs that dole out points for signature transactions pin debit users typically dont receive rewards for purchases j p morgan chase &amp co for example offers a mastercard debit card that gives customers frequent flier miles on continental airlines starting next month pin debit transactions wont qualify a j p morgan spokesman says the bank is changing the terms of the continental debit card to match its united airlines debit card which also doesnt provide rewards for pin transactions the bank is reducing the annual fee to &# from &# another downside visa and mastercard guarantee theyll reimburse unauthorized purchases only when debit card purchased are signed for they say they arent responsible for pin debit transactions because those can be routed through other companies networks such as morgan stanleys pulse and first data corp s star consumers are unlikely to be stuck with any fraudulent pin debit purchases under federal law cardholders arent liable for more than &# if they report unauthorized purchases within a certain period of time banks also often provide some protection to their customers adding to the confusion some signature debit transactions often dont even require a signature last year visa and mastercard began allowing merchants to eliminate the signature requirement on purchases of less than &# the merchant still pays the signature debit rate the move was aimed at moving consumers more quickly through checkout lines new "contactless" cards that consumers can hold next to a reader without a swipe are also considered to be "signature" transactions steven gottlieb a year old wall street analyst who regularly uses a debit card to pay for lunch groceries and movie rentals says hes bewildered by the array of payment options he typically enters a pin but feels more secure signing for purchases especially if he can get rewards by doing so "why would i want to use a pin if i dont have to " he asks mr munson the bike store owner says he allows customers to sign for purchases if they prefer when he sits down with employees for a meeting later this month he wants to discuss three topics first he will tell them that the store is formalizing a trade in program for childrens bicycles secondly he wants workers to greet customers within seconds of entering the store and lastly he will remind them to keep steering customers to pin debit payments "i need to re emphasize how important this is to the bottom line " he says
