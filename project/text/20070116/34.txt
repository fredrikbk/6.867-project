hollywood agent caa is playing a new game with superstar clients like tom cruise and jennifer aniston creative artists agency has long been among the top talent firms in hollywood now it is making an unexpected run for glory in a completely different arena sports the los angeles based caa gained instant notoriety in the sports management business last year when it hired a handful of powerful sports agents including tom condon and ken kremer who represent football star peyton manning and casey close who handles baseball shortstop derek jeter now the closely held firm is plunging even deeper into the sports business last week it was involved in luring soccer icon david beckham to the los angeles galaxy soccer team in a five year deal that will pay him &# million a year to play for the galaxy and with endorsements and profit sharing agreements could earn him as much as &# million over the life of the deal as early as this week according to people familiar with the matter caa is expected to finalize a deal to acquire the sports representation business of leon rose an attorney and agent now working for a philadelphia area law firm mr rose who didnt return calls for comment represents national basketball association superstars lebron james and allen iverson among others the expected pact with mr rose would significantly deepen caas bench of heavy hitting sports agents and establish a solid foothold in yet another league sport basketball caa officials have been reluctant to discuss their moves into sports management but they come at a time when entertainment talent firms generally are pressured by attempts in hollywood to rein in the cushy deals for actors directors and producers that agencies like caa have long lived on with perhaps the largest assortment of marquee entertainment clients and successful ancillary businesses like marketing and film financing the year old firm is arguably better positioned than its rivals but how to grow in a challenging environment remains a concern people familiar with caas thinking say it is ramping up its sports marketing area in which it forges deals between athletes and corporate clients as well as scouring the landscape for new agent hires the agency sees sports as a component of the larger entertainment landscape in which the talent athletes in this case can generate big dollars through endorsements deals still its a big break from caas comfort zone unlike traditional film and television talent deals which offer an agent commissions on salaries of as much as &# million per project pro sports players unions typically cap agent fees at or less and lucrative endorsement contracts for all but the most prominent players can be tricky to come by "your average backup offensive lineman in the nfl isnt signing big endorsement deals " says leigh steinberg the newport beach calif sports agent who lost star national football league prospect matt leinart to caa last spring just before he signed with the arizona cardinals nonetheless says mr steinberg theres inherent value to the business "in an economy thats problematic sports like entertainment is still profitable " sports management firms can overcome low on field deal commissions with volume building big rosters of clients in each league sport to help create a steady stream of revenue from on field representation or they can focus on a handful of star players some of caas competitors in the sports business are also increasingly focused on just a few big clients cleveland based img a diversified sports management firm founded in by the legendary agent mark mccormack appears to be moving in that direction since leveraged buyout specialist teddy forstmann bought the company in for &# million img has grown less and less concerned about keeping a wide swath of agents prompting a number to defect to caa it is focusing instead on non management businesses like golf course design and content distribution into new media formats as the case of lebron james demonstrates it isnt necessarily clear what caa will get out of those arrangements in the near term to be sure scoring mr james a cleveland cavaliers forward and one of the biggest names in basketball would be a huge coup that expected deal was reported yesterday in the sports business journal but mr james last summer extended his current contract for up to four years and an estimated &# million meaning new commissions for caa could be several years away at least and while the year old prodigy has signed significant endorsement deals with a variety of retailers and consumer goods companies including a seven year agreement with nike inc valued at &# million his marketing ventures are handled not by his agent but by business manager maverick carter and other longtime friends mr carter didnt return a call seeking comment breaking into the sports representation business could also be challenging say rivals because its such a different game from the world of entertainment to which caa is accustomed unlike studio chiefs and television producers who can sometimes be cajoled into hiring packages of actors from a given talent firm or hiring a certain actor for one picture in hopes of getting access to a more prestigious actor for another league sports operate on a far more defined system when it comes to hiring the ability to make a compelling deal for a typical league player "is dependent on the value of the player in the marketplace and the interest of the buying teams which there are only a closed number of " says casey wasserman whose company wasserman media group llc represents the l a dodgers first baseman nomar garciaparra and houston rockets basketball star tracy mcgrady "there is no leverage by mass or leverage by other relationships in sports " but it hasnt stopped a handful of hollywood agencies from giving the business a shot the william morris agency an old line entertainment agency that represented frank sinatra now handles a handful of top sports players including tennis star serena williams and young golfer michelle wie the smaller gersh agency also know for representing film and television personalities also operates a dedicated sports division caa however has built up the most muscle among its entertainment business peers in a surprise move last april the firm hired mr condon and mr kremer senior football agents at img who represent coveted players like mr manning quarterback of the indianapolis colts his brother eli manning the new york giants quarterback and san diego chargers running back ladainian tomlinson days later the firm hired mr close another img veteran who represents the yankees mr jeter among others two of imgs powerful hockey agents and another round of prominent football agents followed one area that seems unlikely to bear much fruit for caa finding meaty roles for athlete clients in television or movies despite some notable exceptions such as o j simpsons role in "the naked gun" movie spoofs most are of the variety of the cyclist lance armstrongs brief cameo in the movie "dodgeball a true underdog story" somewhat forgettable jon weinbach contributed to this article
