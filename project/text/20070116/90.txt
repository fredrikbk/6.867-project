the m&amp a forge its hardly a surprise that mittal steel co s move late last month to buy mexican steelmaker sicartsa failed to draw much coverage on the financial pages amid the torrent of megadeals from both the corporate and private equity worlds sicartsas &# billion price tag seemed puny mittal itself had forged a massive &# billion merger with luxembourgs arcelor sa only six months earlier flush with cash and anxious to take advantage of interest rates that are still near historic lows corporate and private equity buyers turned into one of the most explosive years on record for both the number and size of transactions a total deal volume of about &# trillion though a &# billion deal seemed preposterous only a decade ago it now appears to be only a matter of time bank of america and spains bbva are rumored to be circling barclays currently valued at more than &# billion but these periods of deal mania usually end badly for most companies and investors of deals in the u s greater than &# million between and only three in have created meaningful value for shareholders why in most industries do you find some companies thrive doing deals while so many others stumble beyond mittal in the industrial sector witness the acquisition success of nestle in food cisco in technology and the royal bank of scotland in financial services to name just a few our research shows that the most successful opportunists share a set of characteristics that they have consciously developed over time the winners tend to make mergers and acquisitions central to their strategies they study and learn from their mistakes they nurture m&amp a as a core competency and build a team to preserve institutional knowledge they tend to focus mostly on small and medium deals not blockbusters and when they do pursue megadeals they only do so when it is both strategically and organizationally appropriate this gets us back to mittal its true that the netherlands based steel giant only established itself as the undisputed steel industry king when it prevailed in its protracted battle to merge with rival arcelor but the companys success in consolidating the steel industry has been written over years of doing many much smaller deals like the one for sicartsa which furthered its well honed strategy of creating leadership positions in each market it serves in many ways mittal is typical of the kinds of companies that stood out as winners in an analysis we did of public firms and more than acquisitions in six industrialized countries over the years from to given the overall odds of success one might assume that the most persistent buyers would be the worst performers but we found that u s frequent acquirers outperformed occasional buyers by a factor of and non buyers by almost two to one with similar results in europe and japan frequent acquirers succeed because they tend to be expert acquirers interviews with deal czars at these companies reveal that they prepare carefully to create opportunities the deal team and there typically is a permanent well supported team of experts works from an established playbook built on years of deal learning so the company can efficiently recognize deals that fit strategically evaluate them seal the contract and then successfully integrate the acquired business winners also tend to have a series of checks and balances in place to kill deal fever and maintain a rational dispassionate approach mittal has a thin corporate staff and a small but highly experienced squad of m&amp a experts starting three decades ago founder lakshmi mittal began consolidating the industry to take advantage of scale in raw material purchasing manufacturing and servicing large customers he spent the early years stringing together steel plants in low cost countries from kazakhstan to south africa he didnt launch a blockbuster until when he scooped up ohio based international steel group inc the arcelor merger then was the culmination of a long learning curve theres no denying that mittal has taken on a huge amount of risk with his arcelor foray some have already suggested that mittal is exerting too much power over arcelor in the merger even without such friction integrating the two giants would be an enormous and perilous undertaking whether he will ultimately succeed is impossible to know but history would suggest that a company like mittal has a much better chance of surviving a game changing deal than the many who wander in unprepared messrs rouse and harding co lead the global m&amp a practice at bain &amp company mr harding co authored "mastering the merger four critical decisions that make or break deals" hbs press mr duval is a partner in paris
