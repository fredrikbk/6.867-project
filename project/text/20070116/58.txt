new profit driver in europe coal mines bertholene france private investors across western europe are betting they can succeed in an industry in which governments have failed for decades coal mining the efforts reflect a revival of interest in marginal fossil fuel deposits despite political pressure to curb carbon dioxide emissions as europe searches for new ways to produce energy amid increasing demand soaring energy prices are convincing entrepreneurs to invest hundreds of millions of euros in ventures considered unviable just a few years ago france which nationalized its coal industry after world war ii closed its last coal mine three years ago conceding the dirty and costly industry couldnt compete with cheap coal from south africa and colombia but now small london listed coal miner ath resources ltd believes it can profitably mine million metric tons five million tons over the next decade out of a mine shut down years ago in bertholene a village about kilometers miles south of paris "high energy prices are changing the economics of energy production " says ian cronshaw an analyst at the international energy agency "previously expensive areas may become more economic especially with newer techniques in europe coal both locally mined and imported can provide valuable benefits in providing a more balanced and diversified energy supply " aths project which has yet to gain final government approval which can take years is the most advanced of several attempts to revive coal mining in france initiatives also include a billion euros &# billion plan by a former senior suez sa executive to mine an untouched million ton coal deposit in lucenay les aix about kilometers from paris and power an adjacent megawatt plant that would sell power to clients in the wholesale market but some government and industry officials question the viability of the plans the residents of bertholene and other proposed mine locations are also strongly against the idea because they fear their traditional livelihoods will be destroyed "i personally have doubts " says bernard dupraz head of power generation at electricite de france sa frances state owned power giant he says he cant see why coal reserves judged unprofitable not so long ago would suddenly and durably turn profitable france relies on nuclear power for more than of its power production but also imports about million metric tons of coal each year from south africa australia and colombia to provide about of its annual power needs the rest comes from hydroelectricity and other renewable energy projects as well as a few natural gas and fuel fired plants but faced with increasing demand edf one of the worlds largest nuclear plant operators plans to continue to use imported coal for additional power the company plans to revamp nine of its coal fired power plants to prolong their lifetimes beyond when a european directive imposes stricter carbon dioxide emission rules on coal use it may also build a new coal plant in mr dupraz says edfs smaller rivals endesa france a unit of spanish power giant endesa sa and poweo sa have said they want to increase their coal based power generation other experts cite a growing number of up and running coal mining operations in britain and germany as evidence coal mining can be viable in western europe "higher coal prices and less labor intensive more productive safer surface mining technology have made small coal mining ventures profitable " said analyst charles kernot of research and brokerage firm seymour pierce it makes sense now to restart old underground mines in which less than of the coal was actually extracted on average he adds in the last three years prices for steam coal delivered to western european ports have jumped more than two thirds to about &# to &# or about euros to euros a metric ton from &# due to demand from china and india the iea says prices are expected to remain at high levels for the next few decades mr kernot adds aths project would be able to extract coal for euros euros a metric ton in bertholene and break even within two years says brian coppack the chairman of the companys operations in france he is waiting for government approval to start ground tests in the next few weeks ath has also sought permission to mine a hectare acre coalfield in commentry kilometers north of bertholene the two projects together will require investment of million euros mr coppack says local opposition is generally stiff fueled by environmental concerns bertholenes farmers would be compensated for the potential loss of revenue from cattle grazing and the central government and the region would receive a total of million euros in taxes during the mines life mr coppack says after the mine is closed the land would be rehabilitated he adds still residents have hired a lawyer and are determined to defend their grazing land and their chestnut forests where they hunt partridge and boar "ath is going to mine for a few years and leave us with a potential environmental disaster weve had enough " says bertholenes deputy mayor jacques maisonabe
