eyes on the road build it or bag it cast your vote on some of the concepts unveiled by auto makers at the detroit show its january and that can only mean one thing its time to play "build it or bag it " the game that allows readers to register their votes on some of the design ideas put forward by auto makers at the north american international auto show in detroit this years show which opened to the public saturday after media previews last week lacked a knockout show car designed for actual production comparable to last years chevy camaro concept which is indeed headed to showrooms in about two years some media folks complained that this years show was relatively quiet reflecting perhaps the overhanging uncertainty about the prospects of the big detroit based auto giants still the designers and technology futurists who like to use auto shows to gauge interest in their out of the box ideas didnt come up completely empty even as california lawmakers debated rules to limit greenhouse gases ideas for alternatives to century old internal combustion engines took the spotlight in detroit some luxury car brands trotted out eye candy in hopes of persuading a few of wall streets fortunate ones to lay out a sliver of their bonuses for a future addition to the motor pool so heres a look at a few of the potential cars of tomorrow you be the judge chevrolet volt the most talked about concept car at this years show was the chevrolet volt general motors corp s latest salvo in its running battle to convince consumers and lawmakers that its just as serious about greening the automobile as toyota motor corp the volt is a show car but not a real car gm said the volt was designed to exhibit what the company calls its "e flex" propulsion system if that was a real system it would be a twist on current hybrid gas electric cars instead of using a small gas engine to propel the car in tandem with a battery powered electric motor as in the toyota prius the volt would use a small gas engine solely to recharge a lithium ion battery pack electricity from those batteries the same type that power laptop computers would power the vehicle the batteries also could be recharged by plugging in to the power grid perhaps through a normal wall socket thus gm got points for taking seriously the concept of a plug in hybrid which is all the rage in certain circles pros the volts exterior design a scaled down car that borrows strongly from the look of the camaro concept would look pretty good on a real chevy small car and the e flex power system is a great idea using electricity to power a car for much of the morning commute is the kind of innovation the auto industry needs to get behind plug in this exxon cons the technology to make a car like the volt reliable and affordable doesnt exist gm is looking for the federal government to help cover the cost of developing lithium ion batteries that wont cost too much or catch on fire as is the volt is what your kid would do for a high school science project if he or she had a few million dollars jaguar cx f the jaguar cx f was one of the more dramatic show cars on display in detroit among the category of cars that might actually see production autoweek the enthusiast magazine dubbed the cx f "best in show" among the concept cars bristling with technology the cx f show car had a supercharged liter v rated at more than horsepower pros the cx f is a big step forward for jaguar design chief ian callums passionate effort to rescue the brand from irrelevance after years of weakly knocking off staid jaguars of the past the beleaguered british luxury brand now has a potent looking vision of what st century jags might be sporty fast and a little mean cons it should have been on the road years ago toyota ft hs the toyota ft hs concept car is on the surface yet another version of toyotas effort to use gas electric hybrid drive technology for the purposes of boosting power and performance the inelegantly named ft hs fast toyota hybrid system impresses with a gas electric power plant that can produce horsepower from a liter v and fans of toyotas zen master corporate argot cant help but love the companys explanation of how the ft hs "expresses the core values of a toyota brand design strategy that combines two key elements j factor and vibrant clarity " pros get ready for the son of supra after a long hiatus bad boy toyotas are coming back cons most people willing to pay the extra price for a gas electric hybrid want the system to deliver superior fuel economy not a kick in the pants from a stoplight lincoln mkr remember lincoln not so long ago it was the best selling luxury car brand in the u s but since the turn of the century lincoln has been floundering steadily losing market share as ford management struggled with the task of defining what a lincoln sedan should be in a market awash in better designed technically superior european and japanese luxury vehicles the lincoln mkr represents a stab at a new direction built using some of the underpinnings of the successful ford mustang rear wheel drive chassis the mkr offers a futuristic interpretation of the classic lincoln "waterfall grille " and an athletic stance not seen in lincoln cars since well forever pros at last a lincoln car concept that looks like something cons ford is such a mess it may not be able to produce a production version of the car until chrysler nassau how do you follow a smash hit like the chrysler that appears to be a big issue for daimlerchrysler ags chrysler group these days especially since sales of the are starting to cool off this years idea for milking more out of the initial investment in the chrysler s rear wheel drive underpinnings is what auto industry insiders call a "four door coupe " thats a confusing way of describing a car that has four doors like a conventional sedan but the arcing roofline of a sporty two door daimlerchrysler already has one of these on the market the elegant mercedes cls the nassau represents a chrysler take on the same basic idea pros once again chrysler has the guts to take automotive design someplace new while the big boys rehash the same old profiles cons the nassaus aft end illustrates why "luxury hatchback" is a term you dont hear much in the auto industry ford airstream and nissan bevel auto shows are a forum for car designers to let out their whimsical sides the ford airstream and nissan bevel certainly arent serious the ford revives the "living room on wheels" concept that was the rage among japanese designers a few years back the underlying idea what if an airstream house trailer turned into a car the bevel meanwhile tries to answer the question what would an older guy whose kids are grown and gone want to drive around as he pursues his various middle aged guy hobbies woodworking fishing going to home depot and so on maybe hed drive a pickup truck but just maybe hed drive a vehicle that looks like the unholy love child of a small suv and a hearse pros these cars will never be built cons none whats a circus without clowns send comments about eyes on the road to joseph white wsj com
