study backs potential of adult stem cells reuters news service stem cells taken from bone marrow replenished the radiation ravaged immune systems and bone marrow of mice and can make brain and liver cells scientists reported these so called adult stem cells can grow almost indefinitely in the lab and have many of the other valued properties of more controversial embryonic stem cells catherine verfaillie of the university of minnesota and colleagues reported "the cells not only survived when transplanted but they completely repopulated the blood system of the mice " dr verfaillie said writing in the journal of experimental medicine the researchers said the findings suggest adult stem cells can be manipulated to regenerate a range of cells and tissues the cells are called multipotent adult progenitor cells or mapcs and their discovery in provoked a furor among opponents of human embryonic stem cell research who said the findings proved scientists dont need to experiment on human embryos to regenerate tissue and organs and produce tailored medicine most stem cell experts including dr verfaillie repudiate this argument "my research has been misused the whole time there is a huge reason why we have to continue studying embryonic stem cells " she said in a telephone interview last week the house of representatives voted to expand federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research and the senate is expected to pass the bill president bush who opposes the work has promised to veto it again as he did last july the white house issued a report saying work such as dr verfaillies make embryonic stem cell research unnecessary dr verfaillie and other experts whose work is cited in the report said experiments are needed on all kinds of stem cells to truly understand them and federal funding and oversight is the best way to move the promising field forward stem cells are the bodys master cells and depending on how developed they are they can give rise to all the cells and tissues in an organism or to a family of cell types for instance neural stem cells can be directed to form various types of nerve cells while hematopoietic stem cells form blood immune system and bone marrow cells dr verfaillies mapcs are more powerful than hematopoietic stem cells "scientists must now understand that mouse mapcs can make normal blood and we need to explore how they do it " said stanford universitys irving weissman who has been skeptical of dr verfaillies work but who collaborated with her on this study these cells might help rebuild damaged immune systems treat blood cancers and might help transplant patients by "tricking" their immune systems
