business technology h p touts advance in chip technology hewlett packard co is claiming a research breakthrough in improving computer chips with techniques from the emerging discipline of nanotechnology bringing big benefits in performance the computer makers researchers say their approach can allow an eightfold increase in the number of transistors that can be squeezed onto a variety of programmable chips while bringing savings in energy consumption such improvements could bring new capabilities to an array of products including communications switching systems wireless networking gear factory and building control systems and broadcasting equipment h ps approach is unusual because it doesnt reduce the size of transistors the conventional approach to increasing speed or data storage capacity in chips each new generation of manufacturing technology for shrinking transistors can take companies several years and billions of dollars in new production equipment the pace of improvement is becoming more costly and difficult to maintain as circuitry reaches ever smaller dimensions assuming h ps techniques can be adapted for high volume manufacturing companies could improve existing chips without having to wait for factories to upgrade their production equipment "that is saving five to years of work at a stroke " said james ellenbogen an expert in the field who is senior principal scientist of the nanosystems group at mitre corp which manages u s funded research programs he characterized h ps results as "amazing " nanotechnology refers to technology with dimensions measured in nanometers or billionths of a meter where todays most advanced chips have circuits whose widths are measured at nanometers nanotechnology creates components that are a fraction of that size smaller than conventional chip manufacturing techniques are expected to achieve the h p researchers have been refining tiny structures called nanowires which may be arranged in crisscross patterns called crossbars to create circuits that can store data or function as tiny switches their latest research was applied to improving a category of conventional chips known as fpgas or field programmable gate arrays fpgas are popular because they can be easily programmed by makers of electronic products such as networking devices and reprogrammed after they are in the hands of end users but fpgas can be more costly to make than other chips partly because only about of each chip is dedicated to transistors that carry out its primary functions the remainder is used for an array of switches and wiring that connect the transistors researchers at h p of palo alto calif set out to use nanowires to connect fpga transistors together more efficiently "frankly we chose the target we could most easily improve " said stan williams a senior fellow and director of quantum science research at h ps research laboratory
