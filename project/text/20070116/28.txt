doctors fda spar over fade creams many skin doctors across the u s are mobilizing to defend cosmetic fade creams and lotions in the wake of a threat by the food and drug administration to effectively ban such products because they contain a skin lightening ingredient called hydroquinone consumers use fade creams to treat dark age or liver spots in sun exposed areas on the face or backs of the hands pregnant women use them on dark facial patches known as the mask of pregnancy the products are popular with dark skinned people who suffer pigmentation disorders following rashes and acne plastic surgeons use prescription hydroquinone products to treat the uneven skin tone that often follows surgery or laser treatments the fda hasnt made a final decision on the products but dermatologists and product makers are rushing to give the fda more information backing their claims that hydroquinone in small amounts is safe for treating minor skin discoloration uneven tone and age spots the agency says it is acting in the face of "significant additional new data" suggesting some evidence of carcinogenicity in animal laboratory studies "this is a shot across the bow to put manufacturers on alert that that were headed toward a resolution that isnt in their favor " said an fda official "this is intended to be a public process someone could still do studies and clear hydroquinones name " the agency recently extended until jan a deadline for responses to its proposed move a decision which isnt expected anytime soon could affect some products containing hydroquinone in strengths from to about two thirds of the products are marketed as over the counter drugs by about companies products containing above hydroquinone are generally sold by prescription many dermatologists say they have never seen an adverse event linked to hydroquinone products which have been sold in the u s for decades but are banned in some countries "hydroquinones are an important part of my practice for treatment of pigmentation disorders " said susan taylor a philadelphia skin doctor and spokesperson for the american academy of dermatology association a washington based physician group "if those otc products are banned it will affect millions of people " dr taylor said "we have to applaud the fda for attempts to keep us as americans safe but i dont think that this particular ingredient has demonstrated risk to the population " she said skin bleaching products cost roughly &# to &# in drugstores making them accessible to consumers who dont want to pay or cant afford to visit a dermatologist among the most common over the counter lightening creams are medicis pharmaceutical corp s esoterica johnson &amp johnsons ambi line and porcelana sold by a division of henkel kgaa prescription products including obagi medical products inc s nu derm system are significantly more expensive questions about hydroquinone safety have popped up over many years in the european union banned hydroquinone as an ingredient in cosmetics last year two dutch researchers in a literature review published in a european journal urged "that the use of hydroquinone as a skin lightening agent will be stopped completely" because "the risks of long term effects cancer of topically applied hydroquinone may no longer be ignored " the chemical is one of some used in personal care products for which safety data are lacking says jane houlihan vice president for research of environmental working group a washington nonprofit organization that has assigned a hazard warning to hydroquinone peer reviewed studies show "permanently disfiguring results" of hydroquinone in black skinned patients a condition called ochronosis ms houlihan said these patients mainly in africa may have used much higher concentrations of hydroquinone than in the u s but the fda "gives no guidance" as to what level is safe she said many dermatologists say they have only seen pictures of the disfiguring condition at medical meetings "i have never seen a single patient of mine regardless of race develop a case of exogenous ochronosis or any other medically concerning side effect associated with the use of either otc or prescription hydroquinone " kansas city mo dermatologist audrey kunin tells visitors to her web site dermadoctor com in an interview dr kunin said she worries the fda may be following european regulators who "are stripping out ingredients right and left " the fda is currently reviewing a proposed rule change governing over the counter hydroquinone products but says it intends to subsequently consider all skin bleaching drug products including those sold by prescription the fda is weighing whether hydroquinone products should be required to submit a new drug application to stay on the market dr taylor predicts that many companies would likely abandon the products rather than pay the high costs of human tests needed for approval of a new drug most of the fade cream products companies are working with a washington trade group the cosmetic toiletry and fragrance association to respond to the fdas call for more information "porcelana is a relatively small brand for us we are working with the ctfa to make a submission in january " said rick theiler senior vice president of technology at a consumer products division of henkel based in dusseldorf germany "there is substantial information on the products history of safe use that can be documented " he said the fda review took a toll on the initial public offering of obagi medical products the long beach calif companys flagship product line which is prescribed by physicians contains hydroquinone on dec the company sold about million shares for &# each under the expected range of &# to &# on friday the shares closed at &# off cents in nasdaq stock market trading "we have years of history and have no reports of adverse reactions" from use of hydroquinone obagi chief executive steve carlson
