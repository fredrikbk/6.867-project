bank of america quietly targets barrier to growth law capping deposits favors foreign rivals big u s lender says bank of america corp arguing that u s banks are artificially small and vulnerable to foreign acquirers has begun a quiet push to raise the regulatory cap that bars any u s bank from an acquisition that would give it more than of the nations total bank deposits late last year the big bank the only one close to the cap with &# billion or of u s deposits sought and won shows of support for changing the federal policy in votes before the north carolina bankers association and the new hampshire bankers association it has also approached bankers in massachusetts and other states to support potential legislation this spring in congress many lawmakers and community bank advocates have previously opposed raising the cap a spokeswoman for bank of america which is based in charlotte n c said the banks effort isnt a lobbying campaign but "part of an ongoing educational effort" about an important competitive issue u s banks are bound by the cap but bank of america says it doesnt limit the ability of foreign based banks some of which are among the nations top deposit holders from merging with or acquiring u s banks deposits typically include the balances in a banks checking and savings accounts and certificates of deposits they are critical to a banks ability to make loans and thus to its earnings the cap is one of the few remaining legal barriers to bank expansion in the u s for decades the nations lawmakers have been dismantling state and federal laws originally designed to limit the size of banks and their individual influence on the u s financial system in congress repealed the glass steagall act the depression era law preventing banks from owning brokerage firms the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of was an earlier landmark in deregulation allowing banks to more freely expand into multiple states to mollify critics of the law congress included the provision capping deposits the law allows a bank to surpass the cap on deposits through internal growth but not through acquisitions at the time many legislators believed the interstate banking law would lead to a handful of big national banks fiercely competing across the country instead only bank of america has approached the deposit limit or established a broad coast to coast network as of sept it operated retail branches around more branches than its nearest retail competitor wachovia corp bank of america is now the nations largest holder of deposits and the second largest u s bank by market value after citigroup inc in bank of america then called nationsbank corp was one of many regional banks dwarfed in market value by titans including what is now citigroup though it was already larger in terms of deposits but through a string of acquisitions during the s and overhauls of the banks it bought bank of america vaulted to the top tier the cap now precludes bank of america from considering many potential acquisitions limiting its growth opportunities in the u s the cap also hinders bank of america chairman and chief executive kenneth d lewis who says he has no present plans for acquisitions from considering buying banks in europe or asia that also hold u s deposits thats significant because of the top banks in u s deposits are foreign owned royal bank of scotland the leading foreign bank in terms of u s deposits had &# billion of them as of june those deposits are far less than bank of americas but are about the same as those of minneapolis based u s bancorp bank of america hasnt made clear how high it believes the cap should be raised or if it should be done away with altogether but in a position paper titled "global market realities call for rethinking of deposit cap" and submitted to banking industry groups bank of america officials argue that in addition to restricting the growth of giants the cap keeps u s banks artificially small and makes them vulnerable to international acquirers that arent similarly limited "in time the mega foreign banks will be positioned to acquire the largest u s banks " said the paper which was circulated this past fall bank of americas initial moves to raise the cap have encountered resistance from some rivals and small bank advocates "if this cap business actually gets traction we will fight it tooth and nail " said camden r fine president of independent community bankers of america which represents close to community banks however the bank has been more successful with state industry groups such as the north carolina banking association whose members include other banks that have been among the most aggressive u s acquirers such as wachovia and bb&amp t corp it has also softened the view of rep barney frank the massachusetts democrat who heads the house financial services committee once a vehement opponent of raising the cap rep frank was upset after bank of americas acquisition of fleetboston financial corp led to thousands of lost jobs in new england he said then that removing the cap would "happen over the dead bodies of a lot of us " but bank of america has since restored nearly all the jobs initially cut housed its growing wealth management unit in downtown boston and installed anne m finucane a well connected bostonian as its chief lobbyist and chief of communications rep frank said in an interview friday that he was happy with the steps bank of america has taken particularly elevating ms finucane "with anne people dont feel oh theyve come from north carolina and we have no say anymore " mr frank said he is open to considering the question of the cap any change would have to be authorized by congress and would likely have to be approved first by mr franks committee or have his blessing rep frank recently described what he called a "grand bargain " saying he would support certain pro growth pro trade policies from u s businesses if they would in turn support changes he wants in wage labor and health policies in bank of americas case that might include supporting efforts to fight identity theft or predatory lending former rep john lafalce d n y who worked on the law that created the cap said it was part of a compromise to placate small banks that feared losing market share to ever expanding out of town banks "i dont think there is anything magical about the level " said mr lafalce who has been out of office since "how much of an accommodation would they want would they want to raise it to or would they want to raise it to that would be a big difference " mr lewis in an interview played down how aggressively bank of america would push for the change he said he realized other big banks werent likely to cede the competitive advantage they enjoy from the limit "why wouldnt you want to create a barrier to us " he said the next two biggest banks in u s deposits are j p morgan chase &amp co which held as of sept and wells fargo &amp co with according to the federal deposit insurance corp wells fargo and j p morgan declined to comment since june wachovia through its acquisition of gold west financial has eclipsed wells fargo in terms of deposits it hasnt publicly commented on the deposit cap some bank of america competitors said privately that the big banks may form an alliance with smaller banks to oppose any change in the limit mr lewis says bank of america can continue to grow even if the cap isnt lifted and that he isnt in the market for a u s bank now "as i look across the country i dont know what i would want " he said though he cited two possible exceptions lasalle bank a division of abn amro holding nv of the netherlands and harris national bank which together have market share in chicago where bank of america is relatively weak with less than share corrections &amp amplifications an article tuesday about bank of america corp s efforts to win support for changing legal limits regarding the percentage of all deposits held by any one u s bank described executive anne finucane as the companys chief lobbyist and chief of communications in addition to overseeing communications governmental relations and lobbying ms finucane is also responsible for other areas including marketing advertising and philanthropy according to bank of america she has held the title "global marketing &amp corporate affairs executive" since march wsj jan
