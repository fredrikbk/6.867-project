the daily fix patriots slip past chargers rematch with colts awaits as the cast has changed the new england patriots remain the nfls toughest playoff team the winners of three of the last five super bowls retained that title sunday by going to san diego and beating the chargers despite a sloppy performance from quarterback tom brady despite having just holdovers from the three title years as boston globe columnist jackie macmullan points out the pats were the mentally tougher team sunday ron borges writes in the globe mr borges also argues that bill belichick was the smarter coach for shifting to a riskier pass oriented attack when the run was stymied but the coach and his players got lucky nick canepa writes in the san diego union tribune mr belichick "won yesterdays game with inferior personnel but he knows he got lucky no way he prepared for the marx brothers " the chargers gaffes including fumbling an interception on fourth down when batting down the pass would have sufficed explains why mr canepa defends chargers coach marty schottenheimer from calls for his firing mr schottenheimer exacerbated his poor reputation for playoff coaching by going for a first down on fourth and and by challenging a call that fumbled interception that wasnt even close costing a timeout si coms peter king writes "this was an awful awful day for schottenheimer " the pats raucous postgame celebration on the chargers home field angered their defeated opponents particularly league mvp ladainian tomlinson while calling the chargers accusations overblown boston globe columnist dan shaughnessy says "a little decorum wouldnt hurt " next up for the pats is a familiar foe the peyton manning led indianapolis colts who have transformed themselves into defensive artists in the playoffs indy yielded just two field goals in a road victory against the baltimore ravens "the metamorphosis from leaky to lofty has been downright kafka esque " bob kravitz writes in the indianapolis star given the nfls parity the ravens "splendid season means absolutely positively nothing going forward " john eisenberg writes in the baltimore sun the brady manning rematch will spark endless replays of their one sided rivalry and comments like this one from providence journal columnist jim donaldson "the patriots are heading to indianapolis on sunday weve seen pats colts playoff games before and we know how they turn out " the fix will try to remain quiet about this overblown storyline for the rest of the week but first well note new york daily news columnist gary myerss observation that those prior colts losses were in foxborough while sundays game will be played in indys dome and link to the endless and often entertaining manning brady debate on football outsiders now to the nfc which you may have read in the fix and everywhere else is the vastly inferior conference you may have also heard that before about the nbas east home of the reigning champion miami heat or about major league baseballs national league where the world champion st louis cardinals ply their trade so dont yet count out the new orleans saints and please dont pin the political economic and social hopes of a hurricane devastated region on them either as deadspins will leitch pleads given that they have leading nfl passer drew brees and the talented running duo of deuce mcallister and reggie bush it was no surprise to see offensive fireworks from the saints in their defeat of the philadelphia eagles on saturday but defensive stops were an unfamiliar sight in the superdome john deshazier writes in the new orleans times picayune in philly columnists debate whether eagles coach andy reid should have gone for a first down with remaining rather than punting the ball away on th and daily news columnist bill conlin says mr reid will forever be associated with the word "punt " but the inquirers rich hofmann counters that the numbers show eagles quarterback jeff garcias many talents dont include converting fourth and long meanwhile daily news columnist rich hofmann says the eagles must bring back mr garcia amid the uncertainty about starter donovan mcnabbs knee injury and mr hofmanns colleague john smallwood says the loss leaves philly in a "desolate winter wasteland" lowlighted by the ers and flyers in the nfc championship game the saints will face the chicago bears after rex grossman demonstrated sunday that he could participate in a playoff win throwing adequately overall and exceptionally at times in an overtime defeat of the seattle seahawks the qb dubbed gross rexman by some doubters has managed to convince chicago sun times columnist greg couch that he can keep winning of and counting despite bad decisions such as his interception at the five yard line against seattle if mr grossman can beat the saints next week or avoid foiling his teammates best efforts the sun timess mike mulligan points out that bears coach lovie smith would become the first black head coach in the super bowl the colts tony dungy also has a shot mr grossmans seattle counterpart matt hasselbeck was merely "average " again falling short in a playoff game steve kelley writes in the seattle times the loss to the bears closer than expected yet maddening caps an inscrutable paradox ridden season times columnist jerry brewer writes "it was a crazy turbulent week adventure " seattle did at least become the first super bowl loser to win at least one playoff game the next season in a decade a whirlwind tour of the world of sports outside the nfl for the th time

joe posnanski writes in the kansas city star by hanging with kansas on the road before losing "kansas has mcdonalds all americans " mr posnanski writes "missouri has mcdonalds customers " louisville
