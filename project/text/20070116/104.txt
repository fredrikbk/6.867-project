chief executive of tredegar corp a global manufacturer of plastic films and aluminum extrusions based in richmond va where he lives with his wife this past march he went into quasi retirement taking on the role of vice chairman of tredegars board of directors mr schers lightened workload gave him more time to think particularly about the comments he was getting from friends and colleagues about his having gained weight troubled mr scher looked at photos of himself from a trip to china a year and a half ago "i thought that is one slob in that picture " he recalls mr scher also started contemplating his own mortality he had blood pressure problems that he treated with medication and also suffered from arthritis he decided to put himself on a diet "i was at the stage where if i wanted to enjoy life i could and if not i was going to drop dead of a heart attack " says mr scher whose father died at age from a heart attack mr scher wound up losing pounds but this did not help his arthritis or the other aches and pains that limited his mobility a former colleague recommended that mr scher have a personal trainer come to his home the workout even when mr scher was overweight he was still in decent cardiovascular shape because played golf and rode his bike still he was surprised when his trainer didnt have him do any work on cardio machines "he told me weight was not my issue at this point it was flexibility and i needed a lot of stretching and weights because i was so stiff and rigid " mr scher realized just how out of shape he was during his first training session in april when he was embarrassed to find he could not balance standing on one leg for even three seconds he began working with his trainer three times a week at his home for an hour to an hour and a half so he could work out on his own mr scher also bought free weights a stability ball and a bosu balance trainer bosu stands for "both sides utilized" and looks like half of a stability ball with a flat base mr scher says the first few months were "hard as hell" because he was so out of shape but his goal being able to pick up his grandchildren pushed him ahead he says when he started out in april mr scher needed to do a lot of stretching in one move he sat with his legs spread hip width apart and reached his left hand to meet his right foot initially he could barely get within six inches of his toe after three weeks of daily practice he had it theres been progress in other areas mr scher started out lifting two and a half pound weights a bit low just to be safe but now hes up to pounds mr scher says a key to his success was that his trainer made sure the exercises and stretches were difficult but not painful after five months they decreased their training sessions to once every two weeks mr scher continued on his own working out for to minutes a day his trainer had to remind him to rest one day a week and to take it easy by the end of the year they had brought it down to once a month to "make sure im not sliding into bad habits " he says with increased mobility and flexibility mr scher is now able to focus on improving his core strength and muscularity his current workout consists of various programs one using a stability ball a base program of stretches and core exercises a dumbbell routine balance exercises and strength training on his home gym equipment he works out six days a week for to minutes on his own and uses sundays as a rest day he also plays golf rides his bike along the boardwalk near his home and plays with his grandkids the diet when mr

squeezed juice in the morning and eating a half rather than a whole bagel "when i was heavy i just ate so much of what was on my plate " he says forgoing his post work scotch on the rocks also cut back on calories "i didnt have to come home and kick back with a drink to relax " he says "not that i would go home and get sloshed " his diet was a success when he retired his " frame carried pounds after three months of dieting he dropped pounds and he says that another five came off after he began exercising the cost mr scher estimates that he initially put down about &# for home gym equipment including free weights and a bosu ball in the beginning he also spent about &# a month on a trainer but since he scaled back to once a month sessions he spends &# for a one hour session the benefit the compliments from colleagues and the ability to fit into suits he wore years ago are big plusses mr scher says but the biggest benefit is improving his own personal health "just being able to walk down the street without aches and pains at my age is great " now that hes regained flexibility and mobility mr scher has even started to see some muscle tone developing "i told my wife now if i could only grow some hair id be dangerous " he jokes write to jen murphy at workout wsj com
