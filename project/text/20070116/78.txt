politics &amp economics zambian airways flies high on affordability lusaka zambia francis ulaya traveled from zambian capital lusaka to southern africas business hub in johannesburg three times a year on average since he was a teenager usually this meant spending hours or more in a crowded bus that negotiated potholed roads in three countries on a recent afternoon mr ulaya a year old engineer was for the first time making the same journey by plane in less than two hours as with other zambian passengers in lusakas departure lounge he could finally afford to fly because of a small revolution in africas travel industry the airfare at &# one way for the nearly mile trip had become cheaper than a bus ride "we thought in the past that the airlines were just for the elite something very exclusive " mr ulaya beamed as he boarded the zambian airways boeing the success of zambian airways shows how private entrepreneurship can improve the quality of life and drive development in a part of the world that is often seen by westerners as a charity case rather than an investment opportunity the airlines story also illustrates the obstacles african entrepreneurs have to overcome to gain access to financing insurance and other necessary ingredients of a functioning business unlike in the west where budget airlines have sparked a massive tourism boom flying remains exorbitantly expensive in most of africa outside the industrial powerhouse of south africa state owned airlines often hold monopolies on popular routes and flights are infrequent zambia which sends thousands of small traders and migrant workers to south africa every year has emerged at the forefront of the change because it allowed its state airline to go bankrupt and collapse the new affordable alternative that emerged in its place closely held zambian airways is the result of an unlikely partnership between a crusading anticorruption prosecutor and a self described "mad scotsman" from the outer hebrides the airline traces its roots to a charter operation of zambias state owned copper mining conglomerate when the zambian government abandoned its socialist policies and started selling off state assets a group of investors led by prosecutor mutembo nchito and his brother nchimo purchased roan air from the state mining company for &# million in this was two years after state run zambia airways one of the largest airlines in africa with flights to the u s britain and india was shut down in part because of international donors objections to a government bailout plan after failing to buy the state airlines name from its liquidators mr nchito renamed roan air as zambian airways adding one letter to the original and playing to his compatriots patriotism painted his planes in the colors of the national flag with two new beechcraft ds the airline mostly serviced domestic routes by as the mining industry slumped the airline was losing &# a month on sales of &# mr nchitos outside partners in the venture pulled out and he had to fund operations from his own pocket "we were basically going under " he said in an insolvency specialist at the local branch of deloitte &amp touche was assigned to examine the companys books the accountant scottish born don macdonald had discovered a passion for africa during a stint in kenya and had moved to zambia after serving as private secretary to scotlands finance secretary the airline he told mr nchito after making his inquiries was badly run if properly managed mr macdonald said it didnt have to close down mr nchito had an instant reply if you know how to run it why dont you do it yourself eager for an adventure mr macdonald accepted and became the chief executive realizing that much of the losses were caused by the fact that the tiny airline with its two seater planes ran the overhead of a full service carrier mr macdonald started out by cutting travel agents commissions and saving &# a month by withdrawing zambian airways from the international airline reservations system then he looked at the overall strategy the airline either had to expand or it would inevitably shrink into a glorified charter business with their sights set on the potentially lucrative lusaka johannesburg route then monopolized by the state subsidized south african carrier south african airways mr nchito and mr macdonald began a search for investors or lenders their idea was simple instead of competing with saa with its upscale planes they would compete with the bus "your average african doesnt believe theyre ever going to fly in their lives and so we had to demystify flying " mr macdonald said "if we could start a bus service in the sky we could get people off buses " in early zambian airways agreed to lease a boeing from kulula com a budget airline in south africa the plane came with kulula coms crew and staff and tickets were sold by both airlines on march zambian airways launched an inaugural flight to johannesburg charging &# or &# less than a bus ride one way "its faster and better than a bus " said bruce mwanza a year old trader who boarded the flight to johannesburg and whose last time in the skies was with defunct zambia airways in the early s "im so proud that we finally have an airline of our own again "
