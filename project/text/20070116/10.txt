business technology talking tech brainstorming st century challenges what were the greatest accomplishments in engineering and technology in the last century what should they be in the current century several years ago the national academy of engineering asked the public to help it answer that first question now it is doing the same with the second visitors to engineeringchallenges org are invited to brainstorm on what "grand challenges" engineers should set for themselves in the st century the top suggestions will be unveiled in september wm a wulf the academys president explains q how did you figure out the greatest engineering accomplishments of the th century a it was a process very similar to the one we are using to determine the grand challenges for the st century we had a committee chaired by neil armstrong and we invited suggestions from the public the top four were electricity the automobile the airplane and clean water q is the point of the new effort to make predictions about what will happen before the year or to say what should happen a these are grand challenges things that we ought to do i am sure that clean affordable energy will be on the list if we want to continue our developed country lifestyles and enable developing countries to improve their quality of life then energy is absolutely essential and it better be clean and it better be affordable that doesnt predict that it will happen it says hey engineers this is a challenge this is something you ought to be working on q why open this to public a we did the same thing with the last one there were things that made it to the list that surprised me one of them was agricultural mechanization the idea didnt come from the committee in of the u s population lived on farms it took that many to grow enough food to feed the other now of americans live on farms that not only feeds the united states but a lot of the rest of the world q what else might make the list of grand challenges a there was some research done by the military in education one of the most startling results was that you get a factor of three improvement in education with a human tutor the best hypothesis for why thats true is that people tend to have formed mental models of things that may not be accurate and so if you want them to learn something new you first have to get them to unlearn their erroneous models that is what a human can do very well i dont see why intelligent computers couldnt one day also play that role q how many of the accomplishments that ended up being most important in the th century could have been predicted in a my knee jerk reaction is that we would not have done very well in my own field of computing we have a terrible track record of predicting what the societal implications will be we can predict with great certainty how many transistors we will be able to put on a chip for the next years and yet things like amazon or google or the web itself have been a total surprise q then what do you hope to accomplish a for one we hope that the new list like the old one will inspire young people we have a problem in this country of an ever declining percentage of young people go into engineering and physical sciences young people dont recognize the profound impact that engineering has had on our quality of life so we want to inspire young people and give them some sense of what can be
