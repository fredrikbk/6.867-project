health mailbox columnist tara parker pope answers readers questions q my wife will be having a hysterectomy soon and theres a debate among her doctors about whether she should have her healthy ovaries taken out we are tending toward leaving them in but one of the doctors thinks they should come out to reduce the chance of ovarian cancer any thoughts j c a i cant speak to your wifes health situation directly but its important to know that the ovaries continue to function after menopause many doctors dismiss the value of ovarian function to a womans health after menopause however post menopausal ovaries are not useless organs about one third of circulating testosterone comes from the ovaries while the remaining two thirds is created from the conversion of hormone precursors such as dhea which are produced by the ovaries and adrenal glands this means that a womans ovaries account for about half of her natural testosterone but while menopause dramatically changes a womans estrogen levels it doesnt have a big impact on her testosterone levels the ovary after menopause continues to produce testosterone and it also produces very low levels of estrogen and other hormone precursors so if your wife does decide to have her ovaries removed her natural testosterone and dhea levels will change theres no way to predict how that will affect her but a loss of testosterone after oopherectomy can be associated with sexual dysfunction you need to ask your doctor why he or she is concerned about ovarian cancer a family history of the disease evidence of a genetic risk or a history of ovarian cysts or some other problem are things to consider whether oopherectomy is a good option depends on your wifes risk of ovarian cancer which is a rare but often deadly disease my hope for you and your wife is that you have sought a second or even third opinion its widely felt that hysterectomies are overperformed in this country many doctors suggest trying other procedures first such as endometrial ablation for bleeding issues or uterine fibroid embolization for fibroids too often a womans uterus and ovaries are treated as unnecessary after menopause so women need to be fully informed about the effect on their bodies of having them removed for more information see www hystersisters com email questions to tara parker pope at healthjournal wsj com
