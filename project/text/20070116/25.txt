enterprise making big time promotions available affordable sweepstakes operator offers online contests for small firms sites this week a new low cost internet service launches that lets small businesses run sweepstakes for items such as plasma tvs trips and diamond rings on their web sites as a way to attract visitors and cull valuable marketing information from them the service nicknamed caffeine helps users design and run these promotions without having to pay for the prizes or do the legal legwork needed to operate the contests big companies often use sweepstakes and giveaways to woo consumers and research shows such programs make web sites "sticky" so visitors are more likely to make repeat visits and spend more time looking around theyre also a good tool for enticing consumers to proffer personal information such as age location and gender however most small businesses dont have the finances or resources to offer such promotions caffeine was developed by a detroit based company eprize llc which runs interactive promotions for behemoths such as disney coca cola and procter &amp gamble with the launch of caffeine eprize is seeking to capitalize on a growing online movement toward pay per action advertising unlike the traditional pay per click model small firms using caffeine dont pay a dime until a visitor clicks on the promotion and registers by providing identifying details including an email address that the business can then use in marketing and research efforts "were trying to democratize the promotions business " says eprize chief executive josh linkner heres how caffeine will work business owners go to the internet site www caffeinenow com and choose the prize they want to offer from different categories some samples a two year bmw mini cooper lease a kitchen makeover and a &# amazon shopping spree promotions are designed from various templates that include animated scratch and win cards and virtual slot machines it takes about minutes to get a customized banner which businesses then place on their own homepage or other advertising outlets including search engines businesses pay caffeine &# for every qualified customer lead and cents per repeat visitor though they can implement restrictions a seattle coffee shop for instance can decide to only pay for names of contest entrants within say a mile radius and owners can also set a limit on how much they want to spend with caffeine however caffeine will continue to store all entrant information in case a business ever wants to purchase more sales leads or broaden its reach theres also a coupon builder option businesses pay five cents each time a coupon is downloaded one early beta tester of caffeine is fathead llc a livonia mich maker of life size peel and stick sports images the company chose a promotion that gives away a trip for four to an unspecified sporting event and is collecting about entrants a day "we spend a lot of money trying to get people to our web site through advertising and we want to collect data on people who visit the site and arent buying then but might be interested in doing it later " says aaron chestnut fatheads vice president of marketing there are drawbacks to caffeine it is not a pure pay per sale advertising model and people entering the promotions may not have any intention of ever buying a companys wares plus entrants of caffeine promotions can "opt out" of having their information used for marketing purposes standard practice in sweepstakes mr linkner says but a business still must pay for the sales lead mr linkner says that while such leads are "not as valuable " he believes they are still worth something because they represent traffic and provide a business with information about who is visiting its site also prizes are doled out via "pools " which means multiple businesses may run promotions for the same gift item so just because a business advertises a satellite radio giveaway doesnt mean one of its customers will necessarily win that item there is no limit on or disclosure of the number of applicants a challenge for caffeine will be integrating its service with existing advertising opportunities to that end the company is in talks with yahoo inc about a possible alliance where yahoo will include caffeine as an option for businesses buying keywords for yahoos search engine advertising mr linkner of eprize hopes this may one day distinguish ads using caffeine on the sponsored results of search pages "if im searching for drycleaner and see one with chance to win id probably rather go to that web site " mr linkner says yahoo declined to comment on the talks to promote caffeine eprize already has signed up a handful of partners including localbiznow com a search marketing firm for local businesses and a couple of search engine optimization and advertising firms in eprizes own backyard of michigan eric v melin president of spidersplat consulting inc in boston hasnt tried caffeine but he says he thinks the concept is "a natural " particularly if its integrated into the services from the likes of yahoo and google "promotions are a great way for small businesses to make their site separate out from the crowd " says mr melin whose search engine optimization firm serves large and small clients "another thing that tends to happen with a promotion is that people will email the link to all their friends its a viral effect " thats what jeff broaddus owner of quality cleaners in royal oak mich hopes hes been testing caffeine as a way to differentiate his service by promoting a &# gap gift card giveaway and a &# nordstroms shopping spree on his site myqualitycleaners com mr broaddus thinks the contests could induce loyal customers to send him referrals "thats the lifeblood of small businesses " he says
