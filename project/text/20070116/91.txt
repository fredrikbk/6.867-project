day sign up for the e mail here for years now the warnings from biologists climatologists and geophysicists have grown increasingly documented and increasingly dire not just about the threat of global warming but that the scientific means of measuring climate change have been undercut by a lack of funding wrapping up a two year study of the latter the national academies of sciences said yesterday that funding for nasas earth science budget has fallen since this lack of funding for earth study satellite programs has endangered the u s governments ability to understand and predict hurricanes drought and other kinds of climate change a panel at the academys national research council found as the washington post recounts the failure to replace aging satellite borne sensors puts "at great risk" the government ability to track retreating polar ice and the implications that has for sea levels as well as shifting patterns of rainfall and other environmental change the new york times adds "by the number of operating earth observing instruments on nasa satellites most of which are already past their planned lifetimes is likely to drop by " the times reports "the weakening of these monitoring efforts comes even as many scientists and the bush administration have been emphasizing their growing importance both to clarify risks from global warming and natural hazards and to track the condition of forests fisheries water and other resources " and nasas earth science budget is expected to keep falling as funding shifts to president bushs plans for a manned mission to the moon and mars the post notes the panel called on the government to renew its investment in earth observing systems and reiterated the threats that require vigilance "the world faces significant environmental challenges shortages of clean and accessible freshwater degradation of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems increases in soil erosion changes in the chemistry of the atmosphere declines in fisheries and the likelihood of substantial changes in climate " it said "these changes are not isolated they interact with each other and with natural variability in complex ways that cascade through the environment across local regional and global scales " the panels "key questions" read like pitches for the next disaster movie from a "catastrophic collapse of the major ice sheets including greenland and west antarctic" to widespread drought and wildfires the wider spread of "previously rare diseases" and "mosquito borne viruses" to greater frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones and heat waves but these topics have become familiar ones as the scientific community seeks to monitor where the planet is going and it doesnt take a satellite to see evidence of serious transformation in greenland and around the arctic centuries old maps of the coastline have become obsolete as rising temperatures melt the ice and reveal new islands and a new geography previously hidden from human exploration the times reports and in the u s rising temperature now allow southern trees to thrive far to the north while trees used to colder weather are under stress from the warmer climes usa today says earlier this month the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said was the countrys third warmest year on record with widespread drought and unusually warm

game the current political climate is producing strange bedfellows twenty labor unions with nearly five million members are joining forces with a republican leaning umbrella group of conservationists

the union sportsmans alliance today "at a time when the bush administration with its push for oil and gas drilling in the rocky mountain west has limited public access to prime hunting and fishing areas on federal land " sportsmen conservation groups and western politicians in both parties havent liked that and the new groups main goal will be to push congress and the white house for more money to protect wildlife habitats while guaranteeing access for hunters and anglers the post says on another front "powerful business interests that once teamed up to defeat democratic healthcare plans are

hewlett packard plan to report the development of flexible electronic circuits produced through nanotechnology that creates the circuitry on a molecular scale while allowing it to interact with the silicon wires and transistors in use today the new york times reports "a cellphone using the technology could be wirelessly upgraded to take advantage of improved wireless network standards " the times says "another potential use would be in making ultracheap memory chips and one early application could be in the ink jet cartridges which hewlett packard manufactures by the tens of millions " h p researchers also tell the wall street journal their work will make possible an "eightfold increase in the number of transistors that can be squeezed onto a variety of programmable chips while bringing savings in energy consumption " bofa wants to raise deposit limits for now u s law prevents american banks from making acquisitions that would give them more than of total banking deposits in the country bank of america is now quietly trying to change that rule "arguing that u s banks are artificially small and vulnerable to foreign acquirers " the wall street journal reports bofa is the
