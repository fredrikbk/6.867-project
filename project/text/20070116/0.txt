a cultural conversation with daniel barenboim he takes bach personally johann sebastian bach is possibly the most totemic of all classical composers "the immortal god of harmony " for beethoven "a benevolent god " for debussy "to whom musicians should pray that they may be preserved from mediocrity " given such veneration bach and his music can seem daunting to those who feel themselves outside the charmed circle moreover for many nonperformers the overwhelming glare of bachs symbolic stature can impede genuine intimacy with his music his two volume keyboard collection "the well tempered clavier " is a work profoundly loved by its performers but at the same time its sheer familiarity as a musical milestone can blur the wonders of the music itself like the statue of liberty so familiar a symbol that the eye has been numbed to its significance as the most colossal example of th century french academic sculpture "the well tempered clavier" is often listened to without really being heard in all its inventive and emotional immediacy to the conductor daniel barenboim however the wtc is simply the foundation for his work as a pianist "my father virtually my only teacher reared me on bachs keyboard music " he says "because he considered it to be crucial not only for its own musical values but also crucial to performing all other piano literature " this coming weekend at carnegie hall mr barenboim is playing the complete wtc book i on saturday at p m and book ii on sunday at p m and his performance promises to offer considerable insight into his deep personal connection with bach "it is the foundation both musically and technically " he explains in a telephone interview "technically its counterpoint is essential to the development of the pianistic technique " polyphonic counterpoint a musical texture in which several independent melodic lines or voices weave together at once is at the heart of bachs writing in keyboard music counterpoint demands what mr barenboim calls "the independence of the fingers a pianist must be able to play with individual fingers and be able to control the volumes and colors of each different line unless you have this lucid polyphonic capacity you cannot play bach and in the end you cannot play anything else well " beyond technique there is the rich tapestry of each of the works constituting the two books of the wtc each book contains a series of preludes short pieces in a variety of styles in all major and minor keys starting with c major and moving chromatically up the scale c major c minor c sharp major minor d major minor etc each prelude is followed by its fugue a contrapuntal piece in which a subject or theme is stated by a solo voice after which it is stated by the remaining voices one by one amid an increasingly complex web of counterpoint thereafter the fugue develops the material with all three four or five voices with subsequent appearances of the theme some of bachs fugues have more than one subject among them c sharp minor in book ii has two subjects f sharp major in book ii has three and into all the fugues bach pours the inventive cream of his contrapuntal ingenuity which makes listening to them a series of astounding musical surprises fragments of the subjects appear like meteor showers subjects are played in augmentation stretched out diminution miniaturized inversion played upside down or in invertible counterpoint upper voices switching places with lower voices or in stretto overlapping statements like rapid breakers on a beach bach manipulates dramatic tension with his use of chromatic harmony taking the ear to unexpectedly distant places and returning to the home key for a welcome resolution thus for mr barenboim bachs tapestry "reveals the connection between the harmonic melodic and rhythmical construction the essence of western music of bachs time and afterward for example the chromatic harmony of the c sharp minor prelude in book i seems to anticipate wagners tristan und isolde while in the last pages of the b minor fugue in book i you can find bach anticipating most of the elements of schoenberg " despite their seemingly close knit organization these preludes and fugues were not composed as an integral set bach assembled them over a long span of time compiling the first book in and the second in as with all his clavier keyboard music bach wrote with an educational purpose to show professional and amateur players not just how to use their fingers but how to use their minds his aim was as he himself put it to teach "lovers of the keyboard" to have "good ideas to develop them well and to obtain for themselves a vivid foretaste of composition " "it is extraordinary " mr barenboim observes "that although these pieces were not conceived to be played together in concert they achieve a fantastic context when you do play them all together by the time you get to the fifth or sixth prelude and fugue in d minor or in e flat there is an incredible sense of accumulation and accumulation is one of the strongest means of musical expression this is why i like to play both books on successive days the musical journey is huge " bachs music is often more emotionally moving than that of such contemporaries as the delightful georg philipp telemann because of the strength of his harmony how his chords progress from one to another the rate or harmonic rhythm of these chord changes is also linked to the tempos of each prelude and fugue and on record and in concert the notable flexibility with which mr barenboim observes tempos can instill these harmonic progressions with the expressive immediacy of actual speech mr barenboim feels that of the three elements in tonal music rhythm melody harmony harmony is by far the most powerful "you can play unlimited expanses of rhythm but unless the harmony changes you dont feel moved " their rich harmonic underpinnings also give bachs melodies their unique eloquence those of say the e major prelude book ii or the subject of the f sharp minor fugue book ii are not just beautiful in their own right but also for their harmonic implications when in the third phrase of the e major prelude for instance the melody turns to the minor mode we sense a twinge of pathos this emotional quality isnt necessarily limited to pathos or to the pieces in minor keys exultation is another feeling we experience for example the c major prelude of book ii opens with an arpeggiando harp like figure that evokes a dazzling aureole of visual color conversely the implication of melody in the most famous of these preludes the one in c major that opens book i inspired the french composer charles gounod to add his own melody in resulting in one of the great musical hits of all time the "meditation sur le premier prelude de bach " or more familiarly the bach gounod ave maria gounods brand of bach veneration aside we owe an enormous debt to the academic community for our understanding of bachs music which had actually gone out of fashion after the composers death and remained so until the mid th century nevertheless as a performer mr barenboim views a purely academic approach to bach performance with a jaundiced eye on his wtc recordings warner records he approaches this music as a modern pianist and one of the worlds finest colorists rather than a historian apologetically playing on the piano unabashedly he exploits the sonority of a concert grand enriching the textures with pedal in some passages contrapuntal lines mesh in an almost impressionistic wash of sound in others he enrobes bachs keyboard polyphony with the majesty of a cathedral choir this is hardly playing bach by the rulebook but it is intensely musical "rules are necessary for order " he says "but a performer must have the courage to take a personal viewpoint and go beyond decisions based on simple rules otherwise its the same as fundamentalism which gives you answers even when there are no questions " after all bach like all great composers broke musical rules every day of his life mr scherer writes about classical music for the journal carnegie hall presents daniel barenboim
