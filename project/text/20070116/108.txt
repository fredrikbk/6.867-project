why preparing others for an efforts failure can bring you success to understand how tony sharpe approaches managing expectations consider what happened in "star trek" captain kirks grumbling engineer montgomery scott admitted that in order to be viewed as a "miracle worker " he had padded his time estimates for finishing jobs so he could handily beat them "thats pretty much how i manage my clients expectations " says mr sharpe an advertising executive he might tell clients that certain work may involve extra time or money or that he might not be able to do it at all "then i come back with it done " he says asked why he does this mr sharpe responds that the tactic helps him ensure that there will be only good surprises which can help "keep clients from getting mad at us " as long as the results are positive he says "they wont even notice youre crying wolf " in january the clock starts ticking for all kinds of company measures from budgets to performance reviews the next months are spent trying hard to manage expectations about how these things will turn out in a system where the facts dont govern opinions nearly as much as expectations do failure to manage those expectations properly can turn success into failure or a well done deed into a disappointment thats why for example a company that has just reported a gain in net income compared with a year earlier might still suffer a drop in share price and its why rain making employees can lose their luster compared with laggards who surprise everybody by showing some small evidence of a pulse when joe glavin managed a software development group a project manager who was developing record keeping software for him kept reporting that everything was "going great " but a week before the scheduled rollout the project manager "behaved as if he was being chased by a loan shark " says mr glavin and then finally admitted that the whole system was unusable mr glavin ended up getting burned and the project manager "never got a management assignment again " mr glavin says you would think the tactic of managing expectations downward would be so obvious that it wouldnt work but as wendy wood a professor of psychology at duke university notes "you can be a physicist and study gravity and still fall down " so spin meisters of presidential candidates widely reported to be lowering expectations do it anyway and companies routinely lower expectations to manufacture surprise says robert sutton professor of management science at stanford university "if youre managing a large organization youre managing a surprise machine " and stock analysts will continue to gush "great quarter guys " every few months as if bewitched by a magic trick even though its secret has already been revealed "for a while the street will play along " says rick sherlund a veteran analyst at goldman sachs "but after a company consistently beats expectations the street will catch on " at the employee level sometimes the boss never catches on harold wolfe a retired software developer notes that "if you meet high expectations they just expect more of the same but the paycheck doesnt match the work done " so he tended to volunteer for nothing he says hesitated when asked to work overtime and if his bosses asked him how soon he could get work done would respond "ill have to think about it " even when he knew how long the work would take says mr wolfe "i never really disappointed them " one explanation for why managing expectations downward works so well may be the psychological phenomenon of "anchoring " or the tendency to overvalue an early piece of information such as an expectation set by an employee even as new information surfaces notes max bazerman a professor of business administration at harvard business school "we adjust insufficiently wherever we start from has a significant influence on our final estimate " research also suggests that the penalty for missing expectations can be greater than the benefit for beating them in his research on promises nicholas epley assistant professor of behavioral science at the university of chicagos graduate school of business concluded that while breaking a promise is bad "exceeding a promise is often not worth the effort " in other words he says people sometimes value beating expectations little more than meeting them thats why managing expectations downward is so widespread "the chips are stacked against us " says prof epley first employees investors and bosses dont normally expect failure so expectations are generally high second "the loss from that already high expectation is going to be that much more painful " melissa marsh an it project manager who works on deploying new software systems concurs "you project the worst case scenario publicly when you fully anticipate that you will be able to bring the system up earlier " she says after all she says to deliver of what you promised only leads people to sorely miss the remaining one percent "there are a lot of opportunities to disappoint people " she says "and it can be really difficult to impress them " email me at jared sandberg wsj com to see past columns please
