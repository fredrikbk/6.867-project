frances anti anti americans paris the french presidential campaign started in earnest this week after the ruling center right party tapped nicolas sarkozy to face off against socialist segolene royal his nomination also brings closer the day that charles de gaulle will be laid to rest wait you say the man is dead and buried since true but hes gone in body not in spirit the general has shaped frances view of the world and itself from the closing days of the last great war come may with a new resident in the elysee palace that looks bound to change in sarko or sego as theyre widely known france would get its first head of state born after world war ii more than a change of the generational guard looms on the horizon neither of the presumptive successors to jacques chirac sounds beholden to a gaullist creed characterized by the prickly defense of the fifth republics "grandeur" and a knee jerk anti americanism to judge by their rhetoric the two leading candidates are willing apostates particularly on foreign policy the repercussions should not be minimized the year old mr chirac is a gaullist par excellence whether storming out last year when a frenchman dared speak english at a european union meeting or grandstanding over iraq in "i have a simple principle in foreign affairs i see what the americans are doing and i do the opposite that way im sure to be right " hes told colleagues on several occasions according to franz olivier giesberts "la tragedie du president " a political obituary of mr chirac published last year electoral setbacks poor health and plummeting popularity make it unlikely mr chirac will dare seek a third term or be able to hand the reins to a trusted ally such as dominique de villepin the neo napoleonic much less gaullist prime minister mr sarkozy a nemesis of both men won their partys sunday primary with of votes on nearly all matters mr sarkozy sees what chirac is doing and does the opposite especially on america mr sarkozy hails the yankee "can do spirit" and openness to newcomers france and america he says have a common enemy terrorism in a visit to washington last fall he enthusiastically met with george w bush and lashed out against "french arrogance" neither won him plaudits back home one of his nicknames sarko lamericain isnt intended as a compliment his hungarian greek jewish immigrant roots make him unusual in french politics and partly explain his different approach the u s "is a country that a part of our elites make a habit of detesting " mr sarkozy writes in his manifesto autobiography "temoignage" "testimony" that shot up the best seller lists here last summer "that is particularly strange since weve never been at war with this nation which came to help us defend us liberate us on two occasions in our recent history with which we share close democratic values " mr sarkozys book takes a dig also at american arrogance and in his acceptance speech sunday he praised president chiracs opposition to "the war in iraq which was a mistake " but his france would pursue an "entente" with washington he says in "temoignage " which comes out in an english translation this spring in conclusion he writes that "the world has changed a lot since general de gaulles era " his version of gaullism and mr sarkozy does after all lead the generals old camp would save "la france eternelle" through a rupture with the gaullist past less can be said about ms royals views she smiles much and reveals little but in a series of debates before novembers socialist primary what ms royal didnt say said plenty as the other candidates brought out the well worn trope of france as counterweight to the evil hyperpower ms royal stayed mum so far she refuses to play the anti american card though iraqs "a catastrophe " she says its democracy deserves support to more guffaws from paris elites ms royal calls for "extremely strong diplomatic action to prevent iran from getting nuclear power which would be very dangerous for the whole region" and rules out atomic energy for civilian use thats as hard a line as any out there today ms royal wrote a gushing editorialist in le monde "favors a break with the soft consensus that for too many years has prevailed in french foreign policy " for sure she is an ingenue who flopped during a maiden trip abroad to lebanon last month her party will constrain her with its anti americanism on its web site the socialists recently went after mr sarkozy as "an american neo conservative with a french passport " mr sarkozy for his part is inexperienced in foreign affairs as well as unpredictable but the two candidates both in their early s represent a break with the present by virtue of not sharing the ruling generations preoccupation with the traumas of the th century gaullism and antiamericanisme were salves for pride wounded in two world wars and by the loss of indochina and algeria though anti americanism dates back to the th century the word itself entered the french political lexicon in the late s and the dictionary only in to this day no other nations name gets coupled with "anti" in the french language sarko is an anti anti american sego at least agnostic but both are also self avowedly "pragmatic " which leaves less space for "french glory " this reflects modern reality france simply matters less in a larger europe and with a rising asia than before polls also show that voters by wide margins want their leaders to "take care of them " not the world beyond which is a big shift in the last decade so are the french turning dare one utter this word "pro american" not exactly mr bushs approval ratings here are at on par with irans mahmoud ahmadinejad frances large muslim minority is an emerging factor that might sustain old policies by a different name that old fox mr chirac may in spite of huge odds find a way to stop sego and sarko from taking his job a new president could change once in office yet the options on offer give the imagination pause freed of its hatred for the u s and other postwar illusions this country may be usefully constructive for a change in dealing with iran russia the arab world china and so on this france would finally bury the ghosts of its awful th century and de gaulle could at last rest in peace mr kaminski is the editorial page editor of the wall street journal europe bret stephens is on vacation
