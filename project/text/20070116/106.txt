where grant wood lived and worked cedar rapids iowa there are today in america more than a few people who would agree with hilton kramers dismissal of grant wood as a "corpse" one need not "disinter " then there are those who would agree at least in part with gertrude steins assessment that wood is "not only a satirical artist but one who has a wonderful detachment from life in general a necessity for creating the best of art " whether one agrees with mr kramer or with stein it is fitting that many of woods most celebrated works including the undeniably iconic "american gothic" were painted in a converted hayloft behind a midwestern funeral parlor that still operates today this visitor had to circle the block several times before realizing that turner alley the name wood gave his studio and residence from to was in fact the modest turn of the century brick carriage house tucked away in an alley behind the stately turner funeral home wood along with thomas hart benton and john steuart curry rejected many of the european influences on the american art of the time and strove to create a "regionalist" movement that would arise from "an american way of looking at things and a utilization of the materials of our own american scene " this disdain for modernism and embrace of at times an idealized image of american life earned the scorn of the avant garde john b turner and his son david woods greatest patrons in his early years donated the hayloft above the carriage house where horses and hearses once were stabled in exchange for the artists help renovating and decorating the adjacent mansion this allowed wood who had cobbled together a living as a teacher metalsmith interior designer and painter of portraits and murals to devote more time to his art that turned out to be time well spent in addition to "american gothic" wood also painted "woman with plant " "midnight ride of paul revere" and "daughters of revolution" at turner alley yet what is most remarkable about turner alley which was placed on the national register of historic places in donated to the cedar rapids museum of art in and opened to the public as the grant wood studio &amp visitor center in hourly tours friday saturday and sunday noon to p m and by appointment during the week is not that "american gothic" was painted here rather it is the ingenious layout and decorative details of the studio home itself all of which wood designed and executed himself "the studio is a work of art " says terence pitts executive director of the cedar rapids museum of art as we make our way up the stairs to the lofts entrance "the first thing one notices is woods great sense of humor and playfulness " what mr pitts is referring to here is the narrow door to the studio which is fashioned from a coffin lid with a small window at eye level and a metal arrow that can be pointed much like the hand of a clock to inform visitors what time grant wood will return or if hes in whether hes "taking a bath" or "having a party " the door is a reproduction the original is part of the cedar rapids museum of arts permanent collection and was donated to the museum by the turner family in along with other wood creations including paintings drawings lithographs sculptures and decorative wrought iron pieces between and the turners donated another wood pieces and in they donated turner alley itself renovations began in and the grant wood studio &amp visitor center opened a year later once inside the studio visitors are greeted by gentle arches and an abundance of natural light pouring in from oversized dormer windows and a magnificent cupola above in perhaps the most dramatic modification to the hayloft wood replaced the metal vents of the cupola with six arched windows adding height a flood of light from above and a cathedral like appearance to the center of the small studio the walls a rustic plaster complete with trowel marks bathe in light "the interior space of the carriage house with its sloped ceiling and large dormer windows reflects the same architectural features found in many parisian attic ateliers of the kind wood must have seen in europe " writes jane milosch of the smithsonians renwick gallery in her essay in "grant woods studio birthplace of american gothic " ms milosch was curator of the exhibition "grant wood at turner alley " which was first shown at the cedar rapids museum of art in late and then traveled to the renwick gallery in washington last spring she also edited the book that accompanied the show which was the first to give equal weight to woods many works of decorative art and to focus on the role of turner alley in his creative life "what is unique about grant woods studio is the way in which it reveals the artists talent as a craftsman as well as a painter " writes ms milosch "in some ways his hayloft studio anticipates the open multi functional and modern day artists studio lofts converted from empty warehouse spaces in new york citys soho district " wood accomplished this by employing many of the arts and crafts aesthetics and techniques he had used in previous design work including an open floor plan built in furniture and a centrally located fireplace but this creative use of space was not merely an aesthetic choice for if one can imagine wood lived and worked in a studio home of less than square feet for more than a decade with his widowed mother and often his beloved sister nan the model for the stone faced blonde in "american gothic" "when wood decided to return to iowa from what he called his bohemian years in europe there really wasnt a regionalist movement here to speak of " says mr pitts "wood returned in large part because he was the main means of support for his mother and sister " talk about family values one has to visit turner alley to appreciate the creative ways wood found to accommodate his loved ones in the studio where he worked slept and remarkably entertained not a square inch went wasted under the eaves are long cabinets that store beds built in drawers store canvases paints and brushes in the pullman kitchen a table pulls out from a tiny cupboard and is playfully called "moms hotdog stand" in the bathroom wood put in a skylight sunken bathtub where the grain chute once was and an armoire that disappears behind closet doors wood painted in a well lit area to the west of the cupola that was originally envisioned as a "stage" for entertaining but mainly served as his studio space by day and sleeping quarters by night in a fire broke out in the studio injuring wood and his sister and mother though not severely and forcing wood to replace the original studio floor in wood left turner alley and moved to nearby iowa city where he married a former opera singer named sara sherman maxon and began a tumultuous career as professor of art at the university of iowa the marriage was short lived ending in and woods paintings and the regionalist movement he tried to foster were derided as "reactionary" and "communazi" by an art department that thought itself modern avant garde and "internationalist " wood died of cancer on feb a few hours shy of his st birthday since then his work has been praised as "cosmopolitan" and "iconoclastic" and disparaged as "camp" and "kitsch " but perhaps it was wood himself who summed up his work best when he said in an interview "i lived in paris a couple of years myself and grew a very spectacular beard that didnt match my face or my hair and read mencken and was convinced that the middle west was inhibited and barren but i came back because i learned that french painting is very fine for french people and not necessarily for us and because i started to analyze what it was i really knew i found out its iowa " mr judge a free lance journalist teaches at the university of iowa school of journalism and mass communication
