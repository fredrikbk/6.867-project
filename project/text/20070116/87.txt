the game handicapping deal hype and hubris like microsoft on the verge of another big windows upgrade wall street is poised to roll out the largest deal making year in history deftly marketed and shrink wrapped in "win win win" platitudes mergers and acquisitions deals today are delivering more to shareholders than at any time in the past decade according to a mckinsey &amp co analysis of stock market returns that should scare the heck out of everyone given wall streets predictable habit of turning self assurance into hubris to help you assess the landscape and distinguish good deals from bad here is a brief m&amp a buyers guide beware the touchy feely deal juiced up ceos often get eerily squishy when the sensitive topic of job losses comes up lips aquiver they mumble about "limited reductions at this time " while wall street totes up the inevitable body counts its a cruel game though research suggests a cold heart comes in handy for shareholders judging this years deal crop the purpose of most of todays mergers is to save money firing people is the obvious way to achieve it sadly scalp happy deals perform for shareholders according to studies condensed in the ever helpful book "deals from hell" by robert bruner that is because savings are easier to deliver than vaporous "revenue synergies" in which companies vow to sell more stuff in new ways such arrangements are usually dressed up as "mergers of equals " and they happen to be the worst performers mr bruner notes decision making gets diffused and political promises peter out "board seats cost money " reminds one top deal maker meaning companies are often willing to take a cheaper price to ensure some say over the merged companys direction so be wary of deal announcements where ceos do a lot of hugging or combine corporate names siamese twin style such as the recent "sprint together with nextel " what does best for shareholders the sentiment free hostile takeover mr bruner notes look at the success the irascible larry ellison has had since his company oracle seized control of software maker peoplesoft back in oracles share price is up since then you may not want a husband who hatches "diabolical" plans as mr ellison was accused of doing by his peoplesoft rival but when it comes to getting the most from a deal hes your hombre dont mind the government the federal government has nearly stepped out of the antitrust enforcement business leaving companies to mate as they wish the permissiveness follows the justice departments embarrassing failure to prevent oracle from buying peoplesoft nary a breeze passed over whirlpools acquisition of appliance rival maytag last year few objections are expected to the little noticed plans of smithfield farms the nations no hog producer to purchase no producer premium standard farms for better or worse for everybody else these deals have the best chance of returning money to shareholders cost savings on say pig feed and pig pens can be large it also gives them more control over the prices they charge for the pigs themselves this presents outsized opportunities for companies in street parlance to think the unthinkable borders and barnes &amp noble caterpillar and john deere bp and shell "the pendulum has been swinging largely unnoticed " says one former leading antitrust enforcer "and it has moved to less enforcement " with the presidential election looming the message is clear for deals with antitrust issues its now or never fight for your rights dont be fooled by gimmicks favored by deal hungry private equity firms they want as little competition as possible when bidding for companies one strategy enter exclusive negotiations with a buyout target and give the deal an air of competition by allowing the target to solicit higher proposals after a deal is signed this is done via rules called "go shop" clauses go shops are supposed to allow shareholders to seek out higher prices later but higher prices dont result because other private equity firms wont jump a signed deal consider the recent &# billion sale of radio broadcaster clear channel communications a group led by providence equity partners worked for nearly two months to lock up an exclusive deal at a potential price of &# per share it looked as if the private equity partners were going to get their exclusive with a go shop probably tacked on after it was all sewn up the companys directors told a rival bidder clear channel wasnt on the block the same day they were negotiating advanced sales terms with the providence team according to securities and exchange commission filings then the providence team splintered forcing clear channel to call in competitors before they even got to the go shop clear channel eventually sold for &# per share would the price have been as high without the unexpected competition the problem here is that private equity firms observe a gentlemans agreement not to jump each others signed deals that is precisely why buyout shops are fixated on landing auction free "exclusives " they know that in todays red hot sellers market auctions will cost them money the money they save is everybody elses to lose there is rising contempt for these competition chillers throughout the street "right now the credibility of the go shop as a meaningful alternative to an auction is very low " says latham &amp watkins partner chuck nathan highly confident for how long nothing came to personify the s merger boom as much as the "highly confident" letters issued by michael milkens junk bond machine which said deal makers holding the letters were nearly certain but not absolutely certain to get financing for their deals waving the letters buyout artists lurched after company targets insider trading scandals eventually helped to end the buyout game two decades later witness the fine print in a missive sent this month by the chief executive of houston logistics firm egl inc to his companys board james crane wants to take the &# billion company private and lined up a private equity firm and banks to back him the banks dispatched "highly confident" letters to show their support theres nothing to suggest the banks wont make good on their commitment still the phrase poignantly captures todays deal crazy mood will this so far successful merger boom descend into hubris and carelessness perhaps wall streets most shocking behavior would be to surprise us and not screw it all up the game is a new column covering deal making and wall street it appears every other tuesday write to dennis berman
