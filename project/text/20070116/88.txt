the lincoln douglass debate how best to end slavery the radical and the republican by james oakes w w norton &amp co pages &# at first glance abraham lincoln and frederick douglass might seem to have been of one mind regarding slavery "well and wisely said " remarked the escaped slave and eloquent abolitionist douglass of lincolns "house divided" speech in the nation cannot endure "half slave and half free " warned the future president either "liberty or slavery must become the law of the land " echoed the man born in bondage however much they agreed about slavery though the two men differed considerably over how to end it that quarrel animates james oakess riveting and original "the radical and the republican " the ultimate convergence of their views which brought them face to face in depended upon the abolitionist becoming more of a politician and the politician becoming more of an abolitionist in short douglass becoming a republican and lincoln a radical douglass rose to prominence with the publication in of his autobiography "narrative of the life of frederick douglass an american slave " until then he had been aligned with the antislavery pacifism of william lloyd garrison but with the publication of the "narrative " douglass began to strike out on his own as an abolitionist becoming a commanding orator and arguing passionately that the constitution was not a proslavery document as garrison and others held although the framers compromised on slavery to create a new nation douglass claimed their true aim was universal freedom lincoln had long been of the same opinion whether lincolns devotion to black equality matched douglasss however was another matter having served one term in the house in the s the midwestern lawyer was prompted to return to political life in galvanized by his opposition to the kansas nebraska act which repealed limits on the spread of slavery but from his failed senate campaign against stephen a douglas to his gaining the presidency in lincoln gave little evidence that he did not share the racial prejudices of his day witness his doubts about black suffrage and his penchant for "darky" humor lincoln might not have advocated social and political equality mr oakes argues but he was neither a racist nor a political opportunist rather mr oakes says lincolns approach was designed to silence race baiting democrats in order to focus solely on ending slavery a point on which he never wavered lincolns "strategic racism " mr oakes writes thus "helped put a republican majority in congress and a man who hated slavery in the white house " lincolns calculated stand left his views open to misinterpretation during his famous debates with stephen douglas in douglas inferred from lincolns opposition to slavery that he favored all manner of equality to frederick douglass in turn lincolns seeming endorsement of prevailing white views of racial inequality meant that he was not truly opposed to slavery douglasss fears on this score were heightened when lincoln in his first inaugural address disclaimed any power to interfere with slavery douglass assumed that the president had forsaken his antislavery views but lincoln meant only to announce that he would not overstep his constitutional authority the lessons that each man drew from the american revolution account in part for such differences some lincoln scholars have seen him locked in an oedipal struggle with the founding fathers at last breaking through their paralysis over slavery by ending it and saving the union then again lincoln did not wage war until the south fired first seen from this perspective douglass may have been the truer "son" of the revolutionary generation although he refused to join john brown at harpers ferry douglass embraced violence as one means to end slavery his short story "the heroic slave " based on the maritime slave revolt led by madison washington in played upon washingtons name as a way of allying himself with the colonists who rebelled against american "slavery" to britain likewise in the version of his autobiography "my bondage and my freedom " douglass averred that the slave who kills his master "imitates only the heroes of the revolution " temperamental differences also set douglass and lincoln apart whereas douglass had a streak of messianism girded by the politics of rage including public rage at lincoln lincoln was innately prudent and conservative a man of reason rather than emotion douglass looked to "higher law " lincoln to the rule of law no matter to what degree the aims of reformers and politicians coincide they march to different drummers the war powers afforded lincoln by confederate secession led inexorably to the emancipation proclamation though lincolns directive of jan arrived two years after douglass had begun arguing for it and even though the president proclaimed freedom for slaves he appealed to "military necessity" and continued to endorse black colonization of the sort that had established liberia earlier in the th century this was hardly the expression of self evident truth that douglass had in mind when at last the two men met in person in august to discuss the use of black troops in the union army douglass chided lincoln for tailoring his policies to public opinion but the abolitionist came away convinced that lincoln was honest and without prejudice their second meeting one year later was of even larger import concerned that few slaves had heard the emancipation news lincoln asked douglass to organize black scouts to spread the word through the south a plan douglass agreed to carry out lincoln and douglass would meet once more after the presidents second inaugural speech as mr oakes writes douglass arrived at the white house only to have to persuade guards that the president would receive him as lincoln immediately did making sure to greet him warmly for all to witness as "my friend douglass " measured against the failure of reconstruction lincoln in death seemed an even greater friend than douglass had known when douglass spoke of him at the dedication of an emancipation monument in washington he rehearsed his former charges against lincoln but concluded that "the hour and the man of our redemption had met in the person of abraham lincoln " insofar as the speech traced the evolution of douglasss own thought it brought the former slave and the martyred president into a last moment of brotherhood one for which james oakess excellent study gives us a deep appreciation mr sundquist is a professor of english literature at ucla and the author of "strangers in the land blacks jews post holocaust america "
