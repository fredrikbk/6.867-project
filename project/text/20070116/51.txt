market realities of cable vs bells your jan editorial "franchise freedom" was incorrect in numerous assertions regarding the cable industry to wit it is grossly unfair to categorize cable companies as "usual suspects crying foul" and to levy accusations that we are directing local authorities to "slow roll approval and make unrelated demands" of the phone companies weve met similar demands from local franchising authorities both reasonable and unreasonable for more than years and welcome reform for all players cable did not get a "free pass" to enter the telephone business the regulatory relief cable received as a new voice entrant is comparable to the relief the phone companies now enjoy in video pricing flexibility and access to essential facilities since when cox was the first cable company to launch competitive telephone service we have played by substantially the same rules as the bells today we have as much as market share in some cities proving that special regulatory favors are not needed to successfully compete consumers are the beneficiaries in we estimate that cox customers will save a quarter of a billion dollars on their telephone expense in video cable does not enjoy a monopoly since the launch of direct satellite services more than a decade ago consumers have had at least three choices for video service in every market in america cox also faces wireline overbuild competitors in many of our markets allowing bell companies preferred entry into the video market will not magically lower prices for consumers but creating an unfair advantage for these large companies does hold the potential to unjustly damage existing competitors the journal fails to recognize that both verizon and at&amp t already charge prices for their video services that are similar to cable a function of the fact that the primary driver affecting the retail price for video service is the cost of programming its disappointing that a leading business newspaper would demonstrate so little insight into the economics of this business by overlooking the effect of wholesale costs programming on retail costs overall your positioning of cable companies as anti competitive is inaccurate since we compete for customers not only in video but also in broadband and telephony with &# billion in private capital invested since to build a state of the art broadband communications network few companies have invested more or worked harder to meet evolving consumer appetites for entertainment and telecommunication services as a result cox has received numerous honors for delivering an outstanding value proposition to our customers including five jd power and associates honors in alone we agree that franchise reform can be beneficial if it treats all providers equally and reduces taxes and fees for customers when the bells are ready to compete where it counts in the marketplace on value and service we say bring it on pat esser president cox communications atlanta
