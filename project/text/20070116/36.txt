european steel shares are likely to hold allure mergers may lift stocks despite cooling market fearing the china factor brussels the european steel market will cool in but the stocks are likely to remain among investors favorites expectations of more takeovers likely will outweigh the specter of softer steel prices analysts and fund managers say though waning u s demand rising energy and raw material costs and a glut of inexpensive chinese exports already are pushing down prices experts see little chance that european steel stocks will take a nose dive similar to that of instead they say a greater willingness among steel companies to curb production in order to keep prices firm as well as more mergers and acquisitions in the sector should mean the cooldown will be shorter lived and less dramatic than two years ago the biggest risk to that scenario they say is that investors will decide steel companies are overpaying for their targets and react by selling their shares after last years heady gains in which many steel stocks more than doubled prices have fallen this month german steel company salzgitter ag for example is down mittal steel co which is merging with luxembourg based arcelor sa jumped yesterday making it up this year but many analysts say they are unfazed by the declines and some put this months losses down to profit taking "i wouldnt advise people to sell the sector at the moment " said commerzbank steel analyst jutta rosenbaum to be sure some think the decline is tied to weaker metals prices and are more cautious "the downturn in commodities has taken a firm hold of the stocks at the moment " said state street bank european strategist michael osullivan "the flow out of steel stocks tends to be quite persistent and we dont see any signs that its going to come to a halt in the very near future " strategists fund managers and analysts agree the most crucial variable facing the steel industry is the so called china factor the glut of inexpensive commodity steel exported from the asian giant that could hurt demand for steel from other more expensive producers moreover if demand for steel within china cools but the countrys steelmakers continue to boost production the resulting flood of exports could deflate prices credit suisses steel analysts cited the threat of inexpensive asian steel particularly from china when they downgraded the steel sector to underweight from market weight this month many others argue that chinese companies will need to restock steel inventories for their still growing domestic market later this year after s record export year which they hope will curb the surplus of chinese steel in the rest of the world the chinese governments decision to slash subsidies and tax breaks to steel exporters also should cool demand for chinese steel they say "we think china is a temporary" factor said didier van de veire a steel analyst and fund manager at petercam in brussels investors could get some indication of how companies view the china factor starting friday when thyssenkrupp ag executives deliver their outlook at the annual general meeting the german steel and technology company will report results for its first quarter ended dec on feb luxembourg based mittal which calls itself arcelor mittal ahead of the completion of its merger will report its full year results feb salzgitter reports on march and anglo dutch producer corus group plc the target of rival takeover offers reports march this time last year the price of hot rolled steel coil generally seen as a benchmark product for steel prices was set to embark on an eight month climb reaching &# per ton in august according to u k based steel research group meps international ltd while u s prices have since plummeted around to about &# per ton this month from about &# in mid european prices have slipped about &# in the same period to &# per ton from a mid peak of about &# the u s market has been hit by both the china effect and a softer housing market that has dented demand from the construction industry european companies have benefited from accelerating growth in the region analysts say another big reason why european prices have remained stable is last years announced merger between arcelor and mittal and their subsequent production cuts the ability of the worlds largest steel producer by volume to withstand the short term losses that come from curbing output is why many investment banks list it as their top steel pick for this year analysts say they expect other steel companies to follow arcelor mittals lead of cutting production in order to offset any drops in demand ms rosenbaum the commerzbank analyst said thyssenkrupp has already done so company spokesmen declined to comment "production levels need to keep dropping " said rabobank steel analyst richard brakenhoff company earnings may take a short term hit but there is more to gain from higher steel prices he said that discipline could get an extra boost if companies continue to gain market share through acquisitions already corus is the target of competing bids from brazils cia siderurgica nacional and indias tata steel ltd thyssenkrupp has said it
