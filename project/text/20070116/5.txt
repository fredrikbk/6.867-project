a brief history of pricing power yesterdays utility buyers sell high today and consumers are likely to pay when the u s power sector hit turbulence in amid overcapacity and a credit crisis ownership of many power plants fell into the hands of the only investors willing to take on the risk banks and hedge funds five years later the sector largely has rebounded with newfound stability and improved prospects for profits in the sector investors that bought in at bargain basement prices are selling out to long term holders primarily utilities and private equity funds but the same forces that are attracting buyers higher wholesale power prices and thinner reserves are putting pressure on electricity prices "a difficult period of rate increases is ahead of us " said curt launer managing director of sagent advisors a boutique investment bank in new york the higher prices fetched by power assets as they change hands mean owners try to charge more to meet their debt service obligations prices are headed up for other reason as well among them the fact that retail rate freezes are rolling off and fuel prices are somewhat high one recent transaction involving the lake road power plant in connecticut illustrates the shift in ownership the plant was built in by pg&amp e corp s competitive generation unit national energy group but the pg&amp e unit defaulted on underlying debt in opening the door for banks and investment funds including cargill inc s cargill financial services international unit to acquire control four years later those investments have paid off handsomely the banks and investment funds last month agreed to sell the lake road plant for &# million allowing many of the hedge fund participants to double or triple their money the buyer bg group plc a natural gas company formed in through the breakup of british gas has a strategic interest in owning u s power plants they will be fueled by natural gas imported to the u s in chilled liquid form to louisiana and georgia terminals from bgs supplies overseas bg also bought a megawatt dighton plant in massachusetts from calpine corp operating under bankruptcy protection in october for &# million bg spokesman david keane said the united kingdom gas company is halfway toward a goal of owning megawatts of u s generating capacity enough to power more than one million households the company is especially bullish on the northeast in part because a new system of special payments for generators has been approved for new england that is intended to improve industry health and stimulate investment total deal values in the utility sector jumped to &# billion last year from &# billion in excluding debt according to data firm dealogic plants representing more that megawatts of capacity have changed hands in the u s since estimates doug kimmelman a former goldman sachs investment banker and senior partner of energy capital partners a private equity fund utilities are in favor because of higher electricity demand due to economic growth favorable interest rates good dividend tax treatment and a more stable regulatory environment investment interest also has been stirred by new support payments recently approved by the federal energy regulatory commission edison electric institute a trade group said utilities delivered an average shareholder return of last year regardless of how heavily they were invested in deregulated enterprises in the past returns have varied often greatly depending on whether competitive generation was in favor or out of favor the even performance shows healthiness across the sector energy assets wound up in the hands of lenders and hedge funds through various means in some cases banks got the keys because owners couldnt repay loans in other cases investors bought project debt at a steep discount and converted it into equity utilities also have picked up financially distressed plants for their own use with lots of money flowing to the sector "power funds are competing with utilities that are looking for assets cheaper than the cost to build new plants " said ray wood managing director of credit suisse first bostons energy practice big utility american electric power co for example has picked up two plants from the competitive arm of public service enterprise group inc since for &# million about half what they cost to build as a regulated utility aep enjoys certain advantages it can add the plants to its regulated portfolio and get customers to cover overhead costs by contrast the prior owner was a competitive supplier that got paid only for power it sold and had no bill paying customers to pick up the tab for fixed costs some investors have been able to profitably time shifts in and out of assets as conditions have changed though returns can be difficult to quantify as firms shuffle the assets between portfolios closely held sithe energies inc for example acquired some generating assets from boston edison now nstar in they passed into the ownership of exelon corp in stages from to an initial investment of &# million in sithe eventually gave investors &# million according to barry sullivan a former sithe vice chairman exelon began construction on additional plants at the sites but after wholesale power markets tanked it walked away from the assets in and took a &# million pretax charge lenders got the keys back in a successor to sithe called k road power regained control of the boston area plants in october alongside several dozen hedge fund investors k road negotiated power sales contracts that boosted the plants value last month k road refinanced the boston generating assets whose value has tripled in the past year william kriegel a founder of both sithe and k road said hes now weighing two options sell the mystic and fore river power plants to others or find a strategic partner that will give his group a stake in a bigger generation company new england is drawing attention because of the creation of a new "capacity" market there administered by iso new england inc the six state regions grid operator with oversight from ferc the market is intended to funnel special payments to generators giving them a revenue stream to tide them over when power sales are inadequate to meet fixed costs and elicit new investment the payments are being challenged by attorneys general for massachusetts and connecticut who estimate they will cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars a year many industry watchers expect the challenges to fail and similar support structures to be approved for additional states that deregulated their power markets
