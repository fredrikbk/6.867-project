japans profits rise but wages stagnate consumer spending growth are restrained by curb on labor costs tokyo japans economic expansion recently has been a one sided affair corporations are booming but consumers havent been invited to the party japanese corporate earnings are expected to rise this fiscal year for a fifth consecutive year stock and real estate prices are climbing a contrast to the declines they experienced for a decade until the early s help wanted signs are everywhere and the jobless rate fell to an eight year low of in november the economy as a whole has been expanding for nearly five years but one key element has failed to materialize growth in workers wages even as many japanese companies report record earnings they arent sharing the fruits with employees in an effort to fend off competition from china and other asian rivals companies are instead using spare cash to beef up research and upgrade computer systems they also are giving out fatter dividends and buying back shares in the hope of boosting their share prices they have held down pay raises and are replacing full time positions with temporary and part time jobs which on average pay less than two thirds the salary of full time posts after falling nearly continuously from japanese workers total cash earnings turned around and rose in the fiscal year ended march this fiscal year they are falling again down from a year earlier in november according to government data "consumers and households are simply not receiving the benefits of the recovery in the corporate sector " said yukio noguchi a finance professor at waseda university in tokyo from japanese companies point of view surviving in an increasingly competitive environment requires cutting costs by changing the labor structure so they are hiring lower cost labor in the july september quarter the percentage of part time or temporary employees hit a record compared with a decade ago according to government data meanwhile though some of the biggest japanese companies gave companywide base salary raises for the first time in five years last year the amount was tiny about &# a month at honda motor co and matsushita electric industrial co with wages not rising consumers arent about to splurge consumption accounts for a little more than half of japans economic activity so weak spending is holding back growth annualized household consumption in the july september quarter was down from the previous quarter economists say that decline was an anomaly and that consumption might rebound in the october december quarter still goldman sachss forecast puts japans real economic growth at in calendar short of the nation euro zones and the u s s from japanese companies point of view surviving in an increasingly competitive environment requires cutting costs by changing the labor structure japan is under pressure because its companies are heavily dependent on manufacturing chinese competitors are catching up more quickly in steel or auto making than in areas such as finance or biotechnology in which u s and european companies have tended to excel so they are hiring cheaper labor in the july september quarter the percentage of part time or temporary employees hit a record compared with a decade ago according to government data weak consumption has led to other consequences price rises have been very small surprising many economists who thought japan had escaped the grip of stubborn price declines just last summer economists were predicting prices would start rising at a faster pace as the tight job market translated into higher wages and stronger consumption in november the main consumer price index rose just from a year earlier and recent declines in energy prices could push it down in coming months "it is very possible the cpi will turn negative starting in the april june quarter " said takehiro sato a morgan stanley economist this is bad news for officials at the bank of japan eager to depart from super low interest rates and "normalize" monetary policy after the boj in july raised its policy rate target to from zero for the first time in five years many economists predicted another rate increase in that didnt happen now many think the boj will raise the target to at its policy board meeting on thursday following japanese newspaper reports over the weekend that a rate rise is likely the low interest rates have had the effect of weakening the yen japanese investors have been shifting their savings into assets denominated in other currencies which provide higher interest rates the move has weighed on the yens value which now stands close to yen to the dollar compared with about yen two years ago the weak yen in turn has boosted earnings for japans exporting companies such as toyota motor corp the low yen makes these companies products more competitive overseas while the profits they earn overseas translate into more yen when repatriated to japan toyota which is expected to report another year of record profits for the year through march enjoys an increase of nearly &# million in its annual group net profit for every one yen rise in the dollars value
