common sense venezuela shows world holdings need close eye smartmoney as an investor it would be tempting to ignore venezuelan president hugo chavezs anti american rhetoric if he werent reigning over enormous oil reserves but he serves as a reminder that emerging markets may be anything but stable after earlier proclaiming radical plans to nationalize venezuelas major privately owned telecommunications electricity and oil enterprises this week he said he would seize the large venezuelan telecommunications carrier known as cantv whose controlling stake is owned by verizon communications needless to say verizon wasnt consulted and wont be offered any compensation until after the seizure if then "the state gave that company away " mr chavez offered by way of explanation that conveniently overlooks the fact that a third of cantv was sold for &# billion in when the company was privatized mr chavez himself as well as many observers make much of the fact that he was re elected late last year in a landslide which he claims has given him a mandate to seize control of private property venezuelas stock market plunged nearly monday after mr chavez said he would seize cantv and is now down since jan when he announced his sweeping nationalization plans cantv shares in the u s where they trade as american depositary receipts dropped on monday and are down since jan ironically cantv seems to have been thriving under verizons control profit nearly quadrupled in the most recent quarter wireless and broadband usage has surged verizon is so large and diversified that its shares have been relatively unaffected i own a position but before all this happened verizon had a deal to sell its stake to mexican billionaire carlos slim that deal now seems unlikely which could cost verizon the &# billion mr slim had agreed to pay obviously this situation as well as recent turmoil in thailands and indonesias markets highlights the need for country diversification ive enjoyed the remarkable run up of emerging markets over the past few years as much as anyone but it now seems only prudent to recognize that the risk premium that long kept emerging market price earnings ratios well below that of developed european and north american economies has all but vanished as a result last year i sold all of my individual country exchange traded funds and mutual funds india south korea and brazil they had done so well it was hard to part with them the only single country etf i now own is japan fortunately the venezuela situation has had negligible impact on my ishares msci emerging markets index fund the fund only reports countries whose shares account for more than of the total and venezuela isnt one of them even without turmoil in venezuela it would be prudent to rebalance your international holdings along with everything else if you havent already done so this year ive been continuing to increase my allocation to foreign equities but to developed markets besides the japan etf ive added to my position in the ishares msci eafe index trust whose top holdings are stocks in the u k and japanese markets i dont expect the astronomically high returns ive enjoyed for the past few years in emerging markets but nor do i risk the potential turmoil james b stewart a columnist for smartmoney magazine and smartmoney com writes weekly about his personal investing strategy unlike dow jones reporters he may have positions in the stocks he writes about for his past columns see www smartmoney com wsj common
