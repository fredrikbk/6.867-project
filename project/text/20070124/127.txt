tightening the belt in citigroup ouster a battle over expenses falling behind rivals ceo prince confronts executives spending new york citigroup inc chief executive officer charles o prince moving to cut costs at the global financial giant was jolted last week by an expense item from a senior executive todd thomson chief of citigroups wealth management unit had used more than &# million from his divisions marketing budget to sponsor a new television program for the sundance channel people familiar with the matter say the programs hosts were slated to include cnbc anchor maria bartiromo and actor robert redford an angry mr prince told citigroup directors last week that the expense was among a number of lapses of judgment by mr thomson from improper use of citigroups corporate jet to installing a wood burning fireplace in his office to spending citigroup money on functions featuring ms bartiromo according to a person familiar with the situation over the weekend mr prince forced out mr thomson years old mr prince declines to comment cnbc says it and ms bartiromo have no comment ms bartiromo is no longer set to host the sundance program the incident was the latest in a string of problems that have plagued mr prince as he struggles to cut citigroups costs a central challenge he faces at the helm of the worlds largest financial services firm by market value and during his more than three years as chief executive citigroup whose sprawling businesses include corporate retail and investment banking as well as trading brokerage and credit card operations has lost ground to rivals under mr prince citigroup hasnt made a big push into using its own cash to trade and invest in other companies the way goldman sachs group inc has it hasnt expanded deeply into energy investing as j p morgan chase &amp co has amid a commodities boom and it has lost ground in credit cards and consumer banking bank of america corp has encroached on citigroups home turf in manhattan and has spread new branches across the country the charlotte n c based bank has branches in the u s more than any other bank citigroup by comparison has less than in november bank of americas stock market valuation briefly exceeded citigroups making it the worlds largest bank by that key measure although citigroup which has some employees in more than countries regained that distinction the move was a symbolic blow to a bank that has long boasted of its clout in recent years j p morgan and bank of america have expanded their credit card businesses acquiring the card operations of bank one corp and of mbna corp respectively those deals pushed citigroup once the largest u s issuer of credit cards into the no spot with &# billion of average loans outstanding as of dec compared with &# billion for bank of america and &# billion for j p morgan last week mr prince acknowledged citigroup continues to struggle with a big card portfolio that it acquired in for &# billion "one thing not working well is still our sears portfolio which is still a real drag on the overall growth of our cards receivables " he told investors and analysts on a conference call friday citigroup has been trying to attract new retail banking customers with aggressive promotions citigroup shares have risen just since mr prince took over in october by comparison the dow jones wilshire u s banks index is up over that period mr prince has had a tough time corralling expenses citigroups operating expenses jumped in to &# billion while the banks revenues rose just to &# billion investors have voiced concerns about the companys failure to grow significantly and to create meaningful synergies among units some have raised questions about mr princes leadership and about whether the company is too big for any executive to manage "he certainly is not the right person for the job " complains longtime shareholder jerry nemiroff of encino calif who owns more than citigroup shares "you can see the results " mr prince a year old lawyer who helped sanford i weill complete most of the big deals that formed citigroup contends that revenue will grow over time citigroup executives say that they are forgoing some short term profit to invest for the long term in existing businesses and in making targeted acquisitions particularly overseas instead of huge deals mr prince has pursued smaller ones such as acquiring stakes in turkeys largest privately held bank in indias largest mortgage lender and in a troubled chinese bank he has pushed to expand retail banking and consumer finance operations in the u s moving into new markets such as boston and philadelphia the bank has struck partnerships with convenience stores such as eleven to extend its network of automated teller machines globally and mr prince has unloaded noncore businesses such as insurance and mutual fund units "we are engaged in a very extensive very transparent multiyear effort to rebuild citigroup to open branches to build deposits to rebuild and connect old sometimes very old technology systems and to reweight the company to a much more international earnings mix " mr prince told investors during a conference call on friday "and to do all that while generating good short term results its not easy its not fast it is certainly not glamorous " these days the entire banking industry is facing profit pressure from an "inverted yield curve " in which short term interest rates are higher than long term ones banks aim to profit by borrowing short term and lending long term to make matters worse the nations housing market is weakening putting pressure on mortgage businesses that have performed well in recent years and many banks are reporting that more consumers are having trouble paying off their loans in recent months mr prince has focused on cutting costs at citigroup last summer saudi prince alwaleed bin talal citigroups largest individual shareholder publicly fretted that expenses were continuing to outpace revenue growth prince alwaleed called for "draconian" measures to trim expenses in december mr prince announced a management shakeup installing a former deputy robert druskin as chief operating officer mr druskin is now referred to by many as citigroups "expense czar " in the friday conference call with investors mr prince said he doesnt want mr druskin to focus on "magazine subscriptions and black cars and so forth " but on "structural" savings opportunities he said these include determining the number of duplicative offices citigroup has around the world as well as unshared back offices that service different businesses such as mortgage credit card and consumer finance operations mr prince said he wanted to examine whether citigroup has its people located in the right places around the globe "do we have people in new york that ought to be in san antonio " he asked at that time mr prince was also grappling with another expense issue the one involving mr thomson over the years messrs prince and thomson had each been promoted by mr weill after leaving general electric co in the athletic mr thomson rose rapidly at citigroup eventually taking on the very public role of chief financial officer when speaking from a stage he preferred tiny microphones that let him roam about mr prince a cerebral man who became the banks general counsel preferred to toil behind the scenes he frequently coordinated deals and mergers for mr weill after mr prince replaced mr weill as ceo in he moved mr thomson out of the cfo slot putting him in charge of the wealth management business which includes the smith barney brokerage unit mr thomson who had made known his aspiration to become a ceo one day enjoyed heading a business operation catering to wealthy clients around the world his fondness for the wealth management business was resented by some smith barney brokers who cater to more middle class clientele people familiar with the matter say the brokers felt that mr thomson didnt pay enough attention to them these people say mr thomson helped win the business of greek shipping families last year he pushed to make his new penthouse office in the equitable building near times square a showplace for private banking clients one costly installation a working fireplace mr thomson justified the expense by telling associates it provided a dramatic spot for mr weill who was then chairman and is now a consultant to citigroup to hold occasional "fireside chats" with the firms high powered clients mr thomsons office on the th floor overlooked central park and sported a fish tank it was known internally as the "todd mahal " inside the bank mr thomsons friendship with ms bartiromo became an issue when mr druskin then citigroups investment banking chief took his management team to a holiday dinner in at the ritzy daniel restaurant he spotted mr thomson having dinner with the cnbc anchor according to people familiar with the situation word of the sighting spread through citigroup the next day a citigroup spokeswoman says mr druskin has no comment in recent months some citigroup executives advised mr thomson to reduce his contact with ms bartiromo a person familiar with the matter says but he justified the outings as good for business because clients enjoyed access to the cnbc anchor according to another person with knowledge of the matter mr thomson noted to associates that his unit was showing better growth than any other citigroup businesses this person says tension between messrs prince and thomson grew late last year one flash point was a business trip in november mr thomson arranged for ms bartiromo to speak to citigroups private banking clients at luncheons in hong kong and shanghai mr thomson flew with a group of citigroup employees to asia but flew back to the u s on the corporate jet with ms bartiromo a person familiar with the matter says kevin goldman a cnbc spokesman says "she asked permission from cnbc she received it and payment was arranged " dow jones &amp co publisher of the wall street journal provides news content to cnbc ms bartiromo hosts cnbcs "wall street journal report with maria bartiromo " after the airplane incident mr prince ordered mr thomson not to spend citigroup money on anything involving ms bartiromo says a person familiar with the situation six weeks later mr thomson informed mr prince he had signed up citigroup to sponsor the sundance channel show featuring the cnbc anchor that was the last straw to mr prince this person says it involved big dollars for results that were difficult to quantify this person adds mr thomson tapped his marketing money to make citigroups smith barney unit a charter sponsor with lexus of sundances new environmental program to be presented by mr redford a person familiar with the matter says ms bartiromo was scheduled to host a segment exploring the "financial aspects of environmental innovation in business " mr thomson didnt clear the sponsorship with mr prince because he considered it a "creative" way to support the "green issue" in his business this person says on jan sundance issued a news release on the sponsorship mr prince was outraged according to a different person familiar with the matter citigroups board was meeting that night thats when mr prince briefed directors on his views about mr thomson last weekend he forced mr thomson out afterward mr thomson told friends that he had seen the ouster coming according to some familiar with the matter
