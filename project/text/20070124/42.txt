worlds largest exchange by value of shares traded and the tse the second biggest by market value of domestically listed companies aim to cut operational costs and offer better trading tools to

shares were down in p m trading in response to a nasdaq document earlier yesterday that said lse had overstated its growth prospects to fend off the u s exchanges gbp billion bid lse said it was confident it will meet its revised target of at least sets trades a day in financial year it said trading volume in the first trading days of january has averaged almost a day nasdaq called lses forecast "ambitious " it said shareholders should be realistic about lses potential for growth as customer pressure and competitive pressure on fees could reduce yields even if the target is achieved likely depressing the rate of lses revenue and profit growth lse this past week forecast trades on its electronic sets platform will rise at least from its previous estimate to trades a day reacting to nasdaqs statement yesterday that no meetings have been held between the two companies since may lse said nasdaq hasnt attempted to pursue any "constructive discussion" with the exchange since making its offer in november "as nasdaq continues to offer entirely the wrong price the board of the exchange has been forced to conclude that it is not in shareholders interests to engage with nasdaq " the lse said lse chairman chris gibson smith said in yesterdays statement "we await any indication from nasdaq regarding an offer price that the board could recommend to shareholders it is time for nasdaq to shut up or put up " in its document nasdaq repeated its warning to lse shareholders that it could dispose of its lse stake if the offer lapses and ran through the reasons other exchanges are
