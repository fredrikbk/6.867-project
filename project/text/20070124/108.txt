state of the union volatile markets may crimp energy plan shifting corn oil prices hinder ethanols role as gasoline substitute president bushs call for the u s to reduce projected gasoline demand by over the next decade faces a hurdle a volatile energy market mr bush called for in his state of the union address last night a massive increase in u s ethanol use by and a toughening of federal auto fuel economy standards actions that together will curb u s gasoline consumption below projected levels in the administration said but the economics both of alternative fuels and of more efficient vehicles depend largely on the price of oil as well as other commodities leaving them vulnerable to market shifts the volatility ethanol producers have encountered underscores the uncertainty faced by companies and investors trying to develop alternate sources of energy lower prices can hurt the economic argument underpinning their development and added supplies can bring prices down increased supplies of ethanol world wide are cited as one reason for the recent drop in oil prices for example to be sure mr bushs policy does mandate increased renewable fuel use but the policy contains "safety valves" under which federal officials could waive or weaken the mandate if the economics of alternative fuels eroded that is because "a bold policy move such as this could have an adverse effect on commodity prices whether it be in corn or cellulose or oil " said craig stevens a department of energy spokesman ethanol in the u s today is made from corn but hopes are pinned on making the fuel from "cellulosic" material such as switch grass and wood chips which are more plentiful than corn after hitting &# a barrel last summer oil fell steadily in recent months dipping briefly below &# a barrel last week in intraday trading it jumped yesterday to settle at &# in new york mercantile exchange trading but oil remains below the levels that for much of past year sent the stocks of ethanol producers soaring and consumers flocking to more efficient cars and trucks the economic disincentive of falling oil prices marks only the latest squeeze for ethanol producers production has surged over the past year that has pushed up the price of corn ethanols main ingredient in response the profitability of ethanol plants is down the net profit of a million gallon ethanol plant today is about cents a gallon of ethanol produced down from cents a gallon on jan said rick kment an ethanol analyst at dtn an agricultural commodities research firm that partly explains why shares of many ethanol producers have swooned shares of verasun energy corp an ethanol producer that went public at the height of market interest last year have fallen steadily since last november yesterday they finished at &# in new york stock exchange composite trading down almost from its week high of &# in june meanwhile one of ethanols big selling points that it would significantly curb global warming emissions has come under debate amid concern over the amount of energy needed to process the ethanol itself wally tyner an agricultural energy analyst at purdue university worries americans"boom mentality" regarding ethanol will sputter out "i dont think this growth rate can be sustained " he says "if we have enough plants built they will bid up corn prices to where its no longer profitable" to produce ethanol ethanol producers are somewhat insulated from the volatility of the market since some of the corn used in current production was purchased earlier at lower prices dan basse president of chicago research firm agresource co says that corn would have to reach &# a bushel while ethanol prices would have to drop to &# a gallon for it to be unprofitable ethanol now is at about &# a gallon the average cash price of corn nationwide yesterday was &# a bushel the u s uses about billion gallons of ethanol a year according to the energy department the u s uses about billion gallons of gasoline a year it takes more than one gallon of ethanol to equal the energy in a gallon of gasoline ethanol giant archer daniels midland co is experimenting with ways to turn corn hulls into ethanol by doing this adm says it will be able to increase the production of ethanol by without using any additional kernels of corn the american petroleum institute the oil industrys washington based trade group said ethanol and other alternative fuels "have an important role in our nations present and future energy mix " but it said "attaining the full volumes included in the administrations proposal will require additional technological breakthroughs " the big three auto companies have announced plans to significantly increase their production of versions of their conventional vehicles that have been modified so they can run on either gasoline or ethanol gloria bergquist a spokeswoman for the alliance of automobile manufacturers an industry group said her group supports the presidents efforts to increase alternative fuel usage but she said the government needs to boost research into technologies such as batteries for the next generation of hybrid vehicles and oil companies need to do more to roll out alternative fuels mike spector contributed to this article
