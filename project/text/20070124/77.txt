recover from a billion yen &# million loss in its past fiscal year and regain public trust in the safety of its flights as unofficial flag carrier in the worlds no airline market by passengers and revenue jal should be a candidate for aviation greatness instead the carrier is weighed down by a bloated work force and inefficient network of routes it has struggled to earn consistent profits in when japanese news media flayed it for safety lapses large and small jal lost some of its best paying customers to its main domestic rival all nippon airways co upheaval among senior management has compounded jals woes japans airline market is one of the worlds most protected with restrictive bilateral agreements that limit flights by foreign carriers unlike some rivals elsewhere jal has faced little competition from low cost carriers which have yet to gain a big foothold in japan robust international and domestic demand has helped jal generate strong revenue the carrier has a higher cost base than ana partly because of its less efficient fleet and costlier work force "this is a company that is making constant operating losses " says satoru aoyama a director at fitch ratings in tokyo "it needs some more drastic changes " the business plan to be unveiled feb along with fiscal third quarter results will reveal the path jal hopes will lead it to better performance and sustainable profits president and chief executive officer haruka nishimatsu who took over in june will lay out a four year plan that focuses on what he calls the "four vital areas" of restructuring jals route network and fleet providing more attractive products increasing productivity and possibly selling more noncore assets in emailed replies to questions he said yesterday that jal will speed up retiring its older mcdonnell douglas md aircraft and make "deeper cuts" in some routes mr nishimatsu expects jal to sharpen its competitive edge when it officially joins the oneworld airline alliance in the spring giving its customers access to passenger lounges and frequent flier benefits with alliance partners such as british airways and amr corp s american airlines "in particular we need to regain competitiveness and win back individual travelers on domestic routes as soon as possible " mr nishimatsu said jal is disclosing few details about the business plan several operational improvements that the airline has announced in recent days have stoked expectations of far reaching changes to try to win back some customers who deserted it for ana for instance jal last week said it will introduce first class service on flights inside japan starting this autumn it said it will increase flight frequencies on eight high profit international routes including ones to france the u s and vietnam and reduce or eliminate poorly performing services to hong kong and zurich jal also said it will introduce fuel saving boeing jetliners on several overseas routes beginning in may jal is preparing a similar restructuring of its domestic network and an announcement of the details is "imminent " mr nishimatsu said plans are "still under study" to trim jobs from the work force of adds jal spokesman geoffrey tudor the airline aims also to upgrade its meal service and menus on international flights "weve had some complaints " mr tudor says declining to give details jal earned billion yen in the six months ended sept by selling securities and other assets it forecasts a net profit of three billion yen for the fiscal year ending march damien horth a stock analyst for investment bank ubs in hong kong says senior management appears to be making some tough decisions but he adds "im not convinced that theyre doing as much as they should " he argues that jal has a weak balance sheet and is vulnerable because of its marginal operating profits to external shocks such as another fuel price spike ubs rates the airline as "neutral" and targets a month share price of yen fitch gives jal a creditworthiness rating of double b minus with a negative outlook mr aoyama of the ratings provider said he believes jal might be acting too late to try to win back crucial business lost to ana although jals domestic passenger volume had recovered by last summer not enough of the fliers were top paying customers he says many of jals elite passengers switched to ana because they were concerned about safety mishaps and irritated that families with children were filling up the front of jals planes after the airline introduced a cheaper type of premium seat in as many of these top tier customers have enrolled in anas frequent flier programs mr aoyama argues they are unlikely to return deutsche bank sees "no prospect of an underlying move into profit" and rates jal shares "hold " with a month target of yen on them still others anticipate the shares will rise one is yasuhiro matsumoto a senior credit analyst at investment bank shinsei securities it doesnt rate jal shares but the analyst says he would consider them a "buy" if he did neither shinsei or mr matsumoto own the shares he says mr matsumoto says the stock might hit yen in months given managements apparent willingness to confront long ignored problems jals shares have "only upside" potential and should be "very outperforming " he says
