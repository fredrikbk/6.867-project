for unapologetic attention grabber name recognition is companys goal questions for bob parsons company the go daddy group inc title founder and chief executive officer the super bowl is just days away and that means it is once again time for godaddy com to stir up attention for itself the registrar of web domain names has gained attention the past two years for running racy ads during the pigskin classic in ran a super bowl ad featuring a mock capitol hill hearing with a woman now known as the "godaddy girl" falling out of her top last year godaddys chief executive and founder bob parsons generated publicity by using his blog to chronicle attempts to come up with an ad that would be suitable to air during the game on walt disneys abc in the end the company succeeded in getting another risque ad featuring the "godaddy girl" on the air godaddy has already confirmed it will make a third super bowl appearance on the feb broadcast on cbs in an interview mr parsons discussed his marketing strategy wsj it seems as if godaddy is best known for advertising in the super bowl rather than for its actual business a firm that helps consumers register domain names on the web you may get lots of hits at your web site after the ads run in the big game but do you think the average consumer understands what your company does when all the hoopla fades away mr parsons well you know listen to what we do we serve as an on ramp to the internet by providing our customers with unique identities in the form of domain names ok we enable and protect with an array of different products email web site building e commerce tools blogging tools podcasting there is no way to get that across in a second advertising message so what we have to do is we have to run a message that attracts attention we hope that once they come to the web site we can explain of course what we do that proves quite effective as long as they know were godaddy com and they can type it into their browser thats all im after wsj super bowl ads are pricey what part of your annual ad budget goes toward these commercials and how do you justify the expenditure mr parsons well heres how we do it our total marketing is of our budget thats all ill really say about that but the way we justify the expenditure is we have competitors how many can you name you can name godaddy com maybe one or two others thats as far as it goes the way we feel is that the super bowl is an advertising medium unlike any other its the center stage for advertising particularly our kind of advertising where we want to run some message thats fun people are looking forward to seeing something a little edgy a little inappropriate if they dont know what we do eventually they will wsj do you think you make your money back mr parsons i look at this as the cost of doing business the return on the super bowl is one of those things that are impossible to quantify i believe that right now this year we are still reaping the benefits of the ads and the ads and we will be five or years from now so how do you put a pencil to that fortunately because we are a private company i dont have to explain it to anybody other than myself and senior executives wsj you write a blog that tells people about all of the ups and downs of your super bowl efforts last year you told people how hard it was to get your ad concepts approved by abc isnt this just a publicity stunt how does it tie into making people understand what your business is and how it can help them mr parsons the blog was always intended to be a window into the company for our customers and others and also a window into what im thinking i say exactly what i think im the one that writes it i dont sugarcoat anything its not sanitized ill write something that from time to time pr people and an attorney might get the shivers over to me people appreciate that what were going through to get our ads approved its not a publicity stunt wsj do you run tv ads during other parts of the year that avoid the super bowl antics what other sorts of advertising and promotion do you do mr parsons what we do is we use all types of traditional marketing methods we run over ads on cable tv each week we also produced an infomercial last year that we run quite a bit as an internet company we do a lot of online advertising we use email campaigns for our customers that request to receive our email also i have a weekly podcast our super bowl ad will probably appear on cable a number of times wsj based on recent press releases it sounds as if your ads for this years super bowl will use concepts similar to those that have appeared in the past do you need to use scantily clad women to stand out are there other ideas you have considered mr parsons we tried to do something without the godaddy girl just consisting of two fellows in an office talking that was our second ad that was rejected i believe that the ad we do get approved and i feel very confident that we are going to get one approved will feature the godaddy girl when people think of godaddy they think of the godaddy girl i think well do it and in an acceptable way at least as acceptable as youre going to get from us yet it will give everyone a smile i think the event demands it we are competing with the best advertisers in the world all right their budgets dwarf ours if we dont run an ad that stands out we might as well take our money and shred it wsj your ad agency shine advertising recently announced that it was resigning from your account as the result of "creative differences " we have to ask publicity stunt or actual controversy mr parsons thats for real and heres what i can say about it we hired shine to do the creative for some of our commercials and thats what they did i think they did an excellent job thats all we hired them to do at the end of the day when you get right down to it we no longer have a business relationship as far as thats concerned wsj and how will you get ads made in time for the big game mr parsons the ad agency was never going to produce the ads no advertising firm was ever going to be involved in that other than our own production company as soon as one gets approved im going to let the world know thats just the way we do things here
