another shade of green military aids nature lovers colorado springs colo when the pentagon carved fort carson out of juniper covered ranchland during world war ii the army training camp was miles away from the town of colorado springs on the front range of the rockies but this once sleepy area has since exploded into a metropolis of more than a half million residents enveloping much of fort carsons northern boundary tract homes and strip malls have crept close to the bases southeastern border that leaves the acre fort carson almost hemmed in by suburbanites some of whom have complained about the sounds of bombing and other combat training so the army has called in an unlikely ally environmentalists through a little known act of congress army officials are tapping into a fund to help provide the nature conservancy and colorado state agencies with money to buy remaining undeveloped land around fort carson the goal to set up a buffer zone against future sprawl the army has contributed &# million to keep development off about acres around fort carson or about a third of its total goal the project is part of a pentagon program known as the readiness and environmental protection initiative which was established in under the program the pentagon works with environmentalists and other local groups to achieve land conservation deals around military bases across the country deals are in the works for more than acres adjoining u s bases in all congress has budgeted &# million in the current fiscal year for the program up more than threefold from the beneficiaries are located across the u s in the florida panhandle the pentagon gave &# million in to the state of florida to help create a mile conservation buffer for military flights and florida black bear habitat in virginia the pentagon last year bankrolled the majority of a &# million acquisition of acres of wild lands around fort a p hill in partnership with the trust for public land and conservation fund and in hawaii an army donation of &# million to a local coalition of conservationists last year helped the group buy acres overlooking oahus north shore that had been planned for development the odd pairing of the military and environmentalists is raising eyebrows in some circles since many "green" groups have previously attacked pentagon operations as harmful to the environment "the last people i ever thought id be working with were guys in black berets and camouflage uniforms " says joshua stanbro a manager of the trust for public land of san francisco who worked on the hawaii project "now i count them as friends " other environmentalists are more cautious "its a major though not yet complete success story " says lenny siegel director of the center for public environmental oversight an environmental group in mountain view calif although military people involved in the program are gung ho janice larkin the pentagons outreach coordinator for the program adds "ill be honest a lot of people in a military uniform think every environmentalist is a pinko communist " some environmentalists suggest the military would like to use this program to divert attention away from environmental problems caused by toxic contamination such as caused by leaking fuel tanks at a number of bases "the military would rather talk about what they are doing for the birds and the fact they have some really nice forests " mr siegel says "they just dont want to tell you about the bomb ordnance in the forest " pentagon officials admit to past problems on bases but say they pay the utmost attention to the environment now the unusual alliance does offer mutual benefits both sides say the program gives funds to environmentalists to help conserve lands that provide habitat to endangered animals such as tiger salamanders arroyo toads and fairy shrimp pentagon officials say the program helps them preserve the roughly million acres of military training grounds that they say are needed for the nations defense these lands have been threatened by development because some homeowners complain about noise and traffic when they move nearby pentagon officials say in addition development can cause such safety issues as planes potentially crashing into homes and concerns among commanders that nocturnal training might be impeded by city lights in all defense department officials estimate the majority of the nations more than major military installations either are impinged upon by development or soon will be one reason the bases are getting so much development is many are situated in some of the countrys fastest growing areas the marines camp pendleton for example is located between the city of san diego and orange county calif nellis air force base in nevada is situated in the path of sprawl from las vegas one of the fastest growing cities in america and the armys fort bragg lies near a number of golf course resorts in north carolinas popular sandhills area officials say fort bragg already has had to curtail parachute drops of the nd airborne in one corner of the base nearest new homes ultimately too much development can force bases to relocate as the navy says it had to do with its weapons training station at los alamitos calif when it became surrounded by homes in the s pentagon officials say any base relocation now would face similar suburban encroachment down the line "no matter where we would end up trying to locate build it and they will come " says paul mayberry deputy undersecretary of defense the idea to focus on buffer strips around the bases arose from a conservation program at fort bragg in the s at the time the army was faced with having to limit training because nearby development had made the base a last refuge of the endangered red cockaded woodpecker military officials say so the army teamed with the nature conservancy and other groups to preserve private forest lands around the facility giving the woodpecker more habitat environmentalists credit the move for leading to a recovery in the woodpeckers which also gave the army more room to train more freely by more bases were facing threats from development pentagon officials say at camp pendleton development had wiped out almost all the local habitat for the western snowy plover bird except for the acre base that along with habitat loss for eight other species put camp pendleton in the position of potentially having to declare more than half the base as "critical habitat " or a rigidly protected refuge for endangered species so defense officials lobbied for the legislation authorizing funding of encroachment buffers as a way of giving the bases more breathing room the way they did at fort bragg the military can acquire additional land it wants only through an act of congress under the program the military cant own the buffers land titles instead have to be in the name of an environmental group or other partner that preserves the land in its undeveloped form to help overcome skepticism of its intentions in the green community ms larkin says the pentagon began exhibiting at environmental trade shows "people were saying what on earth " she says the exhibits helped get the attention of activists like mr stanbro of the trust for public land he says he first met army officials at a land trust alliance show in austin texas in at the time mr stanbro was involved in trying to save some lands in oahus north shore from a planned development of about a dozen luxury homes situated in waimea valley and revered among native hawaiians as sacred the development site adjoined the u s army garrison which is a training base for soldiers mr stanbro says the pentagon soon committed to helping stop the development the head of the armys buffering program lt col joseph knott hosted a forum in in honolulu and went on to get the pentagon to chip in &# million to help buy the land in question in total mr stanbros group and other conservationists and local agencies ended up paying &# million to landowner christian wolffer in late to buy the development site at a ceremony to celebrate the deal a local woman with tears streaming down her face thanked col knott "i felt guilty because it wasnt just me " col knott says "but it felt good to help out "
