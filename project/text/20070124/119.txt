the risk of filing your taxes early changes in law could cause late revisions to forms an extension for wachovia investors shouldnt be in a rush to file their tax returns those who do may have to amend them later this year major financial services companies are struggling to avoid what some fear could be an unusually severe recurrence of a problem that has bedeviled investors the past three years the issue is forms those statements that banks brokerage houses and mutual funds send out to account holders around the end of january since millions of taxpayers have received revised forms typically in late february march and even april restating information such as dividends that was reported on their initial s this year some financial executives worry that things may get even worse thanks in part to a recent tax law change seeking to minimize the problem a few firms have asked the internal revenue service for more time to mail out their forms to investors among the firms that have received extensions from the irs are wachovia securities a unit of wachovia corp and morgan stanley a wachovia spokeswoman says the company plans two waves of mailings to investors in february and is counseling clients to sit tight "my advice would be to delay filing as long as possible" this year because of the issue says julia flenner a first vice president at wachovia securities in richmond va morgan stanley recently wrote clients to say it had received a day filing extension from the irs the company made the request "in anticipation that tax law changes will significantly increase the number of mutual funds that will be late in supplying their tax information " says ted jahn executive director of client reporting in morgan stanleys global wealth management group morgan stanley will use only about one week of that day extension mr jahn says which "will give us enough time to capture the majority of this late tax information " this move "should substantially reduce the number of corrected s we need to send" but it "wont eliminate them entirely " he says morgan stanley told clients about the delayed mailing via an insert in their december statements the company said it will begin mailing statements on feb and will complete the mailing by feb the firm cited a law enacted last year that included a change in how tax exempt interest income is reported to customers for two new boxes have been added to the irss form int for reporting interest payments the form for dividends is called form div one of them box includes tax exempt bond interest tax exempt interest dividends from mutual funds tax free unit investment trust interest and accrued interest received on the sale of a municipal bond the other new one box shows tax exempt interest that is subject to the alternative minimum tax paradoxically the origins of the tempest date to a tax law designed to help investors part of that law slashed the top tax rate on most but not all dividends to effective retroactively to the start of previously dividends had been subject to tax as ordinary income which meant at federal rates as high as early in investors began to notice a sharp increase in the number of revised forms before the law was enacted the percentage of revised forms sent out typically was only about to a year says patricia mcclanahan vice president and director of tax policy at the securities industry and financial markets association or sifma in that percentage jumped to ms mcclanahan says in it fell to but then bounced back up again last year to sifma a trade group formed recently by the merger of the securities industry association and bond market association represents about securities firms banks and asset managers industry leaders have long tried to persuade the irs to allow them more time to send out s to customers they say the irs has refused to grant an industry wide extension because many taxpayers like to file their returns in february and collect their refunds early instead the irs said it would consider requests by individual firms for extensions previously some firms that received those extensions chose not to use them out of fear that their clients wanted the information more quickly so what should you do if you file your return this year and later receive a revised form in some cases the answer is nothing many corrections are so small it probably isnt worthwhile to amend your original return that is especially the case if it winds up that you are entitled only to a small additional refund and you have to pay a tax preparer an additional amount to figure out how much if the correction is large enough it may well be worth the time and effort to revise your return moreover if the revised information means you owe more tax you should consider fixing your return before the mid april deadline otherwise you could face interest charges and possible penalties as well some investors have received multiple revisions from the same investment firm says stephen w defilippis owner of west suburban income tax service in wheaton ill he typically tells investors to wait at least until late march to file since it is likely that most revisions will have been sent out by that time to be sure some revised forms have been sent out even later than march in past years some taxpayers go even further they estimate and pay what they owe by the april deadline and file for an automatic six month extension "its typically smarter to file for an extension than to have to file an amended return " says mr defilippis who is an enrolled agent and thus licensed to represent taxpayers before the irs a senate panel plans to focus on a new whistleblower law the senate finance committee plans a "roundtable discussion" on feb about the law which authorizes the irs to pay higher rewards to informants in certain types of cases sen chuck grassley an iowa republican recently asked treasury secretary henry paulson for details on how the whistleblower program will be run and who will be placed in charge of it irs officials have said that most of the tips it receives from informants dont justify a reward since the late s the irs has
