flight plan airports take off as development hubs professor urges the use of an asian strategy fix for detroits woes john kasarda says an asian import could help alleviate detroits economic problems it isnt a car but a new kind of city called an aerotropolis a vast complex that centers on the airport and features warehouses offices a shopping mall a convention center and maybe residences and a golf course airports are "the new central business districts of the postindustrial economy " says the university of north carolina business professor he has logged more than miles over the past six years promoting the idea in asia where it has taken root outside cities from seoul to kuala lumpur malaysia increasingly in the u s he is also pushing the idea that the right kind of airport development can spur thousands of new jobs in todays just in time global economy but some experts are skeptical of his u s proselytizing they see big differences between master planned airports built on greenfield sites overseas and civic revitalization efforts aimed at u s airports that are often hemmed in by sprawl some argue that the aerotropolis is a better description of what already is happening around busy airports than a prescription for reviving cities the professor is careful to say he didnt invent the term aerotropolis he says he first heard it in when he was helping officials in zhuhai china figure out a strategy for their new airport but he claims he is "generally recognized as the creator of the concept if not the word " and has "probably done more to develop it and make it real" than anyone "its my primary work " many observers give him credit for being the leading articulator of the idea if not the author in his office at uncs campus in chapel hill n c the year old shows off airport conference brochures that list him as the keynote speaker aircraft models from his various trips and a preface he wrote to a chinese language text about airport economic development the wilkes barre pa native studied economics and business at cornell university in ithaca n y then got his doctorate in sociology at unc during the late s mr kasarda hit on the idea of airport "cities" as the "connecting nodes" of the fast globalizing economy mr kasarda began publishing on the aerotropolis concept during the early s and says no one took much notice but his career as an airport futurist took off after he won a small role in the mid s helping global express delivery company fedex corp map out its regional package sorting strategy in the philippines he has helped airport officials from belo horizonte brazil to denver validate their aerotropolis ambitions and will be in india next month to meet with delhi airport executives his vision has taken shape in asia where governments in china hong kong malaysia and south korea recently have built airports ringed by industrial commercial and residential complexes or have plans for big complexes outside the airports in september suvarnabhumi airport outside of bangkok opened with the worlds biggest passenger terminal under a single roof and the tallest control tower and expansion plans for an entire city and a goods processing zone nearby the thai governments chief planner of the project suwat wanisubut says mr kasardas consulting work gave him the confidence to argue more persuasively inside government that the new airport should be an aerotropolis "most thai people said you should build an airport and then leave it alone because its noisy and you just go there when you need to travel " mr suwat says "but john said the airport is a place where you can make money hes very energetic he can talk for two hours three hours " and talk he does last month the professor spoke to members of the memphis tenn regional chamber of commerce all of the slides and much of the presentation were carbon copies of his earlier works although he added a sprinkling of statistics on memphis which handles the most cargo of any airport in the world thanks to hometown fedex "an aerotropolis is clearly forming around memphis international airport " he told the packed ballroom at the peabody hotel "this is not build it and they will come " he said "its happening right now " arnold perl a memphis attorney who is chairman of the airport authority says mr kasarda has helped crystallize the communitys need to build future airport development into its long range plans so memphis can remain competitive "if we do nothing more well be eclipsed and other global airports will surpass us " he says critics say mr kasarda uses civic leaders desire to create jobs and bolster the tax base to pitch plans that wont work "hes like the music man " says michael webber an air cargo consultant in prairie village kan "he meets city council members and then he spins them " the kansas city department of aviation is disillusioned three years ago under a previous administration the department hired mr kasarda to look at how the kansas city airport could profit from its undeveloped acres mark vanloh the current director says he shelved mr kasardas report before he hired a master developer for an initial acres of what will become the kci business airpark "some of his ideas were simplistic build a road around the airport " mr vanloh says the professor says such criticisms are "simply not accurate or fair " adding that messrs webber and vanloh have praised his work in the past mr kasarda says his job is to provide inspiration not concrete design plans he also concedes that not all airports have the potential to become mega airport cities "im not so arrogant to think all of my ideas are right for all places " he says mr kasarda blames himself for one development he promoted in the u s the creation of an industrial park and free trade zone at an underused airfield in rural north carolina because of its location the global transpark has been a flop consuming &# million in state and federal grants over years and creating just jobs but that is a different case than detroit he says which already is an airline hub highway crossroads and manufacturing center as a consultant mr kasarda has met four or five times over the past three years with civic leaders there pushing a vision of a development that could rise on acres spreading between detroits metro airport and a cargo airport seven miles away although it could take years and cost billions of dollars a detroit aerotropolis could create as many as jobs and attract residents says mulugetta birru economic development director for wayne county mich "cars are still made here " he says "i feel very very confident we can attract high tech and distribution" businesses too
