the informed patient doctors learn to say im sorry patients stories of hospital errors serve to teach staff when year old jill hartel was hospitalized toward the end of a long battle with leukemia her mother woke up from a fitful sleep at her daughters bedside horrified to find a nurse administering an intravenous dose of benadryl though a medication allergy was clearly marked on her medical chart more than years after jills death from complications unrelated to the error her parents lisa alecci and steve hartel who work and live in the boston area say they cant forget the cold treatment they suffered at the hands of hospital staffers who among other things failed to transfer her medical chart from the emergency department and excoriated her distraught father for failing to alert them to the allergy "i still double over in tears when i think of the way they tried to blame us " says ms alecci "no one ever came back to apologize either for giving the drug or for the way it was handled which was as bad as the error " the couple are among a number of families and patients who agreed to share such experiences without identifying themselves or the hospitals involved for "when things go wrong voice of patients and families " a new training film for medical staffers financed in large part by crico rmf the patient safety and medical malpractice company that covers hospitals and physicians affiliated with harvard medical school though their harrowing stories about being stonewalled or ignored after suffering grievous injuries such as botched operations and life threatening medication errors are sure to make doctors uncomfortable the films creator tom delbanco a harvard medical professor and physician at bostons beth israel deaconess medical center says the "bad news" stories make the most powerful teaching cases to show clinicians how they often avoid and isolate patients at the time they are needed most "we need to shock doctors out of their complacency about whats happening from the patients perspective " adds luke sato chief medical officer of crico rmf which will provide copies of the dvd and training manual free for seminars and courses within the harvard system and sell it to others for &# to &# based on the number of copies via its web site rmf harvard edu dr sato says the aim is to help doctors better understand the impact of medical errors and the importance of apology but also to prevent such errors from happening in the future over the past few years the "disclosure and apology" movement has spread rapidly in health care as a growing number of states pass laws protecting a doctors apology from being used at trial and as more hospitals adopt policies requiring that doctors and nurses promptly disclose errors and apologize to patients and families when warranted but getting doctors and other medical staffers to drop their traditional reluctance to face patients theyve harmed and to overcome their fear of reprisal has proven a tougher task especially since the very legal departments and risk managers that are now encouraging open communication have long stressed "defend and deny" policies that often threw up a wall of silence after a medical error now hospital risk managers and insurers are taking a different tack in part because of mounting evidence that disclosure and apology programs which often include an up front offer of a financial settlement can sharply reduce malpractice costs at the university of michigan health system which adopted new policies encouraging full disclosure of errors and apologies to patients when warranted the number of presuit claims and lawsuits has dropped from pending in july when it implemented the new approach to malpractice claims to fewer than pending at present the average legal expense per case is also down more than according to chief risk officer richard boothman whose department works closely with physicians after a medical error or adverse event to discuss how to handle communication with patients "many doctors really want to be open and apologize to patients but are led to believe it can end up in financial disaster when the truth is quite the opposite " mr boothman says using real patients in training programs to get the message across can be more effective than dry lectures or simulations using actors which often dont pack the same emotional punch mr boothman is asking patients who have experienced a medical error or other problem such as a delay in diagnosis to speak about their experiences on video for use in training workshops including a woman whose breast cancer went undiagnosed for years and hired a lawyer to explore a claim but later agreed to a settlement that included a college fund for her children "when i talk to doctors it is these personal stories that affect them far more than a power point presentation with numbers and grids " mr boothman says another effort the sorry works coalition a nonprofit group that includes doctors lawyers insurers and patient advocates was launched in february by doug wojcieszak a political and public relations consultant whose brother died after a medical error in a cincinnati hospital in though the family won a lawsuit "we still grieve that the doctors never sought us out and apologized " he says the coalition sorryworks net works with state pilot programs and insurance companies to promote full disclosure and apologies as a solution to the malpractice crisis focusing on a protocol that requires health care providers and their insurers to apologize if an analysis shows that an error took place or a standard of care wasnt met admitting fault providing an explanation of what happened and how the hospital will ensure the error isnt repeated and offering compensation for patients and families such as the parents of jill hartel who have been affected by medical error the opportunity to educate doctors about how to admit fault and express remorse through such educational programs as "when things go wrong" can help ease the pain of feeling victimized by the health care system "doctors have had it drilled into them for so long that if they ever admitted any kind of mistake they would get sued and they desperately need to understand that isnt the case " says mr hartel "anything i can do to help one or more doctors get the importance of compassion will benefit me and hopefully will benefit them " email me at informedpatient wsj com what to expect after a medical error new policies aim to improve communication while reducing malpractice costs
