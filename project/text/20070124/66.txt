in search of winter in the not so frozen north twin lakes mich readers in texas where snow and ice closed miles of i and the alamo earlier this winter may find this story hard to believe but it has been hard to find winter here in the upper midwest temperatures hit in minneapolis in early january minnesota and much of the upper midwest set records for the most number of days above freezing in december the unseasonably warm temperatures threatened a number of signature events until a recent cold snap pushed the thermometer below zero the st paul winter carnival was shopping for plastic ice cubes to substitute for the real ones that are used to build its signature ice castle the u s pond hockey championships and ice fishing tournaments across the state were also in jeopardy of being canceled and while temperatures have turned cold there has been a dearth of deep fluffy snow to do the things most often associated with minnesota winters like cross country skiing and snowmobiling the john beargrease sled dog race in duluth originally scheduled for this weekend has been pushed back until feb because there is not enough snow thats why i came here to michigans upper peninsula six hours northeast of my home in the twin cities it is one of the few places in the midwest thats almost guaranteed to have snow as a result snowmobiling has become a &# billion industry in michigans upper peninsula hotels restaurants and gas stations rely on the lure of miles of snowmobile trails to make ends meet but up until a few weeks ago the wintry weather had been lackluster at best "this is the first winter in a long time that there wasnt snow for the big week between christmas and new years " said bill manson executive director of the michigan snowmobiling association "the trails in the western half of the upper peninsula didnt open until new years day the rest of the up was barren this time of year we should have two feet of snow on the ground at best its about inches " the houghton mich chamber of commerce estimates that local businesses were losing &# a week due to the lack of snow here mr manson took his sled out on dec and hasnt ridden it since i called the minnesota united snowmobilers association to get their take on the lack of wintery weather but their president was unavailable she was snowmobiling in yellowstone i came up to the up in mid january with my wife leslie and our neighbors gary and kathy klecker the kleckers lifelong minnesotans and avid snowmobilers have been coming here for six years and theyre not alone our motel parking lot was filled with pickup trucks suvs and snowmobile trailers with license plates from other snow deprived midwest states our first stop was pats yamaha in greenland mich the kleckers towed their snowmobiles up here but i rented mine i hadnt driven a snowmobile in years but with a credit card and a drivers license i was able to rent a brand new yamaha venture for &# a day luckily for me snowmobiles are like bicycles once you learn how to ride one you never forget its actually a lot like riding a motorcycle you lean into a corner more than you turn the handlebars your momentum and a burst of acceleration carry you through the corner more than anything else youre also not as cold as youd think youd be on a snowmobile yes you have to bundle up but theres a windshield and the handlebars on most new sleds have adjustable heaters to keep your hands warm even the throttle lever which i pressed down with my right thumb was heated before long i had my snow legs back under me and i was zipping down the trail at miles per hour our first destination on friday night was dinner the difficulty wasnt finding a place but choosing one the entire winter economy here is geared toward snowmobile tourism the well mapped and well marked trails lead to the front doors of bars restaurants and convenience stores at each juncture are road signs just like the ones on the interstate telling riders where they can find gas food and lodging we eventually pulled into the parkview a local bar restaurant and lodge done up in classic northwoods decor in the parking lot were about snowmobiles inside snowmobilers packed the bar quaffing hot toddies and cold beer the dining room was busy too after dinner we decided it wasnt too late for a night ride snowmobiles have headlights and tail lamps after studying the map we chose a mile loop through thick northern pines there are so many trails up here that we didnt pass another sled the entire trip the kleckers usually come for a week ride miles a day and rarely go on the same trail twice on this night it was just us the trail and the snow covered pines on saturday morning we awoke to a fresh dusting of snow tractors partly paid for by the state had been out all night grooming the trails we were up and out early and drove miles down the trail to the copper country cafe for a hearty breakfast of pancakes eggs and strong coffee we then set out on a mile trek along a trail that took us through farm fields pristine national forests and along country roads that are purposely left unplowed on some stretches the road was flat and straight for five or six miles which allowed us to open up our sleds just as i hit mph and thought i was doing great gary zipped by me like i was standing still driving along fire roads and narrow twisting trails through the national forest our average speed was more like mph we zigzagged through stands of trees over one lane wood bridges across the gurgling sturgeon river and around slick icy turns where the back end of the sled briefly broke free and kicked you around the corner the conditions werent great but they were far better than what wed left behind in minnesota at midday we stopped at the trails end bar and grill in sidnaw a typical small town bar its walls were adorned with beer signs trail maps and first place trophies from the baraga county womens pool league it was here that we met a group of snowmobilers from green bay wis another locale where winter hadnt yet arrived in full force "we didnt see snow until we were miles south of the up " one of them said encouraged by reports of good snow we pushed on but trail conditions soon took a turn for the worse instead of well groomed trails that were flat and smooth we encountered a mile stretch of irritating speed bumps one after the other and open water we had to zoom across hoping we didnt sink this is what happens when there are too many riders and not enough snow by days end we were glad to see our motel room wed logged miles the last of them torturous but it didnt deter us on sunday we were up bright and early and back on the trail we ran into some bad conditions at first but then decided to take a mile loop that is one of the kleckers favorites it was the perfect way to end the weekend the slow meandering trail through the woods was smooth the snow ankle deep and the snowmobile traffic light when i dropped my sled off at pats yamaha on sunday night i looked at the trip odometer wed logged miles in days not bad for a couple of city slickers whats more the weatherman was forecasting four to eight inches of fresh snow we wish we could have stayed mr yost is a writer in lake elmo minn
