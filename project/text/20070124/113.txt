the evening wrap a budget odyssey president bush promised last night to balance the budget by a feat many listeners probably thought as likely as their taking up residence on the moon but if a new budget forecast makes the goal look attainable the small print may make the headlines read like science fiction the congressional budget office projected the federal government will run a relatively tidy &# billion budget deficit in fiscal and that the projected shortfall will drop below &# billion during the following budget year those projections follow the recent trend of improvement in the deficit picture which has moved closer to finding some harmony as individual and corporate income tax receipts have climbed more than many analysts had expected for the budget year the deficit totaled &# billion down from &# billion in and there have been more signs of improvement for the first quarter of fiscal receipts were &# billion ahead of last year while outlays rose by only &# billion that meant that the government ran a surplus in the quarter and capitol hills auditors offered even more seeming manna to budget hawks they said by the time rolls around the budget could actually be in balance and that the government may even run a surplus of about of gross domestic product through but all that could easily go up in smoke the cbo models its projections on the basis of current law which means that mr bushs tax cuts would have to expire as planned in the president made clear in his state of the union address however that extending the tax cuts is a priority and he may be able to scrape up the votes he needs even with democrats controlling congress also the projection assumes there will be no change in the alternative minimum tax which is expected to hit a greater number of middle income families in coming years unless congress moves to change the law with democrats arguing that the middle class has been bearing an undue economic burden a change may be in the offing though the adoption of so called pay go budget rules could make reform more difficult finally the cbo assumed no more spending on the war in iraq after this year tempers are running high over the administrations baghdad surge plans the senate foreign relations committee passed a nonbinding resolution condemning it today and the full body will debate the bill next week but neither a shutoff of funds nor a rapid withdrawal seem imminent congress might be able to scrape up some more savings by cropping earmarks out of the budget and the white house believes its pro growth tax policies will keep cash flowing into the federal till but the cbo acknowledged that even if its year model is borne out the longer term strains on the government accounts represent an imposing challenge "the aging of the population and the expected increases in health care costs are likely to put significant pressure on the budget" down the road the auditors warned their words offered a close echo of federal reserve chairman ben bernanke who showed up on capitol hill last week with a sternly worded sermon on the demographic bombs ticking away in social security and medicare as much as the short term budget view had improved that was merely the "calm before the storm " mr bernanke said treasury secretary henry paulson was meeting with conservative democrats today to probe support and explore
