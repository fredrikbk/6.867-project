the nyse faster and lonelier historic electronic trading shift means swift service for investors painful time for brokers on the floor for some traders left working on the floor of the new york stock exchange it appears the big board has dimmed the lights the exchange a unit of nyse group inc is scheduled to finish today its long push to have its securities traded almost exclusively electronically a move that is translating into speedy service for investors but for the employees who work on the nyses iconic trading floor it means fewer jobs and the biggest change to the way the big board has traded stocks in its year history every day more of the human brokers disappear big brokerage firms like lehman brothers holdings inc and j p morgan chase &amp co have let go some floor brokers in recent weeks between five and people each merrill lynch &amp co has discussed with its brokers the possibility of transferring off the exchange goldman sachs group inc s spear leeds &amp kellogg trading unit one of the nyses elite "specialist firms" that match buyers and sellers on the floor is expected to announce layoffs of at least staffers this week according to a person familiar with the matter van der moolen holding nv the dutch company that owns a specialist firm on the nyse said yesterday it cut of its u s staff or about people bank of america has started plans to cut about of its roughly people at its specialist unit and labranche &amp co has already reduced staff on the floor to about people from before the nyse started rolling out electronic trading in october "its been a very painful" few months says michael rutigliano a longtime nyse floor broker "i understand why its happening but its not pleasant when people you have admiration for are losing their jobs " last week traders gave departing colleagues standing ovations on about a dozen occasions when the laid off employees left the floor for the last time as for investors their trades are being executed much faster which means they will more often be able to buy and sell at the price they see advertised right now the market reverts back to human brokers bidding aloud or "open outcry " only when stocks experience big moves which happens about of the time versus almost all the time not long ago when only certain trades were executed electronically but short term volatility in stocks has risen a bit meaning some investors are finding it harder to buy a stock at a predictable price through the day its nothing short of a "monumental" change for the markets says mark gurliacci nyses vice president of strategic market analysis he recalls that when he first started at the exchange in it was too crowded to visit the floor during the first and last hours of trading now he says dropping by anytime isnt a problem nyse officials say because of the automation they can now handle far more trades the specialist firms now handle far more stocks at each panel than they used to because many of the bottlenecks created by human intervention are gone now specialists instead of overseeing trades in a handful of stocks supervise computer programs that spit out thousands of trades a minute one sign of the change specialist clerks that collectively banged their keyboards million times a day have cut that to fewer than million keystrokes "everyone on the floor sees this as a negative but this automation is a positive " argues steven grasso a floor broker at the exchange who isnt related to former nyse chief dick grasso "its a smarter and more efficient business " the changes for investors are meaningful in the securities where nyse has already turned on the expanded electronic trading the average time to complete a trade on the big board has fallen sharply to about three tenths of a second from nine seconds before it hopes to reduce the average trading time by an additional this year this week the nyse adds the final or so securities to its list of electronically traded stocks electronic trading has proved popular since the nyse removed the restrictions in the fall that have existed for years on the size and frequency of automatic orders the maximum size grew from shares to one million in stocks where the restrictions have been lifted in the past weeks of the share volume is now electronic up from about before the change one potential side effect higher volatility for stocks in short time frames nyse says the average &# stock trading electronically is moving cents over a five minute period up from the cent trading range in the days before the stocks went electronic the increased volatility could make buying shares trickier for investors increasing the instances where investors see prices move with little fundamental change to the underlying company the nyse says the volatility increase is small and that nyse stocks are still less volatile than similar stocks traded on the fully electronic nasdaq stock market nasdaq disputes that with statistics it provided from still the nyse says it is making changes that may reduce volatility
