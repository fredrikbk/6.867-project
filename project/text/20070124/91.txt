pushing the envelope paramounts strategy despite oscar nominations the studio faces a climb to reach financial goals if awards were the only measure of a movie studios success viacom inc s paramount pictures would appear to be at the top of its game the studio yesterday laid claim to academy award nominations for movies including "babel " "dreamgirls " and "an inconvenient truth " but oscar glory doesnt always equate to profits when it comes to financial success paramount now in the third year of an attempted turnaround led by studio chief brad grey still has some work to do to achieve margins that match hollywoods best run studios such as news corp s twentieth century fox thats not to say mr grey hasnt made progress already last year he set out an ambitious strategy organizing his movies under various labels he scored several modest hits like "nacho libre" and "jackass number two " and used his skill as a former talent manager to draw some a list filmmakers and he made a splash by buying dreamworks skg which came with its former owner steven spielberg yet none of paramounts successes including its award nominees were blockbusters that gave a large fast boost to the financial performance of the operation meanwhile integrating dreamworks has taken some heavy lifting especially with the dreamworks team determined to maintain some of its independence and while paramount won the most nominations of any studio yesterday it failed to get a widely expected best picture nomination for "dreamgirls " mr grey says paramounts progress last year was just "a beginning rebuilding a studio takes time and requires patience no one ever suggested it was going to happen overnight " his plans for longer term growth include boosting international operations and building a television business the studio chief who came on board two years ago with a mandate to revamp the viacom unit says paramount has a much stronger slate this year that will drive higher margins "thats the slate we can either take credit or blame for " he says highlights include its big summer release "transformers " a sci fi adventure about battling alien races produced by mr spielberg paramount is also distributing dreamworks animation skg inc s "shrek " and it has high hopes for eddie murphys next comedy "norbit " as well as a will ferrell ice skating spoof "blades of glory" mark wahlbergs latest thriller "shooter" and "stardust " a magical fantasy from "layer cake" director matthew vaughn "its a wide and varied portfolio of films " says mr grey paramount is starting from a low base its parent viacom said last year that the studio sank to an operating profit margin of in after a brutal cost cutting drove talent away from the hollywood studio that compares to about at time warner inc s warner bros and around at fox viacom said at the time when mr grey first took over the turnaround plan set a target to reach over several years his acquisition of dreamworks dramatically accelerated that as a result viacom said in june that paramount would hit within a year to months mr grey said in an interview that margins had improved in and the studio was profitable neither mr grey nor viacoms new chief executive philippe dauman would comment on how close the studio has gotten to reaching though mr dauman said the studio was once making &# million to &# million in earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization "were on a path to get back to that level " he said mr dauman wouldnt comment on a time frame for that saying only that he saw the turnaround as a "long term project " mr grey says the studios most profitable movies last year included "nacho libre " "jackass number two" and "world trade center " his new arthouse label vantage also acquired a surprise hit in "an inconvenient truth " al gores documentary about global warming which earned two oscar nominations some movies like "mission impossible iii " were disappointments at the box office however while paramount scored the most oscar nominations of any studio yesterday "dreamgirls" was a big shock the studio had hoped to be able to market the movie as a best picture nominee to boost its box office performance nonetheless the film secured the most nominations of any movie with eight the movie which was developed by dreamworks has been at the center of some recent tension after it won the golden globe last week for best musical or comedy film some people in the dreamworks camp were irked by the impression that paramount which distributed and co financed the movie seemed to be taking more than its fair share of the credit say people at the studio that goes to the heart of mr greys challenge in bringing dreamworks into the paramount fold mr grey says he has tried to give dreamworks as much freedom as possible "we have given them autonomy and a budget to succeed " he said "they are succeeding way ahead of schedule " that has taken the pressure off the main paramount pictures label mr grey is hedging his bets on the big releases comedies and traditional studio fare by allocating six to eight movies each to dreamworks and paramount dreamworks filled an enormous gap in the slate last year and will pull its weight again this year of the studios other labels vantage will contribute as many as low budget movies of up to &# million nickelodeon movies is zoning in on families and mtv films on teenagers and young adults with two to four films each in terms of boosting margins in the long term mr grey says he is eyeing a number of areas including international distribution television and new digital ventures speaking from london where he was unveiling paramounts new international operations mr grey said the international market had strong potential paramount recently dissolved a partnership with other studios to distribute its movies overseas paramount has since been focusing on building its own network of offices to negotiate releases with local theaters so it can take a bigger slice of the international revenues of its movies mr grey said paramount also would start rebuilding a television business this year when viacom split from cbs corp last year paramounts television business went over to cbs "were not going to make a huge investment and we have no intention of getting into the volume television business but i think we could be successful in television if were selective and smart " he said director martin scorsese who recently signed a production deal with paramount has flagged television as an area of interest to him paramount also is working with j j abrams who was behind the hugely successful abc television series "lost " mr abrams is doing a new installment of "star trek" at paramount mr grey said those kind of franchises will be another area of growth mr spielberg recently confirmed that he would be making another sequel to "indiana jones " for instance harrison ford will return in his title role the studio also is open to extending the "mission impossible" series in the future perhaps not with tom cruise though the studio last year made big headlines by giving the actor and his production company walking papers after failing to come to terms over a more modest deal at the studio matthew karnitschnig contributed to this article
