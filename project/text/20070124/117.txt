the mossberg solution edited by walter s mossberg a new push to put a pc in the kitchen cool design allows walk up option bulky on counters in most homes the kitchen is the center of family organization the place where people mark calendars with choir practices office parties and first dates and post notes and family photos on cork boards and refrigerator doors for many years the computer industry has tried to build a "kitchen computer" or "kitchen software" for regular computers to replace the refrigerator door and the wall calendar as the planning and notification centers for the household all of these attempts have failed now hewlett packard co is trying again this week i tested the hp touchsmart pc a unique computer that h p hopes your family will use in your kitchen or family room to get organized digitally this computer due out jan is an expensive &# machine with an unusual design its meant to be used like a walk up kiosk perched on a kitchen counter with users selecting functions by tapping large icons on a touch sensitive screen but after a week of use in my own kitchen i concluded that even a computer as cleverly designed as this one isnt likely to replace post it notes and paper calendars it does have some cool functions including a built in tv a gorgeous screen and a very nice photo software program but these may not be enough to justify the price and the space it takes up in the kitchen the touchsmart pc is a handsome futuristic machine that looks more like something from apple or sony than from h p instead of a regular screen and computer tower it consists of a touch enabled " monitor that folds out from a two piece stand designed to house the computers guts and sit on a countertop the stands base serves as a hideaway bay for an included wireless keyboard and its back side is made to hold a small h p photo printer which isnt included a wireless mouse can be tucked beside the base and a stylus pops up from the top left edge of the monitor this pc also uses touch specific software programs for calendaring leaving notes and editing and organizing photos it can connect to the internet wirelessly or via a wired connection this machine is an attention grabbing addition to a kitchen the kind of thing that would fit in a design magazine but to win over families the touchsmart must overcome the obstacles that foiled earlier attempts at kitchen computers first using a computer to input and display schedules and messages while it works well in the office has been slower and more cumbersome than just jotting things down on paper in a kitchen second unless a digital kitchen calendar system can automatically synchronize with family members office calendars in programs like outlook it isnt solving the biggest problem of coordinating family calendars business trips and events which are marked on work computers are hard to incorporate into family schedules finally the expensive h p machine must compete with cheaper computers already used in the kitchen laptops that are used there temporarily but which also travel to other rooms or outside the house another issue with h ps approach is the touch screen while its cool looking and convenient to be able to do walk up tasks without a keyboard how often will people pull out the keyboard to do things like say ordering movie tickets or booking flights if they do this a lot and the computer is perched on a counter with little depth and no place to sit the experience could be annoying in my kitchen im fortunate to have an island so the hp touchsmart pc seemed well suited there claiming a large hunk of counter space i set up the touchsmart pc in less than five minutes though i didnt use its tv functionality which might be a boon in some kitchens though i dont have the typical family household my two roommates were more than willing to use the touchsmart pc for a week adding appointments to the calendar leaving digital notes playing games of mahjong made more fun with the touch screen and looking up recipes online after a day we were spoiled by the bright colors and walk up functionality of the lcd touch screen theres something satisfying about quickly making a selection with your finger causing a cool ripple effect to circle out from wherever the screen was touched the screen withstood damp fingers and food smudges and can be wiped down with a moist towel a home button on the monitors frame opens the hp smartcenter designed with giant icons and extra large text this screen can display up to personalized shortcuts by default the three largest shortcut icons are hp smartcalendar hp photosmart touch and your local weather updated via weather com hp smartcalendar was consistently slow to open it includes a virtual bulletin board for digital post it notes and a basic calendar notes can be written using the stylus an on screen keyboard the real keyboard or just your finger and they can be left for specified people you can also leave audio messages the calendar in smartcalendar was a disappointment it doesnt synchronize with other calendars without going through windows vista calendar a program in the regular section of the pc nor does it synchronize with microsoft outlook calendars annoyingly smartcalendar has no way of differentiating one family members appointments from another at a glance and if you forget an appointment while the touchsmart pc is in hibernation mode your only hope of being reminded is a pea size light beneath the lcd screen that will glow if a reminder was set with the appointment none of the calendar appointments or notes can be made private so if you have a personal doctors appointment or a surprise birthday party youre out of luck in hp photosmart touch i opened folders filled with my digital photos and easily skimmed through them editing such as red eye removal cropping and rotating can easily be done with your finger though specifically marking a red eye in need of fixing was best done using touchsmarts wireless mouse if you have an a or a series hp photosmart printer it will fit snugly onto the back of your touchsmart and printed photos will drop down onto your keyboard through a slot below the lcd screen but when it came to basic organizing and practical use the touchsmart was lacking one of my roommates prided himself on writing an old fashioned paper reminder in less time than it took to open hp smartcalendar and the calendars inability to distinguish between personal appointments at a glance grew frustrating a video camera is embedded in the screens frame but i couldnt figure out how to get it working even after troubleshooting with h p the company blamed this on the new vista operating system and said it will work eventually h p is definitely on to something with its touchsmart pc but too many of its faults made me keenly aware that this was the companys first attempt at the product its unwieldy shape and size will be a turn off for potential buyers the touchsmarts touch screen is a treat but for practical matters youll do best to stick to old fashioned methods of family organization mossbergsolution wsj com
