business bookshelf a rivalry takes flight and roars ahead boeing versus airbus by john newhouse knopf pages &# when i started covering the airline industry for the journal in john newhouses "the sporty game" his seminal history of the business was one of two titles that folks at both chicago based boeing co and its european rival airbus recommended to me as a primer the other matthew lyndes "birds of prey " revised in took the story up to the last decade now with "boeing versus airbus " mr newhouse presents the next installment in this long running corporate soap opera and it is a soap opera with so few players in the business everyone knows everyone suppliers and airlines sleep with both plane makers bankers get in bed with them all shareholders regularly go home sobbing and staggering amounts of money are involved airlines world wide will spend around &# trillion on new jetliners over the next years most of that treasure will flow to boeing and airbus aviation giants that create some of the most sophisticated pieces of machinery ever devised by human beings their marketing campaigns which can run for months and entail repeated intercontinental sales pitches drag in presidents prime ministers and royalty on both sides of the process a surge or dip in aircraft deliveries from either can swing its home countrys international trade balance the rivalry is made even fiercer by the fact that the companies are a duopoly in a mature industry new entrants arent over the horizon neither player is about to quit it is single warrior combat the likes of which the world hasnt seen since the space race brought the cold war down to the level of individual astronauts versus cosmonauts in recent years the story has changed dramatically throughout the jetliner industrys first four decades boeing dominated but in the mid s americas largest exporter stumbled badly with costly production snags ethics scandals and a general loss of strategic direction airbus created in as a state sponsored consortium of aerospace contractors in france germany and britain was just coming into its own in the s and pounced on boeings weakness boeing officials had made the mistake of dismissing airbus as a jobs boondoggle and never imagined that its engineers could actually use government subsidies to create planes that the market would want so far in this decade airbus has sold and delivered more jetliners than boeing but just when airbus was getting cocky in it slipped on the banana peel of european nationalism as french and german camps inside the company battled for spoils of success a new airbus project the hulking two deck a superjumbo spiraled into a costly nightmare of production snafus airbus also underestimated boeings proposed "dreamliner " which airlines have ordered in record numbers on boeings promises of low cost operations airbus has descended into a financial and management mess that will take years to resolve resembling a jetliner itself the story is dizzyingly complex with countless interworking elements it is easy to get bogged down with plane spotting minutia but mr newhouse rises above that in just pages he offers a concise and balanced account of the past quarter century in the jetliner business with a light touch he makes short work of wonky topics like how airlines use projections of passenger traffic when they are deciding which aircraft to buy "in market forecasting the airline must guess what size bucket the airplane will be needed to carry an unknown quantity of sand the passengers " alas though the book falls short of delivering on his its breathless subtitle "the inside story of the greatest international competition in business " the lead actors in the airliner industry nowadays may lack the mythical profiles of howard hughes or willie messerschmidt but the key players are still characters and yet neither they nor the corporate combat they wage comes alive in "boeing versus airbus " mr newhouse offers a clear picture of the billion dollar decisions that airbus and boeing face but he serves up only hints of the companies internal wrestling over such matters his descriptions of the executives involved often lack the telling tidbits that would lift them off the page this is especially true in mr newhouses portrait of airbus and its parent company european aeronautic defence &amp space co whose labyrinthine complexities require the skills of a kremlinologist or british royalty watcher to penetrate mr newhouse remains outside the gates mr newhouse is also hampered by his decision to approach the book as a series of thematic chapters covering matters such as the rise of asia as a market and manufacturer the development of superjumbo jetliners and airlines suicidal drive for market share this method allows him to analyze each subject thoroughly but also leads to repetition and causes the storyline to hopscotch in time for newcomers seeking to understand the industry that manufactures the jetliners on which so many of us spend so much time this book is a valuable introduction but "boeing versus airbus" offers little in the way of new information or original insights reading more like a series of worthy policy papers than the promised aviation pot boiler mr michaels a paris based reporter for the journal covers the aviation industry
