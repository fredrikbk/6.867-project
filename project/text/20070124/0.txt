bankruptcy boot camps gird attorneys for battle creditors beware o max gardner iii is planning to train an army of consumer bankruptcy attorneys at his bankruptcy boot camps this year his mission isnt to beef up attorneys muscles with a regimen of sit ups or push ups rather mr gardners goal is to teach them the fine art of overcoming the hurdles put in place by bankruptcy legislation that creditors helped to pass in mr gardner who started the boot camps last august believes the new law is punitive toward debtor attorneys and makes it harder for consumers to file for bankruptcy court protection "i felt like if the creditors really wanted reform i would give it to them but my style " mr gardner said "im training an army of consumer advocates that will actively and aggressively look beyond just the bankruptcy in consumer bankruptcy cases at all other remedies that may be available " the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act which took effect in october ushered in sweeping changes to the federal bankruptcy code that affected both consumers and businesses in financial trouble critics contend that the new law made it harder for consumers to file for bankruptcy protection and that it was essentially drafted by lobbyists for banks and credit card companies some judges have expressed that view too in a court opinion last year judge frank r monroe of the u s bankruptcy court in austin texas said that "the parties pushing the passage of the act" appeared to have "an agenda to make more money off the backs of the consumers in this country " mr gardner who has been a consumer bankruptcy attorney for nearly three decades said he plans to help boot camp attendees fight back by putting them through a four day seminar to "de program" and "re engineer" their practices consumer bankruptcy attorneys tend to focus on filing a bankruptcy petition for their clients and getting their debts discharged he said at mr gardners boot camps which are held on his sprawling north carolina farm attorneys will learn that there is a whole lot more they can do for their clients boot camp attendees will be trained to find bogus fees that creditors are charging their clients violations of the automatic stay and laws meant to protect consumers pocketbooks when those things are found mr gardner teaches boot camp attendees how to go after the creditors by filing lawsuits one hot topic that campers are eager to learn about involves the mortgage industry attendees said for example after a client buys a home their mortgage is often sold to a mortgage servicer "gardner has discovered and revealed that these mortgage servicers are engaged in a practice that costs additional expense to borrowers " said bradford botes who will assist mr gardner at the camp and is a principal of bond &amp botes p c mr gardner teaches attorneys to question why a mortgage servicer is for example charging a client a property inspection fee of &# a month or a broker opinion fee of &# a month according to consumer bankruptcy attorney andrew miofsky who has attended a boot camp "is a mortgage servicer really sending people out to your clients home each month to inspect the property and do an appraisal " mr miofsky asked mockingly besides learning how to identify and fight dubious fees and violations boot camp attendees will learn how to set up more efficient law practices by using electronic technology instead of paper and outsourcing most legal services of course the effort isnt purely altruistic consumer bankruptcy attorneys also stand to make more money by knowing the ins and outs of the system suing creditors could lead to huge settlements or winning a lawsuit could lead to the creditors having to pay attorneys fees "you dont need to handle thousands of cases a year in order to make a lot of money " said kevin chern a former boot camp attendee and president of total bankruptcy inc and start fresh today inc "you can make five times as much by just knowing how to look at these claims "
