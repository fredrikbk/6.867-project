corporate focus business bush health care plan finds business backers its a measure of the failure of government these days that business has emerged as a leading advocate of action on social issues in the u s increasingly business leaders recognize that problems left to fester by washington will eventually infect them thats why of the nations largest companies including general electric dupont caterpillar alcoa and duke energy called on the white house this week to support mandatory cuts in the emissions believed to cause global warming such action would likely mean higher costs for the companies but they fear that president bushs failure to engage on the issue will leave them facing a hodgepodge of state and foreign restrictions and the possibility of much tougher action in the future by an administration less friendly to business thats also why business lobbyists were quick to support the white house plan to overhaul the nations health care financing system the presidents proposal would impose a stiff tax increase on people with the most costly employer provided health coverage which includes not only highly paid union members but also the well heeled executives of many of the nations largest companies but business groups say they are willing to take that hit in return for the chance to create a market oriented health care system the rush to back the presidents health plan may stem partly from ignorance as of yesterday business groups had only sketchy details from the white house and little sense of how the plan would affect their own members for the proposal to work somebody out there must pay tens of billions of dollars in added taxes yet no one seems to know exactly who the presidents plan follows the dictum of the late sen russell long son of huey long the legendary louisiana governor and senator that "tax reform means dont tax me dont tax thee tax that fellow behind the tree " the u s health care system provides a veritable forest of sequoias exactly who pays how much for what remains obscure heres how the plan would work the government would give every family with health insurance a standard deduction from income taxes of &# &# for a single person for people who buy their own health care insurance this would be an instant windfall because their insurance costs arent deductible now those without health coverage would have a big incentive to buy it for people with employer provided health insurance however the benefit is harder to calculate all employer health care payments would be reported as income and the employee would have to pay taxes on them if the payments totaled less than &# the familys tax bill would go down under the bush plan if they totaled more than &# the tax bill would go up trouble is most people dont have a clue how much their employer pays for their care if the president proposed a tax on everyone who spent more than &# on a car wed know whose ox was being gored with health care most of us are in the dark which may help explain why we as a society pay so much for it any health care plan like this has its drawbacks one fear with the presidents plan is that it will push businesses to drop their health insurance a trend thats already well under way another is that it penalizes people in insurance pools dominated by older and sicker people but overall the proposal is a step in the right direction the current system of health care tax breaks is indefensible it gives generous subsidies to well paid union workers and executives who use their "cafeteria" health benefits and flexible spending plans to finance designer eyeglasses and orthodontics while providing no subsidy at all to shop clerks who must buy insurance on their own the presidents plan levels the playing field moreover the plans business backers hope it could turn americans into better health care consumers making them more aware of and more sensitive to the cost of their care will it become law not anytime soon mr bush is the lamest of ducks mired in a war in iraq and breathtakingly short on public approval meanwhile democrats already are busy fielding one of the largest casts of presidential wannabes in history washington is very unlikely to accomplish anything so ambitious in the next two years still the bush plan is a big idea that will help frame the health care debate for the future alan murray welcomes reader questions and will respond at wsj com talkingbusiness
