why you should think twice about investing in real estate real estate may be getting cheaper but homes are always expensive like any good knee jerk contrarian my enthusiasm for the property market grows as the bad news piles up only last week the federal reserves "beige book" report on regional economic conditions noted that housing markets continue to soften with sluggish home sales and falling prices in some areas so is it time to buy the vacation home youve always wanted should you trade up to a larger place it is tempting but if your sole goal is making money its mighty hard to justify counting costs when analyzing the payoff from homeownership it is critical to remember two key points first home price appreciation has historically been modest and certainly nothing like the heady gains enjoyed earlier this decade according to home finance corporation freddie mac u s house prices climbed a year over the past years versus for inflation beating inflation by percentage points a year is pun intended nothing to write home about to make matters worse after the current decades blistering performance even slimmer returns may lie ahead instead as you toy with whether to trade up to a larger place or purchase a second home your real focus should be the dividend this dividend is the rent you receive or if you live in the house yourself the "imputed rent" the rent you would have paid if you didnt own the place this rent might be worth or of a homes value each year though the figure will vary depending on the location that brings us to the second key point homeownership is horribly expensive in fact its comparable to owning a mutual fund that not only charges or so in annual expenses but also levies a or back end sales charge the back end sales charge is the commission you will likely pay to sell your home while the annual expenses reflect the triple hit from property taxes homeowners insurance and maintenance costs your annual expenses would be even higher if you add in home improvements and monthly mortgage costs but arguably neither should be included home improvements are optional expenditures while a mortgage is a borrowing cost not a cost inherent in homeownership collecting rent whats the implication of all this if you subtract the costs of homeownership from your price appreciation you are unlikely to keep pace with inflation and you might end up under water true if you have a mortgage you could enjoy leveraged gains but leverage can also bite indeed from current levels price gains may fall short of the interest rate now charged by a year fixed rate mortgage what about the mortgage tax deduction even if you figure in the tax savings the leverage may still not work in your favor all that said this could be a wonderful time to invest in real estate and no i am not making a market prediction frankly it isnt that important whether property prices climb at or a year rather what really matters is the long run dividend as savvy landlords will tell you the key to a successful investment property is finding a place that will attract good tenants who deliver a steady stream of rental income but what if you have no desire to be a landlord what if instead youre thinking of trading up to a larger house or buying a vacation home for your own use in that case all bets are off you wont collect any rental income and after all costs you probably wont make much on the price appreciation that doesnt mean you shouldnt buy that charming country cottage assuming you have the financial wherewithal and you will get a lot of pleasure from the place and clearly its better to pay s prices than s but dont kid yourself you arent investing in real estate youre consuming it
