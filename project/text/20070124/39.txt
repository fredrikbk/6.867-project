coal sector tightens belt amid soft spot recent warm weather and swelling inventories have taken the shine off coal potentially leading to further industry consolidation and lower prices for utilities and steel producers consumers however are unlikely to see relief on their power bills from the drop in price for coal the source of roughly half of the nations electricity coal producers elsewhere in the world are expanding production in the u s called the saudi arabia of coal for its vast reserves coal use for electricity is set to expand over the long term because of the fuels affordability despite concerns over emissions of carbon dioxide the gas mainly blamed for global warming producers are curbing planned growth and beginning to shut mines in an effort to reduce inventories and get supply and demand in line to keep prices from a free fall the production cuts "will likely have a painful effect on earnings " said peter ward an analyst at lehman brothers holdings inc in a note to investors this past week he said he was cutting earnings estimates for six coal companies most production cuts are expected in the east where mining costs are higher eastern coal companies cut an estimated four million short tons of production last year and some analysts expect operators there to cut million tons this year u s coal production in reached billion tons up from according to government figures consol energy inc of pittsburgh in april cut several million tons of production by shutting its shoemaker mine arch coal inc of st louis which operates in the powder river basin in wyoming and montana as well as in central appalachia said it would cut production in by million tons companies are responding more quickly than in previous pricing downturns which should help cushion the effects of this downswing "today margins are better balance sheets are better and most big coal companies are public and must answer to shareholders " said david khani an energy analyst with friedman billings ramsey group inc more frigid weather between now and the end of march could help boost demand and prices if that doesnt materialize coal producers hope for a hot summer thomas hoffman a spokesman for consol said a lack of cold weather in the next few months would make it harder on the industry "i think this is just a short term issue of weather fundamentally if the economy stays healthy theres no reason why electricity demand is going to go down " he said big producers like peabody energy corp of st louis the nations largest coal company by output are looking overseas to offset weaker demand in the u s this past fall peabody purchased a coal company in australia where demand is increasing "were really expanding in high growth markets in asia and overseas in general " said vic svec a company spokesman the company which mostly produces coal in the powder river basin has lowered growth expectations by seven million tons but still expects u s production to be higher than in peabody is set to report its results thursday the price of coal reached multidecade highs in and remained high in early prompting mining companies across the u s to restart idled mines and hire workers coal consumption by utilities fell in from the previous year estimates paul forward a coal industry analyst with stifel nicolaus &amp co primarily due to unusually mild weather that drop combined with the small overall increase in coal production had an impact on spot prices for example spot prices of coal from the powder river basin fell to the current level of &# a ton from &# in january while the price of coal from central appalachia which has a higher heat generating capacity fell to &# a ton on the spot market down from &# this time last year the drop wont likely spell relief for consumers in part because many utilities have been raising rates that had been frozen for several years but it could help industries like steel which use coal as a raw material and have faced higher supply prices heading into this year most big producers had already sold about of their anticipated production and locked in higher prices insulating them somewhat from the current slump but if a pickup in demand doesnt come soon selling the remainder at depressed prices could provide a hit to earnings said analysts and more pain could be in store next year "if theres an overhang of excess inventory throughout thats likely to have an impact on contract pricing in " mr forward said some producers also face higher costs as a result of a new wage pact with the united mine workers of america that calls for a wage increase over five years and is expected to become the industry standard companies also will have to spend more on safety equipment mandated by the federal government after a rise in mine fatalities last year prompted calls for better communications devices and oxygen packs worn by miners meanwhile sagging coal stocks have created buying opportunities for firms with better balance sheets as well as private equity funds to snatch up reserves or companies some expect acquisitions to center on central appalachia where a fifth of u s coal is mined but where hard to reach coal seams can be just four to five feet thick making mining difficult and costly in many cases mining costs there are above the price producers can get for coal others may be looking to broaden their reach earlier this month massey energy co which operates mines only in central appalachia bought a large reserve in western kentucky located in the illinois basin roger williams vice president of sales for the richmond va company said the move could help the company diversify but he said he also sees more acquisitions in central appalachia "its our view that consolidation is extremely likely to occur in central appalachia " he said "to the degree producers are under financial distress its clearly going to be a big driver "
