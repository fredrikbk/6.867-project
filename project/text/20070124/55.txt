fiscally fit tax break or burden terri investigates whether bush health plan would help or hurt the cullens bottom line this week president bush proposed a radical change in the way the government taxes health insurance in an effort to spur more individuals to buy coverage the president didnt offer a lot of specifics in his speech but according to a fact sheet released by the administration his proposal would work something like this taxpayers with health insurance coverage wouldnt pay federal income or payroll taxes on the first &# of income &# for singles that income exclusion is slightly higher than the average cost of health insurance according to the kaiser family foundation the annual premium for an employer health plan covering a family of four averaged about &# in with single coverage averaging slightly more than &# however for the first time the cost of employer provided health insurance would be considered taxable income for the worker right now insurance premiums paid for by employers are exempt from income and payroll taxes self employed workers generally are allowed to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums from taxable income under the proposed plan if your health care premiums total less than &# your tax bill should go down according to the administration a household earning &# would save about &# in taxes under the proposal including &# in income tax savings and &# in savings from payroll taxes for social security and medicare but if your employer pays for a pricey comprehensive health care plan your taxes could rise as my print colleague alan murray noted in his column on the bush proposal that tax increase would likely be borne by union members and high paid executives the proposed tax change was first floated by the presidents advisory panel on federal tax reform back in november one of the panels assumptions was that workers preferred that their bosses pay for insurance with untaxed dollars rather than having to use after tax income to pay for it themselves the panel also concluded that workers with employer sponsored health insurance spend more on health care than they would if they had to pay for it themselves which drives up the cost of health care in general the panel suggested that a tax incentive to buy lower cost insurance might result in more consumers having coverage and spending less on health care i set out to determine what effect the bush proposal might have on my familys bottom line though granted theres no guarantee the proposal will ever see the light of day my familys covered by a health care plan through my husband gerrys labor union i opt out of my companys health insurance plan first i needed to find out how much gerrys employer pays into his unions welfare fund annually for our familys coverage i had no idea what our premiums cost but i knew it had to be expensive because we have a preferred provider organization plan or ppo with vision and dental coverage it was relatively easy for me to find that number since the cost is detailed in gerrys labor agreement &# if you dont know how much your benefits cost and you want to play along at home ask your employer or benefits administrator if the tax change is implemented i presume employers will be required to report on your w how much your premiums cost along with your earnings theres a separate debate over how companies will determine how much an individuals health care coverage costs it may not be as simple as dividing the total cost by the number of employees but well leave that one alone this time around i hit my home computer and called up our tax returns on turbotax i added the &# for the health insurance coverage that would be counted as income under the new plan then subtracted the proposed tax break of &# from gerrys annual wages and salaries that dropped our federal income tax bill to &# from &# for a savings of &# so at first glance the new tax plan would benefit our family but the devil is in the details would that &# income exclusion be indexed for inflation if so would it be indexed for inflation or health insurance premium inflation in medical costs rose while the consumer price index rose just according to the bureau of labor statistics but health insurance premiums jumped even higher last year up according to the kaiser family foundation and premiums are predicted to continue to outpace consumer inflation going forward a increase in health care premiums would increase the cost of our health care plan and therefore our income by &# under the proposed plan shaving about &# off our hypothetical tax savings if that continued within a few years our costs would cross the &# threshold and wed end up with a bigger tax bill unless the break is indexed to account for rising premium costs its easy to see how it might morph into a growing burden similar to the alternative minimum tax which was never indexed for inflation and is now unintentionally affecting millions of middle income taxpayers once implemented might congress become dependent on the increasing revenues generated by the proposed health insurance tax change as it has with the amt i also have to question whether the white houses proposal would have the intended effect of nudging uninsured people into buying coverage or prompting workers to drop out of expensive employer sponsored health care plans and find more lower cost coverage on their own affluent workers would probably stick with their gold standard health plans rather than accept a lower level of service in return for a relatively small tax break and my experience growing up in a low income family makes me skeptical that many of these uninsured workers would run out and buy health insurance because of a promised tax break im assuming youd have to pay health care premiums for a year before seeing any financial benefit from lower taxes middle income workers would likely benefit most if the tax break is indexed for premium inflation since many are already seeking out more affordable coverage on their own because their employers plans have become prohibitively expensive would you choose a more restrictive health insurance plan if the government taxed you for choosing a comprehensive one how much would you pay to keep your coverage write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com and then join me and your fellow readers in a discussion about health insurance benefits a number of readers emailed me to share their thoughts on a recent column on my familys personal savings rate some offered their own suggestions on how to more accurately factor in all of our familys costs read on for some of their comments or join me in a continuing discussion on how much americans should be saving letters have been edited in response to your column on savings it stands out to me that all of your income is earned i assume that you and your husband love your jobs and will stay healthy until the age of to carry these jobs out but i think its important to start diversify into other revenue streams that will generate income and work as hard as you do additionally earned income is taxed the highest versus a vehicle like the futures market which is not taxed as high and can generate monthly income for me "retirement" is when my passive income exceeds my monthly expenses then you can have multiple choices and additional flexibility rodney robinson i notice you dont list car payments in your expenses i believe that even if you dont have a car payment you need to account for the depreciation of your vehicles in your savings rate i feel very strongly about this because cars depreciate so quickly and eventually need to be replaced obviously if you dont have a car this thinking would change some people kid themselves that they dont have an expense when they have no car payment but they do because the value of the car is sinking every month even if it isnt driven jeff longenecker you noted that you no longer save for "big ticket" items in advance rather you use your home equity line of credit to fund them while i can see the logic in doing that for something like home renovation projects i dont see the logic in doing so for a big screen tv my husband and i joke that nothing in our house was purchased unless we could get a interest rate for anywhere between to months we always pay these off in full before theyre due to avoid any interest charges granted if you can get a store to offer you a lower price rather than the "free" interest it can be to your benefit but with a lot of the "big box" stores thats not even an option amy kuntz you plan on retiring at age what about health care insurance as you know current cobra coverage will only get you to age would you qualify for a retirement health plan if not current underwriting eligibility for individual health care policies are very tough and very expensive especially if you or your husband have any type of health condition i e high blood pressure high cholesterol cancer etc many people would love to retire early but lack of quality affordable health care coverage is the problem bob slovin write to me at fiscallyfit wsj com
