spending sincerity test members of congress applauded president bushs lines about spending restraint last night but we are about to get a test of their sincerity when the senate votes today on the line item veto the official description of new hampshire senator judd greggs legislation is "rescission" authority and it is notably less powerful than the genuine "veto" power congress granted bill clinton in before it was struck down by the supreme court but the impulse behind it is the same give mr bush and his successors the power to single out and send back to congress the thousands of wasteful "earmark" projects that bloat todays spending bills congress would then be required to vote up or down and within days on the spending cuts its no accident that mr greggs bill is nearly identical to a rescission amendment offered by former democratic senator and one time majority leader tom daschle in in fact mr daschles version gave the president more power allowing him to submit as many as rescissions a year compared with only four in the gregg proposal no fewer than democrats voted for the daschle amendment in and of them are still in the senate yet how times and partisanship have changed west virginias robert byrd took to the senate floor this week to denounce mr greggs amendment as "garbage" his eloquence is legendary and to complain that it gave too much power to the president thats an old byrd song when republicans are in the white house but back in with mr clinton in office the earl of earmarks noted that the daschle proposal "does not result in any shift of power from the legislative branch to the executive it is clear cut it gives the president the opportunity to get a vote so i am percent behind the substitute by mr daschle " californias dianne feinstein also hailed rescission authority in as a "deterrence" to "the pork barrel " wisconsins russ feingold extolled it as "a useful tool " washingtons patty murray said the president should have the power to veto "pork items" that "contribute to our deficit " north dakotas byron dorgan in said it would be "helpful in imposing budget discipline " senators chris dodd carl levin and joe biden also had nice things to say if this crowd meant what they said mr gregg will easily get the votes he needs to overcome a filibuster yet so far not a single democrat has publicly supported the measure and republicans had to threaten to hold up the ethics reform bill last week even to get an item veto vote on the senate floor this is all the more remarkable given that the senate democratic caucus is teeming with wannabe presidents who would love the power that bill clinton once had if they ever make it to the white house perhaps they lack confidence in their candidacies or perhaps they simply dont want to hand mr bush anything he could call a victory democrats ran hard against gop overspending last year so voters will be watching what they do in the run up to a vote against the line item veto is a vote for earmarks and spending as usual
