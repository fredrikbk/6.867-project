the king and prince of high school hoops from until bob hurley enjoyed every success imaginable coach hurley won more than basketball games and state championships while besting of his opponents at tiny st anthony high a school without its own gym and which can be found by making a hard left out of the holland tunnel in jersey city n j then the program fell from grace if only by the beatific standards of st anthony in and they lost eight games and won a mere games and no state titles now they are back on top undefeated after games and ranked fourth in the nation by usa today but eight miles away in newark bobs son danny is doing even better he coaches at st benedicts which is currently and currently ranked number one in the nation after graduating from st anthony danny played for seton hall and was an assistant coach at rutgers before returning to the high school level still "ninety percent of what i do is from my dad " danny says and why not if you ever wondered how much coaching can do for a team watch st anthony for five minutes at a practice even warm ups tell the story the team takes the floor like a cross between the army rangers and alvin ailey tipping the ball off the backboard and whipping it corner to corner with speed and precision no lay up lines here when the game begins st anthony starting four juniors traps and presses forcing turnover after turnover on offense the players pass the ball so well that dribbling is rarely necessary bob hurley has coached four undefeated teams his most recent in was perhaps his most impressive they won every game and were ranked number two nationally despite the fact that none of the seniors would play in a top tier college program that season was chronicled by adrian wojnarowski in his wonderful book "the miracle of st anthony " it seemed that the team would be even better but a rash of injuries and a plague of careless play led to five losses including a point loss to st patricks an awful year for the st anthony friars meanwhile st benedicts already a top squad was rising to national prominence under danny the team finished at in the team wound up losing only to st patricks by a point and to oak hill academy a prep school from mouth of wilson va which attracts players from around the country and barnstorms the nation st benedicts was also producing blue chip talent five of its former players are now at top division i programs a sixth j r smith jumped directly to the nba and is starting for the denver nuggets this year despite losing three seniors to duke marquette and seton hall the st benedicts gray bees picked up where they left off neither coach is ever satisfied at the dan finn classic in jersey city this past weekend st anthonys played a winning hoboken n j high school team starting the game in a fury and finishing the first quarter leading on the way to a win but after the game coach hurley was disappointed with the effort of the second string in particular during a four minute stretch of the third quarter "you have to respect your minutes " he lectured singling out two upperclassmen for their lack of leadership victory he says can breed inattention to detail danny is little different while not as fierce as his dad he demands the same full court focus at one recent practice held a few days after st benedicts beat prep charter of philadelphia the reigning state champion of pennsylvania the coach stopped practice and berated his players for being too soft on each other "you have to get mad at your teammates " he told the team "there is a fine line between patting a guy on his back and putting your foot up his backside " at the time it seemed like the players were making a brave effort danny didnt disagree but needed to keep them motivated "when youre and number two in the country you have to make up something " he explained later soon after oak hill lost its first game to chicago simeon high school clearing the top spot for st benedicts coming off its dan finn classic win over plainfield n j high school both hurleys emphasize tradition "let me tell you something fellas its a privilege to play here and to go to school here " danny tells his team one college coach university of cincinnati assistant larry davis scouting a st anthony practice marvels at how hard the kids compete and notes "when they come here they know its not about them its about st anthony " st anthony and st benedicts are often on the same court on the same day but never at the same time they were both at the dan finn in jersey city and will both play this weekend at st benedicts brian doherty classic and at the primetime shootout in trenton starting feb but by decree of bobs wife and dannys mom the two teams will never play each other since st benedicts plays in a division of mostly prep schools rather than the all parochial league in which st anthony competes the two schools do not even meet in the state tournament so the question remains who would win at first blush st benedicts would seem to have the edge while most of its players are from newark and its suburbs its top ranked player foot inch samardo samuels a junior came to the school from jamaica and st anthony has no big man with his size and power combined with a soft touch around the basket on the other hand st anthony is unparalleled defensively and has a quicker backcourt with buildings a acre campus and boys in its high school st benedicts has a huge advantage but if resources mattered st anthony with students boys and a rented gym wouldnt beat anybody the college coaches scouting the two teams either cant or wont answer the question "thatd be quite a contest " says one venturing no further danny hurley evades the question directly "i dont even want to think about that scenario it would make me my dad my wife my mom it would drive us crazy " mr ackman is a writer based in jersey city n j
