as duo publicizes bugs in os x mac owners rush to the rescue with the launch of microsofts new vista operating system next week this was supposed to be the month for windows to be in the limelight but thanks to a pair of self styled security experts the macintosh is also getting its share of attention though not the sort apple particularly likes late last month a notice began circulating in computer security forums that january would be the "month of apple bugs " it sounds like a merry old festival and it is in a perverse way each day a new security flaw involving the macs os x operating system was to be posted online two men made the promise kevin finisterre a year old ohioan with a history of being interested in apple security questions and his partner "lmh " the latter refuses to divulge any personal information about himself though others by tracing his ip address say he is based in europe probably spain lmh explained in an email that "we are doing this for a few reasons one of them is having fun enjoying working on new possibilities and researching os x security another important one is the flawed assumption caused by apple publicizing the fact that macs are more secure than pcs " looking for flaws in software is an entirely honorable calling indeed there have been other "month of bugs" efforts involving other big pieces of code including linux and while reasonable people can debate the extent to which macs are or are not inherently more secure than pcs as opposed to just being a lesser target for virus makers by virtue of their smaller market share it doesnt hurt any piece of software for it to be poked and prodded the polite way to do this though is to find what you think is a bug and then to quietly alert the software company responsible for it giving the company a decent amount of time to fix the problem before its publicized but thats pointedly not what the month of apple bugs duo is doing instead the two are telling everyone about each daily bug at the same time the pairs attitude seems to be that two wrongs do make a right when i asked lmh if their course of action was the responsible thing to do he emailed back "the irresponsible thing is making someone pay more than k us dollars for a nifty machine with broken software " apples response is that the mac has a peerless security record overall meanwhile as soon as the bugs started coming over the transom mac owners came to the rescue notably landon fuller a year old programmer who briefly worked at apple but who now heads up computer operations at a san francisco game maker on new years day mr fuller put word out on the web that he would try to create a fix for each apple bug as soon as it was publicized others wrote in offering their help and there quickly emerged a cadre of programmers who each morning would get to work on fixing the bug du jour "it is a technically very challenging thing to do " says mr fuller in explaining his motivation he also didnt at all like the idea of not telling software makers about the flaws before publicizing them a week or so after mr fuller started his bug patching program mr finisterre and lmh emailed him and offered to make him their partner he would be told early about each bug so that he could start working on his patch but only on the condition that he not tell anyone else before they announced the bug mr fuller declined saying that would make him complicit in a practice he strongly disagreed with you may not like the bug spotting duos sense of computer ethics or their sense of humor some visitors to their web site get redirected to a porn site but you have to admire their productivity as of monday jan they were right on track with reported bugs fortunately for mac owners not all bugs are created equal mr fuller says that while a number of the flaws were significant many others pose little or no security threat they would simply cause a program to stop working and some have long been known about in one form or another indeed a number of the affected programs werent even written by apple but by software companies selling products for the mac some of which have quite small shares of the market there was though at least one "showstopper" bug says mr fuller a flaw in apples quicktime movie player that in theory at least could allow a web site to use a specially crafted quicktime video to take over someones computer there is no report of any miscreants taking advantage of the bug if youre worried about it you can get mr fullers patch at landonf bikemonkey org though be warned the site is something of a geek only affair apple released a fix for the quicktime problem yesterday afternoon patches for any other serious bugs should be available soon unfortunately it will be a slightly longer wait for the glorious day when computer owners no longer have to worry about this sort of nonsense email me at lee gomes wsj com
