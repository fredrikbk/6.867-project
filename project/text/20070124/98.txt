slide in crude oil prices may hurt natural rubber singapore a continued slide in crude oil prices could weigh heavily on natural rubber prices and trigger a shift toward an increased use of synthetic alternatives industry analysts said while both natural and synthetic rubber are used in manufacturing producers such as tire makers have the flexibility to change the ratio as one gets cheaper than the other falling crude oil prices in recent weeks are expected to result in cheaper synthetic rubber if the current trend continues and increased use of synthetic rubber in manufacturing could become viable again for many companies "if natural rubber prices dont move in tandem with lower oil prices there could be a switch" to more synthetic rubber goodyear tire &amp rubber co s u s based spokesman keith price said friday "synthetic rubber prices are not immediately impacted by oil prices but there is a relationship since synthetics feedstock is derived from oil " he said crude oil has slumped around since july when prices rose to a record of more than &# a barrel friday crude hit a month low with analysts attributing the fall to a build up in global stockpiles and milder winter temperatures in the northern hemisphere meanwhile rubber prices which slumped around between june and november have recouped much of those losses last week the benchmark ribbed smoke sheet grade rubber contract on the tokyo commodity exchange touched a five month high before settling at yen &# per kilogram above the monthly low set jan although it is difficult to draw a direct price comparison an industry analyst said synthetic butadiene rubber a standard industry benchmark is currently around cheaper in the u s than natural rubber and with rubber prices rising and crude falling the gap is getting wider "we could see a closer correlation between the price of natural and synthetic rubber in the future " said hidde smit secretary general of the london based international rubber study group the organization that sets statistical benchmarks for the natural rubber industry "oil can have an effect on synthetic rubber production costs but its not that easy for manufacturers to shift between the two the margins available to them are generally small around technology or lack of is the boundary currently stopping the shift " mr smit said mr smit has previously said the increasing correlation between the two could mean natural rubber will be more sensitive to softening synthetic prices in the future though a supply and demand deficit could be the driving factor behind any major shift around of the worlds natural rubber is used in tire manufacturing while chinese consumers currently account for around of that consumption according to statistics released by the chinese general administration of customs this week china imported million tons of natural rubber in a rise on year while synthetic rubber imports rose more than to million tons during the same period major tire manufacturers say they are keen to increase their ability to use synthetic substitutes should synthetic rubber become much cheaper they say the option of being able to substitute the percentage of natural rubber with synthetic rubber gives them greater flexibility in the event of supply disruptions and will cut costs if the price difference between the two widens the goodyear spokesman said the company now has the ability to use more of natural or synthetic rubber than the usual mix without impacting the performance of tires the tire industrys average ability to switch is about more than the usual ratio in addition to cost benefits synthetic rubber also has the ability to be more "purposefully designed " goodyears mr price said the latex glove manufacturing industry the second biggest consumer of natural rubber after the tire industry consumes around tons of latex a year and is particularly vulnerable to fluctuating rubber prices as natural rubber currently constitutes around of the total production cost meaning rising costs have to be passed on to the consumer but industry analysts say quality could be the key factor in natural rubber maintaining the edge over synthetic alternatives in the glove industry natural materials currently have the edge over petroleum based alternatives because of the latters potentially harmful environmental impact while medical reports also suggest natural rubber could offer better barrier protection said henry tong president of the asean rubber glove manufacturers association "the ability to switch between the two is relatively high in the glove making industry but the advantages of natural materials over petroleum based alternatives have so far managed to outweigh the extra cost to the consumer " mr tong said industry analysts say any close correlation between the price of natural rubber and synthetic rubber will only be seen in the long term and the current rally in rubber prices contradicts crudes reversal indicating natural rubber may not be much influenced by oil prices in the shorter term but the issue of long term flexibility and the ability to trim rising production costs is high on most manufacturers agenda "that price relationship could appear in time because a lower oil price will in the longer term mean a lower synthetic rubber price " mr price said "the ability to switch between the two doesnt eliminate our raw material cost concerns but it does give us greater flexibility in the event of price fluctuations and supply disruptions and can provide a competitive advantage " he said
