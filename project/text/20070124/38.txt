bush offers plan to curb reliance on foreign oil state of the union tilts toward domestic issues long odds for agenda washington president bush yesterday offered a blueprint he said would lead toward u s energy security and independence calling for a cut in gasoline consumption over the next decade through new fuel economy standards and a massive boost in federal mandates for using ethanol and other alternative fuels amplifying the theme of weaning the country from its reliance on oil mr bush used a state of the union address weighted heavily to domestic issues to urge a doubling of the nations strategic petroleum stockpile to protect against a sudden cutoff of foreign supplies "for too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil " he said echoing his famous declaration of last years speech that the country was "addicted to oil " "the dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes and to terrorists " he added the politically weakened mr bushs latest energy initiative marks the start of his attempt to try to define himself as something other than a lame duck president facing a hostile democrat led congress and consumed largely with iraq his call for alternative fuels with a brief nod toward global warming concerns was just one of many ways he tried to find common ground with the democrats who will determine the fate of his agenda in his minute address the president also put forth plans for expanding health coverage to the uninsured renewing calls for a comprehensive immigration package that was rejected by the previous republican led congress extending his "no child left behind" education program and offering new overseas assistance to combat aids and malaria "our citizens dont much care which side of the aisle we sit on as long as we are willing to cross that aisle when work is to be done " mr bush said as a democratic speaker of the house nancy pelosi sat prominently behind him for the first time in his presidency while the white house touted the energy agenda as one of the most significant parts of mr bushs agenda achieving its goals rests on the uncertainty of technological breakthroughs and the administration is promising relatively little money to subsidize what would be a major redirection in the countrys energy markets mr bush also asked congress for the power to "reform and modernize" fuel economy standards yet continued to reject calls for legislation mandating specific higher fuel standards he maintains that regulators rather than lawmakers are better situated to set new higher requirements for auto makers and the president avoided widespread demands to embrace new economy wide caps on so called greenhouse gases instead asserting that greater use of cleaner energies would lead to a reduction in these emissions widely believed to cause global warming "the way forward is through technology " he said by seizing on the goal of "energy independence " mr bush has chosen a topic on which the public thirst for action is growing it is also an initiative with significant consequences for national security policy if the country actually succeeded in significantly cutting its appetite for oil its stake in the middle eastern problems that so bedevil the president would be reduced though mr bush focused on issues popular with democrats and shunned old favorites he touted before the more friendly republican majority such as broad tax cuts it remains unclear how much he will be able to set the agenda in washington virginias newly elected sen james webb giving the democrats formal response to the address asked mr bush to move closer to democrats on foreign policy and domestic issues "if he does we will join him " mr webb said "if he does not we will be showing him the way " farm state democrats are likely to embrace and expand upon mr bushs plans for a big bump in ethanol and biodiesel production they are likely to take his proposals for increased research funding as an opening bid and go up from there mr webb praised mr bushs energy proposals and said "we look forward to working with the president and his party to bring about these changes " mr bushs call for immigration law changes seems likely to gain traction as well and drew a standing ovation from lawmakers but his plans for overhauling fuel economy standards face longer odds in congress as do proposals to give a big tax deduction to spur health insurance purchases and to cull funds from federal low income health programs for state efforts to create insurance pools for poor people though mr bush devoted the first half of his address entirely to domestic issues he couldnt avoid the iraq war and it consumed most of the second half he included specific warnings to the country that failure would give iraqi extremists a haven for plotting attacks against u s targets while emboldening iran to pursue nuclear weapons and he asked almost pleaded for a skeptical congress to support his "new strategy in iraq " saying "i ask you to give it a chance to work " but the significance the white house attached to the energy plan was underscored by the decision to send mr bush on a first post speech appearance this morning to delaware with energy secretary samuel bodman to visit a dupont co research facility working on biofuels last year mr bush called for doubling the research for fuels made from farm wastes such as corn stalks and straw however his proposed funding for the first commercial size plants was stymied in congress the centerpiece of mr bushs newest energy plan is a significant increase in federal targets for use of renewable and alternative fuels categories that include ethanol made from corn the current standard aims for consumption of billion gallons by a level the u s is likely to hit within about a year thanks to ethanols growing popularity the new target would be billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels by an amount mr bush hopes will reduce projected gasoline consumption by about the white house said oil companies would be required to mix a certain proportion of renewables into the fuel they distribute if they dont they would face a penalty democrats and republicans particularly those from midwestern states cheered the idea but boosting ethanol use isnt as easy as the president made it sound there isnt currently enough corn in the u s to make all the fuel the white house says will be used and environmentalists worry that adding to corn production would increase pollution making ethanol from cleaner sources such as wood chips isnt yet commercially proven the energy plans second main element is a rewrite of federal fuel economy standards that assumes the administration will raise passenger car mileage standards by more each year by those changes would shave another off projected gasoline use for a total reduction of in years together the proposals also would speed up by eight years mr bushs goal from last years speech of eliminating the equivalent of of current middle east oil imports the increase in the corporate average fuel economy cafe standard is about twice the increase the administration imposed last year on light trucks and is in line with several proposals on capitol hill industry and environmental lobbyists both consider a year to be a significant increase though some are skeptical the administration will follow through while the cafe change is likely to upset some auto makers the administration has designed it with a feature that could be appealing to some a provision for creating cafe credits for manufacturers that exceed one or more of the standards which could be traded or banked for future use the white house said in materials distributed earlier in the day that the energy plan would also serve as the administrations climate change policy asserting it would "help confront climate change by stopping the projected growth of carbon emissions from cars light trucks and suvs within years " in his health care package mr bush is offering to raise taxes on generally higher income earners in the name of making health care more available for lower income people the white house plan would make employer provided health insurance taxable for the first time but it would create a big new tax deduction &# for families and &# for singles for everyone who gets insurance whether at work or on their own the plan would also help states extend insurance coverage by diverting money that now supports hospitals that care for the poor into state created programs that subsidized basic insurance plans the foreign policy component of mr bushs remarks contained an implicit acknowledgment of how much u s power has ebbed in recent years because of the war in iraq and how the conflict has significantly reduced leverage over adversaries such as iran and north korea white house aides privately conceded before the speech that u s failures in iraq had sharply increased irans influence and that tehran seemed to be gambling the u s would be unable to wage a military campaign against iran because the american military was so overstretched mr bushs public remarks about the middle east have in the past focused heavily on sunni muslim extremist groups like al qaeda but mr bush last night said "the shia and sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat " the speech also featured a revival of mr bushs argument that the fighting in iraq shouldnt be looked at in isolation but as part of a broader confrontation with islamic militants and as a more ideological conflict between forces of moderation and extremism both wars mr bush said would last long after he had left office laura meckler in washington and mike spector in detroit contributed to this article
