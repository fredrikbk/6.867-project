politics &amp economics sustained robust growth challenges beijing gains spur leaders to address gap between rich poor by delivering another year of double digit growth china is managing to sustain a surprisingly fast economic expansion that success is prompting the countrys leaders to try to better manage the economys excesses and ensure that the growths benefits are more widely spread through society it now looks certain that chinas economy has expanded by or more in real terms for four straight years the government has issued a preliminary estimate of for economic growth in the national bureau of statistics is scheduled to release a more detailed account of the nations economic performance for the year tomorrow but isnt likely to revise that figure substantially if current growth rates continue china could overtake germany as the worlds third largest national economy with annual output of more than &# trillion as early as china passed the &# trillion mark in when it replaced the united kingdom as the fourth largest economy by comparison the worlds advanced economies together probably grew about last year many observers see in china the st century counterpart to the emergence of the u s and germany as industrial powers in the early part of the th century and of japan in the latter half by shifting millions of people out of agriculture and into manufacturing and by investing to build the infrastructure of an advanced economy all of those countries at different times managed long periods of sustained fast growth china gets the benefit of following a path the others have already laid down "china is bursting at the seams it is growing much faster than any emerging economy has ever " said carl weinberg chief economist of high frequency economics "what that tells us is that its easier to develop in a developed world its easier to modernize when all the countries around you are already modernized " chinas four year run could even be considered unexceptional for the country its economy has grown an average of about a year since it began market reforms in what has changed in more recent times is that the rate of growth has steadied from year to year making the economy less volatile that can be attributed in part to better policy making as well as the increasing size of the private sector which is less prone to the boom and bust investment cycles of the planned economy in addition skeptics believe chinas official economic statistics understate actual volatility from a longer term perspective the past couple of years have seen a cyclical upswing to slightly above average growth rates for china helped by a surge in exports and investment many analysts expect china to face something of a cyclical downswing over the next couple of years but in the chinese context that would mean annual growth rates that are perhaps closer to than the combination of large absolute size and fast growth has made china attractive to businesspeople and investors world wide in just a decade china has nearly tripled its per capita gross domestic product a rough measure of the size of the economic pie available to each person yet that figure is still less than &# compared with more than &# in the u s and more than &# in japan china is far from a rich country especially because its rural population which accounts for some three quarters of the nation has badly lagged behind the gains in its more prosperous cities "even though chinas economy is already among the largest in the world china has billion people and in terms of per capita gdp does not even rank in the top " premier wen jiabao said in a speech this month "economic and social development is very uneven so for a fairly long time into the future development will still be our central task " rural incomes are still growing more slowly than in the country as a whole and there is evidence some of the poorest are becoming even worse off rather than focusing on growth alone policy makers are now trying to achieve a more equitable distribution of resources for instance the government has canceled school fees for children in rural areas and has also promised to expand the coverage of basic medical insurance and social welfare plans which now focus primarily on the cities to more rural residents
