remote control caracas the president of the bolivarian republic of venezuela hugo chavez has verbally announced his decision to shut down radio caracas television rctv our tv station the oldest in venezuela as well as the one with the largest audience so continues a long series of attacks against journalists employees management and shareholders of many independent media companies the aim of all this is to limit the citizens right to seek information and entertainment in the media of their choice to impede public access to those media where they might express or encounter criticism of the government or their proposals for reform to stifle the pluralism of opinion in news and talk programs and to cut off the free flow of information and debate in venezuela instead the chavez government seeks to install a system that it has described without apparent irony as the "communicational and informative hegemony of the state " on june president chavez dressed in military fatigues gave a speech on the occasion of the delivery of a batch of kalashnikov ak s to an army battalion he brandished a weapon then pointed it at a cameraman and said "with this rifle which has a range of meters i could take out that wee red light on your camera " moments later he declared "we have to review the licenses of the tv companies " in the weeks that followed the incident various government officials repeated the same threat and started to monitor the editorial positions of the media "there have been qualitative changes in programming in news selection and in the editorial line" of some media an official observed "but there are other cases in which we have not seen this change this rectification " he reminded us all that the government "has the ability not to renew a media license " on nov a month before the venezuelan presidential elections president chavez repeated his threat "im reminding certain media above all in television that they mustnt be surprised if i say there are no more licenses for certain tv channels im the head of state " on dec president chavez again in military uniform declared that the broadcasting license for rctv would not be renewed "the order has already been drafted so they should start shutting down their studios " he provided detail "the license ends in march" but two weeks later in the national assembly he contradicted himself saying that our license would end in may at that same time he launched a campaign of attack ads in all state run media paid for with public funds aimed at discrediting our station in the eyes of the country on jan in his annual address to the national assembly he changed his tune again and said "the transmission signal belongs to the venezuelan people and will be nationalized for all venezuelans " he added "rctv has only a few days left they can scream stomp their feet do whatever they want but the license is finished they can say whatever they want i dont care its over " these verbal threats constitute de facto a public decision to silence rctv but rctv has never been informed legally or formally of the measures that are to be taken against it nor have we ever been told what exactly are the accusations against us which makes it difficult for us to defend ourselves president chavez has violated the presumption of innocence and has denied us due process the actions against rctv of president chavez and his subordinates are in violation of the venezuelan constitution the american convention on human rights and the inter american democratic charter they are a clear example of abuse of power and violate the right to work of all those in the media industry not to mention a violation of the freedom of thought and expression of millions of citizens who seek information and ideas of their own free choice we are faced in effect with an aggressive campaign to extinguish all thought that differs from that which is officially dubbed "revolutionary " in fact president chavezs threat to shut down rctv has even led jose miguel insulza secretary general of the organization of american states to express his dismay publicly "the shut down of a large media company is a very rare occurrence in the history of our continent and has no precedent in the last decades of democracy " organizations such as human rights watch and the committee to protect journalists among others have also raised the alarm but the reaction of hugo chavez has been typically crude its the way he reacts whenever faced with someone who has the temerity to disagree with him he says and has said repeatedly that theres nothing to discuss "rctv has only a few days left they can scream stomp their feet do whatever they want but its all over " mr granier is chairman of radio caracas television this piece was translated from the original spanish by tunku varadarajan
