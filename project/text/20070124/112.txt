the daily fix gonzalez bounces nadal from the australian open exit nadal the no ranked player in mens tennis was rudely bounced from the australian open dismantled by chiles th ranked fernando gonzalez in what the ages michael gleeson calls "the battle of the long haired head banded lotharios " "players have been waiting days now for the gonzalez streak to end " mr gleeson writes "at which is old in tennis years and only having just reached the top he last night made his first grand slam semi final they are not the statistics of someone playing as well as gonzalez is playing surely this is a purple patch that must end soon when he defeated lleyton hewitt he was figured to have played as well as he could against james blake it continued but surely last night against the world no it would end maybe gonzalez is a player taking advantage of the first real tournament of the season striking a break on the competition or maybe gonzalez really just is this good " next up for mr gonzalez th ranked tommy haas with the winner of their match to face either roger federer or andy roddick in the finals on the womens side the semifinals feature maria sharapova facing kim clijsters and serena williams against year old nicole vaidisova ms williams advanced by gutting out a win over shahar peer on sporting leave from the israeli army thats a situation bud collins of the boston globe has entirely too much fun with merrily switching between theater and military metaphors "what do you do for an encore " he asks "if youre sister serena aspiring actress whose day job is playing tennis you take a few bows smile a lot and are pleased to be scheduled for another audition tomorrow the role sought by her and five rivals two russians a czech a swiss a belgian is that of the queen in a seven act drama called the australian open williams a floridian abroad knows that part cold because she played it in and getting rave notices from the critics however a lot of critics people she scorns as negativists felt shed forgotten her best lines and stumbled through the few gigs shes had tournaments over the last months scattered wins no titles in two years since this one hardly ready for prime time anymore yesterday was the day to run through the fifth act again the quarterfinals " gilbert arenas is giving the nba a much needed shot of fun the washington wizards star guard calls himself "agent zero " has his own unique vocabulary and puts up the kind of numbers that let him get away with a certain free spiritedness witness last month when he scored points yelling "hibachi " after launching each shot as the wizards beat the mighty phoenix suns in overtime but sometimes fun gets a reality check last night in a rematch mr arenas had points and the wizards put up a good showing but not enough to keep phoenix from rolling to a win "getting the suns a game was quite a compliment and also a reminder that theres still a little gap between the wizards and the top teams in the nba " writes michael wilbon in the washington post adding that "the suns first half performance was essentially a basketball clinic conducted at the wizards expense even with amare stoudemire reduced to minutes of playing time because of foul trouble that first half the suns flashed just about everything in their repertoire they outscored the wizards the top scoring team in the east on fast break points they ran pick and roll pick and pop they spread the floor and let the foot stoudemire the teams secondary playmaker post up in the lane and look for cutters or shooters " football fans a moment of your attention the fix is looking for a fan of the indianapolis colts and a fan of the chicago bears to write an ode to that team why are you a fan why root for the uniform in other words what characteristics does your team have year in and year out even as the cast of characters changes why should the fates smile on them in the super bowl if youre game write to us and tell us a little about yourself and why youre the right person for the job speaking of the nfl yesterday the oakland raiders trotted out new coach lane kiffin all of years old providing plenty of sound bites and one absolutely terrifying photo of owner al davis looking like hes about to crash through your monitor and bite you in the throat click here to see deadspins ace commentors go to town on this one with occasional profanities in the san francisco chronicle ray ratto says mr kiffin made one mistake he fell back on the old sports cliche of wanting to look forward rather than back to the teams dreadful campaign "and that worked so very well with mark mcgwire " mr ratto cracks "kiffin is the new raiders coach because of the past he is the youngest nfl coach since fritz pollard played for and coached the akron pros at age because of the past kiffin can go on and on about how hard he will work about how demanding practices will be about how the culture of crummy will change but its all because of the past " mr kiffin he writes "was hired specifically to repair the ravages of the worst season in raiders history and he cannot adequately do that if he doesnt know completely about and fully face that season even a quick i saw it i vomited like all the rest of you did and i can pledge that will never ever happen again would have served him well it would have shown he felt the raiders collective pain and intends to try to fix it though not having to accept any blame for it " clarkston ga was a sleepy little town until the late s when resettlement agencies decided it was a good place for refugees to begin new lives in the u s the result has been a culture clash one crystallized in the debate over soccer as warren st john writes in the new york times "as many as half the residents are refugees from war torn countries around the world " he writes "placed by resettlement agencies in a once mostly white town they receive days of assistance from the government and then are left to fend for themselves soccer is their game but to many longtime residents soccer is a sign of unwanted change as unfamiliar and threatening as the hijabs worn by the muslim women in town its not football its not baseball the fields werent made for it caught in the middle is a boys soccer program called the fugees short for refugees though most opponents guess the name refers to the hip hop band " heres betting you wont forget this story and that youll find yourself cheering for luma mufleh the fugees indefatigable coach vern ruhle a hurler with the detroit tigers houston astros cleveland indians and california angels before they opted for a nonsensical name and a pitching coach for the astros philadelphia phillies new york mets and cincinnati reds died sunday after a year long battle with cancer he was in the dayton daily news hal mccoy remembers "a gentlemans gentleman a guy who cared about people and thought more about them than he did himself when one asked ruhle a baseball question it was like asking for a drink of water and getting niagara falls not only did he answer the question he answered things he wasnt asked because he loved talking about pitching and it was worth hearing like the constant buzz of an old neon sign that reminded one of the good ol days " "this is not a story about football " warns gabriele marcotti in the times uk "it is a story about a footballer and his roots and how however much we may be endowed with free will and the ability to shape our destiny some of us cannot escape what we are born into " its a sad story about the death of giovanni montani one of italys most promising young strikers and it all begins amazingly with a young man who wanted to buy a puppy for his sisters birthday tip of the fix cap to reader john falck
