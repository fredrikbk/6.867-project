a cultral converstaion with bruce berman a producer of moving pictures whose taste runs to stills burbank calif at first you wouldnt know you were in the offices of a big time film production company in the lobby of village roadshow pictures where you might expect a poster of the cyber fiction smash "the matrix " theres a small black and white photo by walker evans of a depression era alabama landlord where there might well be stills of george clooney in the stylish "oceans eleven" or the stunning "three kings " theres a photo by weegee of a crowd of normal folk behind a barricade at a s hollywood event and instead of a picture of clint eastwood directing "mystic river" or denzel washington collecting his oscar for "training day " theres a large joel sternfeld photo of an unremarkable house in east elmhurst queens circa move over to the windows of this ninth floor suite in the warner bros corporate building and youll remember where you are as you gaze down over the small beige city that is the warner bros lot past the numerous soundstages and into the backlot facade of new york city brownstones you realize this office is where they greenlight some of that magic as chairman and ceo bruce berman runs the show at village roadshow an independent company that produces films in partnership with warner bros where he was previously head of world wide production and responsible for films such as "driving miss daisy" and "goodfellas" at village roadshow he buys and oversees the production of eight to films a year with budgets from &# million to &# million some are truly magical "happy feet" some are not "the dukes of hazzard" but rather than using his office decor to gloat over the success of his moving pictures "thats tacky" he says "i see it all over town they even put up their bad movies" mr berman prefers being surrounded by stills some might even say the stillest of stills from his collection of photographs capturing the real america from the depression through the present they line the walls of every office conference room and hallway in total in a revolving gallery worthy show complete with exhibition catalog how you might wonder did a moving image guy become so obsessed with the still image well for starters hes a frustrated photographer having grown up in new york and los angeles he hit the road in his younger years and photographed the byways and backwoods of america before deciding he "needed to make a living" and enrolling first in film school and then law school "photography is the road i didnt take " he said "if i had had more courage maybe i would have but this road allows me to collect and commission " at mr berman is one of the worlds top photo collectors according to artnews his holdings trace a line from evanss seminal documentary style photos of the s through the s work of william eggleston and stephen shore who picked up where evans left off documenting the american vernacular in living color on through mr sternfeld william christenberry and other contemporary photographers traveling the same path but he also buys the work of lesser known and emerging artists as well regardless of their status in the art world in many instances hes enabled their projects commissioning work so the photographers can afford to go out and make it "when someone has enough faith in you to buy you as a future its the highest compliment an artist can get " said jim dow from whom mr berman purchased images in advance "funding one if not two trips" to photograph the changing rural landscape of north dakota "being on the road depends on getting that kind of support " said the massachusetts based photographer and teacher "some of the best movies ive been associated with have been with unknowns " mr berman explained "for example the matrix our biggest movie for the writer directors it was their second movie after a low budget lesbian murder mystery "bound" so that was taking some risk on unknowns i guess i subconsciously apply that to investing in photos though i dont think of it as investment " you might expect the man who bought the "matrix" script "though i didnt quite understand it " he admits to have a taste for the cutting edge in photography he collects widely there are photographers in the collection and deeply buying a whole series as opposed to single images but this jeans wearing backpack toting executive confesses to somewhat conservative tastes no digital images no conceptual contortions manipulation or staging despite the art worlds excitement over say andreas gurskys digital feats or gregory crewdsons staged scenes just straight up americana backyards barns gardens storefront churches county fairgrounds rarely sentimental ironic or even blatantly beautiful these images of ordinary places people and things just tell it like it is or like it was you can see for yourself through feb at the j paul getty museum in los angeles which is exhibiting images in "where we live photographs of america from the berman collection " the inaugural show in its new grandly expanded photo galleries the collector has presented photos to the getty over the past eight years "giving his collection a haircut " as he says while bringing the gettys stellar but mostly prewar collection firmly into the present "prior to his gifts we held very few photographs made in color materials " said weston naef the gettys curator of photographs "moreover there were different photographers included who were active between the mid s and the great majority of which were not previously held in our collection " in the exhibition the getty calls its berman photos "an archive of late th century american life " mr berman himself is reluctant to define his collection "i dont know how to put the words on it exactly but it all has a continuity to it " he said "aesthetics always come first i buy what i love but if its seen as an archive of cultural history as both art and archive thats fine with me because i dont think the government or newspapers and magazines are sponsoring that kind of work anymore " one of mr bermans favorite pictures on loan to the getty show is a sternfeld portrait of a deserted green house on a green lawn with a caption explaining its history and location in the infamous love canal neighborhood in upstate new york its so ugly its beautiful mr bermans effort in forming such a collection may ultimately turn out to be more radical than any movie he might put out individually the photos are low on action and drama but as a whole the collection is far from dull it is downright bold even visionary in its determination to capture ordinary and overlooked america ms holliday writes about photography for the journal
