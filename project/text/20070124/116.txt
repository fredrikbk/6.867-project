business day sign up for the e mail here the newest proposals in his state of the union address dealt with energy security but president bush used more than half the speech to beseech members of congress to back his ambitions in iraq and reiterate his conviction that the war there is part of a generational struggle to protect the u s "every one of us wishes this war were over and won " mr bush said "yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept our friends abandoned and our own security at risk " and in arguing that the conflict in iraq lies at the center of efforts to fight terrorism mr bush once again put among the principal themes of his discourse declaring that "the evil that inspired and rejoiced in is still at work in the world and so long as thats the case america is still a nation at war " his words essentially equated counterterror efforts with putting the country on a permanent war time footing since islamist militancy looms as a long term problem the u s

washington post that the goal isnt off todays levels but off projected annual gas use the wall street journal notes that achievement of mr bushs goals "rests on the uncertainty of technological breakthroughs and the administration is promising relatively little money to subsidize what would be a major redirection in the countrys energy markets " and while he wants to "reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars " he still rejects the idea of legislation that would mandate specific higher fuel standards moreover the journal adds mr bushs aims are vulnerable to volatile energy markets that could play havoc with plans to boost the use of more efficient vehicles and alternative fuels like ethanol enthusiasm for more environmentalist energy policy in his administration which long insisted the countrys energy problems could be solved with more domestic wells may also have been undercut by vice president dick cheneys reaction during the speech mr cheney rose to applaud many
