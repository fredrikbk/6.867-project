wealth of nations what drives high growth rates with china and india growing at high rates there has been a dramatic increase in the fraction of the worlds population experiencing the benefits and challenges of rapid growth there are a number of common ingredients in the cases of sustained high growth that have been observed a functioning market system high levels of saving public and private sector investment resource mobility and the capacity to accommodate rapid change at the microeconomic level without leaving people excessively exposed to the risks inherent in creative destruction but it is the resources of the global economy that stand out as driving forces in sustaining high growth these come in three parts demand in a relatively poor economy demand is limited and its composition does not necessarily correspond to sectors of comparative advantage the global economy is huge in comparison and at the right prices and costs demand is for practical purposes unlimited so once the challenge of identifying industries in which the country can invest in acquiring a comparative advantage is met growth in exports will not be constrained by demand and growth in the economy can occur at a rate determined by the savings and investment rates much of that investment in the early stages will go to the export sector which can grow at rates high enough to pull the economy along as we saw in japan korea singapore and now china the growth of exports can set in motion a process of sustained growth which is transmitted to the whole economy and could not be achieved by relying on domestic demand alone these are the dynamic equivalents of the gains from trade for developing countries developing economies are small in relation to global demand and hence they can grow and increase share without having the terms of trade turn against them china being a possible exception because of its size they are constrained primarily by their capacity to invest once the growth process is started they use underutilized or surplus resources particularly labor so that the growth in exports does not come at the expense of declines in other sectors advanced economies cannot grow at anything like these rates and the rapidly growing developing economies will eventually slow down technology a second resource the global economy provides is know how this ranges from engineering and production technology to managerial expertise and knowledge of global markets and it does not have to be redeveloped domestically from scratch and unlike most commodities when knowledge is transferred from a to b both have it one avenue for imported technology to travel is by foreign direct investment but there are cases japan and korea in which there was significant technology absorption from the rest of the world and relatively little fdi here foreign education and explicit programs aimed at learning played important roles investment a third area in which the global economy supports higher than otherwise attainable growth is investment or more precisely through investment beyond the capacity of the domestic economy to save one component is fdi typically not a large fraction of total investment of overall investment would be typical but its magnitude understates its importance because of its role in bringing technology know how and access to external markets beyond fdi it is possible to invest at rates that are higher than domestic savings can provide but this area is complex and controversial financial investments unlike fdi can be reversed easily and if reversals are sudden they can create exchange rate volatility collapses in asset values and failures in the banking system this was observed in the currency crises of the late s and the understanding now is that imperfectly developed or informationally immature capital markets are vulnerable to volatility and that complete openness and sudden shifts to complete convertibility of the currency may not be wise gradualism experimentation and pragmatism are better guiding principles substantial inbound capital in excess of savings may raise the value of the local currency and reduce the competitiveness of the nascent export sectors an elevated level of the domestic currency or volatility will serve as a deterrent to domestic and foreign investment in export sectors some public sector borrowing to finance public sector investment makes sense if the developing countrys fiscal system is sufficiently well structured to ensure the future capacity to repay the debt and if its political system is such that commitments can be kept the record here is not reassuring the high growth cases have not involved much investment financed by foreign savings the current trend is the opposite toward building up reserves modest in some cases and very large in china this means running surpluses on the current account goods and services and deficits on the capital account that is domestic savings exceeds investment as the high growth economies become richer the relative importance of the domestic economy as a driver of growth increases the critical role of exports remains but is at its highest early in the process when the domestic economy is small take japan it lost its growth momentum in the s in part because at its advanced stage domestic consumption is a required engine of growth beyond the catch up phase growth cannot be sustained on a healthy export sector alone it is hard to argue with the diagnosis of sustained high growth in the past half century but people do question the future applicability to developing economies that are "starting late " the argument is that for those countries that are not resource rich the principal resource that they have is abundant labor inexpensive relative to its productive value and that the natural territory for comparative advantage is in labor intensive manufacturing or services for these countries the argument goes it is impossible to compete with china and prospectively india one reason is that the size of china and india and a variety of advantages that go with scale are insurmountable another is that the infrastructure investments make china hypercompetitive and difficult to match the conclusion is that one needs to wait for china and india to grow and that at some point their incomes will rise to the point that they are no longer in labor intensive sectors this argument is unlikely to be right while china and india are formidable competitors exchange rates can adjust to increase the competitiveness of export sectors of new entrants in addition while we sometimes talk about labor intensive industry as if it were one big lump in reality there are hundreds of niches further multinationals are risk averse and unlikely to source in their supply chains in just one or two countries finally china and india together now account for close to one fifth of the u s economy and they are becoming an important source of demand for exports of developing countries so that newcomers have expanding markets in these two rapidly growing economies in short the global economy remains a resource for generating and sustaining high growth in developing countries china and india accounting for of the worlds population are in high growth mode and are pulling much of asia with them there have also been recent increases in export and overall growth in africa though some of that is attributable to an upsurge in commodity prices latin america with the notable exception of chile has been stalled at lower middle income levels but has the human resources and other assets to shift back onto high growth trajectories the prospects for developing countries are in fact probably more favorable now than they have been since world war ii international trade is growing faster than global gdp the benefits of decades of learning with respect to operating global supply chains are accessible information and technology continues to lower transactions costs and to be a powerful integrating force but perhaps even more important the key players in all this the leaders in emerging economies who have the responsibility for building policies that support private sector entrepreneurship and that lead to sustained inclusive growth have a wealth of experience to rely on no one is in
