politics &amp economics libby asserts he was the fall guy defenses focus on politics inside white house aims to cloud prosecutions case washington lawyers for lewis "scooter" libby the vice presidents former chief of staff on trial for allegedly lying to federal investigators moved to muddy the prosecutions case by alleging a white house effort to protect karl rove and make mr libby the fall guy the defense strategy shows that mr libby is willing to part ways with his former colleagues at the white house in opening arguments in federal court yesterday mr libbys attorney alleged that white house officials singled out the former aide to vice president cheney to take the blame for leaking the identity of a central intelligence agency operative in an attempt to take the heat off mr rove president bushs top political adviser as both sides laid out their strategies yesterday in federal court it became clear that special prosecutor patrick fitzgeralds attempt to simplify a case that ended up far afield from its beginnings as a cia leak investigation could be hampered by the defenses strategy to put the case in the context of the sharp elbowed politics of the white house and the iraq war the trial is expected to provide a glimpse into the inner workings and infighting of a white house known for being cohesive and tightly managed in addition the strategizing behind the run up to the iraq war may get a public airing at the same time as a democratic controlled congress is stepping up its scrutiny of the bush administrations war policy a white house spokeswoman declined to comment on the libby case addressing a jury of nine women and three men mr fitzgerald gave a one hour summary of his case which hinges on testimony and evidence he says show mr libby knowingly deceived agents for the federal bureau of investigation and the grand jury investigating the leak of the identity of former cia agent valerie plame in mr fitzgerald told jurors that mr libby was dispatched by mr cheney to counter criticism of the administration from ms plames husband former diplomat joseph wilson mr wilson had made a fact finding trip sponsored by the central intelligence agency in to niger to investigate claims that iraq in a quest for nuclear weapons had tried to buy yellowcake uranium from the country mr wilson subsequently contradicted the administrations claims about iraqs efforts to build a nuclear weapons program in a new york times opinion piece and on television during mr fitzgeralds investigation both president bush and a former white house spokesman said that any administration official found to have leaked the information would be asked to leave mr rove was among the officials who testified before the grand jury that mr fitzgerald convened yesterday mr roves attorney robert luskin declined to comment on opening arguments by mr libbys attorney mr libbys defense team took jurors through a two hour version of events that included the charge that mr libby was the victim of a white house effort to make him the "sacrificial lamb" in order to protect mr rove theodore v wells jr an attorney for mr libby told jurors that as the plame controversy exploded mr libby spoke to mr cheney and expressed concerns that "they want me to be the sacrificial lamb i will not be sacrificed in order for karl rove to be protected " yesterday mr wells said that officials set up mr libby to take the fall in the investigation because while he was "an important staffer " mr rove was "the lifeblood of the republican party " mr fitzgerald displayed to the jury a detailed timeline listing dates when mr libby talked to reporters and to others in the white house about ms plame he suggested that mr libbys misstatements to investigators about when he discussed ms plames identity and with whom werent about "bad memory" but an effort to mislead investigators because he was afraid he would lose his job in court yesterday mr fitzgerald played excerpts of tape recordings of mr libbys testimony before the grand jury in one segment mr libby told investigators he was surprised to learn that ms plame worked for the cia during a conversation believed to have taken place around july with tim russert host of nbcs "meet the press " but mr fitzgerald said yesterday mr libby knew of ms plames status as he had learned it from others in the administration including the vice president and had passed along the information on july to then white house spokesman ari fleischer and on july to judith miller then a new york times reporter mr wells called the governments case "a weak paper thin circumstantial evidence case about he said she said " he told jurors to expect testimony from reporters including mr russert and ms miller but suggested that like mr libby they and other witnesses "have recollection problems " mr wells showed jurors his own timeline emphasizing how mr libby was asked by investigators about conversations with reporters many months after they occurred he quoted from a handwritten note by mr cheney made after a conversation with mr libby about the leak investigation that read in part "not going to protect one staffer &amp sacrifice the guy that was asked to stick his neck in the meat grinder because of the incompetence of others " the person being sacrificed was mr libby and the incompetence was on the part of the cia mr wells told jurors
