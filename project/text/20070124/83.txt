politics &amp economics china verifies antisatellite missile test beijing china broke its public silence about its testing of an antisatellite missile this month but its lack of openness may have damaged its efforts to polish its international image when news of the jan test surfaced one week later it triggered alarm in foreign capitals but chinese officials refused to acknowledge the test publicly until yesterday when liu jianchao a spokesman for chinas ministry of foreign affairs confirmed that it had occurred but offered no additional detail or explanation mr liu speaking at a routine news conference offered assurance that china continues to oppose the "weaponization" of space and he said that china had briefed several foreign countries including the u s and japan about the test after international concern arose he declined to say when those briefings had occurred state department spokesman sean mccormack said monday that chinese officials had acknowledged the test to assistant secretary of state christopher hill during meetings in beijing over the weekend mr mccormack said the u s is hoping for more information about the test in which china destroyed one of its own aging weather satellites in orbit within china there has been no discussion of the test in the chinese press or on the web which is closely monitored by the government china has long tried to soothe international concerns about its rapid economic and military rise by telling the world that it is intent on "peaceful development " but the absence of any official explanation about the antisatellite test has fostered doubts about its intentions and plans and given ammunition to critics in washington who argue china is a growing military threat that the u s must do more to counter including in space mr liu stressed that china "never has and never will participate in any form of arms race in space " but chinas handling of the test could actually help bring about such a race analysts say beijings approach has been "quite counterproductive as far as chinas interests are concerned " said andrew yang an expert on the chinese military who heads the chinese council of advanced policy studies a taiwan think tank "i think they didnt really take into account the international concerns about this " said mr yang who was in beijing yesterday meeting with chinese military experts analysts outside china have speculated that the test was intended to verify chinas antisatellite capability and put the u s on notice that it no longer enjoys unchallenged military domination of space the u s military relies heavily on satellites for surveillance communication and weapons guidance systems the chinese foreign ministry spokesmans comments are unlikely to calm international anxiety mr liu offered no explanation for why china had conducted the test or why it took so long to confirm it when asked about concerns that debris from the destroyed satellite could damage other countries satellites he said the issue was too technical for him to address officials at chinas ministry of national defense continued to decline to comment yesterday mr yang said he believes the missile test was directed partly at taiwan the u s is taiwans biggest military backer and u s satellites are an essential element of taiwans early warning system against ballistic missiles that china has aimed at the island mr liu said the test wasnt directed at any particular country
