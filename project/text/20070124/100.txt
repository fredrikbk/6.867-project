small firms spurn chapter a growing number of financially distressed small businesses are turning to state courts to settle their bankruptcy cases avoiding the arduous insolvency proceedings of federal courts legal experts say since the late s the number of bankruptcy filings has fallen by almost from almost in to in according to pacer the federal governments case filing database but the total number of small business failures has held steady around since according to the small business administration in a new study columbia university professor edward morrison says that may be why chapter cases are becoming a rarity dropping by from to in the study mr morrison notes that sba data show that less than of failing small businesses use federal law to reorganize or liquidate mr morrisons study found that using state insolvency systems is faster and less expensive in most cases many state courts dont require court filings "actions available under federal law are also available under state law " mr morrison said in an interview "its a much less public event than a federal bankruptcy filing and thought to be very quick and relatively cheap " some lawyers say state insolvency courts have become more attractive since the federal bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act took effect in many of the changes in the new law were designed to protect unsecured creditors but they also slowed the federal bankruptcy process and raised costs "it is a little more complicated and there are more parochial traps " said attorney michael j pankow of brownstein hyatt farber schrecks bankruptcy and restructuring group "that inflexibility has caused advisers to look to other avenues " mr morrison said the effect of the new federal bankruptcy law was "ironic " given that it was intended to increase protection for unsecured creditors but as more small firms have turned to state courts in reaction unsecured creditors in those cases have received "much less protection " he said not all state systems provide relaxed regulations some have advanced regulations that closely mimic the federal bankruptcy code other insolvency laws remain untouched from the th century and are out of date with current standards states such as florida michigan and new york all regulate the insolvency process some require property assessments court documentation and barriers against insider trading by comparison illinois laws dont require court records to be filed and recipients of the assets of a company being liquidated dont have the power to contest pre insolvency distributions made to others "these are factors that make state laws attractive " mr morrison said "its a highly unregulated environment and because of this state procedures can be very private " mr pankow agreed "people dont like reading unpleasant things about themselves in the paper " he said "for some small businesses its more about that privacy preference than anything else " colorado laws are also fairly undeveloped denver attorney edward b cordes of cordes &amp co works predominantly in state court receivership a form of reorganization he often operates a debtors business as a third party "we get to act like their mom and tell what to do and what not to do " mr cordes said "its a lot less expensive and a lot simpler than bankruptcy " he said mr cordes most recently served as project manager for pioneer pork llc a farm of pigs near springfield miles southeast of denver the ranch had an &# million loan and has incurred estimated legal costs under &# according to mr cordes "if that had been in bankruptcy those costs would have been five to times that much " he said still some scholars argue that bankruptcy filings are down because of poor record keeping by the government not the behavior of small businesses in a study published in the california law review robert m lawless of the university of illinois and elizabeth warren of harvard university found that filing software used by most businesses had a default setting that automatically labeled documents as "consumer cases" rather than "business cases " "the distinction between consumer and business itself was crude and misleading " mr lawless and ms warren wrote in the study "ask the average interpreter especially one in serious financial trouble whether he or she has business or consumer debt and the answer will probably be both for many entrepreneurs their personal affairs are so intertwined with their business that it is difficult to distinguish between consumer and business debt " however mr morrison argues that disorganization cant explain why the number of chapter filings is dropping faster than any other kind of filing "if state procedures are faster and cheaper who in their right mind files for federal bankruptcy " he asked there are some limitations many states provide significantly less protection for unsecured creditors than the bankruptcy code does the decision to use the state system is usually up to the senior lender who often opts for the system that provides the most control over insider self dealing accordingly if the lender permits a state insolvency it means it has a good relationship with the business cases involving more than &# million in assets are almost always kept out of the state system which is ill equipped to handle multiple creditor dealings "the airlines like delta would love to keep their chapter in a lower profile " mr pankow said "but taking that case in a state court would be absolutely impossible " delta air lines inc filed for bankruptcy court protection in september after the company took a big hit from high jet fuel prices and increased competition from cheaper airlines other troubled businesses that often opt out of state court are those hit by sudden financial stress often caused by natural disasters or burglaries the instant pressure from creditors often leaves the business with no time to organize a state case "they may just find they are overwhelmed by creditors who will devour the assets " mr morrison said "they can raise the white flag and put an end to the rush of creditors and allow the business to wind down its affairs in an orderly fashion " most bankruptcy experts agree that some uniformity among state laws could improve the system in the future "i think it would be nice the only thing that makes receivership in colorado an alternative to bankruptcy is its lack of expensive statutes " mr cordes said "its a nonformal way to effectively reorganize "
